It won't satisfy her old fans and is a major disappointment to fans (like me) of her \\"Ray of Light\\" effort. The songs with her new French producer are over-processed, uninvolving and passionless (how many of those are real words?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music - A HUGE letdown","review":"I was really looking forward to a new M cd.. Especially since it was supposed to be a return to her \\"dance\\" roots, etc. Unfortunately the album really lacks after about the 2nd to 3rd track. And although you can really hear W.Orbit's contribution (a good thing), M's vocals are waaay to high in the mix. I really liked Ray of Light (4.75 of 5) [and erotica] and was hoping that this cd would musically be in that direction again. It totally fails. I kept hearing that this would be a return to her dance roots, etc. I simply didn't hear it.In summary: Save your money; sadly, the CD is a total letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD! I'd give it a 1/2 Star!","review":"Boy what a bland CD! Overly produced and boring lyrics and no catchy hooks or any really stand out tracks. It look likes she rushed this one out to rake in some cash for the up coming X-mas season. I loved Ray of Light so this is a really disappointment. Plus, it was only 40 something minutes (which is a rip off but maybe it's a good thing in this case). Even her Erotica and Bedtime Stories albums are much better than this. For those that want Madonna to go back to bubble pop, please. Well done house music is fun and great to dance to, not this one though. actually this is not even house music. it's electronic funk whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This CD leaves alot to be desired. Even the choice of photography on the sleeve misses the boat. Madonna looks beautiful but the choices are strange. I bought the CD hoping to use it in my dance class. The first cut, \\"Music\\" is fun and the second has a good beat. There is one beautiful ballad. The rest of the ballads are repetitive and unmoving. Overall, it is nothing special. No significant lyrics. No catchy tunes. No profound message. No really great dance tunes. A let down after \\"Ray of Light\\" which was really well done. I expected alot more from Madonna. It was like a quickie in the interim while she does her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit album","review":"Madonna has produced another hit album and it shows that the queen of pop is going to retain her throne for a long time to come. Featuring the number one single Music and the fantastic current single Tell Me which is my personal favourite, Madonna shows that she has managed to progress with the times without losing her own personal touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can someone even think of not getting this cd?!","review":"I must say that this is a cd that you have to get used to after listenning to it a few times! But once you get used to it you can listen to it about a-1000000 times! This is one of the best cd's i've ever got in my life! But offcourse nothing surpasses her album \\"Ray of light\\"! That was the no. 1 cd in the world! But still this cd is in my top-5! In fact it was released earlier because people couldn't wait to get it here in Belgium! So it got released 3 days before it was supposed to! I love the way Madonna keeps changing her image in every other cd she releases! No other artist does that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Acid Rock Sucks","review":"I'm a fan of Madonna's and I thought \\"Ray of Light\\" was great, even though it was a sound I wasn't used to hearing much from her. So here comes the single \\"Music,\\" which was funky and futuristic. After listening to the CD I was so ticked off for wasting my money on it. \\"Music\\" isn't exciting at all. Too many bleeps, very little emotion, too many bizarre and lousy lyrics. The only good tracks are \\"Music\\" and \\"Runaway Lover\\". I held on to this CD for as long as I could because it looked good with my Madonna collection. But eventually it started taking up space and I sold it just to make room for my newer CDs. Get \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Erotica,\\" \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" \\"Like A Prayer,\\" or her self-titled album. Get any of her earlier music instead of this. You're not missing anything here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive offering","review":"Ray Of Light, this is not. I am disappointed with this there is not one song here that I like. Please, don't waste your money. Madonna, you could have done better. I don't want to be taken back to the eighties and reminded of the early nineties and I escepially don't like Niki Harris and Donna Delory those two are tasteless and talentless. Move forward, move ahead, move in the direction of the year 2000. At least with Ray Of Light you have genuine lyrical class and it's worth the time to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Ray of Light is much better","review":"I was surprised to find this album particularly shallow in lyrics. The electronica/techno sounds were harsh and irritating as well - much different than the grace and harmony of the Ray of Light album. For anyone who does not own Ray of Light, I highly recommend it. For anyone thinking about purchasing Music, listen to it first - don't purchase it just because it's Madonna. Madonna's Ray of Light is rich in lyrical depth/meaning and filled with a beautiful tapestry of sound. Music, to contrast once again, just doesn't leave a good feeling with its empty lyrics and annoying 'harmony'."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Madonna thinking?","review":"Okay, I've totally loved everything Madonna has done up todate. Ray of Light was an awesome CD. Erotica was great. And we'llbe listening to her 80's songs for many years to come. But I'm verydisappointed with Music. The only tracks that I enjoyed are Music,Impressive Instant and Runaway Lover, but only because they have agood beat. The rest of the tracks are really lacking in anysubstance. Nothing impressive with either vocals or the music. I'mreally disappointed when Madonna goes from a great album like Ray ofLight and then brings out this CD. CD's like this are the reasonNapster is out there...so I can listen to all the songs and see thatthere are only 3 good tracks out of 10, I wouldn't have wasted the[money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2000","review":"In a follow up to her breathtaking RAY OF LIGHT, Madonna digs deeper into electronica and develops a cutting edge, French discotheque sound. The title track, \\"Music\\" was a HUGE hit in the fall of '00 and there is no question why. Classic Madonna drops her mystic preachiness and gets back down to boogie woogie. William Orbit was back for a few tracks, though you could tell his creativity was spent. \\"Amazing\\" sounds nothing more than a knock-off of \\"Beautiful Stranger,\\" while \\"Runaway Lover\\" still shows a glimmer of his techno skills. My favorite track has to be the vocoder heavy, \\"Nobody's Perfect.\\" The strings arrangement really adds a tremendous amount of feeling, perhaps an expansion on \\"Frozen.\\" Other great songs include \\"Impressive Insant\\" (singy singy singy on a wingy wingy wingy, hokey indeed but still fun), \\"Paradise Is Not For Me,\\" and \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl.\\" This is must-own for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna MUSIC Mania!","review":"Madonna captures an 'impressive instant' with the release of this new compilation of the latest futuristic sounding electronic club music. She collaborates with French DJ Mirwais Ahmadzai in producing most of the album's tracks. William Orbit plays a minor role this time round but his influence still lingers as there are 3 tracks in the cd to his credit in producing. My personal favorite would be \\"I Deserve It\\" which features Madonna's unadorned natural singing voice, kind of like unplugged, amidst electronic squiggles. It also sounds a bit like a country song to me.This cd is definitelymore club friendly than her previous \\"Ray of Light\\", which was more introspective and mystical in nature. Will this album define the music of the future? Let us see."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE HAS NO VOICE - CELINE DION IS BETTER","review":"Sorry, but Celine Dion is a much better singer, the last song in which she was trying to sing in french may be she have heard Celine singing in her native french and wanted to copy her. Celine sings the good french though, not no syllable by syllable sing along. and I recommend her album anyday than tacky madonna. Lets start by criticising the songs. The first one is what you say....Je ne se quoi. Oh baby you should have heard Celine intonation in french to compare. Ok then , the next, Madonna must know she cant compare with the real diva Celine. I think she tries to copy her in the emotives , but it dont come through, sorry madonna. I hate to say it but the seemingly crayon color picture on cover. Its too brite and shiny. Now back to the music, put it this way, shes no Celine and cant ever ever ever profess to be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"this is just an overhyped cd. mirwais is an overrated producer (who is not even big in france, as many may believe) and all this sounds just like french vari��t��. very bad and very cheesy vocoder fx. there should be a law against the use of this machine. and the lyrics are so corny: \\"hey mr dj, put a record on, i wanna dance with my baby\\", hello."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing like Ray of Light","review":"How can Madoona be trendsetting and innovative when all she's doing is rehashing bad techno ideas from 1992?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Overrated Album That I Call \\"Noise\\"","review":"Madonna has changed, unfortuantely, for worse. She might be good at re-inventing herself and her music, yet not for her latest release \\"Music\\". If even one song will come close to the kind of music from previous release \\"Ray of Light\\", I would have given an extra couple of stars. The one and only star goes to \\"What It Feels Like Being a Girl\\" and the rest (of the album) is just filler and bunch of noise.It's OK to play around with electronic music yet Madonna's tinny , hollow, and dull voice is just way too disappointing and annoying. Title track \\"Music\\" is such a pity that it fades in impact after a few listenings. The rest is filler. The entire CD is a concoction of voice manipulations and background cacophony a.k.a *noise*. What has happened to the \\"True Blue\\" Madonna?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff has been done already.","review":"I don't think she's the innovator that everyone is making her out to be. Look at this stuff on the album, it's all retro stuff that's been done a million times before. I bet she even hyped up the electronica thing, cause people said there was a hint of it in Ray of light album. So she went with it. So what's new about synthesizer and voice over samples...duh. And what's new about her Patsy Cline look-a-like cowgirl outfit. She's funny in it actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth downloading","review":"If you ever found yourself bobbing your head in time to the sounds that the little white ball made in the classic video game \\"Pong,\\" then you'll love Madonna's new album \\"Music.\\" I swear, this CD has more bleeps and bloops than a televisied network showing of a Joe Pesci movie. A friend of mine was playing this CD and I had to stop and ask her what all the noise was; I thought maybe the fire alarm had gone off again in our dorm.This CD is nothing like what its title claims it to be. Madonna's last, \\"Ray Of Light,\\" was different and innovative; her latest seems to be inspired by French rave music run through a casio keyboard anyone can buy at Toys R Us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! One of the best Madonna albums out there.","review":"This is one of Madonna's greater albums ever made. It's almost a continuation from the \\"Ray of Light\\" album that was the previous album. I would even consider it a supplement to it. It's fun, upbeat and will get you through any long road trip drive. It's not as spiritual or has ambient as \\"Ray of Light\\" was, but it's more of a celebration of that album. This is definitely a must have even Howard Stern who has knocked Madonna raved about how good this album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"Madonna should try to figure out what she wants to be and stick with it. This recording is rather lacking in focus. This thing she has with trying to be all music to all people is wearing a little tired. Her recordings use to set the standard, now they just follow the pack. It's not awful, its just not what one expects from the moving and shaker of years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing diverse piece of work","review":"If you are looking for a Madonna album where you can listen to the entire album and not feel disappointed then Music is the album you need to purchase. Every song has it's own unique sound. Starting with the title track, that takes you back to 80s with a fresh electronic sound, to the closing track, a different guitar strung ballad, you will be surprised when the album ends considering this album only contains 10 tracks and most are not that long except for the exceptional track Paradise (Not For Me). The bulk of this album is co-produced with Mirwais, while three of the tracks got treatment from William Orbit-(the main co-producer from her 1998 album Ray of Light).The standout track for me on this record is definitely Impressive Instant, an intense club track that can put you in a trance. This album will be hard to follow up but I'm sure she'll follow it up brilliantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big \\"Yawn\\" from the Queen of Interesting","review":"I always eagerly await new releases from Ms. Madonna. She's clever, campy, fun & entertaining...until now. What a \\"Yawn\\" this C.D. was!!Her monotone delivery of toned down, ultra boring material sounded like anyone else's drivel on the radio. It seemed like she couldn't decide whether to [copy] J.Lo. or Cher, so she combined both of their styles to deliever a decidedly un-new, un-creative un-Madonna albumn.I know that she reinvents from time to time, but this Madonna incarnation needed more time in the laboratory before being unleashed on the general public. Dr. Frankenstein himself couldn't have breathed life into this corpse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"I wasn't a big fan of this album when it came out. I remember renting(library had huge cd collections) and thinking it wasn't really that great. Music was kind of ugh? I was like it's ok but way too overplayed. Don't tell me was the only song i really liked,but didn't get to hear enough of on the radio. Other then that I thought runway lover was decent. i thought what it feels like for a girl was pretty lame and boring. She doesnt have great vocals so for me it wasn't that great. I would skip this cd. It's def. not her best. She really should have gone in more of a kylie minogue direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna Rocks!","review":"As usual Madonna has yet another great cd to add to her collection.This cd has an amazing amount of creativity on it with some great hooks and very personal songs. Don't Tell Me is my absoulute favorite song on the entire album.It's wonderfully catchy with great lyrics and it's not like anything Madonna has ever done before.On What It Feels Like For A Girl, Madonna's voice sounds absoulutely beautiful,not to mention it's a wonderful song. If you're looking for upbeat danceable songs,try listening to tracks like Runaway Lover,Amazing,and of course,Music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Face it , the tunes aren't there","review":"Madonna wannabees give anything she does five stars including the dismal 'Bedtime Stories' & the Dick Tracy songs and they've mostly done it again here. This is seamlessly produced by techno-meisters Mirwais Ahmadzai & William Orbit but with about two exceptions, you find yourself fast forwarding, which is sad after such a triumph as 'Ray of Light'. On that album and her previous ones, the tunes penned by Pat Leonard were the best, but long-time collaborator Leonard is absent on this album, and no amount of high-tech wizardry can disguise the lack of a good tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous mixture of disco and bllads","review":"i think this is a great mixture of disco and electronic stuff (Impressive instant, runaway lover) and slow ballad songs (what it feels like for a girl, paradise. I love this album and im sure im going to be listening to it for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet tunes","review":"I've listened to the thing about 100 times, and I have to say that there are some really good songs. Numbers 1,4,8 are currently my favorites.Though, it's not as heaving hitting at Ray Of Light -- it's a damn good album. The title song had be jumping for a while, and now others are taking over.Better than 99.9% of the albums released. Give her a break. I know it's convenient to hate her -- there's power in bashing the powerful -- but the bottom line is that alot of people think she rocks. I'm one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna is a trendy gal","review":"I just am not one of the fans that can follow Madonna down the trendy dance lane. She may have a good instinct for what trend to follow, but she is simply a less than seductive singer, and it is a pity that she hasn't the pipes to move some of us. All the electronica can not make the difference for me. Ray of light was a rather spiritual type of fantasy play and this one moves further into the \\"house\\" mentality. I ronically there are some vocal distortions and effects that seemed to be lifted from Cher's most recent ventures. I must say Cher may be less innovative, but is a more inviting personna.Music? It's up to the listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music?","review":"Nope. Wretched, contrived scat. If music had a soul, this would be on the first freight train to Hell. After listening to this, I had to get a colon flush for my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"This is just horrible..first I have to say I feel really jipped by this album only having 10 songs...not to mention that almost all the songs are bad. Madonna doesn't even sing on this CD, a computer does.The only good songs are the singles. And you've heard those...\\"Don't Tell Me\\" being the best one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna/Music - Disappointing","review":"Madonna's latest CD, Music, is not what I was hoping for. There are only two songs that I really, really like...Music and What It Feels Like For A Girl. I like Music because it's a clubby dance song. I like What It Feels... because the music and tone are reminiscent of Rain...one of my favorite Madonna songs. Both songs reflect Madonna's Material Girl style.The rest of the songs are a little too \\"Spanish-guitary\\" and folksy for me...as if she's being experimental, which is a good thing. Unfortunately, I haven't listened to Madonna's previous albums (Ray Of Light & ) so I don't know if these songs are actually indicative of her current style. But as I mentioned, I prefer her clubby dance hits, which may no longer be her music focus.So for me, this is a CD with 2 great songs and 8 not so good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna returns to her white-trash roots","review":"After her brief stint in spirituality, Madonna returns with a vengeance to her familiar white trash roots, a genre in which she is more familair. The usual melodic-less throw ups abound. She returns what she is most famous for; empty ,meaningless, cringing, mindless lyrics.I think there was one song that was good on here, and that's saying alot. Stay away from this one folks. And Madge, lose the bucket hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, it's a comedy record! Well, then, throw on another star!","review":"In which Madonna -- between trans-Atlantic hair color appointments -- phones in some half-hearted vocals and sub-first draft lyrics and then instructs her record company to hire some producers-du-jour to make it all sound like Tupac and Roger's \\"California Love.\\" Silliest tricks: She slathers on lots of vocoder effects because Cher won that Grammy and raps in French because dating that English movie guy and hanging out with Rupert make her more European. High-points: The hysterically funny string of lyrical cliches in \\"I Deserve It\\" makes you think of Survivor (the band, not the TV show) and the annoying digital tomfoolery on \\"Don't Tell Me\\" makes you take out the cd to see if it's scratched. And then there's the sound of the dentist's drill on \\"Gone\\" that both pays homage to \\"Marathon Man\\" and wakes you up to let you know the album's over. Best idea: She borrows Patsy Cline's wardrobe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love \\"Mo\\".....","review":"Any album releases by Madonna is always a must have in anyones collection. Madonna is like a chameleon always changing and a step ahead in her approach towards her music. Madonna shocked everyone with her fabu take on electronica in \\"Ray Of Light\\". As for her latest release \\"Music\\" Madonna , I still love her dearly but the vibe on \\"Music\\" is WAAAY to mellow here. There is some good songs on the album including \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl..\\" and \\"Dont Tell Me\\". But thumbs down on the tracks \\"Nobodys Perfect\\"....aacckkk!! Madonna sounds like she is being strangled...ick!!!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than ray of light","review":"Even though Music is a little reminiscent of Ray of Light (of which I'm not the biggest fan), I'm very pleased with Music. The Mirwais-produced songs such as the title track and Impressive Instant are clearly the highlights, with bouncy dancefloor-ready beats. The French producer filters Madonna's voice through everything but a Cuisinart. The William Orbit-produced tracks sound like Ray of Light leftovers. Though not on par with Like a Prayer or Erotica, Music is a fine effort from a living legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear....","review":"Dissapointing. None of the songs on here are 'classic' material, and wont be remembered like her songs such as Vogue and Like a prayer. I know music in general is bad at the moment, but i was hoping Madonna would try and save it for us, nope! Still theres no harm in experimenting. Maybe she'll get up to scratch with her next album. Dont get me wrong this is not a really bad album, but by Madonnas standard it is bland, some of the songs are quite funky and by todays music standards, its great. But in 20 years time, noeone will care about these songs, but people will still be loving Like a prayer and Vogue. Maybe im the only 14 year old who realises how mediocre music is at the moment, but im not ashamed to be in the minority...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun at all","review":"The single \\"Music\\" is great -- the kind of song Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder would have done together, if they were still together. Other than one other terrific track -- \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" -- the rest of the album is a sonically adventurous but monotonous experience. And worse, the lyrics are generally pretentious and/or embarassing. And she should not recite poetry -- ever. Other than the aforementioned songs, there's nothing here that matches the exhilarating fun of her recent great singles \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" (which she rehashes to lesser advantage here.) She may not have a great or even decent voice, but she usually has great producers with great pop instincts that make the records sound great. They fail her here. She has the best publicists on the planet, but I will be surprised if this catches on beyond the initial flurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Ray of Light? You listening to same CD as me?","review":"In reading through some of these reviews, it is calling Music the best thing since sliced bread. I can't disagree with this more. Madonna has already written the best CD of her career - and that was the last one, Ray of Light. Usually, the followup to a mega album such as that is either horrible, or is just \\"eh\\". This one is in the horrible stage. I tried to like it, I really did. I can't. The only tune on here that is really listenable is the title track. I hated Madonna's early bubble gum music, and generally liked her stuff from the Greatest Hits era till now, but this? Blech. Borderline is better than anything on this new album, and I really dislike her tunes like Borderline.Some folks will blindly like this thing because \\"Oh god, it's new songs\\", but listen with your own mind. This is so far inferior to Ray of Light, it's obscene how much better ROL is."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word... ewwwwwwwwwww","review":"Normally I try to show positive points over artists when I review, but the only positive point is the title song, \\"Music\\". But even that gets boring after a while. This album just plain sucks. I can't believe she can go so far as to use French beats and so many techno bleeps that you can't hear her voice. Please. It's clear that this album needs to be buriedSIX FEET UNDER!! Madonna, if you read this, I'm sorry I have to diss your album so much. I love your last CD, but this is too much! Maybe you misunderstood our plea, but for heaven's sake, we don't need a material girl; we need new material!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmusical","review":"The songs that are heard on the radio are great, but the rest are really in poor taste. They are short and not well written. It was like she went through a rhyming dictionary just to make her songs rhyme. Buy the singles, but don't waste your money on this one, it definitely doesn't come close to her past albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet.","review":"It's nice to see someone who knows they could put out records based on successful formulas of the past, but instead chooses to push themselves to attempt new things. It's also nice to see her use herself as a conduit between niche musical genres/producers and the mainstream music world. This is by far her most interesting work yet. Someone mentioned there's a lot of techno on here... I'm hearing only three tracks of dance. There's some rock (Amazing), trip-hop (Nobody's Perfect and Paradise), and some mid- to slow-tempo pop fare (What it feels like, etc.). It's just a great, mature, interesting album. I look forward to her future releases now much more than I did before, and that's saying something for someone who doesn't consider himself a big Madonna fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with Sean from Boston","review":"I bought Madonna's latest today and listened to it through headphones at work. All the beeping and chirping and cheesy voice effects gave me a headache. Maybe I just need to let it sink in after a few more listens. But I couldn't even pick out a logical follow-up single to \\"Music\\". Nothing grabbed me as being the next big hit off this album.I still giver her credit though for the longevity of her career. But at this point in time, the last thing she should be doing is sounding like a tired Cher song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Madonna?","review":"Madonna normal has great business acumen, why was she so desperate that she allowed release of this album? The heavy instrumentals which often sound more like special effects than music dominate every track. Her voice is unusually flat and mono-tone. Lacking her normal range and richness. In previous albums the instruments and her voice complemented each other to reinforce the lyric's imagery, her they are often in dissonance seemingly conveying different messages. Be sure you listen to the track samples before buying this one less you be as disapointed as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!","review":"Music was the only great song on this CD! The rest were just too boring and did not have the \\"groove\\" that the title song did. I loved the song Music after hearing the previews and couldn't wait to buy the CD. But it was a huge disappointment after all the hype and I expected the rest of the CD to live up to Music's beat. Buy the single, forget the CD album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flat,too predictable,too boring.","review":"This is a disappointing album.I feel like I am back in the early eighties and Madonna is just starting off her career.The music is too flat and the lyrics are so predictable that you can sing the next words without having to listen to it a few times first.Madonnas voice sounds like that of a teenager with no power and no strength to her vocals.There is only one half way decent song on here,the rest sound similar and it's hard to pick out one from the next. This is nowhere near as good as Ray Of Light.Is the material girl running out of ideas for new material perhaps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"As usual, Madonna does it again by creating another great album. The songs on this album reflect every music genre from country to dance, contemporary to electronica.

This CD falls far short. The songs sound alike and lack depth. I found I tired fast of the title track, Music, and actually ended up with the CD ditched somewhere in my car, quickly forgotten. I wish I had not spent my money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"She gets 2 for Bravery...","review":"Wow, I am scared. Madonna's \\"Music\\" simply shows her arrogance even more then it has been seen before. She thinks that she can pull of French disco beats. Well, I'm really sorry Madonna, but you can't! This CD is so weird, it's scary. Madonna is a complete psycho, who should realize that she is too out of it to keep up with today's music world. Next we'll be seeing her getting her groove on with Nelly or something. Everyone always likes to talk about Madonna \\"reinventing herself in such a unique way\\", but when you think about it, all she does is go along with a certain bizarre trend that has caught on at the moment, all the while thinking she is the coolest thing since sliced bread. Get over yourself Madonna, because you bite. I give you two stars for throwing yourself to the dogs with this new, hideous representation of what we are to call music. MADONNA IS DISGUSTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"another piece of electronic noise","review":"This cd is the latest example of an artist that believes the studio is greater than a simple intelligent vocal.This is a mass market venture..again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a girl is degrading.","review":"This is another strong album by Madonna. It is electro-pop, with a lot of good songs. Of course, everyone knows the hits \\"Music\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"What It Feels Like For a Girl\\". But there are other fine songs, like \\"Runaway Lover\\" and \\"Nobody's Perfect\\". Madonna fans are sure to enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna the Trendsetter","review":"Although utterly different from such past albums as Erotica, and Ray of Light, there is one similiarity. All three albums exhibits a new and improved Madonna setting a new Trend. In the Early 90's Madonna shocked us with her wild sex appeal on the album Erotica. In the Late 90's she gave us a new apperciation for a music genre, electronica, that wasnt mainstream yet in Ray of Light. Finally, with Music, Madonna proved that, whatever she was going for it was different and she could work it and sell it, and make her fans smile with a ghetto cowboy chic thing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album","review":"This is a very Nice album! Not too many big hits, but the album is very consistent and there are no annoying songs. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not excellent","review":"With Music, Madonna continues on the electronic path she treaded on Ray of Light. However, Music is a lot different than the smooth landscapes that ROL offered. But Music is edgier and I must say, a lot more fun than ROL. As with most Madonna albums there are a couple of stellar tracks (Impressive Instant, What It Feels Like For A Girl and Paradise (Not For Me)) and a couple of mediocore fillers (Gone and Nobody's Perfect). The remainder of the tracks are pretty good but some are devoid of new ideas (Runaway Lover is similar to Skin and Amazing is a rehashed Beautiful Stranger). Surely Madonna can do better... Another minus point was the use of the vocoder which after a couple of listens wears thin very rapidly. However, when Madonna (and her collaborators) do get it right it is pure pop heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna has dissapointed","review":"I always seemed to like Madonna... until this album. No, I hadn't bought any of her albums, but I liked what was played on the radio for its upbeat sound and realitive creativity.However, after buying this album, I see that Madonna, sadly, has little creativity indeed. The lyrics, bland and corny, provoke no interesting thoughts, and the beat nothing but a little light techno. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"very techno","review":"I love the first song and several of the others songs are not bad. Some songs are bad. Bad lyriks, irritating techno sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the Chicago Weekly News","review":"I recently reviewed this for my university paper, and opted not to place it here because the only relevant thing I had to say about it is that I would rather drink a pint of elephant vomit mixed with courvoisier than give this record a second listen. I respect Madonna, but this is one terrible record. But as always, it takes her low points to come to another high point, so we can always look forward to her next record, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightrope walking","review":"This is a step sideways--not forward--for Madonna, given the tremendous success of 'Ray of Light.' Once again, she's taking a tried and true path and only marginally messing with the formula that made her previous release so popular, by taking leaves from Cher and Daft Punk, and signing William Orbit once again as the producer.'Music' certainly sounds like leftover sessions from 'Ray of Light', but it needn't take any truck from hardcore fans (if there are any left), as it's got less filler than that album. \\"Impressive Instant\\", \\"What it Feels Like for a Girl\\", the title track, \\"Paradise\\", and \\"Gone\\" are all strong choices for singles, and the copy I picked up came with a bonus VCD of remixes and the 'What it Feels...' video.Even without this extra freebie, it's still worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Just what the world of \\"Music\\" should have NEVER had to deal with all those years--a brash, insincere woman who can't keep her clothes on at all and who exploits herself just to get to #1.

Like Kylie Minogue, her last album is roughly as good as her last producer. 'Ray of Light' is Madonna's only great album. Here she hires a badly-chosen producer (Mirwais) and tries to create a new inyourface electronica style for her pop songs. What? Daft Punk were using the musical ideas here many years before Madonna, only much better. The tracks here sound rather pretentious and boring with no groove or soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MADONNA??? VERY DISAPPOINTING ALBUM","review":"Where are gone the days when Madonna used to make great pop classics such as 'Material Girl','Vogue' or 'Deeper & Deeper'.... Definitly one of her worst attempts at reinventing herself,Madonna has made a tuneless boring album with 10 (11 if you count American Pie) middle-of-the-road tracks that really aren't anywhere as good as her previous stuff....Apart from 'Music' which is really not bad, the album doesn't offer much, 'Nobody's Perfect' and 'What it feels like...' are monotone electonica-orientated songs, 'Impressive instant' and 'Runaway lover' sound like 'Ray of light'rejects , and the rest is just really bad.....Madonna has gone too far, maybe it is time for her to just go back to basics, to her tuneful pop songs days.... Or she should start considering making Bee Gees or Abba covers....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort by a formerly energetic performer","review":"Madonna's earliest records were marked by tremendous production values, and having Nile Rodgers produce was a brilliant idea on somebodies part. However, this record is very weak. It is overly repetitive, and she doesn't have the energy she used to have. I think she is tired. Madonna as a cowboy figure is a bizarre twist, and it doesn't fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bilge from Ms. M.","review":"Eccch. More mindless drum machines. More thoughtless lyrics. More bad singing. Get in line, America!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music? Right","review":"The first thing is yeah, what's up with the cowboy get up? Does she think she is American country/cowgirl? Wrong direction Madonna! Ray of Light was great, Music is a disappointment. Relying way too much on the mixers to do the work. She also really rushed this album out (wonder why?). It maybe a commercial success but as we all know Britney Spears is also a commercial success. I have to admit that i like some of the dance mixes of the single Music (at the club that you can dance to) but the vocal is just annoying and pointless and very cliche \\"music bring together people...\\" whatever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This album represents Madonna at one of her creative low points. Opening with the mundane and childish Music and closing with the mature and beautiful Gone. Much like Bedtime Stories this album is a mixed bag and has several sub par tracks jumbled in with the good. Contrived and pretencious lyrics abound on many of the tracks. Also the synthesizer vocal effect is used in embarrasing excess making the album sound terribly dated. The lyrics are not printed in the cd booklet for a very good reason. This reason being that the song writing lacks any imagination or creativity so there is no reason to want to read them. The all time low points in Madonna's career are the cornball Nobody's perfect, Runaway Lover, Paradise is not for me and Impressive Instant. Be sure to buy a programable CD player to spare your ears from such garabage. The rest of the songs are pleasant enough and worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Madonna's Worst Album Yet!","review":"Remember Cher's \\"Do You Believe?\\" song, where her voice was all f*&ked up by some electro-synth stuff? Well, apparently, Madonna didn't think it was so bad, because she decided to release an entire album of it. Sure, some of the songs are pretty catchy. I mean, Madonna knows what she's doing, generally. I guess it's the electronic age, and I'd better get with the fricken' program. It's probably great. I'm sure I don't know what I'm talking about (read: I'm listening to it, but not for long) (two slices of toast)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hm.......sorry, Music cannot hold a candle to Ray of Light","review":"I know that most people appear to love this album, and apparently, it has gotten great reviews. While I have to admit that she is somewhat of an innovator, and while these are new tunes, I have to agree with some of the critics that they are also kind of lame tunes that are not all too catchy.

Unfortunately, \\"Music\\" is nowhere near as good. The melodies are very average, the lyrics tired, and the subject matter shallow.

When I first heard the song Music, I was really eager to get her new cd. I bought it and when I got it home and listened to it, I was soooooooo disappointed. I am not trying to trash Madonna at all because I love her, but this cd was not her best. Acutally, it was worse than Ray Of Light and I didn't really care for that one either. I think Madonna was her best when THe Immaculate Collection and Erotica came out. She looked fabulous then. She looks good still now, but man, she needs some better material. I did like Music, and Impressive Instant. The rest is really just not that good. Spend your money on a worthy Madonna cd like Erotica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ray of Light it is not!","review":"Well, This definitely is not Madonna best work. I really expected a notch above Ray of Light (one of the best albums of all time, by anyone). This album definitely was not that. I felt it to be repetitive trip-hop loops amongt souless songs. It feels like she just threw a dance-techno album together without much consideration for track listings or music thought. I expected Ray of Light and got the Gambler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna does it again. Pure magic!","review":"Whoa, what an album. It's great to see Madonna turing out one hit after another. The high energy and unique blending of sounds surpass even the great work of \\"Ray Of Light\\" Outstanding tracks are \\"Music\\" of course, the very light and energetic \\"Impressive Instant\\", and the viviacious \\"Amazing\\" which really builds on the tunes of its predecessor \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" which in itself was a great song. Madonna IS the queen. LONG LIVE THE QUEEN! You're the greatest Madonna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna strikes again!","review":"Not surprisingly,Madonna has delivered yet another mind-blowing album that will dazzle the listener.The title track is probably the funkiest dance song she has ever done.The frantic \\"Impressive Instant\\" and the catchy \\"Runaway Lover\\" keep the party going.The slower cuts are also impressive,especially the heartfelt \\"I Deserve It\\",which deserves to be a future single.Another highlight is \\"Don't Tell Me\\",which features great vocals.The only disapointment here is the rather silly \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" and the closer \\"Gone\\" isn't very distinctive.Still,the album overrall is a winner,not quite as interesting as 'Ray of Light',but still a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid album","review":"My first Madonna purchase was 1998's Ray of Light and I was not disappointed. Her follow-up effort to that critically acclaimed album is \\"Music\\". It's a very nice album that follows along in the tradition of Ray Of Light. It's a good album, but it's filled with many ballads and slow-sounding type songs. If you like that sort of thing then I suggest you listen to it. My favorite tracks on the album are the title track, Impressive Instant, Runaway Lover, Don't Tell Me, Paradise, What It Feels Like For A Girl, Amazing, I Deserve It, and my absolute fave on the album Nobody's Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"good solid madonna album","review":"this is an amazing album in many ways. it starts with a techno-loaded bang, the chart topping \\"Music.\\" the other prime cuts are \\"Runaway Lover\\"--obvious message and foot tapping beat--\\"I deserve it\\"--soul-searching ballad--\\"Don't tell me\\"--easy to listen to and rootsy--and \\"Gone\\"--taking a turn toward girl a cappella harmony country. More annoying are the voice distortions on \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" (and the irritatingly plain lyrics; \\"I feel so sad, I feel so bad, sorry but-nobody's perfect,\\" etc.) and the almost-but-not-quite-haunting \\"Paradise.\\" Still, this is an album that you don't get sick of easily, a definite gem in Madonna's crown. She will continue to make great music with different twists as long as we let her."},{"rating":"2","title":"She just gets better and better...","review":"Because of the song \\"Music\\", I just had to buy this cd. And at first, I really didn't really like this cd. It's definitely different in that there's a lot of unnatural variations of her voice. That was rather disappointing. I think her voice is just fine without adding computer enhancements to it, etc.However, after I gave it another chance, I grew to really enjoy the cd. My favorite songs (in addition to \\"Music\\") are \\"Don't Tell Me\\", \\"Runaway Lover\\", and surprisingly \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\". I've heard people mention that they think her new cd is \\"countryish\\", which is far from the truth, it's more of a combination of pop and techno. Dressing like a cowgirl on the cover doesn't mean that she's singing country!The more I listen to it, the more I like it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the real Madonna?","review":"Since her very first debut so long ago, I have been a fan of Madonna, but I have to say that I am disappointed in this album , as I was with Ray of Light. I wish she would come off of this electronic scenario. It does not suit her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"Music is a fair album. It is not very good. The reason why is of course the production , the vocals and the lyrics. Madonna barely sings on this album and when she does she does not really puts anything in it. The lyrics are dumb and not very deep or anything special. Her voice is annoying and the album is a bit overproduced she mixes acoustic guitar with electronic music and is a good idea however poorly done. The album has few songs that are allright such as What It feels for a girl, Music, Don't Tell Me and Gone but the rest is just awful. I just heard her new single and I believe it is going to be a popular one however I think she should really be careful because indeed she may fall rock hard ( even though it hardly matters) because she has already reached the top but she is making terrible music and she is along with a lot of other musicians ruining the music business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure about this one....","review":"There are some songs on here I love, and others I could live without. I love \\"Music\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\", but could do without a lot of the others. As a Madonna fan, this CD is a must have, expecially if you liked Ray of Light. But if you are just starting out, not sure if this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Ever","review":"I've always been intrigued by Madonna, but who hasn't. I wasn't a fan of her music until \\"Ray of Light\\" hit the shelves, but her new album \\"Music\\" blows \\"Ray of Light\\" out of the sky. Motherhood has done wonders for Madonna. She has some deep insight into life and relationships. Buy this album, and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it for your cat","review":"If you have a cat, see how it reacts when you turn this up.

That was old a year ago! Madonna should know better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this rocks","review":"I love this CD. I've had it since the day it came out and I love #1, 4, 8, 9, and 10.

Yet. :) Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"how does she keep doing it?!","review":"I've liked many Madonna songs over the years and have always marvelled at her ability to reinvent herself over and over. This album is no exception -- once again, she makes other pop stars look like amateurs as she puts together another hip album. I'm not a techno or trance fan, but this music is very accessible even for those of us confessed \\"old bags\\" who only listen to a small amount of pop music. She's just good! There are tons of great songs with all sorts of neat effects. Every once in a while I felt like a song was going to turn into Funky Town, but maybe that's just to show how much older I am than the new generation of Madonna fans -- I like La Isla Bonita and Express Yourself the best.If you've ever liked Madonna, then don't hesitate to buy this dancy and fun album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say Madonna is not at her finest on this one.","review":"I had recieved Madonna's music for Christmas because I am a big Madonna fan and after listening to it I'm sorry to say that I'm not impressed. First of all,I do like the album's title track and the Maxi-single of the mixes was very good, but the rest of this album I just didn't care for. I am used to Madonna's dance music and I Just have to say that Techno just isn't for her. And a lot of the lyrics on this album aren't as sexy and imaginative as I know madonna to be. To save you dear reader time there is just something about this album that isn't Madonna and I just can't think of the right words to describe it. Hopefully with her next album Madonna will drop the cowgirl charade and get back to her Dance Music roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to the cliche","review":"As others, I bought the CD after hearing the \\"Music\\" single. I really like the song, but the rest of the CD lacks any intelligence. Such music makers as William Orbit should refrain from the Goddess of bland and focus on newer and off beat artist. If you're looking for a CD with spunk, and artistic gusto, check out Meg Lee Chin's \\"Snake and Junkies.\\" I dare you to take a risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing - Madonna's Musical Middle Age Crisis","review":"I loved Ray of Light, but this CD is terrible in comparison. Many of the lyrics sound like something a 4th grader would write and the electronic voice stuff gets old fast. I guess my first clue should have been the cowgirl outfit on the front cover. This just isn't the Madonna we all know and have come to love to see what she does next. This album seems like it is more of a novice artist's than Madonna's. It's like she is going through a musical middle age crisis and has lost herself somewhere along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty album","review":"In my opinion, this album certainly lacks depth. It sounds like the woman has not matured. The lyrics are surprisingly empty and cliched in most songs. Some parts are catchy (Music, Impressive Instant, Paradise -- how lovely to hear her speak French, my mother tongue), but not enough to make me listen to the songs over and over again like I usually do with Madonna's music. Even when I first heard \\"Music\\" on the radio I was suprised it was actually made by Madonna. Could have been made by Britney or some other teenagers. The album leaves me with a strange feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pure Music","review":"Madonna's 2000 release with Music is amazing. The first track of the same name is a fun and crowd pleasing start and the album ends with the beautiful ballad of Gone. In between, the tracks are all very representational of Madonna's new transformation, which is especially evident through Nobody's Perfect and I Derserve It. Other personal favorites include the poetic Paradise (Not For Me) and the upbeat Amazing. Music is a great addition to anyone's CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Material Girl Strikes Again!","review":"Madonna has been an Icon for twenty years now. \\"Music\\", her release from 2000 has some great material on it. Of course, the title track is blazing and went straight to number 1. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is also another great track, as is the often overlooked \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\". If you don't own it, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Interesting- that is defeniately the word for M's latest. I love it tho. I look at it this way, you either love it or hate it. \\"Impressive Instant\\" is def. different. When I first heard it, I was like what is this? So i played it again and it was awesome. \\"Runaway Lover\\", a sign that maybe M is gonna settle down? \\"Nobody's Perfect\\", heard this one on the radio- a preview before the cd came out- I loved it the first time I heard it! Such an amazing song. Way to go Madonna! So I say if you like something different and \\"interesting\\" go purchase it now! Besides its Madonna so how can you be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album, From The Pop Queen: Madonna","review":"Madonna's new album Music is definitely, without doubt one of her best albums. All songs on the album are worth listening. There are no filler songs, just one great song after another. Gone has to be the best song, the melody is just magnificent and the lyrics can relate to many people. The title track, Music absolutely rocks. My favourites are Gone, Music, What It Feels Like For A Girl, Runaway Lover, Impressive Instant, Nobody's Perfect and Amazing. Amazing sounds a lot like Beautiful Stranger, I don't know why some people don't like it. I absolutely love this album.

Ray of Light was a brilliantly produced CD, but this one is nothing more than a good marketing hype for Madonna's European fans who are obviously more in-tune to the current techno-electronica music. If you really like music, The Immaculate Collection is still the best ever CD from Madonna. That's my 2 cents worth..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Madonna's best work","review":"Unlike her previous releases Music certainly is a dissapointment. The first single \\"Music\\" is an excellent song and great video. Madonna has never looked better. However, the rest of the album lacks songs with hooks and good music. If your looking for a good follow up single to Music, there really isnt one. The album is kind of bland compared to the excellent Ray of Light album. I find it hard to listen to any of the songs past Music.I think she just churned out 10 songs for her fans and didnt really concentrate on the material. What is this crap? Artistic? I dont think so. Maybe next time Madonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"This not music","review":"Although this CD is called \`Music' what you are listening is not Music.

That being said, I think that \\"Music\\" is her worst album to date. The first 2 songs are great, but it's all downhill from there. After \\"Impressive Instant\\" I can't tell the difference between the tracks. The lyrics are cliched and boring. She's at her most unisnpired here. Madonna says she's the happiest she's ever been, and I am glad for that. But if her happiness is going to be reflected in dull, droning music like this; maybe it's time she hands over her crown to someone else and stop making \\"Music.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Missing Here, I think it's music!","review":"It is truly a misnomer to have titled this album \\"MUSIC\\" when in fact it doesn't contain any, or if there is it is kept well hidden. Once again Madonna proves beyond a doubt that attitude and controversy are no substitute for the real thing(Talent). The backgrounds are so fabricated and overproduced that it's hard to tell sometimes what you're listening too. If you're a fan of her earlier stuff, I would recommmend sticking to it. Afterall when it was first released it was just junk, now however it has become vintage junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna has hit the bottom","review":"Never have I heard such despicable, pretentious and unsucesfull CD as Madonna's latest, \\"Music\\". By mixing dance music elements with electronic, trip-hop, techno and melancholic lyrics Madonna suceeds in boring the listener to death. \\"Music\\" would feature any list of worst tracks recorded in the whole year, as would the whole CD, but because of the name \\"Madonna\\" that will never happen, and chances are this will be a bestseller, like most of her CDs. That's unfair, and I hope people at least realise that by listening to it.Madonna has hit the bottom, and she wants to take everyone with her. I'm going to get out while I still can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been a fan of hers since her first LP back in the early '80s when I was freshman in high school. But this collection left me wanting MUCH more. Music and What It Feels Like Being A Girl are the only two, in my opionion, that rate any merit and the only reason for the 2 stars - one for each song. The rest of the cd is just filler. I was hoping for a much more upbeat, dance-oriented cd after her mellow, introspective Ray of Light which I LOVED; probably her crowning achievement (although I still count Vouge, both song and video and her Like a Prayer CD among her best work. However, I still admire her balls for exeperimentation and I'm already looking forward to her next creation and a concert. She is truly one artist who will always be in the forefront. Hopefully, we won't have to wait for her to have another kid in order for her to be inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"Back in 2000, I was still a huge Madonna fan. I kept wondering how she could of followed up the great \\"Ray Of Light\\" album and also she had recently had a hit movie soundtrack single titled \\"Beautiful Stranger\\". All of this was great, until I heard she was having a new album out. When I heard the first single, I was really disappointed. The track \\"Music\\" is more of euro pop and in my opinion is just awful. Majority of the album is like this. The 2nd single \\"Don't Tell Me\\", is the only decent track on this album. The 3rd single \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" is just awful, in the words of Madonna \\"Degrating\\". I tried listening to other tracks such as \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Paradise\\", and so on. But there was nothing else on the album to offer to me. The Ray Of Light album had everything to offer on it.

She got to do something fresh and not stay out of line. this is a mixed of Dance/techno songs with guitar balladsoutstanding tracks here are:music , impressive instant(this one was supposed to be the 3d single instead of What it feels.... but warner wanted an new spanish song from her so was a little difficult to translate I.I. so they released What it feels...and Lo que siente la mujer) Runaway lover, Paradise, Don't tell me and my fav Gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPEN?

I've listened to a lot of her older stuff, but this doesn't pass in my grade book. 2 songs off the cd are any good: Music & Don't Tell Me. Either she tried a different style, or she wasn't quite with it. I don't know, but it's just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving to the beat of her own drummer","review":"The most famous woman in the world once again has the world listening to her voice. On this album sometimes that voice is put through a computer (i.e. Cher) but it still sends the same message, MUSIC. Music is the one area in Madonna's life that she rarely makes a mistake. Possibly because she has so much control over the final product. Maybe she should start producing and directing her own movies. With high-energy dance tunes and slower ballads of love, there is something on this album for every Madonna fan. This is no Ray of Light 2, nor would anyone expect that from Madonna. When it comes to her music, Madonna is hardly one to look back. Can you imagine listening to Like a Virgin now? If you enjoy Madonna, rush out and get this excellent new album. If you don't enjoy Madonna, what are you doing reading this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect the unexpected!","review":"Anyone who buys a new Madonna release expecting it to resemble any of her past work is missing the point!

She has nothing left to prove - and if you get this then you'll get Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Madonna had done her best before, and this CD proves that I am right. There R nothing but silly drum-machines and crazy synthetizers going on here, this album has no hits, those radio edits show us the album itself. Every song is like the other, it is 4 real hardcore Madonna fans. May be I am not that hardcore fan, but this CD is dull 4 an average pop-music listener 2. If U want 2 hear great Madonna buy her first few albums, Like a Prayer or just simply her Immaculate Collection, that nobody can go wrong with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could of Done Better","review":"Her first few albums were quite good. I don't know what happened after that. Her songs lack the beat and enthusiasm she used to evoke. This album I would definitely pass up.

Coming afer Ray of Light it's below average. Everything about this set of songs is gloomy, defeated, downbeat and low-rent. They seem to be written for someone with a three-note range. Most of the songs are slow, dirges. Madonna attempts to inveigle her way back onto dance floors with some regrettable (now hysterical) autotuning. She learned to play guitar for this cds appearances and thankfully Madonna's guitar playing career is now finished. The songs reflect the sort of lifeless strumming she could be entrusted to master in the short schedule between two cd releases. Worst of all is the song 'Music.' A feebler, more embarassing single has never been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna, could of done better job than this album...","review":"I believe that Madonna, could of done way better job than this album. I think she needs to improve her music in the future, and all because she is a mother now, dont mean she cant make better music. It seems like Britney Spears is like taking over her carrer...

Thanks to XM satellite radio -great investment for any music lover- I was able to see who sang this \\"loungy\\" tune. Afterwards, I conducted a search on Amazon to see if he had produced anything else, and much to my discovery was that he had another cd, \\"Deeper\\" that was released on April of 2004 (I am little late, sorry).And the rest is history...Admittedly, I am not one who boasts and brags about an artist.

I like it a lot. Upon hearing the first track, I immediately thought of Curtis Mayfield, and then later read Belasco's liner notes where he credits Mayfield and the Isley Brothers; and their influences definitely come through in Belasco's music. He's effective as a vocal and instrumental soloist.What I really liked about this cd is it's ability to \\"play well with others\\". When I want to shuffle 4-5 cds together, Belasco's \\"Deeper\\" mixes well with newer artists such as Joss Stone and Kem; or another mix with some old-school Ramsey Lewis and Roberta Flack. Also, Belasco's instrumental tracks nicely complemented other cds like Joyce Cooling and Walter Beasley.Belasco's \\"Deeper\\" is like a fresh sound that you know you've heard before.

The only thing I can suggest is calling your dentist (if you bought yours through them-I did) and see if they can locate you some replacement heads at a reasonable price. That is what I have been doing and having success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop for a new Tooth Brush","review":"Well I have loved this Toothbrush for years and it seemed the only way to get my teenager with braces to keep her own teeth clean. Manual brushes don't cut it and most other mechanical hurt her mouth or break the wires. But Alas... now I have to go looking again because Philips will no longer make or support this product. Really how hard is it to keep making replacement heads as long as they sell Philips!? There is obvious demand... even Ebay is charging $100 or more just for replacement heads. I don't blame Amazon, only the silly people who would pay $186! I really don't want to go back with Sonicare thanks to this little stunt by it's makers, but really, this technology just isn't found in most other tooth brushes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only available on line","review":"My dentist said my teeth and gums are better than he had ever seen them.

It takes forever for you to go around to each one and take it over. Ordinarily this doesn't seem like such an irritation in that it is a part of the game but there's only 5 or so different \\"layouts\\" so it seems like you do the same thing over and over again.I didn't really like the mob war situation. Every time you attempt to take over a warehouse or transport hub you inevitably start a mob war no matter what your heat level was. It seems like you wind up running to the FBI agent every 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative and exciting!","review":"Fans of the Godfather movies will enjoy this to no end. It actually puts you IN the movie, as you join the Corleone family and work through all the major plot points, including the horse in the bed, Sonny getting shot, and the Don's demise. Along the way, you will extort hard working immigrants, bribe police officers, steal cars, and throw people off of roofs. Little socially redeeming value, but a WHOLE lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"great entertaining game","review":"Great graphics, instructions and what you're supposed to do is a little fuzzy. Actions difficult using mouse. Overall, a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, horribly engineered","review":"As some reviews have already stated, the controls in this game are HORRIBLE. It does not appear that the group who made this game did ANY testing at all. The camera is unmovable and its stuck in one of the worst positions i've ever seen as far as a camera is concerned. They tried to give the game a sort of Splinter Cell feel with a few of the camera and game mechanics but failed horribly.On the good side, the game's content isn't too bad. You can do things as advertised such as extortions. You also run on a point/reward/skill system which is very fun. The weapon mechanics seems nicely done.Back to the bad. The game is simply unplayable because of the controls. They also have cutscenes that can't be skipped. It's very sad that no one seems to raise an eyebrow in the company when/if they tested this joke of a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I purchased this for my husband and was very disappointed. He's not much of a gamer anymore (who has time) but loves the Godfather. I was very disappointed in the controls and really how difficult the game is. It really takes more time than its worth and you get frustrated very easily. If I had to do it over, I wouldnt waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this One","review":"Played Mafia??? Well this is same but with worse music.. slightly better graphics and story... should be. The game gets old and when you become Don guess what... I don't know what to do. No multiplayer. Hard gamer? takes 2-3 days to finish. You'll be bored and $30 for 3 days is a touch on high side wait till it gets down to $10 it is worth that. Oh yaa, get the Magnum upgrade first you'll be glad you did. Print a map on-line the one they send is unusable and getting to map in game is a torture device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game especially with this price tag!","review":"I cannot complain, maybe they didn't put in the greatest graphics available at the time, but this is still a great game. The cool thing is that you can go into count less stores and take them over for the Corleone family. The mob wars are also very fun. Lastly, i had fun with the cars, whose handling is above normal and speed ahead of it's time (this game happens in the 40's) but that makes it even more fun to drive. The actual plot of the game is interesting, you get to meet all the characters from the book, the character's faces based on the movies. My only concern with this game is that at the end of the game plot the story starts to move too fast and ends too suddenly, and the end I will not spoil.Overall, a great game for 10 bucks. I would say this game is a mix of Grand Theft Auto and Mafia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This game is great. I just have one main complaint. The driving in the game is very unrealistic, and jumps between either not reacting to a turn, or turning instantly on a 90 degree angle.Other than that, i love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this helicopter toy for my nephew for Christmas. I browsed through a lot of wooden toys before settling on this one. I felt that it was worth the extra money to have peace of mind. In less than a month after receiving the toy, the copter part came detached. The copter part is pretty big so besides being annoying, at least it wasn't a choking hazard. The yellow peg holding the copter part in, however, was definitely a choking hazard as it is rather small. I am very upset that this toy was so easily broken, especially since my nephew is not a destructive kid. I hate to think I gave him something dangerous.I definitely do not recommend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book Five Stars *****","review":"Excellent book on writing for the childrens market, tons of valuable content.

This book gave the bare bones basics about book writing. I felt very cheated. There was more information about putting together a poster board with you future wishes than writing technique. It just goes to show that anyone can write a book in thrity days-- it just doesn't have to be well written or informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this waste of space get into Amazon?","review":"I received this as a gift from a friend who is encouraging me to write a kiddies book I have had up my sleeve for ages but never have the time to put pen on paper.... What I should have done is taken 2 hours to write a 'How to write a children's book in 30 day's or less' book and wait for any desperate soul to buy it and laugh my way to the bank. I am truely sorry my friend wasted good money (hard earned cash) on this. The best I can do to compensate is to write this review and let others know that this is a self published waste of time and your money.

It is so easy to work with and makes cakes come out BEAUTIFUL but the taste is HORRIBLE. It tasted like something chewy mixed with nail polish remover.If your looking for a beautiful cake and are going to warn people to take the fondant off first, this is a good product. But don't offer to make someone a cake (especially one that they are going to pay for) and use this product. Your reputation will be shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"I have my own supplier for my fondant. But there was one time when I accepted a rush job and wasn't able to check that I don't have enough fondant left. So I went out to buy Wilton. I was so impressed on how easy it is to work with. So I cut my decors and colored it. As I was drying the stars, I tasted one (isn't that what good cooks are suppose to do?). I almost vomited when I tasted it. I am very sensitive to food taste and smell. The Wilton Fondant taste like rancid oil. At first I tasted the coloring and the pearl dust I used coz I thought the bad taste was coming from there (and the fact that I never thought Wilton can make such bad product). Anyway, I ended up calling my supplier and agreed to pick up the fondant just so I can get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would NEVER Serve a Cake Made With This Stuff!","review":"When I started taking the Wilton cake courses I really looked forward to taking the Fondant and Gum Paste class. And while the fondant is easy to work with and makes a beautiful cake, it is THE WORST TASTING STUFF I'VE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH.Cakes are meant to be eaten. And I have pride in my cakes. I want them to look good, and I expect them to TASTE GOOD! This stuff tastes so bad that I could never, in good conscience, serve a cake decorated with it to anyone. I wouldn't even give it to my dogs. IT TASTES THAT BAD!Come on Wilton! Surely your chefs can create a fondant that people would actually want to eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes REALLY, REALLY bad","review":"I used this once and I will never use it again. Can't believe Wilton makes such a disgusting thing. I learned to make home made rolled fondant and it tastes so good and is easy to work with, I will never purchase this piece of crap again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely disgusting!","review":"I would not in good conscience serve a cake covered with this fondant to anyone. It is absolutely horrible! Its ease of use is pointless if the taste is this bad. I once wrote to Wilton about this and they wrote back saying that their product is best in the market (bite me!) and supposedly has a mild vanilla flavor (it is more like more like sweet play-doh + rancid oil). Other brands while harder to find, are a thousand times better (satin ice/ fondarific). Now that Duff Goldman fondant is made available easily, I hear Wilton is finally going to change the formula. We'll have to wait and see if they get their act together or continue their strategy of making poor quality products just because many consumers don't have other easy options or just don't know that there is better stuff available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"While this fondant isn't the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth, I wouldn't want to eat a cake made with it. It rolls and shapes nicely, but it tastes terrible. My advice is to either go with another brand of rolled fondant or make your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really easy to work with","review":"Don't know why the big fuss over the taste, it's not that bad. I use the fondant for decorative purposes, not because of it's taste, you just can't make the cake look any nicer then with a fondant over it. Wilton's fondant is really easy to work with, even for people that just started playing with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"Arrived quickly needed if for a party on sat order thursday night came friday night!!!!

I still find it hard to believe that they aren't aware that this fondant is laughably bad....of course, once you see the price....you stop laughing. I made the mistake of buying it ONCE...I won't make that mistake again. I should've known when the clerk at the cash made a face. I tried getting my money back to no avail. No one at the company cares. All I can say is \\"BEWARE\\"....great for practice (if you enjoy throwing money away), but this is not fit for human consumption!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use it in a pinch","review":"I used this fondant once because I bought it to give it a try. In a pinch it will do, and given that its cheaper than other brands (not by much though), one can arguably use it for decorations that are not mean to be eaten. The taste is horrible, I would compare it to gum paste in flavor. It is stickier than other brands and when you break pieces off of it this becomes an issue since you have more shaping to do. I use Satin Ice and think that it's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My First Choice for Fondant","review":"Actually, Wilton fondant isn't even my 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choice. I have used this fondant for covering cake boards and for figures that will not be consumed, but I would never use this fondant to cover a cake that was going to be eaten as I find the taste of Wilton fondant to be disgusting. There are far too many other brands of fondant out there that are superior in both taste and ease of use to settle for using Wilton fondant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww!","review":"Its like supper nasty i like because its easy to use.

You cannot sit on them but they seem well made. The only problem I had was that during shipping the side handles were bent a weird way, twisted around. The handles now stick out at crazy angles. They could have been made with an inflexible insert so that they keep their shape. I have pressed the trunks up against a wall, hoping to flatten them out. The only other suggestion I have is that the trunks could be lined so they do not snag blankets or delicate materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for statement that the Bible and evolution mix","review":"This book contains a history of how Christians viewed the age of the earth, the nature of methods of dating sediment, and reasons why the idea that the earth is young is false.

The storyline is okay and Michael Pare (appearing with Mr. Drago again in Deadly Heros) is good in his role as a motorcycle-riding lunar cop from the future. For Drago fans though, Mr. Drago is the bad guy as usual but he uses a lot of profanity which is really not his style. As a psycho biker, Drago's role could have been developed more to give Pare a much better advisary. A good portrayal in the movie is done by Robin Smith (Never Say Die). He's an android from hell sent to finish up what Pare doesn't. Still, this movie is worth a look for any sci-fi lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE BLOWS!!!!!!!!","review":"If you love horrible special effects and bad acting that ISN'T humorous, then this movie is for you.

I may have been able to live with the changes from the original \\"walking tall\\" movies, but just when this movie starts to get good it ends. It's the shortest movie I've ever seen. I was very disappointed. I sold the movie the day after I bought it because I knew I would never watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good re-make of a semi-classic flick.","review":"I like The Rock. He's an honest actor, humble and willing to always do his best. I also liked this movie because it does not use high tech gimmicks and stuff generated by computer specialists.This is a bare knuckles, down-to-earth action flick. Too bad that I could only buy the PG-13 version. According to The Rock's comments, there is an R-rated version which includes a little more spicy stuff. Not that it would affect the plot in any negative way. Is just that I hate censorship.Otherwise, is a fine action movie, even whent it stands a bit in the shadow of the 1973 version, but still with high honors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"The Rock fans will enjoy this action filled movie with a great script, excellent acting, and just a fun time to enjoy your day with a great movie. Worth the bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The original was better and true.","review":"This is a remake of a 1970's movie that was based on a true story. This one is high on special effects but short on plot and not even slightly based on the true story of a local American hero that stood up against impossible odds because it was the right thing to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than You Would Think","review":"While no one would say this movie (or any of its actors) deserves an award, it does serve as a moral (and morale) booster. The basic theme of the movie is stand up for what is right, to walk tall, and in The Rock's attempt to do so, the movie serves its entertainment purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rated Correctly","review":"I normally have liked Dwayne Johnson movies, but this movie was a bad selection. Not only was the acting terrible, it was not appropriate for 13-year-olds, or any adolescent. I'm tired of not being able to watch a decent movie with my kids because of all the sexual innuendos, and scantily clad women. Come On, Hollywood!! Have some originality and make some good family movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LIKED THE ORIGINAL MOVIE MUCH BETTER","review":"THIS REMAKE OF THE 1973 CULT CLASSIC IS WELL, QUESTIONABLE. CHRIS VAUGHN [THE ROCK] RETURNS TO WASHINGTON AFTER SERVING IN THE MILITARY TO ONLY FIND OUT THAT HIS HOMETOWN IS FILLED WITH CORRUPTION AND CRIME. THIS VERSION IS LESS VIOLENT THAN THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S ALSO LESS ENTERTAINING. THE ROCK DOES THE BEST HE CAN, BUT AFTER A WHILE, THIS MOVIE TENDS TO CEASE BEING INTERESTING. ALL IN ALL, IT'S A WATCHABLE MOVIE, BUT I BET YOU WON'T WANNA WATCH IT MORE THAN ONCE! LIKE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, BASED ON A TRUE STORY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER'S NAME HAS CHANGED."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHHHHHEEEEEEZZZZZYYYYYY!","review":"You know you're looking at a poor screenplay when you start hearing things like \\"Are you okay?\\" The Rock was stabbed several times and left for dead in the middle of the road, how do you think he is? Johnny Knoxville and the other supporting characters serve as the main acting talent in this movie, whereas the Rock's character seems to be devoid of any personality traits other than his nostalgia for his hometown. Other cheesy scenes include violence, violence in a casino, violence with wet t-shirt pole dancing chicks, and finally, a troubled youngster who starts out angry at the protagonist, then learns to respect him. What a redundant plot!

Nice modern version of the earlier picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of name is the Rock?","review":"Words probably can't express how bad this movie is, but let's see... You can see every plot turn coming from a mile away, all the bad guys are preposterously bad, the cliches are running amok (the mill closed, things aren't how they used to be, cops are corrupt, the casino runs the town, kids are doing drugs, somebody needs to Clean Up This Town) The courtroom scene is one of the most laughably unrealistic in recent memory. Script is bad, acting is bad. When Johnny Knoxville is, by far, the best thing about your movie, you're in trouble. The one mark in the plus column: mercifully, the film clocks in at under 75 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could've been better","review":"This movie is decent but it has some issues that hinder it a bit. The camerawork in the action scenes, bad writing that involves the use of a 2 x 4 that is somehow tough as steel and its action scenes which are cool but could've been better. As a whole its issues don't destroy it. This movie kicks ass and is definitely worth checking out. 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remake of the 1973 film Walking Tall","review":"The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn,who just returns home from the army after being gone 8 years.Alot has changed in the small town. The main attraction of the town is the casino,whose security guards are selling drugs to kids.When Vaughn spots the gamer at the craps table switching dice and desides to take care of it,the corrupt casino employees mess him up and leave him for dead.When his nephew almost dies from taking drugs that were bought off the casino's security guards,Vaughn unleahes his one man assault to become sheirff and clean up the town.There's lots of great action and a little bit of humor thrown in.IF you love the Rock or just want to watch a great action film go watch \\"Walking Tall\\".Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking Tall","review":"I like Dwayne Johnson, but this film was piss poor cheap, its like they were making up the story as they were filming.

Really bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I hate this movie? Because someone made it.","review":"I hated this movie so, so much. The acting was horrid, The Rock was not at all convincing, the story was fake, the action lame and Johnny Knoxville drove the film into deep, deep darkness. Not only was this film way too brutal to get a PG-13 rating, but the movie alone had no redeeming value or worth. If films this bad are being made, maybe the end of good movies is nearer than we thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"save yourself the pain","review":"Ouch, saw this movie because of the Rock and ended up feeling sorry for all of the actors in it. Script was horrible and most of the action sequences are shot w/ a handheld -- a shaking camera plus a lot of movement equals very blurry screen. Afterward I really wanted my money and time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!","review":"the rock is a loser. so is this film. what a generically crappy, lousy, good for nothing movie. people who like this film are mindless, brainwashed idiots who will see any movie and say \\"it's pretty good!\\" because they are morons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Flick, But Could Of Been A Bit Better","review":"Walking Tall is a great remake and action flick! One of The Rock's best films yet! However, it was a little short and could of used some more effort into the story. The movie was also alittle uneven at times, but overall it was a pretty enjoyable flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rock's shining moment as a movie star","review":"To this day, this is *still* the best movie I've seen the Rock star in. I share the opinion that the Rock never should have left wrestling, but seeing a remake of an old 1973 classic titled 'Walking Tall' helps me see that the Rock is a decent movie star after all.Walking Tall is a movie that won't make you particularly happy after it's over, or make you think you wasted your time. It's just a movie that's above average, with good, memorable action segments. The Rock is pretty convincing in his roll but the biggest problem with the film is that it's WAY too short and actually feels rushed during certain spots (like for instance, when the Rock becomes the sheriff- there should have been more build-up here instead of him suddenly \\"being the sheriff\\").I'm not really complaining. I enjoyed the film. Just a very short film, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justin Timberlake episode - \\"Edited\\" is right!","review":"The Justin Timberlake episode on Mother's Day, 2009 was one of the funniest SNL episodes ever, but this \\"edited\\" version removes several of the best sketches, including \\"Mother Lover\\", which is the main reason I bought it in the first place. Don't waste your money, just download it for free on Hulu or NBC. Also, these shows are very slow to start once downloaded (1-2 minutes) and you can't easily fast forward or reverse (3-5 second delay each time).

As another reviewer said, I feel conned also, feel like asking for my money back, I know it's only $1.99, but if they can get $1.99 from a lot of people unknowingly, hey, that's a pretty good profit generator.Very disappointed, and that's why the one star, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite SNL hosts","review":"I love Dwayne... as a wrestler, you might think he could be stiff but he's just a natural comedian.

I even liked the story told in this one. My problem is this. I am a mother of an almost two year old who is multi racial. When I read this book it stuck me that the baby that PSP makes is brown. I had to ask myself why? The baby causes tons of trouble until PSP gets two dragons to help her take care of it. I bought it for my daughter's 2nd birthday, though she won't be getting it so soon. I have decided to save it for a few years until she is old enough to talk about and critically think about the imagery of a white woman needing dragons to held her take care of a little brown baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Taste Anything Like The Original","review":"Despite what they say, this is NOT the same formula as the original, tastes nothing like it.

He is truly an amazing talent. It's too bad that the current state of radio airplay doesn't allow artists such as Tommy Emanuel exposure to listeners. While I really enjoyed Tommy's original compositions, its his covers that really rock. Mason Williams \\"Classical Gas\\" really gets a shot of steroids! I highly recommend this to any fans of acoustic guitar virtuosos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tommy DVD by far!","review":"Yes, some of the other Tommy DVDs offer better quality images, but this DVD documents a superlative and comprehensive overview of Tommy's amazing chops and his lovingly-crafted songs. Two thumbs(and a pinkie) way, way up!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest guitarists working today.","review":"Tommy Emmanuel is not only an extremely gifted finger-style guitarist, he's a first rate showman who enjoys his own show nearly as much as the audience. If you can't see him play live, this is really the next-best thing to being there. The show runs the gamut from fresh arrangements of old standbys to intriguing original compositions, and not a clunker in the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unblelievable!","review":"Tommy Emmanuel is simply the most amazing guitar player imaginable.

Since I have some really dark accents in my dining room, this works out ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan of Arcadia the First Season","review":"I loved this television show when it was on the air and was so disappointed when it was cancelled after only two seasons. I looked everywhere for the dvd's of the two seasons and found the best price for Season 1 on Amazon. I highly recommend this dvd to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does this show remind me of Wonderfalls?","review":"Don't get me wrong. I really like the \\"crooked lines of God\\" premise, but somehow this show feels like a slightly worse copy of \\"Wonderfalls\\".Same idea. Girl is given instructions on doing things to help the world along. Girl is confused.Just a few differences - Joan of Arcadia has a little bit of that \\"after school special\\" feel and is missing the sardonic wit of Wonderfalls.Still, all in all, definitely a nice little program. I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are Seasons 2 and 3?","review":"Just plain and simple, release the other seasons! I don't blog and I don't chat, but I do appreciate exquisitely written and heart-felt, compelling television. Release the rest of Joan of Arcadia! The rest of the dreck on TV is just wasteland. Oh, BTW, to Ms. Hall, how about a full-length feature movie where you tie up that lose end of Joan versus the Devil that was going to be the next season we were all cheated out of. It would sure beat the horrid remake-itis that has gripped Hollyweird.

Anyone who's considering buying this boxset has probably watched and already liked the series, so I just wanted to comment on the quality of the DVD themselves. I have various TV series boxsets ranging from old sitcoms like Dilbert, Three's Company, and Gilligan's Island to new dramas like Buffy and Angel but I was never impressed with video quality until seeing the Joan of Arcadia. The video is in widescreen and it's really crisp. It looks movie quality. I don't know, I guess \\"Joan\\" is the first series I've bought that is recent and airs on a major network so maybe this quality is the norm. Maybe \\"Joan\\" airs in widescreen HD and they did a quality job on that so conversion to DVD was simple.In other areas, the boxset had extra scenes in most episodes and has many episodes with commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than your average commentary","review":"When I saw the first promo for \\"Joan\\", I was SO prepared to mock it. I initially missed it because of CBS' choice of Friday night at 7pm. A couple of friends raved about it, so I made time to watch it once and make obsessed.So many things were incredible about this series. They didn't beat the viewer over the head with religion; they made God feel approachable (even if you're mad at him). This material can mean different things to different viewers, which is so refreshing.I highly recommend the commentary. Lots of things were revealed... like the name of Adam Rove's father (Karl). It was mentioned once, so I had to rewind to verify. I'm not holding that against them. The writers/producers gave an reasonable explanation: they wanted his name to be average. (That thought cracks me up: Karl Rove --- average!!!)Creators/Producers/Actors/etc: Thanks for the two years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan of Arcadia, sophisticated, witty,","review":"An entirely believable 16 year old girl with an entirely believable family, warts and all. The program handles complexity with great sophistication, often letting complex issues stay unresolved, forcing the viewer to reach her/his own conclusions. Manages to be spiritual without being theological; avoids confusing religion with spirituality. A definite viewpoint about God is here, without any attempt to proselytize. The best program I have ever watched dealing with spirituality. All the main characters are fine actors and the interactions with Joan's family and friends are witty, occasionally sad, always asking profound questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show on Television","review":"Joan of Arcadia is a wonderful show and the DVD set is great for me, since I began watching the show partway through season one. You don't have to a particular religion or religious at all to take value from the show. The acting is wonderful and there is a lot built in to each episode that is deep, inspiring, and thought provoking. Joan of Arcadia is a gem and is quality TV at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan of Arcadia","review":"They are very interesting programs, well written and thoughtfull.

It was very good then and I was disappointed it was cancelled after just two seasons. The second season was better than the first. The show was getting better over time. After I recently watched the two seasons on DVD, I like the show even better. I consider Joan of Arcadia to be one of my all-time top ten television shows -- and that dates back to the 1960's.I am very impressed with the acting skills of the main character, Amber Tamblyn. I am surprised she is not one of the big stars today.What I really enjoyed about the season 2 DVD was the special feature of a script reading. First time I had ever seen that done. All people involved with a single episode sat around a huge table as the actors read their parts from the script. Occasionally, clips from the actual aired show were shown. Very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing show","review":"Thoughtful, original and inspirational, this show is truly the best to come to television yet. The box set has commentaries with the creator of the series (Barbara Hall) and one with the cast, deleted scenes, information on the different actors that play God, and interviews with the cast and the creators of the show. This Emmy nominated, People's Choice Award winning series is one of my favorite shows of all-time. It asks hard questions and doesn't force any certain religion on you; instead it encourages people to look inward and see what they can do for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan of Arcadia (season 1 DVD set)","review":"This is a MUST HAVE set.

The first season ends with a poorly executed and silly finale with Joan getting Lyme disease. I tried to like this series and watched the DVD collection with my best friend. It has its moments but I really don't see what all the hype is about. If the show is so great, why did the audience diminish in droves in the second season? Again, the first season finale might give you some clues. As for the actors, they are fine in their respective roles. The DVD set is mastered quite nicely and there are many extras. But the show is not in the \\"classic\\" realm the way other long running shows are. It had its possibilities but in my own opinion, it just didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRICTLY FOR THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT!","review":"The message of this program seems to be that God can be anything or anyone....even a tree! To be fair, the series does have its moments but they are hardly worth paying the price of this DVD set. I'm not surprised it was cancelled. I watched the first season out of sheer curiousity and the show, did indeed, begin promisingly enough. However, by the end of the season, the program began to border on the ridiculous and its no wonder the show lost its audience in the second season ensuring its demise."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF ITS SO GOOD, WHY WAS IT CANCELLED AFTER TWO SEASONS?","review":"This show could never measure up to the three best family dramas in television history...\\"Little House\\", \\"The Waltons\\" and \\"Touched by an Angel\\" each of which lasted nine seasons. SOmeone must have been doing something right there. Having watched this series I have one question. Why did the audience stay away in droves during the second season thus ensuring its cancellation? If it was so good, why did the audience diminish? This show was nothing more than a teenage soap opera with a lame attempt to theologize (badly I might add). I'm not sorry it was cancelled but I am sorry for those that liked the show. Suffice it to say, if ratings are the indication, I was in the majority ....those who stayed away during the 2nd season."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan","review":"This one got me hooked on the whole concept.

Usually you can win over CPU but only in the last minutes of the game.

Learning about the male chimpanzee's quest for dominance, it makes one wonder how much our behavior is motivated by inherent drives that are not only irrelevant in modern cultures, but are unknowable by those who experience the motivation.This book has changed the way I look at and understand the word around me.I strongly recommend this book, but it is not for the faint-hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"obsession","review":"it is an excellent music, that reaaches right to the heart, and some fantasies.

Never mind the Aces of the other side, the german, italian, romanian, finish and japanese, who got no mention at all.Since we live in a global community, to portrait the dogfights of all countires, in the last 90 years,would have made this series more popular around the globe. It seems it was made for US and Israely consumption only.I hope this series will add a broader spectrum in later productions.They should also add military commentators and eyewitnesses from other countries too.Also, when the producers handpick the most successful US & Israeli exploits only, it leaves a wrong impression to the lesser educated viewers about the war in the air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"This book tries to address starting a business and eBay.

Half of the 10 listed do not have a current valid eBay userid that matched what was in the book. One \\"successful seller\\" is mostly a buyer.

And then I read Cally's War again. Yup, it's that good.So about this book? Well, let's see... romance, redemption, espionage, assassination and internal politics at high speed in typically well-written style. What else could a girl want?A word of warning though. A lot of the subtlety and background is explained in Ringo's previous books - it's difficult to fully understand some of the undercurrents/subplots without having read the other Legacy of the Aldenata books. That said, the book is still a great read without them.And you can always read it again after you've bought the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!!!","review":"I really enjoyed the Posleen Series and was looking forward to reading more. I assumed this book was an epilouge of sorts. I was wrong.It was a dreary story of Cally; 50 or so years in the future. The usual charcters were accounted for but it seemed all so stupid. This book has the feel of some dreadful romance novel. Emabrassing sex scenes, horny protagonist, Fabio look alike, well, there were no Fabio clones, however, I have no idea who the target market for this book is!!!I love Ringo's military fiction; it's the top of the genre. I hope he leaves the romance genre to the Barbara Cartlands of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intrigue and Violence, no Posleens in Sight","review":"If you like stories of intrigue and violence featuring homicidal nymphomaniacs with large chest measurements, this book is for you.

If you want that, spend your money on something else. No one expects an author to write the same stuff for his entire life. The mistake with this novel was positioning. If you don't over analyze human nature, it make perfect sense that there was a great expectation that this novel would tell where the puppet strings lead and how humanity's destiny would play out. To be fed a rather deviant sex story is a tad shocking and disheartening that the larger story will ever be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Sex Interfering with a Good Adventure Novel","review":"I've read this book and \\"The Hero,\\" both spin-offs from the Posleen wars. I'm personally glad that the Posleen carnage is over. There is only so much you can do with ravening aliens and last-ditch defenses.This was a good read, except for a lot more sex than was needed to sell the story to me. Cally's efforts to deal with her own persona remind me a lot of the problems seen with long-term Special Ops folks. They all get a little ragged around the edges. The Special Ops aspects of the book are great.I must be getting old, but the sexual aspects of Cally's life are very much overdone. I can live without the graphic details. They don't add anything to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much violence for me","review":"I've been reading science fiction and fantasy for over 50 years now and although I have read and very much liked most of what Ringo has written, this book contained so much violence that it turned me off the book.

I'd like to say that I only have myself to blame, but it would be a lie. I blame Ringo for pawning off the writing of this book (and the trashing of beloved characters) to someone else. Clearly, he was too busy to come up with something remotely resembling a good plot, so instead turned to pitiful s&m; sex and the torture of women. It has become obvious that John Ringo has some serious issues with women and has let them infect his writing. There is no plot here, unless you count destroying a loyal following of fans.

But you won't find out in this book. The posleen are defeated, dead, gone, defunct, destroyed and absent. Which makes this book about a sex mad assasin fairly pointless. You don't learn anything about plots being developed in previous books. Just some ho-hum sex and nail polish. One posleen is killed during the novel, plenty of humans (by humans). Why? Dunno, who cares? Not me, I'll give mine to the local library so as few people as possible need to waste money on this explotation rip off book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring I had to work to finish it.","review":"I don't mind that John Ringo didn't write it but I do mind that he doesn't seem to understand that using the same characters in the same world at the same time with his name on the publication would bring in readers who expected at least some of the same feel and expertice. It's not that it is a \\"women's book\\" which it isn't I read more women's books than men's books since I read a lot of mystery books. The story feels like a short story stretched past the breaking point to fill a novel's space and it feels like a throw away short story instead of a keeper. I was able to explain the story to a friend without him missing anything in 5 sentences and thats light weight. So if you want to keep up with the characters in this series I would wait for a paperback at a used bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"anticipation dashed and trashed","review":"I awaited this book with salivating anticipation, and was truly horribly disappointed. The explicit sex [...] scense really were awful. Cally seemed to spend a lot of time either in bars to pick up strange men, or having sex with various targets. As an asassin, she is excellent, but do we really need all this trash stuff?? It's as if the authors were afraid the book might not sell well without lots of sex. Also, it is not a \\"stand alone\\" book. You must have read at least one or two of the previous books, which were excellent. This book does not explain just why the B.S. are against the human military, why the aliens are suspect, or just who are these aliens and what is their ultimate goal. I look forward to further Posleen books, not to mention Mr. Ringo's other series. Please, though, leave Cally and her sexual exploits out of any further books. NOT for young readers, which is too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Blah","review":"I had mixed feelings about this when I bought it - I already knew it wasn't like the previous books but I did expect better.Firstly, the plot was not sufficiently well connected.

The ending itself is just a bit too convenient and a bit too cryptic.There are some scenes with the mysterious Bane Sidhe (hint, this is pronounced Banshee in English), but we really learn nothing useful about the group. Nor is there any meaningful detail about what has been happening since the cavalry arrived (aka the Fleet) and ended the Posleen incursion on Earth in one afternoon (slight exaggeration), some forty years earlier.If you skip this entry in Aldenata series, you won't notice the omission.

She shows she can take care of herself and her \\"granpa,\\" fighting assassins and 'posties,' even surviving a nuke dropped on her head. She has strong family ties and later strong female influences. But all that is for nought, when she is portraited as a psychopathic slut assassin in this novel.

I have had that on advanced order for about 2 months. And with your attitude I will not be purchasing any of your books in the future. Subbing out a story line is the lowest thing an author can do in my opinion. Either write it yourself or let it die!While the outlook for the German SS novel looked promising I was under the impression that YOU had wrote it. But since I now find out that its only your name on the book why should I bother.Im sure the gentleman you have writing it is a very good author. But I was going to purchase it based on your name. Which in my opinion you have destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The consequences of selling your name","review":"This book cannot have been written by the same author as A Hymn Before Dying. It's absolutely terrible. Wooden, badly plotted and amateurish. All I can hope is that the co-authorship meant that Ringo simply sold off the characters and the basic background to another writer who wrote a hacked-up melange of romance novel and dumb science fiction.Yech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn? or S/M?","review":"After some interesting ideas in the preceding 'Posleen' war books, we are down to some plain old porn and S/M. Dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written TRASH","review":"I enjoyed the other Ringo novels but this book seems to only have Ringo's name on the cover. The book takes place thirty to forty years (remember rejuv treatments) in the future. Cally is an assassin who is lucky she can do a clean kill. Not much about the aliens except as a side issue. Sex seems to be on the author's mind and the somewhat pornographic desciptions seem to be out of place. Could have been a great book if the secret agenda of the Darhel was developed. Only a few killings of their agents and a couple of cameo appearances was it. Not much else. Recommend you save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish","review":"To be honest, I did not finish the book, but after reading about 30 pages it just was not my \\"cup of tea\\". I have read many of John Ringo's books and enjoyed them all. I was excited when I had a new one in hand. The excitement quickly ended. The sexual descriptions were just not necessary, in my opinion. There are better ways to describe the mental illness of a character. I usually give my books to a small local library when I finish them - not this one. This is not a book I would give to anyone. I will certainly read the first pages in the bookstore from now on before buying any more of John Ringo's books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but Cally's War is mis-titled; there is no \\"war\\".","review":"John Ringo's comments and feedback were good to read. I don't know if I speak for a majority of reviewers, but the title and the cover art lead us to believe that there will be Posleen blood shed at some point.If you're looking for an in-depth view on the life of a spy - a mid-aged, female, expert spy - then this is a great book. Well written. Just be ready for a spy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I was unable to finish reading this book. Cally was preoccupied having one night stands and shopping. What happened to the war?In all fairness I only made it halfway through the book, maybe the second half was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish","review":"Prior to this book, I hadn't read anything by John Ringo. So I had no expectations of what the book was or should be other than one with good action and a kicka$$ leading lady. I had no problem with the sex nor with the, well, only implied sadism. What I did have a problem with was the disjointedness of the plot. (Was there a plot?)The book got off to a great action start then fizzled with page after page after page with details of Cally's daily life. As another reviewer pointed out Cally seemed occupied with her clothes, hair and sex. Fine. I don't have a problem with this character development if the story is going somewhere. But it didn't. If it did, it was moving at a snail's pace.Maybe I gave up too early around page 100. But all these details didn't seem to have a point other than to add to the final word count. And I just couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for paperback if you have to have it","review":"It defintely is a change from the previous posleen books. They were all action and violence, while this one is more subtle and delves into the main character's psyche a lot more. The major problem i have with it is the cost. It's just not long enough to justify spending 25 or even 16 dollars on it. And I just couldnt get into this idea of having a spy take the role and the body of another person. Its too convient."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's your problem, Ringo!","review":"You start with a character that was shaping up to be really fun and full of potential at the end of Hells Faire. A girl with excellent bloodlines, training, and fun to boot. Cut to the beginning of the book and she has become a total tramp who uses her body like a garbage disposal and cannot be respected by the other characters in the book let alone the reader.

If you don't, you are likely just prolonging the inevitable. I read another reviewer say that when I purchased my first Mehdi CD, but I didn't believe it. The day I received that first Mehdi CD, I quickly ordered the other seven CDs from SMI, and I waited very impatiently for them to arrive.I'm certainly no expert, but to me, Mehdi compares only with Mozart: it's impossible to find a single composition that is not a perfect classic.

The book, as noted by almost all reviewers is a wonderful collection of recipes combined with beautiful pictures and stories. I am writing this review to respond to the \\"review\\" of TL from San Francisco. TL's review was not a review of the book, but sounded like the whining of a jealous individual. Every review recognizes the wonderful pictures; TL contends there are none; TL states they have been dining at the restaurant for three years; but has not looked at the author's first book for two years; why were they going if they did not like the food? None of TL's review rings true and it is a disservice to the author and this book to have the review posted."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cookbook","review":"aesthetically pleasing book with interesting background information on the dishes and good recipes. more pictures of the actual dishes would have helped, especially for those that you are not familiar with, but the easy to follow step-by-step directions made up for the lack of pictures"},{"rating":"2","title":"just like the restaurant!","review":"Great book!

Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with this one. Besides the culture and history aspects, which I am not looking for mainly in a cookbook, I find her recipes in this book too tedious and complicated. Furthermore, I tried two recipes (Hue beef vermicelli soup and tofu, tomato and chile soup)and both did not even taste too good. I decided to give the book to my friend, a great fan of Vietnamese food. She returned the book to me after two weeks because she cannot find half the ingredients called for in the book. Since my friend and I are not hardcores when it comes to \\"authentic\\" ethnic foods, this book is definitely not for people like us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Fan","review":"Another cookbook without pictures! I saw this book in the store, but didn't want to get it. I have been going to the Lemongrass Restaurant in Sacramento for the past 3 years. The last time was about 2 months ago. Big disappointment. The food looked good but the taste wasn't Vietnamese or Thai at all (I am Vietnamese). It looked more European. Wonder what she was trying to do? We were not happy with the whole dinner. We decided not to return to the restaurant. I have her first book but haven't used it the past 2 years. For someone who is popular in the Bay Area should do a lot better! I think her cooking is overrated from the SF Chronicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not for me!","review":"My best friend recently gave me this book for my birthday. As a keen fan of Vietnamese cuisine, I was rather excited and could not wait to try out the recipes. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed after my third attempts. The recipes I tried (seafood stew with lemongrass, beef stew with star anise and basil, and braised duck with pineapple) are mostly strongly-falvored, but did not taste too great. In addition, as indicated by another reviewer, the ingredients are difficult to find. This cookbook lacks the pictures that would help entice one to make the dish. If I wanted to look at photographs of a country, I would result to National Geographic, not in a cookbook. As for most the recipes in this book, I find them to be too extravagant and require too much time. This book is definitely not for me. I am glad I did not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"I find this cookbook highly over rated. Frankly, I am not interested in the author's personal stories, which had been mentioned over and over already in her first cookbook. Her recipes require too many ingredients, most of them are not easy to find. In short, I don't find this cookbook useful at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Line cord","review":"The product shipped and arrived on time. There were problems with the product when it arrived and it is working as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great animation, but no originality","review":"Final Fantasy IX starts out as being a completely different experience. However, it is soon apparent that Square was not thinking correctly when doing this storyline. The monsters almost all bear names that have appeared in previous titles, the black mage (though cool) and the Dragon Knight (wicked, but enough is enough) resurface quickly and linger throughout the game. At first it's fun to see these popular themes resurface, but it has gone way too far. The only plus sides to this game that I can think of are: the great graphics and animation and the music (Uematsu has done it again!) Plus the RPG is too short; if you can get an item by beating the game in less than 12 hours, it is too short, ok? No questions asked."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.

The charaters look like kids one of the the charaters is a chicken and the story is bad.

I admit that this is the first FF game I've ever played and that game has got me hooked on all the rest.

Its a triple threat! Trust me...this is a game you do NOT want to pass up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy IX it breaks all standards","review":"this game is by far my favorite Final Fantasy. it breaks all barriers and gets rid of the flaws of it's predesessors. Its graphics are the same as ff8(as if they needed to get better). there is no junction or materia system, it is all item based (which is a good thing). the characters are original and their personallities change and they grow more mature through the game (which is a must for rpg's). the weapons are cool and the spells are just cool to look at(especialy the summons) (leviathan is my favorite). in all this game rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurrah for the FF comeback!","review":"After the horrid disappointment that was FF8, this game has restored my faith in the series. This gripping storyline with amazing gamplay and terrific characters makes for a very addictive game for any serious RPG gamer.... you MUST get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what Final Fantasy is about","review":"I have seen the one star reviews for this game. The reviews seem to miss what the story is all about. It's about life, death, love, and friendship. The story is far deeper then the carp FF8. But what is odd is that it seems that many one star review people seem to have started off on FF 7 or 8.Well that's all nice. But they miss what they other FF games where about to. Life, death, love, and freindship. They also had deep storys to them. FF7 yes it's good. FF8 well let's just say there is no story on less you like Dawson's Creek.You want a great Final Fantasy game with a deep story buy FF9. You want a bad*** bad guy buy FF7. You want Dawson's Creek play FF8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anomaly","review":"Contrary to what some anomalies suggest (You with the 1 star rating), this game so far is the culmination of all the great things that define a Final Fantasy.Don't listen to all the people babbling about it not having an interesting story etc. You buy and judge for yourself. Sure the game is not perfect, but what in the world is? If you enjoyed Final Fantasy 1-7 (8 aside), if you enjoy RPGs, if you play video games at all you owe it to yourself to play this game.And at least this game is intelligent and knows what \\"fantasy\\" implies."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game was awsome","review":"this game was a very good game. the graphics in the cg are sweet. the gameplay is very fun and challening. it was very adictive and out of this world.

The graphics are by far the best in the series, (besides X) and wow, the music! i listen to the music almost everynight on my ipod. i have the whole soundtract. It isn't to hard to beat, and levealing up is pretty simple. You fall in love with the caracters right away. The storyline is amaizng. And might i add, its so nice to have a game w/out guns and all that crap, final fantasy ix takes it back to a simple time, with magic and swords. Set in a medival setting. The characters are unique and just addorable. They have that childish look to them, but are actually very mature. This game makes me cry everytime. i just love it. it is well worth it. And for it to be only 14 dollars, thats amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy IX","review":"Overall, this is a pretty good game. Certain aspecks of it are annoying but others are wonderful. Like being able to cast cure on ALL party members at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"FFIX for the playstation 1","review":"As with all FF games, FFIX provides hours and hours of game play. Although the replay value is not so high (as the story is linear), the game itself takes a very long time to beat. The world map feature in this is game is really where its at. When you set out to explore the continents, the game looses its linear feel (which is a good thing in my opinion). The graphics in this game are bar none - AMAZING for the playstation 1, and no, not just the pre rendered cinematics. This entire game looks amazing, and plays the same. If you like RPGs, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ffix flew the coupe.","review":"If you like rpg's, you should like this game. It's not as good as ff 7, but nothing is. Its much better than ff 8, although it is a little more \\"cartoony\\" than i prefer. I was just glad I was able to find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LONG LAST","review":"I hate my job for one reason. I have to pause the game and put the controller down. The moment i put the first disk into my Playstation and pressed power, I was anxious. My patience paid off when I selected new game. I have played every Final Fantasy game in one form or another, but this one is the best one of them all, hands down. FF7 and FF8 had their pros, but the major con was that it was set in the future. The Final Fantasy universe is great due to the middle ages time and the mythical creatures of that time. A pro of FF9 is that the characters are so well conceived and made that you actually feel their emotions and understand how they feel. The summons are really impressive once again. The magic spells are glorious. There are even some funny events. Best of all, CHOCO IS BACK AS A VEHICLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the Best Game in the Series","review":"I didn't think that anything could beat FF7. When I put the FF9 CD in my PS and turned it on, I immediately knew I was wrong as soon as I heard the music in the opening FMV. The game has a whole lot of character development. Throughout the game you learn more about the character as well as their past. And if you don't think that Vivi is the coolest as soon as you see him, you need to get your brain checked. The music is awesome. It fits the game's medieval style perfectly. I was impressed by the graphics. The characters aren't all fuzzy as in the previous 2 games. Not to say that they were bad but they were just majorly refined and cleaned up for FF9. If you enjoy playing any Final Fantasy you will love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINAL FANTASY 9","review":"THIS GAME IS AS GOOD S IF NOT BETTER THAN FF8.THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THE CUT SCENES IS AMAZING AND THE ENDING WAS BRILLANT.BUT DO BE PREPARED TO SPEND A LONG TIME LEVELING UP SO YOU CAN WIN THE FINAL BATTLE WITH NO PROBLEMS.I WOULD RECOMMEND BEING AT LEAST ON LEVEL 60 BY THE END TO ENSURE VICTORY."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best RPG on PS1!!!","review":"A great game!What more can I say? I can say this much,I've play FF7 & FF8,the graphics in 7 where blocky,the graphics in 8 where fine but 9 is the best!!!! The basic story line is: Zidane,and his bros are hired to kidnap Princess Garent of Alexzandria,but Zidane ends up falling in love with her,blah,blah,blah. The main story line focuses aruond a young(9 year old)Black Mage named Vivi(my faveorite person!). He is discontent by the mystery of his existence and determined to find himself among the emptiness and loneliness that plagues his soul. above all Final Fantasy 9 is a GREAT game with good music,graphics and story lines. So don't take my advice make up your mind by yourself,buy the game!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the absolute best out there...","review":"This game was excellent. The graphics were breath taking. The characters were adorable, and very likeable. The story was touching and memorable. That should be good enough right there.

Final Fantasy game behind number 8","review":"Another great game from Squaresoft. Great gameplay and thousands of side-quests to keep you amused for months. The storyline in itself is sometime so absorbing that when your up at 3am playing instead of studying for your Government final, you forget its a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned","review":"This game owned FFVII so badly. The graphics on this game owned FFVII's. The characters I will have to say is the best part of this game. Vivi is a black mage who I fell in love with. He was so pimp. Running around and blowing fireballs at everyone (You have to get the game for one part with Vivi and another black mage fight in MSV) This game goes back to the 4 players in your party which owns! The characters also aren't so real. They are small looking pimp characters with big heads. Through-out the game the bad guy change, which is awesome because you never know who to suspect next. Another awesome part about this game is that it's hard but not so hard that you have to have a stratagy guide. You will enjoy not having to build your characters so high either. I think I beat it at like level 70 (but thats only because I like to build my characters up) and owned the end guys. Well I don't want to give away more then what I already have to so get the game and own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FF9--back to the basics","review":"FF9 brings back everything we used to know and love about previous final fantasies--the black mages, the summoners, actual character classes, and a great story. Not to knock FF7 or 8, which were great games (especially 7), but there weren't really any solid character classes in them--the materia system in 7 means anyone could do anything. It's a classic reborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Game","review":"I have loved Final Fantasy games for a long time. So when I saw this game I just had to have it. It,s game strategy is similar to the Final Fantasy VIII strategy. A new feature is the treasure hunt game by the chocobo. The characters are humanized animals, which is quite a cute approach. It is difficult and tough to proceed at certain parts in the game, so I stopped playing the game, kind of put it on ice, haha. It is a good game if you can get all the way through. I don't know why they make games so hard to solve sometimes, or is it just me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"it was the first final fantasy game i played and instantly became a fantasy lover.

I thought they had reached their top with FFVIII (which is an ecxellent game), but once more they have proved me wrong. The great thing about FFIX are the brand new cartoon like characters you play with. The main character is not the typical FF leader always so quite and lonely. Tis guy is totally new. Plus, you wont find a game with more sideq quests than this one (probably over 15), and there are some links with previous FF game (Excalibur sword for example). In bottomline, you MUST buy this game. Your gaming life could not be complete without the excellent RPG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the PS1 Final Fantasies","review":"I'm a bit biased because I worked on this game but I really think it's the best of the FF series (7,8,9) on the PS1."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step up from FFVIII, but still no FFVII or FFX","review":"At first, I found myself really enjoying FFIX. I guess thats because its predecessor, FFVIII, was quite possibly the worst Final Fantasy ever made. As the story of FFIX progressed I found it kind of stupid, and the character development was just lame. Still I must say I did enjoy it for the gameplay and not to mention the music. I'm not trying to insult this game as a whole, just its story. If you are looking for a good RPG to play, then I give you the thumbs up to buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"This game is the much awaited sequel to Final Fantasy VI (buy the Anthology and VII too).

Buy this game NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A game for the final fantisy type","review":"This game is great. it has great graphics. awsome people. every person has there strengths and weaknesses. some people do a certin magic ect. it is super long. and doesn't get boring. i guess your thinking wht doesn't it have 5 star?1. there is not that much different magic for final fantisy2. there wasn't enough itemsBut on the bright side there is tons of charectors wich make 1. and 2. even out a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit from SquareSoft!","review":"Wow, I played most of FF8 (I'm on the 3rd disk now) and I tought It was the best game ever, now another great game has came out!! i just got it yesterday, and has rented it in the past, and this game lives up to ff8's expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The plot is Messed Up!","review":"There is only one thing I dislike about FFIX, the plot.

My favorite one is Beatrix. Though when ever you fight her she kicks your butt[which is gonna happen whether you like it or not.]anyway when you get to play as her, you're unstoppable.You get to fight vicous bosses [not including Steiner] but may take awhile to beat the bosses that are not Steiner.But when Steiner gets to learn the SWORD MAGIC stuff, he gets stronger.Try playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 rubbish,this good?","review":"im sorry,but the person who put down number 8 is servierly incorrect.i bought this game when it first came out and took it back a couple of days after due to the firm belief that it was indeed aimed at young children.everything about it was,well,crap.the boss battles were comically simple,with the player left baffled with the limited options you have.attack attack repeat until dead.ff8 was a masterpiece,like 7.there was a plot to it,it just took time to understand,it was more complex.......not a simple 'save the princess' story.the characters in this game were terrible.for children.im gonna pick this up again cheap,to give it another chance,it was years since i played it,but i dont think il change my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Fantasy IX","review":"I have to admit, the Final Fantasy series is amazing!

There's not many bosses in this game and not very much puzzle solving. This game lack any adventure in it. Not many places to explode. I love the final fantasy games, I expected this game be as long as VII & VIII. I beat this game one month.

MUST BUY NOW"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"Okay, so I havnt played this game yet, but Ive seen it, and everyone Ive talked to who has it says its awsome. But the reason Im writing this is to tell people to shutup, I mean Im sitting here looking at the reviews, and I see all these stupid reviews where people give the game one star, and then go on and on about how cool FF7 is and that you should buy that. Well, I own 7, and I would rather see why you DONT like the game than why I should go buy FF7. If you like 7 so much go write a review for it. All Im asking is to see real reviews. Okay thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old but its still way fun!","review":"This game used to be my favorite game ever but now its Final Fantasy X. Even though I don't play it very often I still think the music is cool and I love to face Trance Kuja and Necron. Some people think Zidane is a weak and scrawny person. I don't think that at all. Why, huh, just why!? I would rather smell barf than listen to them! They may seem a little short but thats just because the screen is looking from afar. He is one cool thief! And Dagger...some people want to leave it a suprise to find out her real name but not me! I'm very impatient so here(or look)me out! Her real name is Mary(and that IS true)!I hope you all agree...bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Final Fantasy game!","review":"I really love this game. It is a great role playing game. It has lots of excitement and the graphics are great. I love Final Fantasy IX!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Game!!!","review":"See, I like how Square rebounded from the doomed sin of FF8 to bring this epic to light!! Great storytelling, a love story that won't make you puke, great enemies (and the music!!!!) You have to like the way Kuja talks garbage to our heroes in the course of the game. I also like how the game brings out the summons spells so beautifully and the CG is awe-inspiring. A great way to say bye-bye to the PSone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly The Best!","review":"This is one of the best Final Fantasys yest! I love how it has gone back to its old FF roots of fantasy ONLY! I also enjoy how the job system is somewhat back (with some exceptions). Now only mages can cast spells and warriors use swords...it's great! The characters may look wierd (I like it!) and not be as serious as the Cloud from FF7 or Squall from FF8 (I like it beacuse they aren't nearly as stubborn...Zidane is actually quite outgoing and clever...) but they are certainly a great cast (better than) for the last FF game on the PS console! Also, the game holds a bit more difficulty than the last three games...not that much more though... The game, unfortunately, is more linear than any so far. Where exploration and gameplay lack, the story excells and the FMV's are absolutely incredible. This is also one of my favorite RPG's and Final Fantasy games (FF6 and 7 among others...). A definete buy for any RPG (ANY!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"lost evening but in a good way","review":"I bought this game at 3:00p.m. central standard time, I went to sleep at 2:00a.m. central standard time.

If you're a fan, even if you're not, play this game and you will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of the title...","review":"An excellent game. Graphics were the best of any Final Fantasy game, and the return to a medieval setting was kind of refreshing after the last few FF games to be released. The storyline was a bit linear and flat compared to FF III and VII. Characters' actions were somewhat predictable, however the story remained satisfying. This game was definately worthy to carry the Final Fantasy title and is worth the investment,"},{"rating":"2","title":"My reveiw Final Fantasy IX","review":"Final Fantasy IX is the most weird insane and brilliant final fantasy game yet. The cut scenes are amazing and so is the sheer quality of the graphics through out. The story line is interesting but easy to follow. Vivi is my favourite character but each character has its own backround and emotions about them. over all 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I never really know what to put here...","review":"This game reminded me a lot of Final Fantasy 7. Grant it...the graphics and CG were much better, but the play, IMO, was very similar. There were parts of the World Map that I found rather difficult to navigate, but, as an avid FF player for the past 15 years, I loved it regardless.Still think that this is a must have for any RPG gamer or FF lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First FF I Ever Completed","review":"...again...there's some real issues with the artwork here...oh well...Now that title is saying something because I found that this FF was by far the easiest (Soul cage can be killed just by casting life). But that aside this game is still brilliant.The characters interact with eachother well and when Vivi's friends are attacked that's just as heart wrenching as Aeris ***Spoiler***. Kuja is second evilest villain ever (below Sepiroth) and all the characters have their own individual skills so you don't have to worry about teams being unbalnced. One thing I would say is a disadvantage is the trance system, for some people it's very good (Zidane has some cool dyne moves) but for others it is completely pointless (there isn't much difference between Summon and Eidolon) besides that though the combat system is great.Buy this if you have FF7. If not buy that first as it is the best game to get you into the FF world, universe, dimension etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ff9, the best game yet!","review":"when i got this game i thought it would be boring. then when i played it, WHOA! i thought it was great. the graphics, gameplay, and story is 10/10. i would rate it 9.6 THE BEST. i really think the game is worth [price]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best?","review":"Can someone really say that this is the best Final Fantasy in the series? I'm afraid i cannot. I loved Final Fantasy 7, 8 was not as good as 7 but 9 was better than 7 but not as good as 8. Final Fantasy is played but so many gamers cause of the hype. I love Final Fantasy but I'm going to have to say that when this game is compared to FF7 and FF8 this (disappoints). But if you're a new gamer get this game. If you've played and beaten 7 and/or 8 then get a PS2 and get FFX."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic RPG!","review":"When I first got this game, I thought it was gonna be hard. But suprise, surprise! I beat it!! I have Final Fantasy games VII and VIII but I didn't beat them. FF IX was a little easy for me, but at certin points I got stuck. I think, in my opinion, this is a great game. It's my favorite. But I like the other 2 that I have, as well. The storyline, the graphics and especially the FMV squences are truly fantastic! The ending was amazing! But I'm not going to ruin it. If you are a hardcore Final Fantasy fanatic, I recomend you play this game. Rent it first, and if you like it, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Started playing right after FF8. At first, I didn't like it because FF8 was some what more realistic, so it took a hour or two for me to get use just how different it was. You can't really compare FF9 to FF8 because it is more of a throw back to earlier Final Fantasy's. While FF7 was revolutionary to the RPG world and FF8 showed us the mature and dramatic route Square Enix is going with the series, FF9 was pretty much the last taste of what Final Fantasy was. And let me tell you, the taste was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"this was the 3rd final fantasy game i've played... i have enjoyed every single one so far! this is one of my favorites.. probably second.. :Dthe story is different compared to the other final fantasies but it's still very interesting! really enjoyed playing it again.. after... 7 or 8 years.. really worthwhile! yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from an old school FF Player","review":"To start off, people who gave this game a poor review are obviously not old school FF Gamers... I have had the FF series in my blood since Kindergarten. Waaay back in the days of FF1. I still remember the Thrill of Beating Golbez in FF2, and getting FuSuYa in my party. I still remember the first time I saw a moogle in FF3, teehee, theyre so great. And if anybody out there considers themselves an officiendo on the FF series, then this game is for you. I LOVED IT. It brings back the sense of adventure so many experienced with FF3, god knows i'll never forget it. As for the people who Bashed this game, you obviously started playing FF around FF7. I mean c'mon, complaining about deformed characters? TRY PLAYING AN FF GAME WITH CHARACTERS WHO CAN BE MEASURED IN SQUARE PIXELS AND TELL ME ABOUT DEFORMED CHARACTERS! As for everyone else, get this game and do yourself a favor. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another long nail in the coffin of story-driven RPGs.","review":"If you like your RPGs contrived or if your intelligence and maturity levels are forever arrested at an adolescent age, then you'll surely love Final Fantasy 9. Don't be fooled (though it's obviously too late for that) by this game's deceptive marketing touting a \\"return to the style of early Final Fantasy\\" because the only similarity between this game and, say, Final Fantasy 2, was my feeling like an eight-year-old when playing both of them. If you like overt, heavy-handed, overly simplistic dialog (and most of you bought 7 so I assume that you do), then this game will serve it up for you disc after uninspired disc. Get yourself a Vagrant Story or a Suikoden or some well-orchestrated Baldur's Gate for the PC. Or don't.

I hurried through the game to get to the end so that I could say that I have beat it. I didn't even do the side quests do to the fact that the game sucked so bad. The story line lacked in all areas and the characters were horrible. I am ashamed that squaresoft put a Final Fantasy name on the game. Only buy this game if you are trying to complete a Final Fantasy collection, otherwise it isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite good enough","review":"The series of psx disappointments continues. FF 7 was fun but not really a Final Fantasy game, FF 8 was fun enough to finish (intresting how the limit break system was just a less random one of final fantasy 3/6's) and now 9, well 9 was the first final fantasy game that I will not be finishing. It's sad, but the story is neither gripping nor exciting. The creators tried to recapture the greatnest of FF 6 but failed miserably, the humor is well [bad]. The dialogue is one of the few average parts, and the graphics were just a FF7 and FF8 mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"This GAme...","review":"i hate this game. The Characters are too young- i mean Zidane and Dagger are 16!! also, Zidane is a pretty flat character compared to squall, and garnet is ugly compared to rinoa. and look at the field characters!

Better graphics, etter everything.FF8 Forever :)(:"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the true opinion","review":"I put 1 star so someone would look at mine. I'd give this game at least 4 stars though. Lets face it though, FF7 was pretty good, FF8 didn't exactly match up to the expectation of FF7 and FF9 was better than FF8, but still worse than FF7. The chararcters and story line are probably the only two things that'll frustrate you. The music was okay,but the difficulty of this game was just wrong. It isn't exactlty an RPG if SquareSoft makes a game so easy to beat. But, hey it's Final Fantasy, how can you hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not THAT good","review":"First off, this is not a bad game.

Well first off the graphics: now I will admit the backrounds are great but the characters look like they all had birth defects imagine the character models of ff7 in exploration mode but shiny and slick.The plot: the plot is terrrible, theres no twists theres no turns its so linnear and predicatable you can tell what's going to happen before it actually happens , and the worst part is you don't care about the characters like you did in ff72(the best game ever made).THE GAMEPLAY: this is the worst part in the game, you have to run around getting weapons and putting spheres inside them just to learn spells and the battle system is completely see through.gameplay 1/10 shallow terriblecharacters 0 /10worst characters ever (the main guys a monkey!) plot 1/10 linear terribleif your going to buy a final fantasy first buy 7, then 10,and finally 8"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Final Fantasy Ever","review":"If you've played hours and hours on the other four(five if you count FFIV) Final Fantasy Games, you should probably hate this one with a passion. Not only do they have characters that lack in imagination or creativity, but also in the depth that other Final Fantasies have brought to the table. The monkey man is indomitable, and the wizard role which was made out to be the best thing since the spork was invented was clearly overrated. Personally the confidence and depth of characterism that were displayed in FF7 and FF9 were excellent and made for a game that I will continue to play over and over until I'm old and grey. FF9 was one that will leave with only one feeling for the future: what is FF10 going to be like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good, but FF 7 it ain't","review":"Everybody is always saying how FF 9 is great because it gets back to the roots of Final Fantasy. But this game is nothing like FF 7 at all. It doesn't come anywhere close to FF 7. Its got wacky graphics, and a boring, kiddy storyline, and the combat system in 9 is just way too simplistic. FF 9 is just another stinker from Square, which is what all us super-fans have come to expect. If they don't get it right next time, I will swear off Square games forever. That includes FF 7, so that would effectively be like commiting suicide, because without FF 7, I'm sure I would enter a permanent vegetative state.

Also what happened to the challang of Final Fantasys? This game is so easy, it will take a inexperinced gamer about 50 hours to beats tops. Even the villins suck, like Queen Barhan should be renamed the worlds fattes villin. The magic system is stupid also, only two people can use stuff like cure, while only one person can use destrutive magic.

FFIX has a disjointed story, and all the cliches Squaresoft innundates all it's RPGs with (except FF8). The characters become annoying quickly and there is no real challenge througout the entire game.

I played about 20% of the game before I started getting bored. Played about another 25% of the game before I was so bored I could not keep playing and just gave it up. Never looked back.If I played this one right after FFIII or something then I probably would have loved it. But after VIII this was horrible.

Square did not seem to care and only wanted to get one more game out for PS1. Granted, the graphics have improved since FF8, but the story has not. The plot is dull and starts to jump in the end. The battle system is [poor], consiting of equiping weapons to learn abilities which you activite with x number of spheres. Towards the end of the game, it gets almost impossible to earn enough money to buy the weapons. The bosses are also not very challenging.

Beware older gamers, this is a silly, tiring, annoying complicated Romper Room. FF8 is THE game in the series. To sum it up, I was never in fear of any enemy because I didn't care.

I tried very hard to complete 8 but it kept dragging on and on and I had said enough is enough and turned it off. The same goes for this game too. I suggest to anyone who wants to play a real RPG go get a copy of Everquest and install it on your pc. You won't regret it. It will probably take you 60 hours just to get your character to level 20 let alone the max of level 60. And will take you months upon months to explore the entire map.

A ... little ... with a tail for a hero, a 3-year old looking princess who's the heroine (Garnet, not Eiko - i won't even mention HER), and giant knight with a lot of makeup and a tiny head. One word- childish. There is no story line, at least no storyline that's more advanced than our favorite nursery rhyme. Everything is stupid and childish, and even though the graphics are great, they're completely wasted on this crummy game. Squaresoft, you rule, but this game ...

I can't wait for 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"... those random battles","review":"This game is great besides those borrrinnggg ...frussttrattinngg random battles ...like always!! Square needs to get a clue and develope a fun battle system for final fantasys.Xenogears had the best battle system but Square STILL decides to go with that ... system they use for final fantasys.Besides that, this game is sweet and is worth buying ......and by the way, XENOGEARS RULES!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squaresoft has done it again!","review":"Being a big fan of all the Final Fantasy's I belive that this was just the greatest ever made. Compared to all the others it blows them out of the water. This game is not very realistic but i love it, if you were one of the many people to play Final Fantasy 8 you might think that they are simler but they don't come close. In Final Fantasy 9 everything is very unique and fun to see all the aazing things that people have thought of. The battle system is basicaly the same but I like that not everyone can use one thing everyone has some special thing of their own. This game is a great game to get into and play for hours everyday. In this game there is always something to do form Mini-games to catching chochobos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok Now I'm hooked!","review":"This is the first final fantasy game I've ever played. For some reason the FF series never struck me as interresting from the previews and review I saw and read of them. But I never actually played any of them. I seen this game at Sam's Club for $39.95. I decided to give it a try. And WOW that's the best 40 bucks I ever spent on a game. Although I'm not a graphics person I look more for fun and gameplay(which this has I might add)This has great graphics and eye poping FMVs If you are a RPG fan and are in doubt about FF. Try it you won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate RPG","review":"I never dreamed this game would be so amazing. I was not even a Final Fantasy fan before this.

Like the others IX is not a continuation of VIII but rather a whole epic story in itself. This is a feature by feature review.Graphics: 5/5The graphics in this game are pretty good for a 32-bit system. The most amazing thing is the FMV sequences which have superb realism.Controls: 5/5The controls are easy to master and simple to use.Sound: 3.5/5The sound is good most of the time but sometimes you start hearing funeral music.Gameplay: 5/5The gameplay of this game is much like the other Final Fantasy series. And the battle system is also like the others.Story: 5/5The story in this game is very long and complex and considering that is spans 4 discs make it a very long one also.Overall: 4.7/5This is a really great game and if you are a beginner or an old pro at RPGs you should pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"I feel this is the best final fantasy game. Althouth it is not a break throw like final fantasy 7 was. The big towns, new features,and cool charactors make the game. I mean who does not like a king that was turned in to a frog or a big fat chef whos best attack is to eat the ememy. And if you think the story is not that exciteing wait till you play final fantasy 10. That game is horrable. It sold so will because 9 is such a good game. You wait the new x2 is not going to sell as well as x."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Most people either say that they hate it or they love it as do they with FFVIII. One thing that was good about this Final Fantasy was that it was a little different but with the same characteristics. The characters were a fresh and new idea to the previous Final Fantasy's. Even though it had some of the same principles such as battle system (similar to that of FFVIJ). Overall I think that it has a good story to it, but not the best villan ever. Also it has some pretty sweet action sequences, probably the best on the PSX."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!YES!!YES!!!","review":"I love final fantasy and part 9 is a hell of alot better then part 8!! ff7 is still the best ever but this is how a ff should be buy the game if you loved ff7 because this is like playing it over one more time"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game IS the second best FF ever!","review":"Ok,my friends told me to buy it,my gaming mags told me too,so I finally bought it and found how good it really is.Here are the basics...Graphics: OK regular with really good cineama graphics.Controls: IT'S A RPG OF COURSE IT HAS GOOD CONTROLS!!!!Story line: Kinda forgets the main focus a bit too often.Battle system: Great but pretty stressful for newbies.Sound:Good but repetitive.characters: Good and varied but they sometimes act stupid.Difficulty:NEWBIES!!!DO NOT EXPECT TO FINISH GAME IN LESS THAN 30 HOURS!!!!Note:If you have played FF10 and liked it you may not like FF9."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST!!!!!","review":"I really couldnt believe such a touching story with a fantastic journey could even exist. I LOVE it, it was soooo great! I actually played it 6-8 hours a day cause it was very(and I mean VERY)nice.If you like lotsa adventure, very easy ways to get started in a battle, a cute SAVE POINT,a pinch of romance, smaller romantic stories in one BIG one, a little comedy, then this is THE game for you.I love it so much until that when I think about the story I get all tingly and sad cause I could'nt play anymore.P.s. I losing my patience waiting for the next Final Fantasy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Amazingly Awesome But Recommended","review":"So far this game has been fun. This game is not for the type that can't sit down for more then one hour, because this game is a long one. The graphics are good for when it was made but sometimes it is hard to tell where something is like the weapon shop or item shop. The story in the game is interesting but you need to read almost everything to completely understand what is going on or you will get lost. The one thing I really like about this game a lot is that it still has the traditional final fantasy fighting sequence unlike FFXII (which is still a good game). If I could rate this one out of ten I would give it a eight out of ten. I hope who ever gets this game will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Greatest FF Game Ever","review":"Personally, i absolutely loved this game. it definately makes up for the horrible \\"love-story\\" POS that was FF8. But anyway, the characters and the story are absolutely original and wonderfully put together. The plot is great and theres even a little mini-game where you collect and \\"battle\\" cards. though they dont really battle, its more of a strategic card-placing game where the object is to obtain more squares of your color on the boardthan your opponent. pretty simple, and actually entertaining. This game requires many hours of gameplay, which is great, and is a must-have for any FF fan or just someone who loves RPGs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I think Final Fantasy 9 is a great game. It has the best graphics out of every Final Fantasy, except 10 and 11 because they are on PS2. The storyline isn't as good as Final Fantasy 7 but I still give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay so like almost everyone else, I love this game.","review":"While this game doesn't start you off with a \\"bang\\" it does certainly welcome you with a beautiful intro. I can go on and on about the graphics but you can see for yourself if you decide to rent or buy the game. Like the other Final Fantasy games that has appear on playstation, this game also has mix reviews leaving many wandering if they should buy the game. I say rent it first. For me, I loved the graphics, the storyline, character design ( I just love that SD look!), the characters, and the music of course. But the SD look and the lack of freedom this game offers may turn off alot of fans. So do yourself a favor and rent it! You might actually fall in love with this romantic game."},{"rating":"2","title":"FF9 a great game","review":"Final Fantasy 9 is a much better game than FF8. FF9 is set in around medival times but the game play is pretty much th same as FF 7and 8. It is 4 discs long. The strategy guide is fair but it is still good to have. Of FF,7,8, and 9 FF7 is the best. FF9 is almost as good. It depends on what you like. The one bad thing is the main Character Zidanne. She is a very crudy character. Over all it is definitely worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RPG ever!","review":"I have only evr played ff7 out of the series but when I got this game I knew I hadn't wasted my money.All the characters have their different abilities which you dont need to set using materia which takes a little of the fun away but you still need to build them up to get better movesMy favourite charachter in the game is Vivi(mage) although his physical attacks are the weakest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but not as good as 7or 10","review":"First of all they have to fix something i cant write numbers with the ones that say end and page down/up. Anyway this game is awesome. It doesn't live up to 7 or 11. However it was better than eight even though 8 was the worst ****in RPG i had ever played. The graphics are ok the story makes you crack up laughing sometimes. I just hate the new summoning system. i like materia (7) and the sphere grid (10) better. This is a game that some gamers will get sick of and others play over and over again. It really depends if your a hardcore RPG fan like myself. if so you will enjoy this game. at least rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"i am trying the final fantisy series for the first time and it was very good the graphics were good the weapons varied which was interesting the bosses were hard but not quit the game hardthe storyline was great altogether this game is very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing game","review":"I got this game knowing NOTHING about it.

Its music is meant to be sung. The lyrics are just as important as the music. Kurt's voice expresses so much emotions that you can never get the same experience through the sounds of string intruments. Aside from this, this cd does not have the right arrangement to produce a sound that come close to the original songs meant to be performed. This is another way for some stupid record label to make money off Nirvana's music. If you are a true Nirvana fan, this cd is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming!","review":"I bought this CD on a whim, and I was not that impressed with it. I think it's slightly better than an elevator-muzak version of Nirvana's songs. I think Nirvana's music could be done well in a classical style, I just don't think this CD does that. A good example of this is Christopher O'Reilly's album, \\"True Love Waits\\", which takes Radiohead songs and turns them into classical songs. While it could be argued that Radiohead's music lends itself better to classical music, I think that album picks up more on the complex structure of Radiohead's music...this is a quality Nirvana's music also has, but this music doesn't even come close to capturing that."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Around Great","review":"This is a great CD for Nirvana fans, or just for those who like orchestra.

If you've ever been out to lunch or at a party with someone who wouldn't stop talking about themselves and condescendingly giving you their opinion on every single topic that comes up, then you've already, in essence, read this book. I think the fact that, as of this writing, there are exactly 7,572 other books ranked higher than this one despite her media friends constantly hyping her book tells you all you need to know about how interesting this book is. I'm upset that I spent $$ dollars on it. There's nothing new here you haven't heard her say on Imus or Hardball of any one of a number of places she seems to always be. Believe me, I love politics, but this was a BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, dumb, yet interesting!","review":"How this woman ever got to be a reporter is beyond my understanding. I take it that she is good at being able to spot things that interest the casual reader of Time magazine.

The unfortunately buyer gets a book that in truth merits no stars at all.Carlson's brownnosing of the Washington Post's Katherine Graham is sickening enough without a half-dozen mentions of how Carlson's daughter was married at \\"Kay's\\" Georgetown mansion. Did you catch that? If you didn't, Carlson will remind you.Oh, and George W. Bush made silly faces and served fancy food on his campaign's press plane.

She brags about being a member of the Sally Queen Special Class in Washington. She shows contempt for ordinary people and their concerns. She hated Al Gore because he talked about issues on the campaign plane, issues that effect the lives of millions. She liked Bush because he served lobster ravioli on the campaign plane and made funny faces instead of boring her with discussion of issues. She recycles her columns from Time magazine.

Carlson bucks this trend by inviting us into actual dialogues taking place as decisions are made and implemented.

Not as stupid as it appears to be. The screenplay is smart, even with such lines as \\"You're hot as doughnut grease, babe.\\" That line is a gem.

And when it is not predictable, it is bad. My expectations where low, and unfortunately this film exceeded them. Perhaps in 2001 when this film came out it was worth seeing, but in 2012, the indie comedy has been perfected enough to push this film to the bottom of the must view heap.

I have started rereading all the bookks from the beginning of the series and am reading each one in order. If you have the opportunity, do it. If you like JD Robb you'll like this book. My husband got this book for me for christmas and was worried it wasn't the right one because of it's size. I can read the normal books in about 2 nights, and it's nice to change it up a little and have an easy one night read. No worries, you don't lose any of JD's pizazz. Don't let the size fool you.

I'm a big fan of the Eve Dallas series and this one is no different. Although the story is a lot shorter than usual, the quality, the suspense, and the thrill a minute are still there. I personally don't like to be very specific when I write a review. I'm currently reading \\"Remember When\\", which is a two parter: book 1 written in the present by Nora Roberts, and book 2, written by \\"J.D. Robb\\" in the future and which involves Eve. Unfortunately, I read a review written by a reader in which he/she (?) gave away part of the plot. So, having said that, all I can say about Interlude in Death is that is worth every minute you will spend reading it. However, I do recommend starting to read this series from the beginning with Naked in Death. The characters evolve, develop, change, grow...and you go along for the ride and enjoy every second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome read","review":"Love all of J. D. Robb's In Death Series.

I see there are number of reviewers that have been disappointed and feel the same way I do.I have enjoyed many of Nora's books and I don't like throwing a wet blanket on her writing skill, but still I don't understand why she would release these types of marketing teasers.

Admittedly, they have some issues, but there is just more cohesiveness than I would anticipate. It wasn't terrible though and definitely not enough to skip the book over.

The owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck. Ooooooh! That's so scary. Yawwwwwwn. This book is absolutely horrible. The writing is terrible, the action is missing and there really isn't any mystery. It's not like Nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals. When you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people. Lots of suspense there.

Unfortunately, with the exception of a few songs - i.e. My Obsession, Best Friend, Pop Drone - the album is a major disappointment. If you want to hear a recent Cheap Trick release that rocks, check out their previous album, Cheap Trick 97. Special One is a pale imitation of CT97."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Indeed...","review":"Great album...buy it! Scent of a Woman, Too Much, My Obsession, are great songs. The bonus DVD makes it worth it just for the \\"He's a Whore\\" video.The listener will be treated to a more complex Cheap Trick sound on this album. Robin Zander shows all of his vocal flavors, from hard rock scream to sweet ballad. He truely is one of Rock's most underrated singers. Rick Nielsen gets some rare guitar solos and Tom Petersson has some intricate bass lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid album","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this album. I hadn't even heard of it until recently going through the Cheap Trick discography on Wikipedia. But at a $5 price tag (with a DVD!) it was too good a deal to pass up. Boy, was I surprised. Does it rank up there with classics like 'Heaven Tonight' or 'One On One'? No. But it's really good. Yes, a little heavy on the ballad side, but Cheap Trick are one of very few rock bands that do ballads well, without all the shmaltz and cheesiness that most bands seem to produce when they slow things down. Bottom line, Cheap Trick write and record very good songs. Catchy songs. Hummable tunes. Things you remember. They are not amateurs. They are not hacks. They've been doing this a long time and are very good at it. And this is a very good album. I'm actually a little dismayed that it's so obscure, but then again, it's nice to find gems like these once in a while. A good, solid album. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special indeed","review":"I had read some pretty bad reviews on this CD and therefore had never added it to my Cheap Trick collection. But recently I decided to pick it up on impulse. Man, I wish I had discovered this a long time ago! There are some excellent cuts here, with my personal favorites being Best Friend and Low Life In High Heels/Hummer. The rest is hardly filler with My Obsession, Pop Drone, and Scent of a Woman solid songs. There really isn't a pure dud on the CD. This CD as much as any that they have done showcases the amazing variety of songs Robin Zander can handle.The DVD special that came with the CD also contains some pretty good stuff on it.If there is a criticism I would have on this CD is the order of the songs; I have always preferred the harder and less refined stuff leading off a CD with the more sentimental or softer songs later, and this one does the opposite. But tht is a pretty minor point in an otherwise solid CD from a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Special in its own way","review":"Its no Rockford but it doesn't pretend to be anything Special.This album is enjoyable for a more downsize aproach.Almost sounding alot like Voodoo Lounge from the Stones.I actually had to listen to this a couple of times and boy it grew on me.Hummer is unique in its own way.I think its great....maybe i'm into uniqueness and not boring stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm","review":"im actually stunned by the other reviews to be honest.I was so looking forward to getting this album in the post,and excitedly opened it when it finally arrived.the bonus dvd has some great stuff on it,so i was immediately pleased with that.the album,,,,,NOT so much!To be perfectly honest, if i played the whole thing more than 3 or 4 times all the way through,id be very surprised.it sounds to me like a band out of ideas. honestly. and i love CT very much.so this one is filed under\\"no thanks\\" for me,and there is absolutely nothing special about it.( apart from the bonus dvd;-)Thank god they came back with Rockford,and even stronger with The Latestas i was worrying about them!they are stil tremendous live also!!!!!!Keep On Rockin;-)psyes,im about to dig it out and try and see some of what the other reviewers saw,so wish me luck;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Words\\" can never say too much about this disc","review":"Cheap Trick graces its fanatical following with another stellar follow up to their great Cheap Trick (97) album. \\"Scent of a woman\\" is one of the best Cheap Trick singles released in years. \\"Too much\\", \\"Pop Drone\\" and \\"My Obsession\\" update Cheap Trick's classic sound. The first half of the disc is lighter and more pop oriented than the second half. Starting with \\"Sorry Boy\\" (supposedly about soldiers dying in Iraq according to bassist Tom Petersson) the album takes a dramatic turn and really gets darker. \\"My Best Friend\\" is a monster of a song. \\"If I could\\" starts off with a dance rhythm before returning to the Cheap trick we all know and love. \\"Low Life in High Heels\\" and \\"Hummer\\" are basically two different songs in one.

Cheap Trick is my favorite band in the world, but the new disc sounds very uninspired imo. The hooks are very lacking & the songs are terrible & boring for the most part. I can't see how anyone could find this as one of their better efforts. I listened to it three times & don't even care if I get it back. \\"The Doctor\\" is even 10 times better than \\"Special One\\". The only redeeming songs on this disc are Scent Of A Woman & Words. They need a new producer, not Steve Albini & some help writing some new songs, because it's obvious that the band can't do it themselves anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Trick not what they used to be","review":"I just purchased their new CD and I would love to tell everyone that it is GREAT...but I can't. I was really excited to get their new CD, I have been a huge fan for years, and have met the band on a few occasions.

But I genuinely feel like I just threw 15 bucks away."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's be honest","review":"Cheap Trick are my all-time favorite band, but let's be honest. They ARE still the greatest live band around, a joy to behold, but the music that lives in our hearts, the reason we keep going back again and again, is for Cheap Trick circa 1976 to roughly 1982. Go back, listen to any of the first five albums and then listen with honest, open ears to this new so-called \\"Cheap Trick\\" album. Apart from Robin's voice, you can't even tell its Cheap Trick at all, there's just nothing going on here that sticks to the ribs. Whenever a longtime favorite artist releases a new album, be it the Stones or whoever, there is such fan joy that your heroes are making ANY new music at all, there is a tendency for hardcore fans to praise a really lame, forgettable record. This one is gonna clog up the used and cut-out bins just like every CT release since at least The Doctor. Get it soon for $... just like Woke Up with a Monster and the 1997 self-titled CD...."},{"rating":"1","title":"There isnt anything on this worthwhile","review":"I was really lookin forward to an album thats catchy and memorable but this is just noise nad very boring. I love alot of their older albums even their 86' album \\"the doctor\\" which many felt was garbage I liked alot but this isnt. I am glad they had fun with this one and felt like they didnt have anything to prove which they dont because they are legends and inspired many bands in the 70s,80s,and the depressing grunge grouss of the 90's. However I liked their last last album which was produced by a grunge prducer but this one waiting 6 yrs for was not at all great.

The idea behind this book is to cash in on the Washington Post vault, providing great photos and articles combined with new pieces by long-time Skins beat reporters to tie it all together. Sadly, whoever edited and proofread this thing reeeally dropped the ball. Sentences at the bottom of the page are repeated at the top of the next, photographs are mislabeled, pieces of sentences are missing, words are chopped off in the middle. Probably still of some value for the die hard Skins fan, but a real black eye for the Washington Post. If their newspaper were produced as shoddily, Richard Nixon would have finished his second term."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm??","review":"This album is for hard core Bill Nelson fans only. While composition wise, the musical arrangements are as interesting as ever, the instrumentation (cheesy synthesiser sounds and tinny drum machines - no doubt state of the art in their day)is very early 80's and, I have to disagree completely with another reviewer here, and say that it is very much of it's time and has not aged well at all.

The lighting pattern is very even as other reviewers documented; and although I haven't tested the advertised claim of an extraordinarily long battery life, I don't doubt it and like that feature. Build quality is excellent.For my purpose of lighting up walking paths during the evening, it is a little dim but useable.

The blade mounting is simply dry plastic parts clamped together and spinning at high speed with no lubrication whatsoever.

Apparently, the 64MB RAM that HP uses limits the total capacity to 1.2TB or thereabouts. It is frustrating that HP would try to save on parts that would have cost them less than than a few dollars. This means that in a RAID1 configuration, you cannot use more than 500GB of total storage.If you have no plans to go to higher storage in the future, this seems like a good product. There is a Yahoo group with active discussion that can help sort out various issues.But my own experience has been that my storage needs keep doubling every two years.

A half hour to get it started and then ten to fifteen minutes of play and then all over again and again. My computer exceeds all requirement of the game and still this game really and truly sucks. Not the game but the load time.Spend your money else where or take up sowing. Or read a good book. You will finish the book before you finish this game. Hope this helps.

I assumed after all the complaints about Doom 3 that ID would get off their collective asses again fix the gameplay problems. But here I was again, a rat in a dark maze, killing enemys that pop out in laughably predictable places. Open a door and \\"OH MY GOD\\" there's another one! Ha Ha.

Aurora 7500 with AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor, 1 Gig RAM, ATI Radeon 1800XT video card with 528mb RAM, XP Professional. After I loaded the game and attempted to start it my computer locked HARD, wouldn't even reboot. I tried uninstalling and re-installing with same problem. Contacted Activision and they sent instructions to \\"update\\" my drivers, funny for a computer that was just built. Anyway, I followed their instructions and the results were worse, now I had NO drivers and I had to contact Alienware to get my system running again. I sent Activision an e-mail stating what had happened and all they said is \\"you didn't follow the directions\\". Well, I followed every step and it made things worse.

Always have and always will. \\"T\\" rocks on this DVD. The casual setting at Billy Bob's really showcase what a talented and down to earth performer Tanya really is. The show mostly consists of her traditional country hits. I really missed hearing songs from \\"TNT\\", \\"Tear Me Apart\\", \\"Should I Do It\\",and \\"Dreamlover.\\" With a career spanning some 30+ years, I think a complete retrospective is called for, in fact, I know it is. I would, however, have liked to have seen Tanya perform more of her recent releases. I really missed \\"Soon.\\" Maybe another concert DVD (part 2) is in order! \\"Two Sparrows in a Hurricane\\" was a big highlight, as well as \\"A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be\\", from her latest album, \\"Tanya\\".

Maybe this CD will appeal more to the older generation. I liked the CD, especially \\"Human Spark\\", as much for the Bruce Hornsby and Mark Knopfler influence, as anything. I listen to a lot of CCM, since I program an hour of daily praise music on a low-power radio station. (The show's not cutting edge; but it's eclectic, since we try to appeal to all ages.) The CD may not inspire you to action, but it will help you think about your next step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am typically a MWS fanatic. However, this CD is just... lackluster. None of the songs really grab you like \\"A Place in This World\\", or \\"This is Your Time\\". Even MWS's bread and butter piano ballads seem forced. It is as if he had to crank out a cd to fulfill a studio contract obligation.That said, the messages in the songs are dead on. Smith never has pulled punches and the message is convicting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to Smitty's previous work","review":"I've been a huge Smitty fan and bought all his albums since hearing his 'Live the Life' CD in 1998. I've always been impressed by his work, until 'Healing Rain.' I was expecting something on par with 'Live the Life' or 'This Is Your Time,' and I came away very disappointed. It took me years to get tired of those CDs (and even now I still enjoy them), but only a few days for 'Healing Rain' to get old. It doesn't even compare. A lot of the music is very repetitive, and/or the tune never really seems to go anywhere. It doesn't sound like he uses many real instruments in this one, and the lyrical and musical quality seems uninspired, at best. I like 2 or 3 of the songs, but overall it seems clear MWS just didn't put his heart into this album the way he normally does. I hate to say it, and I'm surprised it turned out this way, but there are a lot of other albums out there that could be money better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and Empty","review":"Slick and clean production, as is typical for a Michael W. Smith album, but ulimately most of the songs fall flat and seem uninspired and empty. Of course, Michael with sell plenty of copies because his face is on the cover. There just seems to be nothing of lasting value to these songs and I'm wondering if Michael will ever get it right. He \\"sings\\" as if he is doubtful he can make the next note. I've listened to album after album of Michael, and I've liked some of the songs, but at least half of them have sounded unfinished or like they were rushed in order to meet a deadline commitment. Michael could possibly be one of the most over-rated CCM artists of our time. Seems like he never found that \\"Missing Person.\\" I admire his personal life and commitment to great causes, but I continue to be baffled by his popularity as an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be a lot better","review":"this guy is no elvis... plus the songs aren't very good... and they lack any soul or conviction. he seems to be going through the motions on this cd. only buy this if you are a die hard fan or you like music that will give you diarrhea."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!!!","review":"I would use this cd for a frisbee!

This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"What more can I add that many have said previously. The script was really bad, the choice of Evi, previously played by Rachel Weisz (and sorely missing), was atrocious. There was almost no chemistry amongst the cast this time around, as if they knew this was a stinker and they were just going through the motions. Another thing, why 7 years between The Mummy Returns and this one? If there is usually such a long time lag in a series, the interest in the series has usually faded or gone away altogether. Typical Hollywood, completely clueless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for the mummy to die","review":"Rick and Evy O'Connell (Brendan Fraser & Maria Bello) go back into action against mummies when their adult son (Luke Ford) inadvertently awakens an ancient Chinese warlord (Jet Li) who is still bent on conquering the world.I enjoyed the earliest parts of this film most. The scenes showing the O'Connells chafing under the boredom of their sedate, wealthy lifestyle are quite humorous. Once the action gets under way, it's just a lot of been-there-done-that. Many of the action sequences are nearly incomprehensible due to chaotic, frenetic editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping the Shark ...

Sets a new standard for \\"jumping the shark.\\"I'm a big fan of Brendan Fraiser, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. LOVED the first two mummy movie.Now I'm an even bigger fan of Rachael Weisz for not acting in this disaster.The script was laughable (as in \\"Ouch! Did they really just say that?!?\\"), the plot was watered down from the second installment and tended to take ridiculous leaps. The entire story insulted the legendary history of China. (I thought \\"The Forbidden Kingdom\\" was better than this pile of garbage.There was none of the humor and wit from the first two movies.Jet Li had too few lines. Maria Bello had too many.Save your money. Skip this dog, and watch one of the first two again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doom of the Mummy","review":"Very disappointed in this installment.

I couldn't, and still, can't get enough of The Mummy, but the 3rd one was cheesy, the humor was forcedm and seemed as though they were tryingt incorporate a bit of Indiana Jones. I'm sure Rachel Weiss read the script and said, \\"No way. This film will cause my acting career to take the road less travelled--to the dump.\\" She made the right choice. It was horribly written, comedy was lacking, and the Yettes. Come on.If I could give it -5 stars, I would. What a waste of 1 hour, 55 minutes of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be buried like a mummy","review":"This film is just so bad on every aspect that writing any further about it would be considered a complement to the film to give it that much thought. Honestly, I think this is the single worst film I have seen out of 1000's. Just where did they dig up that actress who took Rachel Weiss's place? DO NOT....repeat...DO NOT get this film, even if it's free. Yes...it's that bad. The only movie I've seen that is worse than this one is Brendan Frasier's FURRY VENGANCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Cursed!","review":"How can you follow two smash hit Mummy movies (rightfully set in Egypt) with this crap? It would have made for a better film if it were it's own, stand alone story with no connection to the first two.

This disaster of a film is truly cursed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie STINKS!!!","review":"Just another way for Hollywood to screw you! Take a good series and flop the third using the aura the first two created. How stupid can this people be in selecting a completely untalented \\"Edy\\" for this film??? And the son?

I was very excited when I heard this movie was coming and looked forward to seeing it. However, I did not like the \\"new\\" Evy, I enjoy when the same actors play in all the movies. She just didn't do Evy justice. The son was a bit of a joke as well. This was not one of Jet Li's better movies. I enjoyed War and the One, to name a couple, but not here. The movie was action from the get go, which isn't bad, but it just wasn't interesting like the first 3. I purchased this movie counting on it being as good as the others.

We especially liked the terra cotta army of this and plan to use this movie as a reason to set the kids to doing research. I personally liked the yettis best of this. I didn't quite buy the change of wife from the previous movies but the actress was fine. I know they can't always get the same people.

I won't go into the plot since it has been reviewed and critiqued on here alot. What I will say it is a great twist to have the Mummy set in China. Jet Li is excellent as the bad emperor who is now a Mummy in this series. Great special effects, not a bad plot, and decent acting make this enjoyable to watch. Rachel Weisz selected not to be in this movie, her replacement Maria Bello does a good job as the wife of Brenden Fraser in the movie. The special effects are excellent and this is another good movie to watch on a rainy afternoon. Good Fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and unnecessary","review":"The Bottom Line:It's not like the first two Mummy films were great films, but the cast exuded low-key charm and the adventures were fun enough; in the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, by contrast, the cast (conspicuously missing Rachael Weisz) goes through the emotions of the ridiculous screenplay while third-rate CGI dominates the back of the screen and everyone watching the film wonders why they even bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Daniel and Rob Cohen: The Madoffs of movies.","review":"This is a crime against movies. Virtually every frame includes elements stolen from better movies. Everything has been ripped off then re-hashed in the most vulgar, brain-dead way imaginable.The producer, Sean Daniel, has the nerve to name his production company Alphaville, after a landmark movie by French new wave maverick Jean Luc Godard. Daniel and his cohorts should be sued-- not only for creating a travesty, but for trashing the work of so many far worthier creators.Honestly, if it were possible, I'd have Daniel and his director Rob Cohen sent to jail! What they have done here drags what's left of film culture into the mud. These guys are to movies what Madoff is to finance.Karma will get them in the end. It already has: they're certainly intombed in the evil of their own parasitic slime.On the other hand, I feel sorry for the actors-- except that they didn't have to take the money.Hunter Thompson was right: this is a generation of swine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"This movie was a huge disapointment!

Wondered why it was there until I watched it. The script doesn't bear much scrutiny. Very disappointing. I guess they probably won't do another sequel now because this one was so awful. A pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Okay, so I loved the first two mummies and was really excited to see this one, but...what in the world happened?Firstly but not too important, the actress changed.Secondly, what's up with the old English setting, I just wasn't used to it.Now the biggie: the plot line was just all over the place; it wasn't fluid. It's like one thing happens, and then suddenly the scene skips to something completely new. It felt like they were trying to put too much information into one adventure. The plot didn't allow the viewers to get to know the characters enough to really relate to them. There are a few sensitive and emotional moments but they don't last long enough or deep enough for the viewer to truly feel them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this is the worse of the Mummymovies. Maria Bello was horribly cast as Evy. There wasn't any spark orwarmth in the way she portrayed this character she is totallyforgettable. The only reason I watched this movie is because I'm abig fan of Brendan Fraser and John Hannah. If you are the type whoneeds to have the complete series of anything you watch like methen look for the cheapest dvd you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was absolutely embarrassed to have rented this movie to watch with my friends.","review":"There should be a curse to keep the director, producer and writers from ever, ever producing a movie again. I enjoyed the first two Mummies, but this really threw me off. It was as if they handed the story to a 13 year old boy to rewrite. They have Abominable Snowman doing jump kicks and high fives - like white ninja turtles with fur. Then they pasted in lines of cheesy dialog between the scenes of CGI effects. The main characters that you pay to see are in minor roles. The story is chopped together with no flow. For some reason, maybe bribe or ransom, they made Luke Ford a main character. WTH is Luke Ford and what he is doing in a movie that I use to like? Allot of people didn't do their job on this one and someone needs to be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the Scorpion King instead. Yes this is that bad.","review":"Completely agree with the above review, this was a horrible addition to a great series of movies. The new person playing Eve is terrible she doesn't seem to make any attempt to emulate the established character, Alex is too old and despite behaving very \\"English school boy\\" in the second one, growing up in England and having gone to an English University (I am pretty sure it mentions that somewhere in the film), he has turned into an American action hero. Story is near non-existent, action sequences are tame at best, the so called jokes aren't the slightest bit funny and they get Yeti's to help them. Yes Yeti's, I know we are suspending belief here that an ancient Warlord has risen from the grave and now has super powers, but Yeti's?One last thing, it is a bit of a stretch to even call this movie Mummy, since technically the \\"Mummy\\" wasn't mummified."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment !","review":"I own and love the other two Mummy movies but this one was a disappointment. I didn't care for the guy who played the son. I found his monotone thru out the movie to be very distracting. I would have loved seeing more of Brendan Fraser. It seemed that their hearts just weren't into the making of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinema version","review":"I have to agree with all the other negative reviews for this movie. It was a real disappoint and will definitely signal the end of the Mummy franchise. The son is too old compared to his father and the new actress who plays the female lead can't compare to the original. Don't waste your time or money on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring, Waste of time","review":"I watched this movie only because it was my friends birthday party and he can't pick good movies.

This installment however, was nothing like those. The change in cating for evie was horrible. She ruined the movie for me...the entire time I am ticked at rick for cheating on his true love. I cannot say enough bad things about her. Other complaints include a much weaker stoty line and a mediocre acting job by the actor who played their son.

It was nothing compared to the first two. The only reason why I'm bothering to give it two stars is that Brendan Fraser was there. He deservess the stars.

Definitely rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't even be considered part of this series","review":"Let's start with a rather significant actor bail-out on this stinker - Rachel Weisz - who played 'Evie' bailed - her replacement is weak, leaving you going \\"huh??\\" Next, we get this idea that somehow, this is a Martial Arts showcase movie, not the horror-lite, adventure film like it's predecessors. Take all that into consideration and wrap it all into a script that would've been better to wrap fish in and you start to get the idea. This movie stinks - really stinks - worse than \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\" bad. I don't know, I used to think Brendan Fraser had some potential in this genre, but now .... what a lunkhead of an actor.This movie was soooooo bad, that after 45 minutes invested in to trying to figure out where this clunker was going, I gave up, turned it off and watched something more entertaining - like the Weather Channel. Don't bother with this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie that I have seen in years.","review":"I am a big fan of the first two Mummy films. The second was a step down from the first, but both are great and I have seen them many times on dvd. I was very excited to see the latest in the series and made it to the theater on opening day. WOW, what a letdown. The casting was horrible for the \\"new\\" Evelyn and especially for the son. There was no chemistry between Rick and Evelyn. None.The attempts at humor were so unfunny that it was painful. \\"The yakk yacked\\". The action was predictable and poorly executed. The abominable snowmen were bad beyond belief.I almost walked out of the theater after about 45 minutes, but I stuck it out for some sadistic reason.I highly recommend that you don't waste your time watching this junk, but if you must see it PLEASE rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This movie was a big let-down. I LOVED the first two Mummy movies in the series and could watch them over and over. This one was written so bad that the lines could be laughed at throughout the entire thing (and I don't mean the comedic lines). The wife is a different person and is awful, son talks like John Wayne and is too old compared to the years that went by, and Jet Li was barely in the movie/had any lines. The special effects in this movie were mediocre in 1995 and that's saying something. The story of it completely broke off from what it was in the first two. The wife has no connection to her past like in the second one whatsoever. I would not recommend this to anyone that loves the first two. If you don't want to ruin the series and have not seen this movie, then don't even think about watching this. I have never been so disappointed in a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing : (","review":"I am a big fan of the Mummies...up until this one. I tried to prepare myself for the fact that Rachel Weisz wasn't in it...unfortunately I guess I wasn't prepared enough.

The first one was ok cause it was different. Then they made it two more times. This time with the nakedest woman in movie history, Maria Belo (sp?) (not naked) playing the Rachel Weisz part. And like every other franchise that goes on too long that add either a young side kick or a kid of one of the moron main characters or both and usually it is Shia Labeouf or some Shia wanna be ya. This movie is stOOpid and unorigional. It is like watching a rerun of the same movie for the third time. I would rather see Brendan Frazier do George of the Jungle 10 at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Unwrapping, 1.5 stars","review":"The first Mummy movie was enjoyable. The second ok, this one is just a DUD!Brendan Fraser doesn't even seem to be the main character anymore, the story is more about his son.

I was bored 5 minutes into the movie. The humor was flat. The twists predictable. The villian stupid. The graphics annoying. The chase scene silly.Not a movie I recommend unless you just love the series and have to see them all. Warning - you may not like the series as much if you watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on par with the other Mummy Movies","review":"While I loved the first two Mummy movies, the plot for this third instalment seemed thrown together just to milk the franchise for more $$$. Rob Cohen took the directors chair from Stephen Sommers and it shows, big time. The special effects for the whole movie were as bad as they were for the end of the Mummy Returns. The Yetti looked totally CG and the signal they made of \\"field goal\\" made my laugh and shake my head at the same time. I wish they had written a more compelling and historically accurate story than this one as it was ALL action and had plot holes big enough for a tank to drive through. The suspense of the first Mummy movie is what made it so popular. Unfortunately, this third instalment had practically NONE. Overall it was very disappointing and definitely NOT worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Mummy Movies","review":"I'm a diehard fan of The Mummy, and even liked the oft-maligned The Mummy 2. I went into this movie having ignored the trailers and reviews and was incredibly excited about it. Much to my chagrin, it was not only the worst of the Mummy series, but also one of the worst movies I've seen in years.Not only would I suggest avoiding buying this movie, I wouldn't even suggest renting it. If you're new to The Mummy series, stick with the first two movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a shame. I was a big fan of the first 2 films.

I baught this movie for my wife because she was unable to see it in theaters.. and i am glad we didn't waste the money. The magic from the other two movies was completly lost in this movie.

Add in to that way to much soap opera drama not enough of the humor that made the other 2 films great and to top it all off there was no coheasion between the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"It completed my 3-disc Mummy set.

It is not as funny and you don't like the characters as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad...","review":"I was a huge fan of the first two Mummy movies. When I found out this was coming out, I was very excited. Let me first start by saying that I hate it when they have a trilogy with different actors/actresses playing the characters. (Evelyn) Other than that, the acting was bad. The story was very brief and shallow. The best part of the movie was that some parts were so bad that they became laughable. Again, I am still a big fan of the first two. This movie just seems like they threw this together and did not work on it very much. It might be worth renting for Jet Li's martial arts but that is about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"A cross between a B-Grade 50's picture and a boring cartoon movie.

Rachel Weisz is gone, Jet Li sleepwalks through the role (with what little screen time he actually has), and the plot is very predictable. Save your money, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I also thought this movie was very disappointing. While I liked the first 2 Mummy movies, I thought this one fell very short. First, they replaced Rachel Weisz with Maria Bello without even an explanation, and boy is she a bad actress. Then the moments between Frazier and his son, also replaced for this movie, were hard to stomach, let alone seem believable. Maybe if Jet Li was given more of a role this movie might have been better? What sealed the deal for me on how crappy of a flick this was? Probably when the abominable snowman kicks a field goal with one of the bad guys and the other yeti signals \\"its good\\" with his arms. Save your money and if you're dead set on buying this movie, at least rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Widescreen)","review":"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Widescreen) is the third movie in the series and it is painfully bad. The plot is a joke. Bredan Fraser phones in a lame performance and the replacement actress for his wife try as she might the chemistry is just not there. The first two movies were full of fun, wit and good adventure. This move is nothing short of a travesty. Pointless violence, a plot written by Dr Nick Riviera from the Simpsons or maybe even Homer himself, shoddy acting. I was so disapointed considering that the first two movies are good enough to watch again and again. This one I will avoid att all costs. 1/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have been made.","review":"Without Rachael Weisz, this movie shouldn't have been made period. I was so disappointed. It's completely obvious to me that if Weisz refused the script, you either change it to her satifaction, or don't make the stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was not in the same class as the first two Mummy films. The story line was decent but the acting was poor. The chemistry was missing between the actors and it was very disappointing.They need to find the first Evie and bring her back. She added much to the first two movies. She was an intelligent klutz in the first films, which added dimension to her character. This one doesn't fit with Fraser very well. The characters were not well developed and it just didn't do the film justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adition To The Series","review":"The 3rd instalment of the mummy series is a good adition but i think they should stop where they are before they ruin it.

This release is a totally successful alternative to the freer direction that jazz was moving toward in the 60s with Ornette, Cecil etc. McLean knew that he didn't want to go that far, but also that he had to find his own way to move on. Together with other like minded players - Andrew Hill, Bobby Hutcherson, Joe Henderson for example - they forged what at the time must have sounded like a compromised version of the \\"new thing\\", but today makes you wish that more players had worked in this area which cooly and intelligently adds to the jazz tradition in a very measured way. McLeans's alto sound is sour and fantastic, making him a direct predecessor to Roscoe Mitchell to these ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome back this edition!","review":"eventually blue note decided to reprint this fantastic cd! unfortunately there are no extra tracks, but who cares? this wonderful cd is really a golden one. every Mclean fan should know this music, so you don't deserve many words. buy it and be joyful."},{"rating":"1","title":"jargon overrides fidelity to the primary texts","review":"Mr Baucom likes the falsely scientific vocabulary of theory so much that he both occasionally says the obvious in a way that sounds precious and also sometimes follows the logic of a wrongly framed argument far away from the primary text he purports to discuss.For example, instead of writing the obvious fact that maps were important to the Raj, the reader finds this: \\"Within that archive, the map occupies a position of privilege.\\"A few paragraphs later, the reader learns that Kim's becoming a British intelligence agent somehow erases Kim's identity as the little friend of all the world. Kim is then resurrected as \\"the zombielike R17.\\" Nothing can be further from the actual depiction of Kim in the novel. Kim's identity as a British agent remains as vivid as it was before he takes service with the Raj and his devotion to the lama as intense. And even at the book's opening Kim unwittingly enforces British dominance in bullying an Indian child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempted...To Throw my Kindle Down","review":"the troubles between the two main characters seemed to drag on and on and on.

I was disappointed with this film it was too fake. And had way to much of Novack naked. None of the original jackass crew are in this film. It was like he just wanted to promote his record label and bar. The only good scenes where of Finland and HIM. Andy Mcoy of Hanoi Rocks fame was so drunk he could barely talk very sad. All in all this was not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scripted waste of time","review":"I'm quite surprised to see so many glowing reviews on Amazon. A quick Google search reveals unending amounts of harsh criticism. I got this expecting something like Jackass or Viva La Bam. However it's quickly apparent that nearly everything is strictly scripted.. It's just not believable. Even though Viva La Bam was somewhat scripted it still felt far more spontaneous and improvised, and Don Vito was hilarious! But this is a tragedy of which alcohol couldn't even fix.There were only two scenes that I genuinely enjoyed. The first was when they picked up a guy, pulled down his pants, then blasted snow up his butt with a snow blower. The other was a 5 second scene when Collette De Benedetto steps out of a hot tub. Snow enema, hot girl, that's it!This seriously had epic potential but completely fails as a result of their use of a lame, unbelievable script instead of a more reality based production method.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally... not a fan.","review":"There are plenty of other reviews which explain the plot very well.

I would have been much happier watching it for free. Its not to say its the worst thing ever, as it did have its good moments, just not really what I was hoping for.My friends hated it WAY more than I as they were expecting basically another Jackass movie, which it really is not, saying its just too forced and disingenuous. Their top 3 favorite things about the movie (and basically the only three things really) were:1: Bam's woman in bed in panties2: The map of Finland tattoo3: Andy McCoy from Hanoi RocksI'm not saying \\"do not buy this movie\\", just that you may want to check it out as a rental.

The casts were a bit different depending on the era, but there was a stable core to the friend group that lent some enjoyment to watching them act like idiots. To a certain extent, the old material felt real and honest - it was alot like they'd just taken a camera along while they were goofing off.But this new material is absolutely nothing of the sort. Bam's new friends are all complete idiots and self-absorbed jerks, and the show is so scripted and edited that it's basically just Reality TV (tm) for mook-addicted MTV flunkies. \\"Bam's Where is Santa?\\" feels fake, contrived, forced, drawn out, artificial, planned line-by-line, etc. It's joyless and not funny. It seems the days when Bam (and company) was fun to watch are long gone.They need to go back to the beginning and be real again, or quit making TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read","review":"THE NIGHT REMEMBERS reminded me a bit of the movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\".

The paperbacks tend to bend and distort the images and it is much more pleasurable to view the depth of the images when the photo itself is rigid. Look for page size. This book has a good page size and you can move the photo in and out to arms length with certain images will have an apparent depth of up to 8 feet. One book, recommended by another reviewer on this page, I own in a paperback with small pages, yes the artwork is excellent but the depth of the photo appears to be 6-12 inches in most cases.

We are constantly being smothered with new filmakers trying to recapture the original vibe of the above mentioned film. This film put me to sleep. Do not waste your time. The Texas remake in 2003 is far better than this if that tells you anything! Cameron should try to make an original film based on new ideas. Pointless gore and horrible music. Better luck next time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"DADDY'S DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Horror icon George Romero's son Cameron doesn't fare so well in this thrill-less thriller. Horrid acting, an illiterate script and inept direction make for a disastrous film.A real time-waster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie was AMAZING. Cameron Romero out did himself on this production. The horror in this film was extremely intense, this film is not for the faintest of hearts. TRUE HORROR! Definantly an EXCELLENT buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the (fake) hype!!!","review":"I am going to assume that the reviewers are family or friends. If not, they need to see more horror films.I'll just give you the lowdown in a few points.Story-Several young people are walking through Virginia in 1969 and meet up with a crazy family. There is a little more to the story but that is the setup. Wow, original!Acting-It wasn't completely horrible since they mostly talked for the first hour.Gore-Nothing happened for the first hour and then there were maybe two decent scenes, but nothing you haven't seen if you've watched any torture-porn type movies in the last 5 years.Scare factor-Zero! I don't know what else to say. There was no tension whatsoever. I swear that there was more tension and suspense in a Disney movie. I am not kidding!!There is more to complain about but I'll just leave it that Cameron Romero should stay away from making movies and leave it to his father. I haven't liked all of George Romero's films but he knows what he's doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge disappointment","review":"Just finished watching this movie, as a matter of fact the credits are still rolling, and I must say I have not seen such bad acting and horrible plot in some time. I was so excited to see it after all the hype I read about it, and being such a fan of camerons father, I thought how could I go wrong. Well was I duped. I wonder if the vidoe store will give me my []back. The amazing thing is that 6 veral young adults cant fight there way away from an elderly woman in a wheelchair, an obese woman who cant take 10 steps without running out of breath, and her half wit son. Seriously, how stupid do they think we are. My Recomendation..... Dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and poorly edited derivative gore nonsense!!","review":"Every cliche you associate with the Crazy Redneck Slasher genre is here in this movie. The sexed-up hitchikers, the broken down truck, the mentally challenged son, the meat hooks and the dirt-poor overbearing extended family who just might be having you for dinner if you dont stop running round in circles. I personally have seen all this before and better told. Because the movie was so obvious I kind of wondered why Cameron Romero bothered? Its tired and jaded and didnt get a cinema release in the UK. Also there are huge plot holes and inconsistencies. I would say avoid!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad...","review":"Kind of a 70's throwback, and of course it is pretty well a texas chainsaw rip-off,but really a decent flick, especially considering the garbage that passes for horror atyour local cinema.

I blame the writer. Has some decent effects in the gore aspects and the camera work through these scenes is decent. Also decent panoramic work of the country side.The worst is the plot.

There is no close to the story if that is the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"The apple falls far","review":"I saw this low budget attempt at horror and was very disapointed. This film is so slow and feeble I had trouble sitting through it. I had thought that maybe G.Romero would have helped his son with the artistic side of film making but alas he was obviously busy elsewhere when his son made this movie. Boring, slow, bad acted, poorly directed. Stay clear of this rip off of a movie.

Other than that though ...As far as bad points go, there is practically no insight into the characters of the crew or the aliens. I will go as far to admit that I admired the author's style of writing, and it would have been a good book if it hadn't been so MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING!I could tell from the start that this was not going to be one of TNG's best offerings, and unfortunately I was proved right.

I would even say that \\"Battle Angels\\" by itself, with its crazy rippin' guitars and mad vocals, is worth buying the CD for. Listen to this CD if you like hard and angry metal that's awesomely well done. It's got variety and great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found!","review":"My daughter got it from her father many years ago, and that was the only thing he ever got her and I was looking for all over the place to get her a new one, and here it is, soo happy!

I prefer these side-loading harnesses over the downward-facing ones the pros use. These are more accessable if you need to stay a smaller target. I tend to stay right at the edge of my cover and find that these help you pull your pods without making a \\"fly-away\\" with your elbows reaching behind you for the vertical pods. Camo helps with the woodsball fields, obviously, but I don't like the fact that most of the harnesses only house a 20 oz. tank; what about a 48+?! Some of us HATE to run out of air on a big match. Still, the holster for the tank is a little goofy and I'm not that sure how secure the tank is in there during play. I feel it COULD relieve itself of its place in the harness. I also dock it points due to its quality in manufacturing. Still, this was the best fit for what was out there when I shopped, and it will do fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author is trying too hard.","review":"I've now read 2 books by this author, & I think she creates overly elaborate romances based upon really unrealistic plot devices. I think she could write a good Harlequin if she'd only simplify her plots & make her characters less flat. They don't have any distinguishing characteristics; it's just about unbelievable sexual attraction. You can have that in a Harlequin but Geez, give the characters something else too. Otherwise it's a waste of time. This book: it's dull and slow.

I found myself looking to other parents for practical evidence of how to be a better dad. There is one man in particular who had perfect kids, and perfect house and, well you know the rest. I got a lot of good ideas from watching him with his children.Later I ran across this book, and it put into words the very same things that I saw him DO.It wasn't until about 2/3 of the way through the book, as I was incidentally recommending to a friend, that I noticed that my \\"good example friend\\" appeared on this cover.

However, I have two books that I would never have purchased if I had not had to - Editions 7 and 8 of Educational Research. This is a mind-numbing traditional textbook. The authors write with an officious, academic style. While they have tried to incorporate qualitiatve research into their work, the positivist bias is so strong that it comes across as condensending. Also as an older learner, I find the type set and page layout difficult to read. There are so many better books, I would not buy this one if you can avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forest Cello Mello","review":"I have long been purchasing stuff from Solitudes before getting to know that Dan Gibson was the man creating the peaceful ambiance.This album is fantastic. The music isn't mindless, but it is thick enough to enjoy the cello lines and the musical progressions are predictable and comforting. The reason I bought this was for my massage therapy business, and I find myself listening to it long after people have gone home. Being in South Philly it is fantastic to hear all these woodland birds and the different water sounds Dan has collected. Very worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing and peaceful","review":"This CD is lovely. It's mainly cello but also has a piano accompaniment.

The only reason I'm giving it one star is to bring awareness to a possible danger with the saffron tea he recommends. I bought the saffron tea and tried it for the first time last night. I woke up an hour later with an itchy body, hives, and swollen hands, head and lips. My lips were severely swollen. Thankfully I woke up when I did and was able to take a ton of antihistamines. Im still swollen as I'm writing this but thankful that my throat didn't swell shut last night. I googled saffron allergy and found that it is a known allergy and listed my exact symptoms. I'm sure there are probably plenty of people that are fine drinking it but please proceed with caution when first using."},{"rating":"2","title":"An alternative way running out from drugs","review":"This is a good book that helps everyone in replacing drugs with natural psorisis treatment.

My husband is a physician and was skeptical of me trying this diet out, but said that he would support me. The problem with this diet is that there are too many \\"loop holes\\" in which Dr. Pango can say, \\"well, you didn't do this\\" etc. I read the book, multiple times over, took notes, and still found it impossible to figure out exactly what I was supposed to be eating on a regular day. As with most forms of deception, this book is confusing and contradicting at points. It is aimed at people who are desperate and willing to try anything. I ate grapes for three days, took spoon fulls of olive oil, enemas, everything - nothing worked.

It would be wonderful reading even if you did not have Psoriasis or Eczema. I just can't wait for his upcoming cookbook, Dr. John's Psoriasis Cookbook...Plus which should be out soon. This will certainly make it easier to keep us all on the regimen and eating the right foods.

I was always a bit uncomfortable reading aloud a few of the traditional verses -- \\"she whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed\\" -- is an especially alarming example. But adults don't always give children enough credit; many generations have mentally sorted through these verses with no lasting harm.

Although I would not trust the cloth pouch to carry the thing under any stress. Pouch is just to keep the dirt stuck to the shovel blade from coming off in your pack, but I doubt it works very well.

It does, just be sure to continue to \\"unscrew\\" the locking mechanism, and it locks the shovel in place just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Emergency Shovel","review":"Very stout.

The quality is sub-pare, and the mechanism to lock the handle in place for use is flimsy and the handle stays loose. The canvas pouch is just a bit thicker than a standard cotton pillowcase, and like the shovel, does not look as though it will tolerate any abuse. The blade is of a heavier gauge of metal, but whether of cheap iron or good steel, its hard to say since it has a coat of green paint on it.I purchased two of these shovels, one for the car and one for the pickup, and both shovels and pouches I received have the same lack of quality. I really was not surprised to find that they had been manufactured in China, not Michigan."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong solid steel design","review":"I would recommend the seller, item shipped quickly and arrived fast.

I read this in light speed. It was definitely not worth the price for me. I found about two sentences that I highlighted and then I stuck it in an envelope and sent it on. It's a lightweight by comparison with other books I've read for inspiration, or as antidote to being blocked.

It is almost as if you are \\"a fly on the wall\\", ease-dropping on two icons of \\"the lost generation.\\"The settings are superb and the opening scene of Stein and Toklas proof-reading one of Stein's books is amazing!A must for anyone interested in the literature and art of the 1920s and 1930s.Also the interview with the director on the DVD version provides some fascinating insights into how the script was developed as well as how the movie was cast and made.A must-have for anyone interested in this literary period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent christian fiction","review":"I am a \\"left behind\\" groupie and was looking for something to fill the void til the next book in left behind is released.

About as intellectually rigorous as the 60's phrase \\"Oh, wow, hea-vy, man!\\", this book becomes somewhat disturbing as the knowledgeable reader becomes increasingly aware of its shortcomings in dealing with some of the outright criminal activities of the more violent politicos and certain outlaw \\"allies\\" such as the Black Panthers street gang. Too bad. Some of us Berserkly types learned a lot from the movement, including the important reasons for its failure.

The rubber had to be scraped off with a razor blade and the suction cup became useless because the surface was damaged and irregular due to half of it peeling off. My brother also had the same thing happen with his Nuvi. Garmin is aware of the issue, in both cases they promptly replaced the unit without question. Good customer service! My advice, don't leave it on too long, or if you do, don't try and take it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got what I wanted","review":"I bought a Garmin suction cup mount.

Three reasons,1) they don't insulate well. The 3M ones my father uses in his house do a 10x better job than these.2) the tape isn't sticky enough and the drafts will peel the tape off. I had to use painter's tape to seal the cover on.3) they don't shrink hardly at all. The shrink rate is very minimal, so there is no real shielding effect. The 3M product seems to shrink twice as much.Don't waste your money on these, either here or at Home Desperate.I'll find a better product next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"Frost King insulation seems good for only one thing - working anybody trying to install it into a flying rage. The plastic is fine - it's plastic, whatever. The tape, though, is not anywhere near up to the job of holding the plastic together. Every time I've finished installing a window covering, the moment the wind picks up, the plastic billows up and a corner or side blows out. The tape simply won't hold the plastic well enough. This might be fine if your windows are already air-tight, but then you probably wouldn't need plastic sheeting over your windows, would you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape not sticky enough!","review":"After reading the comments by other reviewers, I still decided to buy the Frost King product because it was the only brand offered at my local Lowes.

Needless to say I will be returning and repurchasing another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tape does NOT work!","review":"The tape that comes with this is CRAP! And I didn't just get a bum roll, because I bought an extra roll, and that tape didn't stick either. You could barely tell what side was the sticky side (before removing the tape backing) and it didn't hold the film in place. I ended up having to use packing tape, which will leave one hell of a mess, but we're replacing the windows next summer anyway, so I won't have to do the clean up. It's very frustrating to put this much time into a project and have it fail so quickely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape Unwilling To Stick To Surface","review":"I rarely review products such as these, but I did buy this product at my local Home Depot.This is the first year I have had to winterize my windows, and I thought that because this was the only product for sale at a place like Home Depot, I would be buying the best product for my needs.Upon trying to get the tape that came along with the package, it would not stick to the surfaces around my windows. Unwilling to give up too soon, I continually tried to get the tape to stay in place. I finally had gotten the tape to marginally stick around the window, only to visit again in 15 minutes to have all fallen from the wall.I can't imagine the tape being strong enough to hold the plastic in place throughout the entire winter, so I went and bought some 3M double sided tape.After this year, I know that I will no longer rely on any other product beyond the 3M brand in the future. I can't imagine I will have the same issues as I have experienced with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat poor quality but not totally useless","review":"Yes, the tape doesn't stick too well, especially the outer layers of the roll. Also, separating the tape from the backing is a torturous process; I don't know if the other brands have come up with a way to do it better. The plastic is very hard to cut as well. However, I did manage to get the tape reasonably adhered (by firmly and continuously pressing on it) and the plastic stuck to it. I can honestly say that it seems to have worked. Because it's been such a mild winter, it's hard to say definitively, but on cold days it seems like the temperature in the room is a couple of degrees higher than it would have been without the plastic sheeting, and that means a lot to me in terms of comfort and fuel savings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it! Tape doesn't stick worth beans!","review":"I've filmed hundreds of windows. And compared to the 3M product, the Frost King window film has a BAD ODOR! In other words, IT STINKS!!! For starters the tape won't adequately adhere either to clean surfaces OR to the film, which means shrinking it with a hair dryer is impossible, it simply pulls off. The film isn't nearly as clear as the competitor's product, which comes out absolutely invisible if done correctly. Nor does the film shrink as much or as easily as the competitor's film. I just made the mistake of buying this brand again (because it was all the big box store had in stock) and immediately regretted it. Sometimes a higher price DOES indicate a better product.

Therefore I have wasted my time and money, hoping to seal my windows over the holiday break. This product is completely useless to cover any window I have. It would be useless to cover any window in any house in my neighborhood.

In the past, the tape rolls were more than enough and I always had left-over tape. When I started covering windows this year, I started out with last year's tape and those windows are holding up fine. However, ALL of the window insulation I've put up using the new tape has fallen off by the next day. It is VERY frustrating and I feel that I've completely wasted both time and money.

I cleaned the edges of the windows, waited for them to dry, applied the tape, used a hairdryer to increase the stick factor, and waited 15 minutes before applying the sheeting. I only applied the tape on the metal window casing as it says to not apply on painted plaster and that's all I have around my windows.However, within a few hours, the doublesided tape was pulling away from the casement in several areas on all three of the windows. I had to try to tuck it around and stretch it to the nearest surface that it would reach, as once you shrink it, it isn't unshrinking. Now at least 1/3 of the sheeting has pulled away from the frame and my money and time are down the toilet.

I'm afraid I'll be heading to the store to buy 3M tape after the first winter storm pops the plastic off the tape. Perhaps people complained about the difficulty of taking the tape off and they weakened the formulation. I switch between 3M and Frost King depending upon which retailer has either out faster. 3M is the best hands down if a bit pricey. IMHO it's worth it.

Most of her advice is based on appealing to men in a very general sense (most men prefer long hair and stuff like that), so if the man of your choice isn't typical, then you would ignore some of that information. The best parts of the book are: her list of questions to ask a man to find out if he is the man for you and her advice on when and why you should move out of a live-in relationship.

I got rid of it years ago, but I think that enough of it sticks in my mind that I can write a review. One of the techniques she recommends is transference, which seems dangerously close to practicing psychiatry without a license. She seems fixated on jewellry, particularly religious jewellry. I actually wrote to her and asked if religious jewellry is such a turnoff, why do people think Madonna is so sexy? (This was in the eighties, remember) Of course she didn't reply. What really upset me about this book is the demeaning attitude toward men. I guess that I'm too much of a romantic for such calculating approaches.

I almost threw the book out the window when she says that you shouldn't make him wear a condom unless you are worried about sexual disease. When shouldn't you be worried about sexual disease?

Act like it's 1950.If you follow these simple steps, you'll be sure to land a husband, but he's most likely a jerk, and then you're stuck in a miserable marriage. Good Luck!Frankly, I cannot believe this stuff went over in 1984. Another reviewer called this demeaning to men, but if you read this book, you will not believe how it demeans women.Maybe, if you're a gold digger, this is a good book for you! Perhaps it was a bestseller in 1984, since there were so many wealthy bachelors seeking a trophy wife.

No other characters are permitted to develop more than one or (maybe) two dimensions or interact with one another -- only with Reigert An outstanding cast that includes Eli Wallach, Isabella Rosellini, Rita Moreno and others is largely wasted in shallow, second-fiddle roles (although they are all solid pros who make what they can of the goofy lines they are given. Wallach particularly makes the most of his character).The story actually starts off reasonably well, but begins to fall apart about 40 minutes in, after which it devolves into a series of random, inexplicable scenes that show a lack of thought or planning.

I assumed -- unwisely -- that given the Bose brand and high price tag, that the sound quality would be wonderful, or at least average. As the other reviewers have noted, the midrange on these speakers are terrible -- a full 1/3 of the sound is missing: e.g., background vocals are frequently inaudible.The industrial design is beautiful, and the interface is friendly, but not worth the extra cost. For audio purists and anyone who wants value for their money, you'd be better off with another speaker system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bose Companion 3 is AWESOME","review":"I just received the Bose Companion 3 speakers today, I hooked everything up which was really easy, took about 3 minutes, and hooked it to my iPod.

Seriously, I love them and will keep them forever (until Bose comes out with more computer speakers in the future)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"They sound pretty good.

The bass thumps even at the lowest setting. Play it at a reasonably mellow low volume, and you'll notice how irritatingly tinny the satellite speakers are. People who complain, \\"no highs no lows, must be Bose\\" are dead wrong about this set. I say where is the mid range? Where's the mellow warm tones? I hate what this does to my music! Plus the speakers cut in and out. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"These speakers, like other Bose products, sound amazing in the store but not so much at home. I even have a great sound card installed on my computer but these speakers still lack mid-range. They sound hollow and get distorted when turned up loud. The subwoofer volume controls the bass on the sub as well as the speakers. If you turn the sub down low, there's no base in the speakers. These would be great speakers for the casual music enthusiast but unfortunately they wouldn't be spending $250 on speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"$250 Bose Companion vs $100 Altec Lansing 251","review":"These are great little speakers, but they are way overpriced.My roommate has these and I've listened to music with him many times.I myself have an Altec Lansing 251 surround system. It was $100 when I bought it (Seven years ago!), and you can get it for $50 now. My old Altec Lansings produce a much better overall sound (especially midrange) than these overpriced Bose.I will admit, the puck does make me a little jealous because it's very fucntional and very cool looking. The Bose are also better constructed than Logitechs or Klipsh. But if you're looking for sound quality, go with Altec Lansing, or Klipsch Pro-Media 2.1If my Altec Lansing 251's ever had a problem, I might consider buying the Bose. Since they haven't, I haven't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bose- low quality for high prices.","review":"Well, the time when BOSE name was associated with good sound came and gone. As for now it is company who sells crappy speakers for reach guys. In fact you can get the speaker s that sound much better for third of the price but they will not be such beautifully slick. For the price you can get pro sound from Samson, M-Audio, Fostex Alesis studio monitors. This set has bad everything. It has dirty bass, poor midrange (near not midrange) and flat and dull highs. Yes it is slick, but there's no sound.To have the sound you need the space where the sound could resonate, that's why people buy larger speakers with invertors. It is simple like that: no resonance - no sound!If you have the extra money to show off with BOSE brand buy those. But do not forget to save some money to buy a good speakers along to listen to music after your friends will read the label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware..","review":"Before you buy these listen to comparable product from Logitech, Klipsch, Altec Lansing and Cambridge Soundworks to name four. If this Bose product was priced around 100 bucks I would be a little more forgiving. It isn't though and the sound quality is shockingly bad. No highs, no lows (must be Bose!), not even a reasonably accurate midrange. Shame on the Bose corporation for marketing yet another overpriced, under performing product. I would encourage anyone in the market for a good pair of desktop speakers to listen to the brands I list at the top of this review. The quality of desktop speakers has risen to a very high level in the last couple of years. Amazingly, the Bose corporation's arrogance has once again produced yet another embarrasing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced/ sub-par performance","review":"I bought these speakers because of the five star reviews on this site but quickly returned them do to the mediocre sound quality. I am amazed that a manufacturer can sell a 99.00 set up for 250.00 dollars! The speakers and subwoofer are very small and the sound they emit is far below what you would expect for the price.

I'm using the original foil and cutter and it works just fine. The trick is simple - brush out the cutter and head EVERY time you use the shaver. The super-sharp edge comes off the cutter within a couple of weeks of use, after that the sharpness basically plateaus. If you keep it clean it won't jam up. Its the uneven pressure that causes the cutter to try to shave through the foil. I only had a foil cut through once and that was because I didn't snap the head on fully and tried to run the shaver - foil went in about 30 seconds.Now I DO need a new cleaning brush, as I've worn mine down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Have owned shaver for years and like design.

I have read The Others and I highly recommend it also. This book (Once) was addictive. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Warning though there are some pretty kinky sex scenes in this book so I don't really recommend it for anybody under the age of 16 or 17. I enjoy Mr.Herberts books because they depict an ordinary or in the case of The Others disabled person, and let them do some extraordinary things. Take away all the magic and mystical stuff in them and they are essentially just stories of the little man going against really bad people and winning. So if you like fairies read this book, if not then read it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult fantasy long on description but short on imagination.","review":"Clive Barker does a great job of making creative fantasy for adults but James Herbert's predictable sludge paced tale will put many adults asleep.After a stroke Thom returns to the manor he grew up in as a child only to discover masturbating fairies in the woods and a hairy succubus who really really wants his sperm.Herbert manages to describe everything from the tiniest leaf to what everyone is wearing but pays no attention to plot or pacing.The most memorable aspect of this book is the handful of admitedly erotic graphic sex scenes where Herbert uses descriptions to good effect...if this were a movie you would be pressing the fast forward button.Besides that it's disappointing and flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Herbert's worse book","review":"I have been a fan of this author ever since his first book \\"The Rats\\". However, it has to be said this latest offering is really terrible. The OVER descriptive writing of the book makes you just want to run for the hills. This book does not take you long to read by the time you have skipped over the pages and pages of this stuff and the really quite terrible sex scenes, which seem to never end. The story, what there is of it, never gets going and you begin to wish that Mr. Herbert had never written this book. My personal opinion is that James needs to get back to his horror writing and leave this fantasy stuff to those who can write it. I was very disappointed and hope his next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORDY AND UN-ORIGINAL","review":"In truth, I did read the reviews for this book, but decided to take a chance and buy it anyway. By the time I got to page 40, I felt like I was back in a school--it became 'required' reading instead of pleasure reading. I considered it 'required' because I had paid my money for this book so I was 'required' to read the whole thing.Soft porn aside, the whole fairy journey was long, boring and unoriginal. The characters were stereotypical: the bad witch Nell vs. the good fairie Jennett. The good 'son' versus the 'bad' one, yada yada yada...Mr. Herbert has some really nice passages but they got bogged down with too many other passages. And the thing where he put explanations in parenthesis looked like footnotes to himself he didn't bother to work into the story.

I Plan on giving it to my Husband to read and believe his opinion may differ from mine. I don't say it's Bad or poorly written but I consider it A MAN BOOK.

I really liked the character of Thom and savored his chemistry with Jennet (although it was a bit creepy that the love interest is described as so childlike). The quiet parts where the two are exploring the forest and talking while Nell was off being wicked are the book's best feature. But once the romantic tension was resolved and Nell looked to be turning into a generic villian, I lost interest. It was disappointing to see a story that started out detailing unseen worlds of wonder devolve into a typical Good vs. Evil climax. Just when the book should have been roping me in, it lost me, and I've been unable to finish reading it for over a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a childs book!","review":"This is considered to be in the Sci-Fi/Fanatsy category, but it's DEFINITELY not a fairy tale for a child. It has an errotic, sensual quality that an adult can most assuredly appreciate. I enjoyed this book very much and found it hard to put down. You have to be a fan of works such as this to fully appreciate Herbert's flowery English prose. But, he definitely transports you to a realm of unseen worlds and fascinating characters, leaving you breathless to find out what it all means."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad, it's almost scary","review":"What was James Herbert thinking? This novel is part fantasy, part horror and with a chunk of soft porn thrown in as well. And none of it works.

He is a very active father and doesn't like this story because it's all about \\"I, Prudence's mother\\" and there is no father in the story.

In fact, while reading the book to our child for the 1st time we got to the picture of the \\"poo poo\\" in the bowl, she got all excited and yelled \\"ice cream mommy\\".

I have hidden it from her so I never have to read it again. The language is not accurate (wee wee and poo poo), repetitive (not in a good way) and the pictures don't accurately portray current potty seats at all. Run don't walk to find other books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"my 2 year old just didn't like the book. she didn't stay interested in it at all. it was not helpful for us. it had too many words to read - maybe if you had a older child but for my young one it's just too long"},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it; I hate it; it works","review":"This is a hokey book which contains all of the worst visual representations of the 60s and 70s. Still, my child loves it. True, she usually thinks the potty depicted here is a cup, and says yes to the question of whether it is a vase to hold flowers every time, but she gets the picture (how could she not, the illustrations are that obvious). The illustrations are only good in the sense that the more realistic books do not adequately portray missing the potty. But, the illustrations reflect a terrible era. Think muu-muus, the stylized dove, 2-d everything, shades of orange, pink and avocado. I really don't like reading this -- the words are stilted, the colors are horrifying, but it seems to work (or such is the consensus among mothers I know)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"It is way too expensive for what you pay for. The video is very short and I can't stand that they call it Wee Wee and Poo Poo."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I bought the book to help my daughter with potty training but we (my husband and I) found it a little to explicit for such young children, I could have done without the little girl bent over telling us this is where the poop comes out, I've recently gotten a few other books that do a much better job without being so, well gross. I wouldn't recommend this one over any other potty training books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if it were still the 40's!","review":"This may have been a good book back in 1980 when it was written but I think even then it was outdated!The DVD and VCR tape are the same, don't be fooled by the release date.In the book, dvd etc. the little girl who wears cloth diapers..., bends over to show her bum hole. Her grandmother gives her a potty?? It looks like an nice pitcher to make lemonaide in. Very unrealistic in this day and age. She then walks around naked, poops and pees on the floor next to the \\"pitcher\\", and then the next day she poops and pees in the so called potty, yay she's all trained....right. They also call it wee wee and poo poo.....I don't know about you but I call it pee and poop or pee pee and stinky's.lolDon't waste your money on this outdated poop so to speak. Children need more up to date potty videos and books with there favorite tv charaters like Blue or Bear in the Big Blue House Etc. Elmo would be a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction","review":"This is a fairly good introduction for a little girl to potty training. I wouldn't expect any book to be a perfect how-to potty training manual, but this at least shows kids that this is something that all little girls go through. Like another reviewer said, I didn't like the parts where you're supposed to say \\"I, Prudence's mother\\" or similar -- it just seemed clumsy. I changed those parts to third person (\\"This is Prudence's mother...\\" .)As a father whose two kids are now potty trained (thank goodness!), I might offer this advice to parents of toddlers: There's about a gazillion different approaches to potty training. Don't get bothered by some friend who tells you about what is supposedly the \\"right\\" way to potty train. Every child and every family is different, and you have to find what's right for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor language, not interesting","review":"I just bought this for my daughter to help spark an interest in potty training. This book is boring, in it's word use, and illustrations. The language used is also strange: \\"we we\\" for the urethral opening, and \\"hole\\" for the anal opening. It just sounds odd to me. My daughter and I love \\"The Potty Book for Girls\\". It's much more interesting, and langualge use is more acceptable (to me anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite classic book for 2 generations","review":"I had this book when I was a child and bought it when I started ECing with my daughter. Since 8 months she has been captivated not so much by the story but rather the pictures. She is in love with the book and spends a lot of time flipping through the pages. I find the book very straight forward and the illustrations clear, unlike some befuddled reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's reinforce gender differences from the start","review":"It's great that little girls who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls. Maybe the chamber pot style toilets in the book actually exist in a spanish speaking country somewhere...maybe...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must like word choice","review":"The book is cute, but you need to be sure you want to use the words \\"wee wee\\" for pee pee. If not, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Even though I bought this one used for [price]- I was very disappointed in the content. The \\"potty\\" pictured in this book is actually an \\"urn\\" like bowl that does not look even vaguely like any of the potty chairs that children are using currently. No matter how well it is written, my daughter (20 months old) will not relate this picture to her potty chair which makes this story worthless.Sorry I wasted [money] plus shipping and handling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is too long, not age appropriate and is annoying to read. The pictures aren't really age appropriate for a young child (perhaps it would be better if you had an older child you were trying to potty train - but I doubt it). The only thing my daughter enjoys is looking for the pages with poopoo on them. Don't waste your money on this one. There are many other cute potty training books out there. I just bought the sesame street one and my daughter loves it and I don't mind reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"After hearing so much about \\"Once Upon a Potty\\" , I was thrilled when my daughter received the book and audiocassette for a Christmas gift. After reading the book and listening to the tape, I was disappointed. The lanuage was very infantile (although you are encouraged to substitute your own words for urination and defacation). The potty that was pictured looked like a ceramic pitcher which could cause confusion to children exposed to ceramic plant holders. My 23 month old daughter was not interested in this particular book on toilet learning, although she loves others. If you buy it I hope you like it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt look anything like a potty","review":"The pictures are cute but what is the point if the potty doesnt look anything like one, it is a pot with a handle!

Unless you want your child refering to her body parts as 'pee-pee' and saying things like 'wee-wee' and 'poo-poo' stay away from this book! Babies and children would not talk like this if adults did not teach them to! People who do so should hang their heads in shame. Teach your children the correct names for their body parts and they wont grow up so repressed. I couldn't even donate this book to charity for fear soome unsuspecting person might buy it, first I let my youngest use it as a teather and then I pitched it!

It may not convince your daughter to use the potty but it gets her thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not age-appropriate","review":"I thought this book was too long and involved for my 18 month old.

This book would be good if you were potty-training a three year old..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs update","review":"Although my daughters used this book for potty training, it needs to be updated. Carrying the potty around the house for use - ugh! Book received in a timely fashion and in great condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toddler loves it. Me, not so much.","review":"To be fair, my 2 1/2 year old is currently obsessed with this book. If rating was based on her requests to read, it would be a 5-star. However, I don't love the illustrations and I find the book awkwardly phrased (text like \\"and I, Prudence's mother, kept changing her\\" doesn't roll off my tongue). I read to my children A LOT and I never rephrase as heavily as I do for this book. In short, I dislike reading this book and I think that potty books require enthusiasm from child and parent to work well. I'd suggest \\"Potty\\" by Leslie Patricelli instead. It does a better job communicating with concrete pictures and it feels more modern."},{"rating":"2","title":"not her favorite","review":"this isn't my daughter's favorite potty book. She prefers reading \\"Everyone Poops\\" actually. There are alot of words to read to her in this book. She can't quite make it through everything I'm trying to read before turning the page. But, she's only 15 mos. old so I'm sure she'll enjoy it more as she gets older. Having been raised on Prudence myself (and so were my sibling & cousins), I love the story. I love that it shows the poop in the potty. My husband's a physician, both of my parents are physicians, and I'm going to be one eventually. We don't believe in using polite words instead of the real ones and definitely don't feel embarrassed at pictures of poop in places where it belongs. This book does not push any lines for me; actually, I can't stand the potty books that beat around the bush and don't even show that there is supposed to be poop & pee in the potty when you're done. At least this book tells it like it is even if it uses one too many words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit with toddlers","review":"My son, who is about to turn two, LOVES this video. The songs are great, and there's a nice mix of toy and real trains. Part 4 is the best of the three.

Within a month and a half the decal started peeling. When the weather got cold the backing became stiff and brittle. Very poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST!","review":"I was introduced to Darly Coley via this videotape many years ago. In my opinion, Daryl Coley is one of the best male vocalist to ever live on this planet (along side Luther Vandross & Donny Hathaway). Although he chooses to use his alto/tenor God-given instrument to sing gospel it's clear he could have easily been a jazz or R&B; artist without effort. My favorite song on this video is the title cut \\"He's Right On Time.\\" The choir, the back-up singers, the band and Mr. Coley himself truly shine - so much that you can't sit still while they peform/minister this song.Another one of my favorites is \\"You Are\\" in which Mr. Coley solicits broadway diva BJ Crosby to help him belt out this powerful cut! Who knew there could ever be an equal to Daryl's amazing gift, but in BJ Crosby we find such a person. She is mind-blowing! I thank God to have this videotape in my possession again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea glass review","review":"I was told by a friend about the book and bought it so I could have a keepsake for the glass I collect."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy!","review":"i guess i had a different prospective of this item. thought it had more to do with the ocean not rocks. this book is for my daughter who loves the NC oceans. she had to move to Ky and misses the ocean very much. i thought this item would give her some fond memories. i'm not sure if this item will be an enjoyment to her or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like.","review":"I mean really, what's not to like. What could possibly be wrong with a book written about such a benign pastime. It almost sounds green - it is green! Picture this, you're at the seashore, strolling casually along, eyes to the sand, and you're intentionally removing pieces of glass (from broken bottles, etc.) that other, assumedly uncaring folk (litterbugs actually) have strewn into the sea. And we've made a sport of it too! Honestly though this is a nice book with loads of information, and really nice photos. The best of its genre I think. Makes me almost wish I lived by an open stretch of convenient beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Joy To Read","review":"Richard LaMotte did a wonder-filled job of putting together this informative and comprehensive book on sea glass. I honestly have enjoyed reading every page. I had no idea that there was so much history hidden in every piece of glass, and even though I have collected glass over the years, I never understood the relationship between winds and tides and the weather that deposits these beautiful little gems on our shores. Mr. LaMotte shares all this knowldege with such passion that reading his book not only feed my intellect but also inspired the beachcomber in me. And, the photographs are simply beautiful. Every image works to support as well as illustrate all the topics that are being discussed. The entire book is truly a piece of art in itself. I will read and re-read this book. It is a must for anyone and everyone who loves sea glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference and Looks Nice on the Coffee Table","review":"I recently started collecting sea glass on my daily walks along the beach here in southern California. After a few weeks, the patina variations, colors and sizes got me wondering about the process of glass turning into sea glass. I did a quick search and came across this book on Amazon. It's a great all around book. Informative, great pictures to compare my samples with, and I have it on a table near my collection so guests can reference it while checking out my samples. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious gems of all colours","review":"This is a glorious book. I got over my initial disappointment that it refers entirely to American glass sites but soon realised that didn't matter as every page is full of really amazing and interesting information and photographs. This is not just a coffee table book but would be a tremendous addition to any library where the readers are curious and want to encourage that curiosity in their children. Great historical information on the types of glass used and fantastic photos of the original vessels that could have resulted in your piece of precious sea glass. I will read this cover to cover having looked through every page at the moment of delivery. A beautiful book, over 200 pages packed with colour illustrations and information, marvellous additional references too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend.

Pure Sea Glass takes the casual collector a step further in covering the history, conditioning, styles, and rarity appraisal of found sea glass.

His voice is worn out, and that is blatantly obvious in the first song, \\"I Sing The Songs.\\" That performance may have been the low-point of Sinatra's career. There are some strong songs here, like Change Partners, See The Show Again, It's All Right With Me, For The Good Times, Here's To The Band, and My Way.

It presents several famous and entertaining bits from Monty Python's Flying Circus, bookended in a throwaway narration by Steve Martin, in an attempt to showcase a full retrospective of the artists' ouevre. It debuted in 1989 at the Aspen Comedy Arts Festival, and was probably quite entertaining, especially since all six members of the group were together there for the last time.Thus, if you want a brief retrospective of several high points of the series, this video may be for you. It doesn't have every piece ever run, but it has enough to be worth it. However, now that the entire run of the show has been released on VHS and DVD, this video may be simply needless.

This is one of those books whose reputation precedes it, but upon completing the first chapter, you'll forget everything you thought it was going to be, and you'll want to delve right into it. Definitely a book to read through once, and then go through once more, slowly, with a pen, paper and highlighter.Should be required reading for everyone, certainly the Christ-follower.It being so well-known and praised, I think I was expecting something that I would struggle to understand, but it couldn't be more simple! Simple with incredible depth, one that you'll refer back to and glean more and more from each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilgrim's Progress in Modern English","review":"The Pilgrim's Progress in Modern English is very easy to read and contains the two parts in one book. You will amaze of the Bible knowledge of John Bunyan and if you are a student of the Bible you will know were in the Bible the passages are that the book refers to. I will definitely recommend this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - Pilgrims Progress made easy","review":"For years I have tried to read the classical version of Pilgrim's progess and then I found this book on Amazon. This is the best rendition of this book I have found to date. It was easy to read, great study notes are the end of each chapter and a fantastic addition to my Library. I'm glad I found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My English Teacher's Attempt to Force Christianity Upon Us","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The plot is boring and horribly predictable, the characters are flat, and the story is wholy uninspiring. I've read much better devotional books than this so-called \\"literature.\\" If you want to be inspired, go read the actual Bible; don't settle for an imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"The other reviews for this record have me puzzled. This is the band's first effort and worst. If you are or just becoming a big Huey Lewis and The News fan, I urge you to by this cd for your collection. Otherwise there isn't much on here that stands out. \\"Now here's you\\" and \\"Trouble in Paradise\\" are good tunes, but most of the songs are mediocre. The album itself sounds unclear and the band seems to rush through most of the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"News' Debut","review":"Huey Lewis & The News' self titled debut album is a solid, workman like effort that laid down the blueprint that the band would follow to the top of the charts in the mid 80's. The album is full of no nonsense songs that have a rock, r&b and pop mixture with perfect harmonies. The album isn't as polished as their later efforts, but Mr. Lewis' appealing vocals and the band's loose and enthusiastic playing makes this a fun effort. \\"Trouble in Paradise\\" is the most famous song from the album (thanks to a live version that appeared on the We Are The World album) and is great songs as are \\"Some Of My Lies Are True\\", \\"Hearts\\", \\"Stop Trying\\" and \\"Who Cares\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the beginning","review":"We were lucky enough to see Huey and the News starting out in the Bay Area. This is a little raw, but what they sounded like. Their live shows had so much energy, and even though the record sounds much like the live show, it cannot capture the intensity and drive Huey and the band brought to the stage. My favorite memories of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"stale and boring, albeit authoritative","review":"I wonder why it is that Dover insists on resurrecting these centenarian \\"classics\\" that reek from the profoundest nadirs of Victorian/Edwardian writing. The material, while bursting at the seams from its completeness and thoroughness of research, is presented in a most unappetizing manner. The author must circumlocute almost forever until he gets down to brass tacks, and--when he finally embarks on the meat of some myth or other--you have to read hard between the lines to torture the actual story line out of the narrative. There's got to be a better way to bone up on the rudiments of Celtic myth, and I think I've found it: \\"Druids, Gods and Heroes\\" by Anne Ross, likewise e-available at Amazon. You'd do well to avoid Squire and books of that ilk. Dover tries so very hard to deliver quality stuff, and they very often do, but Squire is *not* a shining example of their success in that direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly Work","review":"\\"India: Art and Culture 1300-1900\\" is actually a 478-page catalogue for the exhibition \\"INDIA !\\" held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Rather than call it a catalogue, which can sometimes conjure up a negative image and diminish the importance of this effort, it would be more appropriate and accurate to call this a definitive tome on Indian Art. This specialized book presents three hundred thirty-three works representing Indian art from fourteenth through the nineteenth century. Author's love for art and his expertise are very obvious to the reader in the scholarly text and references accompanying each piece of work.

I thought the first, third and fifth songs were the best. If you like the Pharcyde, don't pass on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without FatLip They're Nohing","review":"This was truly a disappointment. The production on this album is lame at best and and the rhymes have no life to them. I was excited when I ordered this cd, hoping for something in the same vein as labcabin... but it wasn't. Not worth the dough. The only semi decent track is the first one , which is convenient for that one day out of the year I consider listening to it I can play it and take it out without skipping thru tracks. its tempting to to buy cuz you think maybe it's good and this guy doesn't know what he's talking about , but trust me . It's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pharcyde Minus One","review":"That should be the real title of this album. Though the three remaining members hold their own lyrically, and the in house prodution is decent, one can only wonder just how tight a full L.P. WITH fatlip would be. The first song \\"pain\\" tells the story of sucess and failure, which pharcyde knows well with label problems and in group quarrels. But the song is truly a stamp of perseverance in their struggle. We can only hope this quartet can join back together and show the hip-hop game what hip-hop is. Until then, we're stuck with an incomplete e.p. and a fatlip album with little promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is pickle juice","review":"If you are a true Pharcyde fan, then this album will certainly depress you. It is hard to imagine this high-energy group could sound so laconic. None of the tracks show Pharcyde's usual wit or humor. Overall, an incredibly disappointing release from one of the old pinnacles of west coast hip-hop. Only the most desperate need for nostalgia should move you to buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!!","review":"I have been waiting 4 years for these guys to drop something. Still tight as ever. They up the style on this one as they did with the last two. The only question I have is wheres the LP?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulda been more","review":"Just like THE RIDA from Detroit, I've been waiting since 95 for another Pharcyde album. While this EP is not as great as the other albums it does suffice for the true Pharcyde fans. While these guys may be average mc's they still continue to have some of the flyist beats in the business. Track 4 is definitely the tightest one on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD straight SUCKS!!!","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE Pharcyde fan. Dedicated since the release of the first album \\"Bizare Ride...\\" It had seemed like forever since the release of their second album and I was itching to hear some new tracks. Even knowing that Fat Lip had left the group I figured \\"How bad could it be?\\" Consider the question answered. Absolute sidewalk dookie. Listen up Pharcyde fans, if you feel like throwing money at the Pharcyde boys because you've got nothing better to do than waste money, then this album is for you. For all of you that remember the good ol' days of Pharcyde, funky beats, killer production, and tight rhymes, pass this album up. I wish they had a negative star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Picture - Sometimes","review":"This TV has a nice picture on any analog inputs. If I use my DSS through the cable input the picture is great. However, if I use it through the S-Video Input at times of high motion the TV can't decode the signal fast enough. The result is a bunch of blocks on your 50\\" screen. Pretty irritating to spend $1500 on a TV and see blocks as the signal quality! It is a super obvious problem with any S-Video or Component input source. I am not at all satisified with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typhoon Colander was a disappointment","review":"I purchased this very cute colander for the size and design six weeks ago. It arrived slightly dented, but I was able to push the dent out. I thought it was strange that it was so flexible and that the colander had a warning to 'handwash only'--it seemed very flimsy. I followed the directions, but within five weeks of normal usage, the enamel began to flake off and it started to rust. Unless you are purchasing this colander as a display item only, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decorative Item Only","review":"I purchased this colander approximately a year ago. In that time, the metal lip around both rims has rusted, and the paint has flaked. I always handwashed and dried it. Unless you're planning to put fruit in it or hang it on a wall or do something other than that for which it was intended, I would pass on this. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent review...","review":"As a second year PA student, the CD provided gives a great review for our \\"blocks\\". It does have questionable answers without explanations yes...but that is where personal research will solidify probing questions. I think it is a great tool to utilize since it has so many questions included in the CD. When I only have a few hours to fit in a good review, this is where I turn! The book is also well compartmentalized. Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but not the best","review":"Buyers beware that this is not MAC compatible, so the CD ROM is basically uselesss to you...I have found it useful as coaster.

Still in love with the series.

In fact, so disappointed I considered only getting books from the library. I just could not find that right mix of story and romance. I found the first novel in discussion. I am thrilled that I took a chance on it. I love the ending; thankful for the payoff. The love scenes are not graphic and just hinted. The story well developed over a series of novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"With the cultural diversity of our neighborhoods today, I thought a book like this was a great idea. I expected that the author would be respectful of the different religions he's chosen to write about. That wasn't the case. Throughout this thin tome, the author has chosen to pontificate on the weaknesses of each major religion as it compares to his own Christianity. Of course, this is all opinon. His opinion. From this book, I gather we should be afraid of our non-Christian neighbors because they harbor ulterior motives and are vastly inferior. Anyone looking for a primer on the basic tenets of the world's major religions done in a respectful, all inclusive manner better look elsewhere. This small minded volume does nothing to foster undersatnding and acceptance in a multi-cultural environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rect Spot Sprinkler AWESOME","review":"I really like this product. It creates a nice wide pattern and is perfect for trees that are new and bushes and garden areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep shopping...","review":"It has one really nice feature, the work light. I was out late at night working on my tractor and this light was heaven sent (no pun intended). The bad news is that after pumping up 3 tires on my kids bicycles, the compressor was noticeably slowing down. That bites if you have 10 tires that you need to inflate like I usually do. I had no problem whatsoever returning it and the seller said this behavior was unusual. One of the first casualties of moving manufacturing offshore was quality control (actually the USA was just average at it). So I could have just gotten a bad unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"RECHARGEABLE AIR COMPRESSOR","review":"One of my biggest disappointments in Amazon purchases. This is the closest I have ever come to sending something back.It arrived when expected and was packaged well.It never held a charge long enough to pump up a low tire. I replaced a Campbell Hausfeld unit that I have used for years. That unit was so reliable, I kept it in the trunk to use whenever a tire was low. I destroyed that one by leaving it running when I went into the house to make a phone call. It overheated and died; I guess I was lucky it didn't burst my tire!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman quality","review":"Coleman name led me to buy this compressor. I was surprised to find that it was a piece of junk! Stick on labels should have tipped me off. Even the labels won't stay attached. Also, very low pumping capacity, hard to open hose cover, pressure guage is innacurate by 5 pounds at 35 lb pressure, and inflation tips easily fall out of the clips. This experience has created a new image of Coleman for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"It sounds like a good product, doesn't it? Just a little more than any other air compressor, but it has it's own battery and light. Unfortunately, I though the same thing, and bought it. The first one was acting strange from the day I got it, but it took a couple months (of just sitting around) before it completely failed. I mailed it in, and got a new on in return. The new one seemed to be working fine for a while, but after using it 2 or 3 times, it simply wouldn't start. The warranty period has expired (it's not an item you use frequently) so I can't get it replaced. The unit is designed so that it can't run while plugged-in, so when the charger or the battery dies, the whole unit is trash. You can get a better no-name air compressor for $10 at your local car-parts store."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've said it all!","review":"The previous reviews have touched on everything about this piece of junk. The gauge is totally off and the switch broke after a few uses. It wouldn't fill my truck tires at all. Fortunately I got my money back from Pep Boys. Avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this piece of JUNK!","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased TWO (yes two) of these compressors. The other reviews cover everything about these paper weights.I bought two of these from a discount store that doesn't give refunds. One unit was for myself and the other as a gift. We bought the unit to fill excersize balls, beach balls, kids toys, etc.Well...the one unit we had already thrown the box away, so we couldn't return it. The other unit we took back for in store credit and the unit we had to keep we put out with the trash.It's junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond worthless","review":"This product is completely worthless!!! The pressure gauge is grossly inaccurate, it doesn't produce hardly any air flow at all, the unit is excessively noisy, and the cheap labels do not adhere to the plastic surfaces very well. It is a pathetic excuse for a Coleman product; or any consumer product for that matter. My wife purchased it for me as a Christmas gift so I really do feel bad about complaining about it to her. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in 2 months","review":"* Bad Compressor *I bought mine from the Coleman store expecting their past good quality. It has been two months. I have probably inflated about 100 soccer balls with it. It just froze up. Then it blew the fuse. Replaced fuse. Same thing again. I called customer service and was redirected. That is when it became clear that this is NOT really a Coleman product. The fine print results in spending another $20 or so to get it repaired or replaced with a refurb. I'm buying something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to add salt to the injuries, but","review":"I am actually commenting on a similar model. Also is a Coleman powermate rechargeable jumpstart with inflator, light, etc. It looks fine and solid. However, it doesn't last at all. After using the inflator a few times (less than 10 times to be exact), the inflator made strange noise and quit inflating. Very disappointed on Coleman products. I haven't got any chance to use the jumpstart function yet. Just like other reviewers, it really hurt me when such a big brand name makes such a crappy product. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grasping at Straws","review":"I was horribly disappointed in this book. I feel the author had great intentions in putting this together, but given the bands lack of participation in interviewing, this book has nothing to it. Half of it is pictures or other inserts with little insight to the heart and soul of Layne Staley. I found it to be quite boring with little substance. In fact, on page 57, the author discusses the single written for the last action hero soundtrack \\"What the Hell Have I?\\" Only problem is, the author calls the song \\"What the Hell I Have?\\" I find that to be a problem. If I were writing a book about a celebrity, I would make sure I got the names of songs correct. This book is nothing more than an overhyped disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, Bizarre Life, But a helluva great story","review":"So that's what life was really like behind the giant walls for Layne STaley, cool. I had no idea that he wasn't this superfreaky, extravagant rock star who just did drugs all the time to get high. Wow, to him they were like insulin to a diabetic. I found out how normal he started out...and then what caused his life to get so extraordinarily weird and successful. This book is definitely loaded with true stories, right from Layne's own words and those of his two closest family members. The drawings and photographs really gave me an idea of who was on the inside too. I just wish he didn't have to suffer so much and die so young. We'll miss you Layne but at least now we know what you were really all about. I gotta give a couple thumbs up to the effort this reporter gave to fly back and forth from ARgentina to Seattle to get this story for all of us to enjoy.

But: it's written by a fan who wants to be in the picture herself. Adriana Rubio is obviously very proud to have had intimate conversations with Staleys mom and sister, and it shows throughout the whole book. Everybody shall know that she has this overwhelming respect for Staley's relatives and their stories. Also, I got the impression that she wrote this book to get rid of her own complexes, comparing Staleys heroin-addiction to her own struggle with Anorexia Nervosa. She places herself too much in front, which is quite irritating after a while. Or, in the words of Layne Staley: \\"She should write a book about herself\\". Still, there is the telephoneconversation with Layne Staley and her that is quite shocking for the true fan. I'm still reading the book so now and then, about a year after buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty weak","review":"i love layne, as well as the rest of aic, jerry, mike, sean..the book barely talks about layne at all. the author talked about colombia and drug markets, mike starr's book, and other useless stuff that is irrelevant to learning more about laynes \\"heart and soul\\" as said in the title. the material on layne is good, and i like the dialogues from the recordings of layne's family the author use. also, the author repeated a lot of stuff such as a certain quote from layne about \\"don't they hear the words..,\\" calling demri layne's \\"one and only love\\" a thousand times..and other junk like that that makes it boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Fan","review":"Garbage.

The author never tells us whether she even met Layne Staley in person, and judging from the text she apparently did not. Layne's mother and sister, and the author's experiences with both women in the period just before Layne's death, are the actual subject of this book. Adriana Rubio provides some insight into Layne Stayley's childhood, but she tells us almost nothing about the final years of Layne's life (though plenty about the lives of his mother and sister around the time of Layne's death). Rubio's book loses sight of the fact that it was Layne, and not his mother or sister, who made such an impact on the world of music. \\"Angry Chair\\" is therefore a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I worked two hours to purchase this book.I wasted an afternoon of my life reading it.This book could have been about 10 pages long.136 pieces of paper were wasted on this book.This muck barely deserves space on a webpage, letalone an entire book.Read something else, don't waste your time friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written with almost no insight into Layne Staley","review":"A few times while reading this book I had to tell myself that I was not reading a 5th grade book report. The writing is that bad. There is no information about Layne since he was basically a recluse for the final months/years of his life. So all you get are tales from his mother and sister from his childhood like how he liked to play with legos.(literally) Lots of big print, pictures, and other fillers allowed me to read this in about an hour. Desperate to fill space, the author even allowed John Brandon, who wrote a book on AIC bassist Mike Starr, to print songs he wrote as a tribute to Layne in the book.

You'd much rather go to Hannibal Lecter's for dinner than Jonathan's home. The heroes, Poe and Pierce James Figg, and a perfect match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, historical fiction","review":"This is one of Marc Olden's best books, if not his best. The story is primarily set in New York in the 1840's and not only entertains but educates. The characters are fun, Poe is a royal pain and his relationship with Figg develops in to a very touching union between two men who understand the meaning of loss. The flipping of stereotypes is also a clever technique, as Figg is English and thinks with his fists whilst Poe adds the brains and subtlety.The secondary characters are fascinating as well, more so as they are all based on real life people. I was fascinated to find out about New York in this period.If you like historical fiction, then I don't think you can go too far wrong than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven as he might have played it","review":"There are so many recordings of the key Beethoven repertoire, especially the piano pieces, that it is hard for someone with a new interest to know whee to start. Walter Gieseking and this recording -- and the companion recording of the Moonlight and Pathetique sonatas -- are great places to start. Although the sound quality is somewhat limited due to the time-period of the recording, the performances are incredible. I have been listening to these recordings since I was a child . . . to me, they define these pieces. Gieseking is faithful to the score, to the tempo markings (most performers are not), and his performance, to me, matches descriptions of Beethoven's own playing style. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in quality of templates","review":"This thin quality paperback includes six pages of small templates for iris folding and other elements used to create greeting cards.

At times in the movie, you can't understand what they are saying.The movie itself is a great film, having an interesting story line and plot. It has all the old time great Hollywood greats, Beulah Bondi just to name one of them. The live radio show was a real show on the ABC Radio Network, and watching it was pretty cool.If I were to purchase this movie again, it would be a copy from Synergy Entertainment.

Its a great reference book and I purchased another one to give to my newly wed son and his wife instead of bringing a bottle of wine for dinner. This will last them much longer and just like me I know once you have it, you will use it to see, if its got a reference for those gooseberries, one of your recipes calls for and you never heard of. Great reference book for food and things you would use to process same.

Such as non-parallelism or something else that would blow my mind. Instead I waded through page after page of bad art and crummy story line. Sure, perverted wheel chair ridden ex super heroes reading comics of alternate lives is a neat idea... If its done right. Sadly I feel that nothing in this comic is done \\"right\\" and its a complete waste of paper.

I have read comics with content, and the content of this book doesn't bother me, what does bother me however, is what is said at the begining of the sieries. \\"this is a metaphore\\" how sick and wrong is that? The auther of this doesn't need to defend what is actualy in the series, all he has to say to people who dislike it is \\"well, you don't get it.\\" Even if it is a metaphore for anything (which I doubt, or it is quite weak) it ruins the thing by declaring it beforehand. the idead behind a metaphore is that it is a mesage that is cleverly disguised.This series goes absolutely nowhere. there is no real ending. Is that a metaphore to?

Difficult to Understand....","review":"First of all, this review is based on what I got out of this graphic novel. I may be very dense and can't understand subtle humor of this nature. I found several parts of this humorous, but most of the time I was confused and lost in the story and where it was going and why it was going that route. Maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense and I just didn't get it. It any case, the art was, to say the least, incredible and visceral. I would definitely get another penned by this artist. But the story left me confused and somewhat disturbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's filth","review":"This is the comic equivalent of a Troma film mixed with The Illuminatus Trilogy. The reviewers that loved it are correct about the content, I simply found it was not for me, it has a lot of ugliness without inspiring amusement.Actually, I can't really recommend this book to anyone except for fans of comics like Preacher, Hard Boiled and The Invisibles that *really* like to push the boundaries. I liked Transmetropolitan a lot and I was still very put-off by this. It's filthier.I would suggest you borrow this one from a friend and peruse it first. It truly is *not* for everyone.

I have even cut directly into the sod a couple of times just to see how it would handle it. It is sturdily built. I recommend a heavy duty drill if you are going to use it much, because a lightweight drill will overheat fairly quickly (but at no fault of this product). The one drawback to this product is the shaft is round where it inserts into the drill chuck, which means you really have to torque it down to prevent slippage.

Also:- there are lots of errors in the sample multiple choice questions; and- some subject areas are not covered in enough depth (cursors, locking spring to mind).So you will need a supporting text to cover the areas that this text is weak on.I failed first sitting (solely on the text) and passed the second time (with the assistance of another textbook)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good layout, no depth","review":"I liked that this book models its chapters and sections to the list of exam objectives published by Microsoft.

I think that if you use this book along with Transcender's test questions you shouldn't have a problem passing the test.

Anyone who is stuck in the suburbs, working a dead end job, bored with modern life, and sick of lying politicians will enjoy this book. Just don't go into it expecting to read about a heist. While the robbery is a central pillar of the book, there is so much more to it than the crime itself. Spaggiari's accounts of soldiering, his childhood, adventures, and disgust with modern society are the best parts. I laughed, I cried, and I pumped my fists in the air and exulted in his ultimate escape from the courthouse.

This book is a combination of the true bank heist details along with Mr. Spaggiari's somewhat self aggrandizing views of life. This book will appeal to anyone who likes the 'true crime' genre or who just likes to hear a story of someone who unrepentantly flipped his nose at authority and got away with it. The detail, effort and planning of this endeavor make the reader aware that this robbery was a major undertaking and while the author may be somewhat boastful in tone, it leaves no doubt as to just how big a caper this was.

I can understand the equations in some other book but I can't understand why they are so. I lacked the physical meaning behind these equations and I lacked the bigger picture as well. I borrowed this book from the library hoping to fix my problems before the upcoming the mid-term, and indeed the book proved the most helpful. Don't be fooled by the small size of the book or the \\"a mathematical introduction\\" in the title. This books addresses intuition before delving into the math.

I had hoped for something that really focused on creating resiliency, and this thing read like the typical robot oriented philosophy I've seen so much in corporate training. Just have the right attitude, just stay positive, just don't be like those other losers..... So where's the real tools for how to increase your own resiliency? How do these people really stay positive in the face of adversity? It was so unreadable, I couldn't go any further. My experience with books like this, and I've read more than a few, is the tone and content is set early on, and if it seems like drivel it won't change, so I didn't read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"This is a required book for one of my classes but I thought I would enjoy it.

My father read this book also and felt this book had a huge impact also. By including real life examples, Keith Harrell has made these steps in improving your attitude REAL.

It is a great read for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Attitude is Great About This Book","review":"I heard Keith Harrell speak at a sales meeting in January and immediately bought his book. Keith is the real deal. He weaves stories about his life into the principles he reveals about how much our attitude effects our lives and the lives of those around us. He obviously has a relationship with God, and he uses that relationship as the foundation stone for his belief system. I highly recommend this book for adults and teenagers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very narrow focus","review":"I noticed on the 1st CD a pattern that did not change into the 3rd CD- Almost all of his examples and stories are about himself. When he was in school and stuttered, when he wasn't drafted to the NBA, when he was painting, when he had to give a speech, when he was driving in Atlanta, when he was at a ball game, when he was a college player, on and on and on. While I see he has achievd a lot in his life, these stories about himself did not seem all that interesting or motivating. I would have preferred that he did some detailed research and found some real motivating stories about other people that illustrated his points. It seemed like he decided to write this book and did not do any research-he just thought of stories in his own life as examples. I found it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This was a great read, I think everyone should read this great book!

Its a brilliantly written book without the Psycho-babble found in other books. Everybody has thier bad days. The author does not try to concentrate or explain causes of failures or shortcomings but in fact shows a way to overcome and react to them in a positive manner that can make a worse situation seem to be a blessing in disguise. Keith's personal accomplishments due to his attitude and examples of other people doing the same is a real inspiration to any reader who is seeking to overcome thier difficulties.

First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life. Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes. This tape fails in both respects. While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation. And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to.

Bill James Harpur and Isles series, John Harvey's Charlie Resnick books, Russell James, Derek Raymond and Peter Turnbull's Glasgow P Division procedurals-the list goes on and on and is just breathtaking as one works through these writers. Anyway, The White Trilogy is dark, funny, cynical, tough,uplifting and hard to put down once you start. Let me put it this way, if you went to see the movie \\"Bad Lieutenant\\" and didn't walk out and are glad you didn't-get your hands on The White Trilogy. As much as I am into diversity in my reading material, after reading this book I am straight into Bruen's The Guards.

Shaped like a dictionary, you just search for one substance and a list of incompatible materials follows with a description of the reactivity, references and sometimes a short story, very dense information. It covers organic and inorganic chemicals, but also construction materials. It is one of the best references of this type I know with Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemicals (Bretherick) and Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials (Sax N.I. and Lewis R.J.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good OVERVIEW","review":"This is truly a very useful piece of reference material for anybody doing any kind of studies in European history. True, it doesn't cover everything, but it provides a very useful structure in which to place further information. Also, the author does have a consistant theme running throughout this book that I feel obliged to point to as nobody has thus far. Davies constantly is looking for signs of the development of the idea of a unified \\"Europe.\\" Davies provides a very insightful look at the way in which the people of Europe saw themselves throughout history. Now, while I must admit that it covers more of the similarities than the differences among the ways in which people view themselves, (really the book's one weakness considering what it set out to do) Davies attempt to reconstruct a picture of daily life through this idea of \\"Europe\\" is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Norman Davies is clearly confident that his view of history in general and history of Europe in particular is more interesting and probably more valid than many others who have approached these topics. I surmise that his view of history is that it is an argument to be waged, about the larger patterns and the more subtle threads, rather than a simple telling of the episodes and icons which later political entities have enshrined into myths that serve the ends of governance. On this score, Davies would not be unique. But in telling the history of Europe with this approach, he has undertaken a topic of so enormous a scope such that the scholarship would have to be breathtakingly manifest and the arguement would have to be breathtakingly persistant and persuasive. And he pulls it off. What emerges is a wonderfully constructed version of European history that seems connected across time and space. I found myself both stimalated and inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide on Europe's turbulent divisions","review":"Norman Davis has done more for Eastern Europe than legions of politicians and business people who have sneaked behind the curtain in the last decade. As a Pole, I can only be grateful for his contribution. In this monumental and yet very accessible tome, Mr. Davis has tried to be objective and he has succeeded to a large extent. Especially important is his \\"European\\" rather than nationalistic view on history. Other continents may, however, feel neglected, and anyone looking for history of Western Civilization may feel disappointed. This book is too eurocentric;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Overview with Much Detail!","review":"I have read both Robert's and Davies' books on general European history. Robert's book is an excellent, concise introduction to the history of Europe that can be read in several weeks. After reading Robert's text, one has a good concept and understanding of the \\"basics.\\" Davies' book includes all of the data covered by Roberts but goes into much greater detail, including many names, locations, etc only alluded to in Robert's work. The \\"capsules\\" that occur throughout the volume are indeed irritating but sometimes interesting. The stressing of Eastern Europe is not a problem and often adds much interesting information. Davies' book is much more \\"meaty\\" than Roberts'. Thus, if you want a concise introduction and review of a very extensive topic, read Roberts; if you want a more comprehensive and involved text, read Davies; or ideally, read both but start with Robert's text!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Go find a history professor who has fallen prey to schizophrenia and have him jabber at you endlessly.

The clash started long time ago, and it continued into modern times. He writes about the oprression of Ortodox chuch on Uniates but doesent mention the fact that Vatican was and still is much more agressive and much more opressive than the Russian Ortodox church. He also writes about the fact that state should create nation and not the other way around, most of examples are confirming that he is right, but in balkan Peninsula we have situation where nation created the state, and it is the only way for state to fuinction i that part of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is racially offensive","review":"I decided to take a look at this book, and was very sad that I did. It is so amazingly racist I could not believe some of the things written in here could be published! For instance, he sais that it's the Jew's own faults they were in ghettos. He sais that there were a lot of Jewish communists, so the massacre of Polish Jews should not be considered a racial issue.At many points in this book, I felt like I was reading neo-nazi propaganda. I was very offended as I read this, and I strongly advise you not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book has been a huge best-seller in the U.K. where I presently reside. Since my wife and I will spend the next 2 years touring Europe, it seemed like an ideal purchase. I was very disappointed and felt that I had wasted my money. The book rambles and is overly verbose. Further, inordinate attention is placed on the author's speciality area: Eastern Europe. If you are interested in an alternative I would highly recommend The History of Europe by Oxford's John Roberts. That book is better written and does a superior job of illuminating the mechanisms underlying the continent's great historic changes. I would score it a 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficially looks OK, but...","review":"This is a rampling, disorganized and idiosyncratic history. Further, the author's biases taint his presentation. If you want a superior volume check out J.M. Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A much-hyped work suffering from innumerable errors of fact.","review":"This is a most perplexing work. It has received extensive and highly favourable reviews, but its reliability as a general work of history is slim. The straightforward and quite extreme errors of fact are almost as numerous as the page numbers - for example, Davies gets the dates of all but one of the British Tudor monarchs wrong. What I find especially misleading, though, is its relentless stress on the centrality of Polish history to Europe; this reflects the author's specialism, not a disinterested judgement. Finally, his treatment of the term \\"genocide\\", with its bizarre attempt to identify analogous experiences with the Holocaust, runs perilously close to frivolity. All in all, this book will probably be forgotten in a few years' time; at least, I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKETCHY","review":"While it is apparent that Davies has a marvelous knowledge of Europe's vast history, this book is nothing more than a disorganized outline. He does not go into any detail and assumes that the reader is on his own level of prexistent knowledge. In the section on Greece, he only mentioned the name of Alexander the Great once or twice. I was stunned.The same goes for the rest of the book. One should have a PH. D. in history before beginning this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDIOT'S GUIDE TO HISTORY","review":"I agree with one of the previous reviewers, Oliver Kamm, especially about the capsule \\"Genocide\\". This book is easy to read but was probably easier to write. It is too superficial and still full of errors. The relative emphasis on subjects are unbalanced. This book may meet the expectations of tourists before their trip to Europe, particularly if they don't care about the reliability of information. As a result I regret buying this biased, subjective and concentrated book of European history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Davies Misses the Boat","review":"Huge, Dense and Fun in an excruciating kind of way, but Davies assertion that Poland is central to Europe or European culture or tradition (in any sense other than geographical) is dead wrong, perhaps he should look just a little to the west. In attemping to \\"define\\" Europe - 'what makes Europe European?' - he misses again! Maybe the Celto-Germanic-Slavic ethnic/racial continuum and it's roots in a common kinship, culture and religious tradition might shed some light there, Norm. Lastly, it's hard to believe that \\"serious scholors\\" will flirt with the notion that the Greek tradition owes so much to imports from the Middle East, perhaps Norm forgot to read his Hesiod. The strongest qualities in this work are the energies spent on the 'Volkerwanderung' and the great \\"capsules\\" full of tastey tidbits. If you already have this one - keep it for the shelf, if not join the ranks of the Grand-European-History-Hunters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasure to read, pleasure to disagree!","review":"This book is by very knowledgeable author, who has his own interesting views and prospectives. Even if you disagree about some issues, or you find his findings to be strange, it is pleasure to disagree.It looks like many readers of history books are looking for reconfirmation of the ideas they convey already. This book is a fresh stream, no doubt. It bring more than just dates and sequences, it gives you much of flesh, of feeling, of European feeling about subjects that hard to recollect living in US. While some points of controversy is a feature of the book it has my highest recommendations. It gives a touch of a light on the subjects that otherwise often appear academic, lifeless and curved in stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am reading it now. I can not stop reading it","review":"I am not a professional. I am reading for pleasure.This book is perfect for an European,who had already some history lessons on Europe. I enjoy the style the simplicity and high level of documented comments, to dissplell a lot of missconceptions about the past ( and the future). I have to brush up my Latin ( for ROMA). I have a lot of expectations for the coming chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Berlin Wall - alive and kicking","review":"It sure looks impressive - 1.8 kg anyway. Davis attempts to introduce the part of the European history towards which the West was (and very successfully still is) absolutely ignorant - i.e. the history of so-called Central and Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, everything is focussed upon the basic assumption that the area known as the Western Europe was the centre of the main great ideas of the European development that spread to the other areas. Stereotypes? Definetely. A feel-good-about-yourself-if-you-belong-to-the-West book? No doubts about that. And it is written well for the mass audience that never bothered to learn a bit more in school than necessary and to which the Berlin Wall remains real even when physically removed. But it still deserves a strong 8 as being a good sample of the pop reading material"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent History of a Complicated Subject","review":"While the overall size of this volume might be daunting for some, this is undoubtedly one of the best history books I've ever read. Exhaustively researched and touching on nearly all aspects of Europe's long history, Norman Davies manages to pace and propel the story in a very readable way, while being cognizant to show history from nearly all angles ('winners' and 'losers'). This is a book I could reccomend to students and history buffs alike and each would find value and entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable and readable, both academic and woven through with intriguing insights","review":"This highly academic yet highly readable classic is indispensable for an understanding of history, starting with the greek myth of europa, a thorough but entertaining dissertation on the origins of modern europe, and the features of modern europe. No war or effort at peace is left unexamined. I cannot recommend this highly enough, it is indispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A monster of a book.","review":"Rambling, discursive, entertaining informative and highly individual. With particular reference to eastern Europe and Orthodoxy. Norman is a eastern European specialist and so balances up the usual highly Western European, Catholic/Protestant bias found in histories of this sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Davies' Fresh Perspective","review":"This is a tour de force. Davies stands the Anglo-Franco-centric stance of most Western historians on its head. He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks, Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Attempt","review":"Grand synthetic history is usually tough to write, and to read. Davies more or less succeeds in telling the story of \\"Europe,\\" and it certainly passes muster for the general reader. Nonetheless, the book has some faults, particularly Davies' silly insistence that Poland is the center of Europe, the world, and the universe. But it's an easy read, entertaining, and Davies has an interesting take on things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"I acquired this book with no knowledge of European History. I read almost all of it before finally giving up. I would not recommend this book for those with no background in the subject. I believe the author's expertise impedes his ability to communicate the subject to the novice. The level of detail seemed to overwhelm and confuse the big picture. As a novice, I had a hard time sorting out salient facts and assembling them to create a coherent overview of the subject. I have since read some other books that were vastly superior in effectively communicating the basics of the subject.If you have a degree in History this book may be fulfilling. If you are just trying to get a general handle on the topic try J.M. Roberts \\"History of Europe\\" instead. Also check out \\"A History of the Middle Ages\\" by Joseph Dahmus"},{"rating":"1","title":"Knowledegable writer, but too much a show-off","review":"I'm surprised by the many favorable reviews - I find this book clumsily organized and unnecessary in many of its details.

It's a shame, since Penn and Hutton give great performances (especially Penn). The movie has a strong start, develops the relationship between Hutton & Penn's characters well, and offers first-rate tension in their half-baked spy escapades. However, just as their plans unravel, so does the film as it devolves into Hollywood shtick. Worst is Hutton's relationship: Lori Singer's portrayal of H's girlfriend is so wooden she barely furrows her brow when H breaks up with her.My biggest beef is with Pat Metheny's score. His overmixed, cheesy newage noodling dates the movie and makes it sound like a training video.As a DVD, F&S fares no better.

While the graphics are fairly good, the game itself sucks. You never step out of the airplane and the game is difficult from the beginning. This game is unfairly difficult and will easily make even the most patient gamers frustrated. The game gets old after only a few minutes and nothing new changes in the game except locations. All missions are relatively the same and this game provides no lasting entertainment. I would highly suggest not buying this game. Believe me, this game is NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"XBOX ONLY! POOP!","review":"Another great game stolen away. :( The original was a blast and a PC remake would have been fun.

Never have I had so much in the way of all control. Usually you are confined to making someone run, jump, turn right, turn left and climb. This game allows you to fly over and around and all about.That said I agree with other reviews. You get to feeling like you're doing the same thing over and over. You get a mission, choose a plane, shoot down some bogies while fulfilling an objective, killing this that and the other thing. Over and over without much change of pace or significant change in scenery.Good for a first timer, but repetitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish i had more time to play","review":"This game is one of, if not THE best game out for the Xbox since Halo.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's very buggy (at least for me, I've only had my XBox for about a month though). After I beat the single player mode, I tried to go back into the name I beat it with to play the stages over, and it would lock up while it's loading. The disc is in perfect condition, no dust, no scratches. Also if you try to join a game on XBox Live after it tells you the connection may be bad, if you cancel it and try again, the game locks up. Those are the only gripes, and the multiplayer thing is a pretty rare occurance (only happened twice so far). I blame my ISP for that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL... the best flying game that's out there.","review":"All across the board... this is a very fun game. From the graphics, to the music, to the game play, to the story, everything about it is great. The only bad thing about it is the fact that there's no sequel of this game. This game totally has Ace Combat and all other combat flight games beat, so hopefully Microsoft will make a sequel to it some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game!","review":"OK, this isn't no Halo but I enjoyed it very much. I am a progessional pilot and I generally avoid game console flight games due to lack of realism. I was pleasantly surprised by how fun this game was. Kind of a FPS of the sky. Good plot and story line.Only real con I have is it is a farily short game as XBOX games go. Probably 10-15 hours playtime. For the money, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good case","review":"Be sure and test it first before you use in underwater with your camera.

I think the only bad review I've ever written was for a baby swing that wound up being recalled by the CPSC. Point is, this keyboard tray is BAD. Really bad. It is a piece of plywood suspended between two flimsy rolling arms that attach to the underside of the desk with gigantic galvanized metal brackets. I spent hours attaching it only to remove it at the end of the day because it was so bulky and wiggly and ugly and dangerous. The manufacturer's description honestly sounds like it's for a different product...I checked my model number several times before writing this review! The drawer does not \\"lock\\" into place...you can pull it right out (I mean ALL the way out) and there's not a single ball bearing in sight!

The pictures are entirely of rear echelon types in Camp Fox and other camps washing their hair, wrestling, standing in line at the PX.

Peters has been severely and systematically criticised for misuse of source materials and taking quotes out of context.Even Daniel Pipes (no enemy of Israel) has called it \\"an appallingly crafted book.\\"However the book is interesting as an example of Zionist propaganda, mainly aimed at an American audience. It basically seeks to restate the (long discredited) idea that Palestine was essentially unpopulated when the first Jewish immigrants arrived in late 1800s, and that the Palestinian Arabs are almost all 'new arrivals' and immigrants from places like Egypt and Jordan.Worthless as history then, but interesting to see the sophistication and lengths some Zionists and their supports will go to in order to achieve and maintain American support for Israel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, truthful, and informative! A must have!","review":"This book is undoubtedly one of the best books on the middle east conflict. What makes this book different and more interesting from the rest is that the author first set out to write about what she believed were the poor suffering \\"Palestinians.\\" Through her extensive 7 year research on the conflict she found the truth to be exactly the opposite of what she first believed it to be. Such personal accounts as her witnessing \\"Palestinian\\" children counting out arsenals of Kalashnikovs on the shells of a small \\"hospital supply\\" warehouse make the book amazingly informative.Overall it is an absolutely excellent book providing a thorough analysis on the root of the conflict.

It was blasted in Britain and denounced in Israel. The \\"research\\" the book gets so much attention for is a jumble of out-of-context information culled from a handful of studies done mostly by Great Britain during the mandate period. When Ms. Peters isn't misquoting something, she's manufacturing her own version of the study that she then refers to again and again.There are lot's of great books out there about Palestine, the Arab land given to European and American Jews in 1948.

Spare your money and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arab Myths exposed","review":"The strength of Peters' book is in its research (almost 1800 references) and its unblinkered look at the facts. She exposes the myths that the Arabs had been in Israel \\"from time immemorial,\\" (making Jews the interlopers), that Arabs want to live harmoniously with Jews, etc. She shows Jewish life in Moslem countries, and cites some of the hateful passages in the Koran which continue to guide contemporary Moslems, even secular Moslems. Her critics generally fail to identify specific alleged errors or misinterpretations for good reason, for then the discussion would be about those data, the data that Peters cites in detail. Terrific book, and terribly- and ominously- relevant to current events."},{"rating":"1","title":"LMAO!!!!!!!!!","review":"In 1984, Joan Peters published From Time Immemorial, which claimed that Palestine was virtually empty on the eve of Zionist colonization, and that Palestinians are in fact foreigners who surreptitiously entered Palestine after the Zionists \\"made the desert bloom.\\" The book is now widely recognized as a fraud. Baruch Kimmerling (of the Hebrew University) and Joel S. Migdal, in their authoritative study, Palestinians: The Making of a People, published by Harvard University Press, observe that Peters's book is \\"based on materials out of context, and on distorted evidence,\\" and, citing my own conclusion that the book \\"is the most spectacular fraud ever published on the Arab-Israeli conflict,\\" report that \\"similar evaluations were expressed by notable historians\\" in Israel and Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"long discredited","review":"While this book is not entirely worthless by any means, its conclusions should be treated with extreme scepticism on account of the sources used. Much of the information on which Peters bases her arguments has long been discredited, and scholars of the conflict (by which I mean those of us who study and teach it professionally, not those who write on it) have long dismissed the work. Its continued use by amateurs like Dershowitz and many of the individuals on this review page has contributed greatly to the perennial ignorance and misinformation that makes up most of the Israel-Palestine discussion.

The amazing thing about it is that you can just put it on and not skip ANY of the songs.

Unfortunately, the other half of M2M, Marion Raven, has apparently flipped her lid.I gotta agree that Marit is a much better solo artist with awseome style. The direction she has taken with this album is both unique an extremely entertaining. It tends to be a perfect blend of pop and folk with a Leigh Nash (Sixpence None the Richer) feel to it, only better. Well worth the extra few bucks I had to spend on an import cd!

However, this is their first cd and I consider it essential listening if you like hearing how the band developed.

It provides a genuine combination of several genres blended to perfection to provide the listener with music to suit or soothe any mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Step 1 Physiology review","review":"This book is the best review for physiology on Step 1. That does not mean it is the most detailed, or that it has everything, but in terms of high-yield information that is managable in limited time, it takes the cake. It follows the format of Costanzo's larger text \\"Physiology\\" which is more intended for coursework, and which is also excellent. It is loaded with high-yield information and great diagrams. If you know it well, you will be well prepared for Step 1 (and physiology is a pretty big part of that exam.)Most physio topics are coverede very well. Some pathophysiology topics (e.g. cardiac arrhythmia) are not. In those cases, \\"Pathophysiology for the Boards and Wards\\" can be used as a supplement. It wil not be enough by itself for coursework. Suggestions for a course textbook are Costanzo's \\"Physiology\\" or \\"NMS Physiology\\", both of which are excellent. NMS has more detail, Costanzo is somewhat easier to read. But for Step 1 physiology studying, this book it it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best.... yet.","review":"Basically the best Physiology book out there. Great graphics and explanations, all the material you'll ever need for the Step 1 and more.

Great book for the shelf exam"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review","review":"The book had a lot of concepts that really helped with my learning of physio throughout the course and later with prepping for the physio shelf exam. My only beef with the content was with the impertinent discussions of molecular similarities between some hormones, but overall, I was pretty satisfied with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the BRS series","review":"There are only two great BRS review books. This (physiology) and the behavioral BRS are well organized, concise, and complete.I did feel that the GI chapter in physio BRS was too detailed. Like the physiology of gastric motility...probably won't show up on the step 1 exam. The only high-yield GI physio topics are the GI hormones.Other than that, the book covers everything and in just the right amountt of detail. You can read & understand it in 3-4 days, if you were good at physiology. 4-5 days (depending on how many hours you study a day) if you were sleeping during your physiology lectures in med school.It my opinion the only physiology review book. Kaplan's lectures notes on physio would take too long to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classicly funny Marx brothers, video is fair","review":"This film has some very funny lines and is done in the classic slapstick Marx brothers style. Because of its age and being Black and White, the video is only fair and the audio is quite quiet. A classic you will want to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor DVD","review":"If I was reviewing the movie only, I would give it five stars. Some of my favorite Groucho Marx lines are in this movie. However, the DVD was itself was of poor quality. The movie film that was recorded was in poor condition with bad scratches in many places and, toward the beginning, a really bad splice had been made. Fortunately, no actual content had been cut. I was disappointed Universal did not go to the trouble of digitally restoring the movie. Cleaning up the bad splice may have been difficult but the scratches should have been comparatively easy. I would have happily paid more for a better quality DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment, especially in sound quality","review":"This DVD was a dissapointment, especially in sound and video quality (what else is there?). I know that the film was a very early talkie, but I didn't find the quality of the sound and video any better than the earlier video versions I have seen. I was really look forward to seeing and hearing some of my favorite Marx Brothers bits, but the sound drops in and out inconsistently. I expected more from a higher priced DVD -- and there are no extras.

When he starts to play he forgets the rest of the song! So he keeps on playing the same thing OVER AND OVER again! Finally Groucho tells him \\"When you get near a song PLAY IT!\\" Chico tells him once he kept this up for three days! Groucho gives the suggestion of paying him HUSH MONEY,to see if he'll stop.

The tracks are diverse, ranging from aggressive attacks with strong vocals & percussion (ie. Crushed), to tracks that are mostly doomy/droning/noisey/dark ambient atmospheres (ie. Scorched Earth). Overall this is a great amalgamation of noise & distortion, dark ambient, drum 'n bass, and some experiamentalism. I recommend picking it up! I may have to up the rating to 5 stars after spinning it a few more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beauty Of Noise And Obliteration.","review":"For fan's of Front Line Assembly, Chris Petersen shouldn't be a relatively new name. Despite his long standing work in groups like Decree and Will, it's his work as a hired gun alongside Bill Leeb that has garnered him the most recognition.However, those expecting anything remotely similar to Front Line Assembly or EBM in 'Moment Of Silence' should be warned. Alongside Ross Redhead and Sean Lawson, Chris has taken industrial back to it's harsh and noisy roots with the new Decree.Songs evolve, moving from crushing drums, devastating electronics and noisy guitar into creepy dark ambient tracks; the aural landscape created features nothing other than chaos, pain and ruin. Decree has taken queues from the old school masters of the genre and put forward an original and punishing CD. This all makes for an intense listening experience, one definitely not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually love Amazon's recommendations!","review":"Amazon's recommendation feature has steered me to some great music over the past few years, with only an occasional dud. Amazon recommended this album, \\"Moment of Silence\\" by Decree based on my purchase and 4-star rating of Synaesthesia's \\"Ephemeral\\" (which, by last glance, is listed above as an \\"also bought\\" title). \\"Ephemeral\\" is a nice, airy, new-agey, light electronic, upbeat album that I bought after Amazon recommended it based on my purchase and enjoyment of Amethystium's excellent dragonfly trilogy.So, you can imagine my surprise when I started listening to \\"Moment of Silence\\" and heard what I can only liken to death metal screams and industrial instrumentals akin to Edward Scissorhands playing a new instrument based loosely on a chalkboard. Some people like this, I'm sure; I don't. That's why I gave it one star. Sorry if this is unhelpful, but I'm unfamiliar with the whole \\"noise\\" genre. I, personally, prefer a little melody here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I have a lot of respect for FLA.. But not this. This is garbage. Amazing programming.. But why in the hell do they insist on the terrible vocals? This CD would benefit so much more if these songs were instrumentals..

Then it suddenly started to go through batteries - I would say a new set of batteries for every 20 point-and-shoot pictures taken! I contacted GE about the problem and they were aware of it. They directed me to a patch download to address the issue. The patch worked for about a day then the problem resumed. It did take some good pictures while it worked, but I wish this camera would have lasted a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great options for the price","review":"I like the look of this camera, and the price is great. It takes great pictures and has a lot of features. You can take pictures in black/white, sepia, panorama and the camera has a good manual setting feature. There is a little lag time once the picture is taken, so it is not good for successive shots or catching action events. The LCD screen is also very shiny and can be difficult to see in very sunny conditions, but if you hold your hand over the screen it works fine. I am overall very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it, but...","review":"Quit working for me after about 6 months.

GE replaced the first camera because it stopped working during our vacation. (8 months after we bought it.) They replaced it because it was a manufacturer's defect and they replaced it with a refurbished model. The second one didn't perform as well as the first one. It was sluggish- sometimes needing to press the shutter button 3 times for just one picture. It was nice as a backup though. The size was nice and the fact that it needed 2- AA batteries was very convenient. The second one decided to quit working at my grandma's funeral. (6 months after GE replaced it). Absolutely no warning that it was failing. Let me down once, shame on you, let me down twice- shame on me. I will not be replacing the camera with another GE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wast your cash","review":"Very frustrating. I purchased this in spite of the many reviews about the battery life. After researching a bit it seemed that doing a firmware upgrade takes care of the problem...it doesn't. I have yet to take more than one picture with ANY type of battery. Rechargables don't work at all, lithium takes a picture then dies so there is no way to download, special camera batteries were no better. Spent $35 in batteries and no camera. The batteries are still powering my old camera though so they aren't a total waste. GE was no help. So either spend extra to get the battery issue solved or get lucky and get one without a battery issue. Would not recommend this to anyone, regardless of the price. Stick with Canon or Sony, I've never had an issue with either of those brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good for price","review":"This is a ok protuce good for th price.The video recorder does have sound but the words go faster then the pic so it gets a little screawed up .From the picture stand point it is alright not that great, some days it take very blurry pics.The batterie life is pretty bad i go trough so much batterie with this.The portiblety is alright to it wont fit in your pocket onless your a guy.The colors great!

When she began taking pictures with it, horizontal lines began appearing across the screen. It did the same once the image was downloaded to the computer. We tried a different SD card, but that did not make a difference. We contacted the Online Company we purchased it from (Tiger Direct), and they told us to contact the manufacturer. We did that and they had us mail them the camera. Six weeks later, the camera was returned to us in the same condition with a note that they were unable to fix the problem and couldn't do any more for us. So now we're trying to figure out what else we can possibly do to have the situation corrected.

The author captures the wit and fun of the TV dialogue. I laughed out loud especially at the Scarlet O'Hara from Hell. Buffy is forced to face a trial by an ancient force.

If the timer is on the frig, manipulating the buttons is very awkward. I think a left-handed person would find it even more so.

The ladies go on a cruise, but they return to the same problems after their vacation is over. There are some things to celebrate, such as the birth of a baby and a wedding date being set. In my opinion, the subplots concerning Grace's young friend, Lucy, are a bit awkward and seem out of place, and the one in this book is no exception. I feel that the books are popular because they show that senior citizens can still lead active and useful lives and the characters comprise a warm and intertwined extended family.

That is all I had ever used or tried. Thought I might try a foil since it was cheap and had a 30 day return. Amazed at how much quicker it is than the rotary models. Shaves way closer...no comparison! I can't imagine getting a closer shave. For $25 it is an unbelievable shaver...not sure why anybody would pay more. My shave time was cut in half if not more. Rotary model was slow...foil very fast. One to two passes at most on face...Chin and neck take a little longer.Weaknesses...makes a mess in the sink and doesn't do as well on the neck or under the chin, but neither do the rotary shavers.

If you listen closely you can definately hear remnants of \\"Its Better To Travel\\", \\"Kaleidoscope World\\", \\"The Living Return\\" and so on. Swing Out Sisters' one unfailed characteristic is that they always sound like THEMSELVES. This album reminds me that they even sound like their early selves.....like they have come full circle.

I tried out the new one and it never even acknowledges that there is a cd in the unit at all and would spin for a second or two and then show 00 on the display and never play at all.I am very dissapointed in this item and think that the entire product line must be defective.I really hate that I have to return a gift at all.

When playing a CD, it often skips in places that my other CD player doesn't, and sometimes even stops for no apparent reason. The only good point of it is that it has nice, big numbers, but I don't it's worth buying this just for that. Don't buy this, please; it's dangerous to have radios flying out of windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"This unit worked well for a month or so then started stopping in the middle of a song. Sometimes it will start again - other times it will not play no matter what you do. The radio is just about useless as the tuning is so tight it is hard to line up a station.

I did not really care about the characters and felt they needed more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella","review":"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister is a basic Cinderella story, except that it is told from the ugly stepsisters point of view. Plus their are other little twists like the stepsisters are all friends, and Clara (Cinderella) chooses to clean and stay inside, no one forces her to do anything she doesn't want to. This book is a very good fantasy novel, especially if you like the story of cinderella. I liked this book because I really love fantasy novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Reading...","review":"I'm not too far into the book, but so far I'm bored out of my mind. It seems like a chore to read it. I hope it gets better soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That Was...Underwhelming","review":"I'm not sure I understand what everyone saw that was so great about this book. I practically had to school myself to read a chapter every night. The plot moved at a snail's pace, and the constant references to how perfectly perfect the Cinderella character was grated on me after a while. I get it already! She's gorgeous! As for the story itself, I kept waiting for something to happen...but nothing did. Until the end that is, when we get that huge \\"twist\\" that no one but me saw coming a mile away. I am usually a fan of fantasy and science fiction, but I found the references to the supernatural in this book to not fit somehow. They didn't really add anything to the plot (except for the obligatory \\"tension\\" for our narrator and \\"depth\\" for the pretty girl), and took away from whatever action was already going on. The only thing keeping me from giving this book one star is the characters Schoonmaker and Caspar, who are the only ones I enjoyed through the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Surreal","review":"Beautiful prose packs each page to convey the story of \\"Cinderella\\" from a stepsister's point of view. Which stepsister? It is up to the reader to find out. Their mother is a ferocious survivor; full of attitude and determination she is to keep her family of three from being homeless and starving. She is wicked and crooked, observed the people but is she really a witch? The reader gets to discover the truth. From start to finish, it seems that Mr. Maguire is supplying his readers with a conventional art of arguing about a few important aspects of life. Each character is emotional by right. The plot revolves around family ties and their schemes in keeping each other from succumbing to ruins. Also, each is with an agenda of one's own. If \\"Cinderella\\" the fairytale is a summarized version of a long story, then this narration details the behind-the-scene actions, at least in Mr. Maguire's perspective which turns out to be quite enthralling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Although not as interesting and in depth as Wicked, Confessions is a simply lovely book.

Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the trouble","review":"The books of Maguire were touted as \\"reimagining of classic fairy tales.\\" Ummm. . .no. I was sorely disappointed to find that the books merely took loosely adapted generic characters from classic fairy tales, and then used them in stale, overbearingly boring political stories. I ordered Mirror, Mirror. . Wicked. . .Confessions. . .and Lost. . . and reading them was pure punishment. While well written for what they are, I suppose, they are not as described. They are not for people who love fantasy, nor are they for people who remeber the classic stories of youth with fondness. They are for people who feel the need to punish theirselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the real Cinderella version","review":"I picked this book up with the excitement that it would share the ugly stepsisters side of things, but keep the basic plot the same as most Cinderella stories. However, this was not Cinderella. In this Clara is rude, and seems like a brat. The ending doesn't make her seem very much better either.It was difficult to care for any of the characters except maybe Iris, who at times seemed a little bit of a brat as well. I'm open to other versions of this story, but this is definately not anything really close to Cinderella. I'd suggest reading Elle Enchanted or watching Ever After. Those two versions are amazing and in Ever After you even have a stepsister who is kind and one can care deeply about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted My Money","review":"The title was the best part of this book.

Force this poseur to find a job."},{"rating":"2","title":"And they lived happily ever after ...","review":"The readers of this book, that is. Gregory McGuire has hit another one out of the park with \\"Confessions.\\" Following up on \\"Wicked,\\" the first of McGuire's expanded fairy tales, \\"Confessions ...\\" tells the story behind the story of Cinderella.Childhood fairy tales, true to their intended audiences, tell stories of black and white, good and evil. Once we all grow up, though, we realize that the world is many shades of gray. McGuire's stories reflect that adult knowledge. That is why this story is so fun to read. I voraciously read fairy tales as a child, and McGuire has allowed me to revisit the stories of my childhood while entrancing me as an adult. His are quick reads, which is somewhat disappointing, because the end always comes too soon.I cannot recommend this book highly enough, and I will be waiting for my 'prince in shining armor' to write me another grown-up tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than Wicked","review":"I loved Wicked, but I loved this one even more. Every new book from Gregory Maguire just gets more fun. Maybe I'm alone in this, but I really didn't see the end coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writing but Rushed at the End","review":"I was very impressed by this book. I loved that the Cinderella story was appropriated for a historical fiction novel. I got to know the characters very well, could sympathize with them, and they felt very human. It was a very enjoyable book to read.Two small issues, however...1. The ending felt quite rushed! It took almost the entire book to get to the ball, and just pages later, the book was over.2. I only recognized strong similarities between the original Cinderella story and this story in the second half of the book. Maguire failed to relate his story to Cinderella early on.Overall, I was very pleased, and would certainly recommend it to others. No regrets!!! And I learned a lot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, disturbing, heartbreaking.","review":"A convincing, sobering reinterpretation of the story of Cinderella. Who exactly was Cinderella? How did she come to live with two ugly stepsisters and a domineering stepmother? Was her beauty a blessing or a curse? And what exactly did transpire the night of that fateful ball, when she was suddenly \\"freed\\" from her bondage? And what of the morning after?This book is not for children; it's for adults. Its portrayal of human nature approaches that found in \\"Peyton Place.\\" To quote from the text: \\"In the lives of children, pumpkins can turn into coaches, mice and rats into human beings. When we grow up, we learn that it's far more common for human beings to turn into rats.\\"The import of this story, and the lives of its characters, will stay with you long after you turn the last page. And if you should happen upon a brave little tulip on a blustery Spring day, you will remember Clara, Iris, and Ruth . . . and perhaps shed a tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is an excellent read. The story is very well told. Part fairy tale, part mystery, part romance, it has a little bit for everyone. The twist in the the epilogue through me for a loop and was completely unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suitable followup to \\"Wicked\\"","review":"You'll never look at a fairytale the same way again. That's a good thing, in many ways. \\"Confessions\\" strips the myths we grew up with: happy endings, beauty guarantees happiness, and renders reality.Yes, pumpkins do turn into coaches, but more often, humans turn into rats....\\"Confessions\\" is narrated by one of the Ugly Stepsisters, who tells the tale from her perspective. You're left with more questions and answers but that's the way of a truly thought-provoking book. One of the best retellings I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ugly Stepsister surprised me!","review":"This book spent a fair amount of time feeling a bit overcast to me; I got the impression that Mr. Maguire was visualizing a very grey city, with dark grey cloud cover daily, and exceedingly drab clothing. Our introduction to his Cinderella was wonderful, and her regression into the ashes was quite elegant. Iris (the younger Ugly Stepsister) was an incredible leading woman, as are all Mr. Maguire's leading women, and she told quite the tale. The plot twists were a bit surprising at times, a few were rather detectable. By the end, I found myself breathless and was sad that I had read the last of my collection of Gregory Maguire novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, boring","review":"i thought this book would tell an exciting story based on the classic fairytale \\"cinderella\\". it did tell a tale but it was soo very slow that i couldn't wait for it to end so i could read something else. maguire does develop the characters and story that precede the magnificent ball in the classic tale. what he fails to do is make you give a damn about any of the characters so the story makes little or no positive impression on you. i was bored from the get go and only finished it because it was a book club book. don't think i have the gumption to read \\"wicked\\" despite the positive reviews i've read on amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked it is not","review":"This story had a lot of promise, a great beginning, a tolerable middle, and a complete let down of an ending in which Cinderella becomes a harlot in a back salon and then produces a series of brat princes and princesses as little more than an ordinary although royal housewife. It's hard to love or care for any of the characters as they are all so 2 dimensional. We see only symptoms of problems rather than their roots and are left with little or no resolution for most of them.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Tale of Deception and Fate","review":"You've all heard the tale of Cinderella. You know girl is ruled by Evil stepmother and stepsisters, girl has fairy Godmother, girl goes to ball, girl gets guy. Yay! Everybody lives happily ever after . . . but what if that was the wrong story? Have you ever wondered if that was all there was to the tale? What if the story tellers got it wrong and Cinderella wasn't so destitute after all and the stepsisters wern't so evil? This is what Confessions is all about. Imagine a poor family of three: Mother, and two daughters. And through vairius twists of fate, end up in a beautiful house with a pampered brat of a girl to suddenly call family. Not very apealing is it? This is the story of the innocent stepsisters who were berated by society and hurt by their own stepsister, Cinderella. It's an amazing story about love, hate, and hurt. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"We-ell......","review":"I was severely disappointed by this book. It had none of the quirkiness of Wicked, nor did it have the intelligence and parallels to history that gave Wicked it's flavor. It's OK, don't get me wrong... But don't waste the 16 bucks. Get it from the library if you MUST read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dark retelling.","review":"This was a great book. That said, I absolutely hated it. It's strange, being able to recognize that something is very good but still to hate it. I feel the same way about Steinbeck and the movie 21 Grams.The characters were vivid and deep and interesting, which is greatly important to me. The story was very dark, and I guess I may need to consider the possibility that such a dark story is simply not to my taste. I found this book to be one of the most draining I've ever read, with Wicked still up there as number one. I still have Mirror Mirror on my shelf waiting to be read, because I keep thinking that as talented as this author is, maybe I'll like other pieces of his work, but isn't the definition of insanity to do the same thing repeatedly and expect a different result? Maybe I'll give that other book to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"If you enjoy a different take on classic fairy tails this is a good read.

Having read all, however, I'd have to say COAUS was my favorite.I think if you read this book, you'd either love it or hate it. My mom tried reading it and couldn't get past the prologue. I read it, and bawled my eyes out in the epilogue.It was a bit slow, but that's the style of his books. From what I gather, you're supposed to savour every word and detail.Iris is incredibly likeable, as is her older sister (don't remember the name).I loved both the novel and stage adaptation of Wicked, and didn't think anything could beat it, but COAUS is my favorite book. Mirror Mirror was also thrilling, but there really wasn't much read there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tale","review":"Maguire has done an excellent job in presenting a well known tale in an entirely new manner. This is a must read for anyone who has seen Disney's Cinderella and wondered about the truth behind the two ugly stepsisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Wicked series, thought I would give his other books a try...","review":"I must say that I am extremely disappointed with this book. I LOVED the Wicked series (though, I haven't had the chance to read the final book yet) and was fairly excited to learn that he has written other books as well. I love \\"fairy tales with a twist.\\" This book was in stock at my local library, and I was stoked. Then I read it. I can be an extremely fast reader, especially if the book I'm reading is captivating...but this was a whole different story. I finished this one quickly, because simply put, it was extremely short. Absolute snore fest. I couldn't believe this was the same author. So thankful I didn't go out and waste my money by purchasing this book like I had his others. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending (non spoiler)","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely, until the end. There was so much rich, authentic detail, interesting setting in Holland during the Tulip Craze, and new sympathy and a new way of looking at the characters.What was a real downer was the ending. After some scenes of intense tension, the ball, the prince, the disguise, etc, there's a climactic scene of confrontation back at home where some very upsetting secrets are revealed, and then-- huh?? What? That's it? It's over!It's like we never get to actually see what happens. It's like the last chapter is missing.There's a flashback summary in an old lady's voice, reminiscing about the other long-dead characters, from which we can figure out what happened.But after getting so into the story, I would have liked to experience the ending too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine, moving book","review":"The novel is both an imaginative retelling of the \\"Cinderella\\" story and a meditation on what it means to see, honestly and truly. Maguire creates complex characters: in particular, prickly Iris and the mesmirizing \\"wicked stepmother\\" Margarethe. The seventeenth century Haarlem setting is vividly drawn and the author's respect for painting is very apparent and welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"See \\"Cinderella\\" from a new and different view...","review":"I tend to like it when authors take traditional stories with famous protagonists and tell it all from another point of view (recent examples include The Red Tent, The History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters). This book is no exception. In fact, it's intriguing because it shows that even in \\"fairy tales\\", things are not necessarily black and white. There isn't a good guy or a bad guy...just lots of grey folks in between (notice that the title is Confessions of an *Ugly* Stepsister, not a wicked one). Whole people, with virtues as well as faults. You end up having sympathy for just about every character in this tale. I think I'll be reading Wicked real soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella Re-imagined: A Fun Book","review":"OK, so it's no masterpiece, but it's fun, light and extremely imaginative.What I love about this book is that none of the characters are caricatures. Cinderella is not your run-of-the-mill enslaved beauty, the evil step-mother has some redeeming qualities, and the ugly step-sisters may be ugly, but they are rich in personality. Gone too are the fairy god-mothers, mice turned coachmen and magic that fades at midnight of the original fairy tale.The backdrop for the story is Harlem, a Dutch town in the 1630s at the height of the tulip craze. By the way, to find out more about the tulip craze, read the excellent book \\"Tulipomania\\", by Mike Dash.Bottom line: this book is a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect a Nobel Prize winning novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this book was confusing at parts and it lacked detail also the story was dull don't read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cindersmella","review":"This book is nowhere near the best I've ever read. Of course, I've read more than two books, the first one not being \\"Wicked\\" or \\"See Spot Run\\". An interesting premise that turned into ennui by the end of the first chapter. I like to give books a hundred pages, in the hope that it will get better, unfortunately, didn't happen this time. Don't be fooled by the number of pages either, the print is for a grade two level, frankly, so is the content. I wouldn't recommend it to my dog, and I hate my dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Boring","review":"Ugly Stepsister was the reading choice of my book club and it was roundly disliked. The choice was based on the much better received Wicked, which I have not read.The book was extremely slow to start. Although the characters were interesting, the writing itself was flat and uninspiring. It took me four weeks just to get through the first 100+ pages. By the date of the book club, seven weeks after I started the book, I still hadn't finished. In fact, the only reason I finished it was that I'd promised my fellow club members I would.Our next book club read is Middle Sex (or Middlesex), which I hope is a better read. I can't imagine it will be much less entertaining. Thank goodness Harry Potter is being delivered next week so I can get the memory of Ugly Stepsister out of my head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After all the hype that followed Wicked, I felt compelled to pick this one up. Mistake!After getting through a fairly promising start to the book, it slogged on until the very end, where it got interesting again (if not wholly unrealistic).Not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit!","review":"I did love \\"Confessions of an Ugly Step-Sister\\". The story was told well, and there was more closure to this story than there was to \\"Wicked\\" (not as many unanswered questions).However, I have noticed a trend with ALL Maguire books and that is the painfully slow beginings. It took me several days to get through the first 80 pages, and I nearly put the book down and gave up. HOwever, around page 80 or so, I was unable to put the book down and read it in 2 days. I also felt \\"Wicked\\" was slow to start for the first 50 pages or so, and then -the same thing the story took off and I read it in a day or 2.The beginings of Maguire's books are necessary because he gives you so much background information right off the bat. It is just hard to read. But I assure you - get yourself through the begining and you will be happy you did!Also, if you're expecting the Disney Fairytale stay away from this book. It is Pleasantly unlike any Cinderella tale I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the version with a pumpkin and fairy godmother","review":"Who else in the world was tired of the hearing about how Cinderella was so perfect and tortured? I was. So I got this and I loved it. Cinderella ( Clara ) for once is not the center if the story and I like her better for it. Her faults actually allowed me to like the charactor more. The stepsisters are still wrectched but their side of the story is as trajic as Clara's.Gregory is such a good writer. He dares to challenge the original outlook and makes it delightfully dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and compelling","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read Maguire's \\"Wicked\\" first and then this one. I thought this was a much easier read than Wicked was, and it really explained the story behind the story of Cinderella. I liked that it was unexpected and showed the characters for who they really are."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED THIS BOOK","review":"I picked this to read before i got on to read the much hyped Wicked. I can not impress on anyone how much I love this book. It is deeply and richly explains motivation and the feelings in any Cinderella story. Enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so glum, Cinderella?","review":"Maguire's retelling of the Cinderella tale is not without interest or insights. Despite the stilted dialogue, the characters become human. But the novel lacks humor and spirit. The story the author presents ultimately becomes as drained of spirit as its setting Holland is drained of seawater. It's a depressive interpretation. Cinderella's tale becomes one of scandal, but without tabloid titillation -- only a matter-of-fact sombreness. *SPOILER* What point is there in having the Prince deflower the Cinderella character at the ball? Just more proof to show what \\"rats\\" we mortals be? As for the book's ending twist, though it's unexpected and initially jawdropping, it's hard to swallow when you think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Beautiful","review":"After a long (but good) semester of reading only classical greek literature, I looked to this book for a break. I got it because it seemed light and an easy read. It was a quick read, but at the same time immensely compelling. Maguire has an elegant sense of phrase and a skill for his craft. It definatly left me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragging","review":"I felt the whole story was dragging and slow paced. The concepts in the story are nothing new. The writing is mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow storyline and rushed ending","review":"I was looking forward to this book but in the end, I was really disappointed. The action through 3/4 of the book moved at a snail's pace and then the end was rushed. The story was more about Iris than it was about Clara (which was fine and as it should be) but the end epilogue gave Iris a mere 2 paragraphs while Clara was talked about for almost a page and a 1/2. The story was incomplete- What actually happened to each of the characters? Why in the world did the author, Gregory Maguire, end the book so bluntly? You can tell there's more but what happened to it?I hope \\"Wicked\\" is better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Cinderella...behind the scenes. A wonderful extension of the Cinderella story and more backstory on the ugly stepsisters. So enticing, and reminds you of your childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella with a Twist","review":"I liked this book as much as Wicked, perhaps even more. I loved the historical touch to it as well as the portrayal of the ugly stepsisters. The history of the Dutch Tulip market crash was amazing and well researched. I loved that it touched on paintings by old Dutch masters. Iris was a wonderful, compmlex character as were Clara and Ruth. Margarethe was absolutely chilling in her plotting and social climbing. I believe this is by far the best version of Cinderella to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, grown up non-fairytale!","review":"I tend to enjoy books like Wicked, that take the archetypes and turn them on their heads. This book does that as well- it's just my flavor, and I like how the author takes fairy-tale characters and makes them new. Maguire certainly tells a great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"People had been raving to me about this author for months, and I was hyped to finally read one of his books, only to be let down greatly. He writes a good story, but doesn't actually write it all that well. While I liked the overall plot, it was very slow and tedious. The story takes far too long to actually catch your attention, and then is littered with pointless imagery that doesn't add to the story at all. (I.E. discribing how urine steams when it hits a cold floor)Truely, I did like the story, but I think he could have tried to write it better. In a high school writting class this would have easily been grade as a C."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed somewhat","review":"I've read Wicked first and perhaps that was where the mistake lies. Wicked was so well written that after reading such a great novel, Confessions was somewhat of a disappointment. It's not a bad novel but the character development was just par and the storyline seemed a bit forced. I would love to recommend Wicked though for those who might be interested. I even bought the soundtrack from the Broadway show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I reading a different book?","review":"I think I must have been reading a different book, because for the life of me I can't understand what all of these people found to love here. I thought \\"Confessions...\\" was boring, dreary, and plotless. It just seemed to go on and on with no end in sight. Maybe I just didn't \\"get\\" it, but in my humble opinion this book is a definite miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted and moving","review":"I never write reviews on here, but I just finished this book and I have to say it was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I will never look at Cinderella the same way again. This book doesn't just retell the story from another point of view, it does so by creating characters you connect with and pulling you into the story so much that you forget it's the same old fairy tale. I admit it's a little slow in the beginning, and it took me a few chapters to get totally into it, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. I expected this to be one of those stories where the Stepsister tells her side of the story, putting all the blame on Cinderella, but what I found was a truly moving story where there isn't a real villain, just three sisters who are all products of a dysfunctional family.I seriously reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from Wicked, equally absorbing","review":"In his two adult books, Macquire seems to take one premise and then explore them in character studies. In Wicked, that led him all over the place in terms of characters, plot, and pacing. In Confessions, he looks at the concept of \\"of what use is beauty?\\" and spins a much more focused and tightly drawn narrative than we saw in Wicked. One stylistic approach he used was the tense of the story, it does take getting used to. Instead of saying something like \\"Iris went to the window and looked out onto the town square\\", he says \\"Iris goes to the window, looks out at the town square\\". I can't recall another book written this way. It might put off people from the thematic elements of the story.Once again, we see how all things are relative depending on the perspective of the person(s) involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking from cover to cover!","review":"Gregory Maquire has done it again! He entranced us with Wicked, forever changing the way we watched The Wizard of Oz. And now he has given us a gift with his second novel, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister. Stunning in every way, I read Confessions so very slowly, because I didn't want it to end. What more can you ask for in a novel? Do yourself a favor and make Maquire a part of your life. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of telling the real story","review":"Gregory Maguire first caught my attention with his brilliant retelling of the Wizard Of OZ and so when I saw that he'd worked his magic on Cinderella I was anxious to see where he would take it, he didn't let me down. It is impossible to review Confessions without comparing it to his earlier piece Wicked - and for good reason. Part of what will form your opinions of both pieces is the order in which you read them, because whichever you read first will become your favorite of the two - the reason is the surprise and joy you'll get from the way he retells these stories, but when you read the second book, you know what to expect from the other. But what it all boils down to is they are both brilliant and fun reads. Don't choose, just read them both!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very old favorite.","review":"I don't really care for country music other than Willie.

Although 17 out of the 19 stories were not personally written by the refugees themselves and that the voices of the people in my opinion were greatly oversimplified, the author is acknowledged for her effort to compile this list of stories together so that this phenomenon, unknown to many people in the world, is not to be obsolete (thank you for writing this book). I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Vietnamese or Vietnamese-American culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Composting Toilet Book","review":"Del Porto's book is the definitive composting toilet book at this time. There is nothing even close. His book covers all aspects of composting toilet systems and touches on graywater issues as well. He treats the composting toilet as part of the home system. If a person is seriously interested in installing/having a composting toilet, this book can save him/her all of the mistakes people usually make. He even (carefully) explodes some of the advertising myths that the purveyors of composting toilets would have us believe. The book covers ready-made systems as well as home built sytems. As trite as this sounds, the book truly is a must for someone considering intstalling composting toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book to read while your sitting on the pot.","review":"This book was well worth the wait. Whether you want to buy a system, or build one, if it's not covered in this book, then chances are it doesn't exist. It covers wet and dry toilets, self-contained composters and also cental units. What I like about this book is that it discusses the pros and cons of each type of design in a very straight forward manner. The authors did a very nice job on this book. If you ever plan on, or are even thinking about a compost toilet system, buy this one now. I leave my copy on my coffee table for guests, it always stirs up a conversation.

And so, Bo and H.F. take a road trip to Florida only to find a new world and a new relationship for themselves. Along the way they make new friends and enjoy new experiences outside of the \\"southern U.S. bubble\\". If you like the book Girl Goddess #9 by Francesca Luis Block, you will love this book. However, I recommend this book only to girls that are in the eighth grade and above because the details and concept require a mature attitude towards the theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I was browsing through a gay bookstore in atlanta and just happend upon this book. Now I can't get enough! The characters really come alive off the page and I think many who read will relate to either Bo or H.F. I know I certainly did! The books main focus is about a young lesbian in Kentucky but as a gay male I found the entire thing to be a true work of art! I really enjoyed Ms. Watts book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A difficult but essential read","review":"This book is not easy to read. The \\"Jane Doe\\" in this case had a difficult life and was ill used by her spouse, family and the system.

Smallest I have seen ever, plus it doesn't use a giant power supply as is typical of most external drives.

It will corrupt your drive as well as give you endless error messages. Don't believe me? Search for Prolific PL3507 on the web and you will see it is a problematic chipset for everyone who tries to use this drive via firewire.If you will only use USB2.0 then go for it. USB is much more reliable (most of the time) althought it will invariably be slower.

That design was extremely annoying to me since the velcro was very strong and would not let go of the inside of the bag. That wass the main reason I returned the item. As for capacity, it does have enough room but not in a very convenient way. I bought this for a Pentax K-X with two lenses, one of which is a 55-300. That lens did not fit in the bottom compartments. So I needed to have the longer lens attached to the camera and in the top compartment. Then the shorter lens would go in one of the bottom compartments and the other one would be empty. Not very efficient for me. And again I emphasize, accessing the bottom compartments is extremely inconvenient because of the velcro design.The build quality however is excellent, very solid, and it looks great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag!","review":"Thid bag fit my camera, two lenses, and some extras (like batteries and remote).

I use the small top zipper compartment to carry the shoulder strap when not is use. I took all three of the velcro dividers out of the main compartment and stored them in the small zippered front compartment.

Collection of short stories or not, it was too disjointed to grow an attachment to any of the characters.I guess I feel like I was being lectured by the author about why people feel the way that they do in relationships. It was pretty boring and I'm pretty surprised that it's being made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What looked like a promising book was a disapointment","review":"I read this book up until page 104. Then all of a sudden the story jumps to some inane story that has nothing to do with Jane. This book should have kept going with the Jane character and not jumped in the middle of the book to another unknown story. And if Jane was so practical, why did she knowingly get involoved with this older man? The author really never quite tells us what Jane sees in him,what the attraction is. Promising book, but needs a good rewriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing read","review":"While I wouldn't say reading this book was a waste of time, it definitely wasn't the best book I have ever read. The main character, Jane, is very endearing. She reminded me very much of myself as a teenager. However, I found the book to be very misleading. I was under the impression that the was a novel; instead it is a collection of short stories, and not a very good one at that.The stories do not seem to follow any particular chronological order, and I found the second story to be completely misplaced. What was the purpose of placing this story into the book? The \\"book\\" seems to focus on Jane, yet there is only one reference to the main character in passing.I think Ms. Banks has the ability to capture her readers with her realistic portrayal of the characters, but her ability to write as novel definitely needs improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try again Ms. Banks","review":"This book was over hyped not to mention way over rated. Someone compared the author to JD Salinger. Well that ought to send him in to further reclusion! This author need to get it together. She has the potential to be a good writer but she needs to find the right story and she needs to stick to that story and not wander off. I can't imagine what people found good about this story that includes a couple of chapters unrelated to the rest of the book. I will read her next book ( I like to give all authors at least a second chance)but if it is not any better it will be my last book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant and adorable","review":"The author must coincide with the character in this book. She's just so descriptive and passionate about every detail that she entices the reader into such drama and humor. Ruth Ozeki quoted about this book that she knew this girl. I think a lot of girls can also."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT READ!","review":"I picked up this book, because I liked the cover.

This book drew me in and I didn't want to put it down until I had finished. Once I had finished, I was sad, but felt like I had met a new friend. It was an easy and fun read. I definitely recommend this as a summer book must-have for any woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I felt like I was reading the story of my life with certain identifying details altered.

Jane is poorly developed and lacks soul-- not to mention gives women a bad name.I'm sure they'll make a movie of this...it's the kind of child Hollywood eats up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This publisher was hard up for new material!","review":"I wasted an hour of my time reading about an undramatic woman's lifetime of trials, tribulations, woes and sorrows. I wish women would quit buying these books that continue to keep them at levels of general mediocrity. Surely, men don't sit around reading soppy books like this. I actually was looking forward to learning about hunting and fishing. The best part of the book was the quotes before each chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a light read","review":"GGHF was recommended to me by an English major friend of mine. It took me a while to finally get around to reading it, but I'm actually glad I did. I'll admit that it wasn't as good as Fielding's Bridget Jones, or a lot of other short fiction that's been hitting the shelves lately, but I wasn't looking for a literary masterpiece. If you want a fairly quick, light read, this is a great book. It's not one to get too overly analytical of, as some readers seem to have done. I read it over the span of a few busy days where I could only pick it up for a few minutes at a time, but I never felt lost. Some stories are poignant, touching, and others are very funny, causing my friends to glance at me warily when I read it during a terribly boring class. Don't read it expecting literary genius, read it expecting a simple set of stories that give us a glimpse into Jane's world, that many of us could identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading several books of this same genre, I was really looking forward to reading a Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing. However to my disappointment I found that I was the one doing the hunting -- for the plot and characters. At the beginning of most chapters I had no idea who the characters were. When she finally gave it away, I had to go back and reread the first few pages to make sure that I was following the story. Then there was one chapter in the middle of the book had absolutely no clear point or correlation with the other characters. Who were those people and why were they there? It was never clear. I think that this book would be better if it was a series of short stories. Each with a begining, a middle, and an end. As for a Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing -I say don't bother. It isn't worth the excursion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and missing a lot of detail","review":"Ugh. That's exactly how I felt after reading this book, which comes across as more of a collection of short stories from parts of one woman's life. The stories are from different parts of this woman's life, but its hard to tell, because there's so many gaps in between the major events in her life, that I actually thought this was about more than one woman. The stories about her life are depressing tid bits, and make her sound like she's continually searching for something in her life, and it comes across as her being desperate. If you enjoy reading about women who are seemingly never happy, then pick this up, you would enjoy it. If you were hoping for a unique and interesting way of telling a life story, you're better off writing your own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"This is one of the better books that I've read recently. It got me really engrossed. The story line is simple yet enchanting. The character Jane might be plain but she's charming in her own way. This book is for girls who had been in love before yet not sure if he's the right guy...As enjoyable as it was,there was this part of the book which I didn't quite catch. It's the chapter \\"The Best Possible Light\\". It talks about \\"Nina's\\" children. It got me quite puzzled as I was not sure if the author was still talking about Jane. If so,why did the kids call her Nina? If anyone can clear my doubt,do feel free to e-mail me. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"To be honest, I cared so little about this book and its characters that I didn't actually finish it, so maybe something amazingly wonderful happened at the end that I've missed. But I doubt that. Though not badly written, the wandering, boring story is certainly not worth buying. Why praise was heaped on this book, I don't know, but it seems lately, any whiny novel about relationships written by a woman is deemed \\"Fabulous\\" by the media. There are plenty of good writers, both female and male, but this genre has been exhausted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the last chapter is worth it....","review":"For all you \\"Rules Girls\\" out there, the last chapter is a scream. Gives a good realistic look at the results you get when you follow the rules and why you might want to think twice. I had a good laugh. However, the last chapter was the books only saving grace. I would have a difficult time recommending this to someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"Once again, I believed the hype surrounding a book and picked it up. I only paid a dollar and I want my money back. I am an English major and I read a lot of great old books, but there is lots of great contemporary fiction out there--this just isn't it. If you really want to read this book,I would recommend that you check it out from the library. It's not worth plunking down money for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series of flat short stories pretending to be a book","review":"I think I'll have to start ignoring reviews. Many critics raved on about The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing, which turns out to be a slim collection of largely flat short stories pretending to be a book. The main problem with Jane, the heroine, is that she isn't very interesting. This leaves a large hole at the centre of the work, one so large in fact that it devours everything else. We meet her as a sassy teenager and then she moves on from one tedious romance to the next -- and suddenly she is married with kids -- and then we're back to the tedious romances -- and suddenly someone has cancer and we think it's Jane -- and we're back to the romances. It all reads as though someone pressed the \\"Random play\\" button on an album and we get the various chapters in no particular order. The writing is crisp and there were a couple of occasions where I laughed out loud, yet none of this can compensate for the vacuum at the centre of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"At the risk of sounding rude, this was one of the most boring, disorganized books I have ever read. I was reading under the midconception that this book was similar to the Bridget Jones series (which I LOVED), but it's not at all like it. If you are looking for something funny, I would skip this one all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This book was very entertaining and it rang so true. The themes could be heavy at times, but is was never depressing. I liked that the chapters were all so different, it provided a sense of the character at different stages in her life. I loved the way the author dealt with all the different relationships the main character has. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl's Guide to Growing Up","review":"This novel was such an enjoyable read. I read it in one day as the Blizzard of 2000 blanketed my entire area and rendered me snowbound. What a delight it was to be curled up with a book that evoked so many emotions: laughter,adolescent angst, sadness, and the feelings that preside during the ebb and flow of relationships.I felt that the author skillfully captured the normal emotions of a girl as she goes through the stages of her life.Her sarcasm had such perfect timing--and was something to which I could relate since I too use sarcasm to express myself.I did feel that some chapters dragged on and one chapter had no real place in the novel, hence the four star instead of a five star rating.I was sad to say goodbye. It felt that I was leaving behind a part of me. I only hope that I can one day find another book that touched me as much as this one--and if I can't I think I will be forced to write one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"might have as well been about hunting and fishing","review":"It was mediocre at best, every review i read explained that it was an amazing insight into being single and what its like. I didn't connect with this at all and regret the purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan","review":"None of these short stories caught my attention. I felt like I was more so skimming the book than actually reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lance's Book Review","review":"Jane or should that be Janie when editing one of the manuscripts remarks that \\"the author wants to be the next Faulkner and maybe he is but i can't get past the first chapter\\". Maybe this is self ironical because when i read it maybe Ms.Bank wants to be the next Helen Fielding (Bridget Jones), Marian Keyes (Lucy Sullivan is getting married) or Terri Paddock (Beware of the Dwarfs) because this novel is disjointed after the first chapter.Some might say because i'm a guy i shouldn't be reading chick flicks but since the success of BJ's Diary i have read other books of this genre.Well if this is the American Version of Bridget Jones, i am terribly disappointed in this bleak New York novel. I recommend you either skip the book or borrow it from your library so that you won't be disappointed that you shelled out your humble dollar on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book get published??","review":"I have to confess that I purchased my copy of \\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" when it first came out in hardback back in 1999 and for next few years it sat in bookcase, well now that I have just finished it, I wish I had just left it where it had been. This book was the worst ever! I can't believe that I bought it. All this time I kept thinking that it was like \\"Bridget Jones\\" and it was not anywhere near the quility of \\"Bridget Jones\\" or any book for that matter. The bottom line that book contains seven short stories and the only thing that ties them together is the main character of Jane. Do your self a big favor and just stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Retarded","review":"This book is badly written. The cover likens it to \\"Diary of Brigid Jones\\" but it's nowhere in that league. Throughout almost the entire book, the mood and narration is dark, with the headstrong \\"heroine\\" jumping from one dysfunctional relationship to another, lonely and full of insecurities. This part was fine.But all of a sudden, in the last chapter, she meets Mr. Right, and finds out that--gasp-- she has not been able to find Mr. Right beforehand because of her overreliance on reading self-help books and acting how \\"everyone\\" told her women should act. NOWHERE beforehand in the book does she even mention a self-help book or playing into some mold of \\"only call back after three days\\" etc; the ending is a complete cop-out. Even the style of the writing does a 360 in order to try and sell. Most of the book left me unsatisifed or sad, but the last chapter or two just plain annoyed me. This writer just tried way too hard to create a chick-novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"This book was no where as good as I thought that it would be. The main character, Jane, is only portayed through random thought and sparse conversation so that you never get a grasp of her character. I honestly did not even realize that this was supposed to be a collection of short stories, because no where on the book cover do you get that idea. That helps to explain the totally random story in the middle that has no relation to the rest. I spent the rest of the book wondering what happened to those characters and when they might appear again. Even as a light/fun read I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"\\"The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" was a book I was skeptical about from the beginning. However, it proved my wrong 10 times over with it's witty remarks, real-life situations, and something virtually everyone can relate to in every page. Melissa Bank succeeds in writing about real-life realistically and still making it readable, relatable, and humorous! I plan on reading it again........I especially enjoyed watching her relationship w/ Archie. I am starting to read the comparable \\"Otherwise Engaged,\\" and hope it is as good as this book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new and refreshing","review":"\\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" by Melissa Bank offers something new and refreshing: an insightful look into modern courtship rituals. The book does this through the eyes of its protagonist Jane who looks at herself and her family and friends to try to find the true meaning of love and happiness in the 90's.I like how the author uses Jane in all but one of her short stories. I even liked the short story that didn't pertain to Jane or her surroundings. It reminded me of a commercial that comes on after watching 15 minutes of a sitcom; it was just a change of pace. I'm anticipating a wonderful writing career for this brilliant new author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I can't believe the accolades this book has received! I found it to be completely fragmented and disconnected. Most of the chapters are written in the first person (Jane, presumably), then in the middle of the book there is a chapter written in the first person (but not Jane). Why? Leaves storylines up in the air. I mean, is that entertainment? Anyone can start something and just not finish it. Very confusing. Also, found Jane's \\"revelations\\" to be dull and flat. No continuity with characters, you never quite know who's who. One of the worst I've ever read. Dry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very East Coast","review":"Perhaps you have to be from the east coast of the USA to appreciate this book. It seemed smug, stilted, and tried too hard to be clever. I found myself wondering how the book was ever published, but I suspect that ties to someone in publishing did the trick. I admit that the title story was the best part. It had better movement and less of a self-pitying tone than the rest of the stories. The good part is that it's a popular book and if I take it to Powell's quickly I'll get an extra buck trade-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked character, didn't like book","review":"I'm not sure I can quickly call to mind another book in which I liked the main character so much but disliked the book itself. Jane was a gem of a gal but I hated what the author did with and to Jane. Pair that with the two weird stories that seemed to have nothing to do with her and I found to book a drudge to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good way to spend an afternoon","review":"This book has been likened to Bridget Jone's, and while I have read and enjoyed them both, I do not think you can easily compare the two. Hunting and Fishing is a much more serious book and deals with issues beyond Ms. Jones. Which is not to say that it isn't funny. It is, but it is blended with growing up, losing a parent, and learning to love and be loved.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I loved this book. Although some of the chapters were confusing! I thought it was romantic, true, beautiful and sad. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true cut and paste...","review":"It's ironic that the main character of this novel started her carreer as an editor, for the book was in desperate need of editing. The chapters were very incongruous and confusing--as if she wrote them all seperately and put them together in a random order. I almost felt as if \\"Jane\\" was a different person in each chapter, and that the collective \\"Jane\\" represented an every-woman. Looking at it that way, the book was not bad. But assuming Jane was the same person throughout the book...I don't know how this got published really. It was written very much on the surface--I saw the book as a person who is afraid to let anyone see his true self. Unfortuantely in this case, the gilded covering was a little too thin--It was plainly visible that there was nothing below the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A REVIEW: PLEASE READ BELOW.

PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR NEED FURTHER INFORMATION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episodic tales of a woman's life and loves.","review":"Melissa Bank's book, \\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" starts promisingly. The first chapter is wry and amusing and I thought that I was in for a real treat. The book seemed to be a tongue-in-cheek look at the life of a modern woman. Unfortunately, Bank chooses to jumble up the plot lines and characters in the different chapters of the book. This is confusing and it left me without a coherent feel for what Bank is trying to say. The narrator, Jane Rosenal, is not even present in one chapter, which is narrated by another woman named Nina. The love affairs recounted in the book are, for the most part, uninteresting and without real insight. There are occasional doses of wit and humor that brighten up the book. However, \\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" doesn't add up to very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterly Dissappointing","review":"This could quite possibly be the worst book I have ever read from cover to cover. Perhaps I fell prey to all of the hype and my expectations were too high. The characters were flat, emotionless, and I never cared at all what was going to happen next. Personally, I am sorry that trees had to die in order for this drivel to be printed."},{"rating":"1","title":"so lame, I threw it across the room","review":"I was anxious to read this because I read one of her stories in Redbook magazine. They advertised it as an exceprt from the book, however, that particular story appeared nowhere in the book. This was the first problem. The second problem was the book itself, which was not a novel, but a bunch of short stories. I was completely unaware of this until I got all the way to the ANNOYING MIDDLE CHAPTER, featuring a completely different protagonist. Finally, it dawns on me. So THAT\\"S the reason she keeps switching tenses! So THAT's the reason she keeps jumping around! So THAT\\"S the reason I hate this book so much I'm throwing it across the room! I think it was a lame effort to publish an unfinished novel in a hurry. She probably sent the first chap out and got a nibble, then ran out of time and since she couldn't get the chaps to gel, she called them short stories instead. Glad I didn't buy it at Borders."},{"rating":"1","title":"so, so","review":"The book seemed gloomy to me. The \\"I said,\\" \\"she said,\\" phrases were too common and stood out like sore thumbs. Many of the lines do not flow. The f-word is used a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry--I'm not getting it","review":"Just read this after several friends raved. Oh boy--yet another whiny thirtysomething looking for love. What an ORIGINAL concept . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just left me feeling... empty.","review":"I was totally psyched to read this book. I had heard so many wonderful things about it. The trouble is, reading it was as boring as peeling potatoes. Nothing happened. Jane is not sexy, savvy or smart. She's not a single NYC gal on the prowl. She's frumpy, boring, and indecisive.This book left me empty. Not because it had a profound effect on my psychological state. I only wish it had! It was just a bore.I detested Bridget Jones' Diary- but would highly recommend it in comparison to this disjointed, confusing and flat book. I gave it to a friend and asked them to read it to see if it really stunk as much as I perceived it did.I do not understand the high volume of 5 stars in these reviews! If you want a good book, read a classic like the Great Gatsby. The girls Guide is not, in any way shape or form, a GREAT book.It's a whole lot of hype.

I found it to be an extremely boring read. The book reads like a journal meaning it is very random and jumpy."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite novel","review":"I am Jane. This book, other than the New England upbringing, mirrors my life. I highly recommend it, as an adult who came into her womanhood by Judy Blume. This is the necessary next step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an exciting read...","review":"I read this book one rainy afternoon. I was not that impressed with Girl's Guide...The first story of Jane as a 14 year old was enjoyable and I was excited to see what would happen as she grew up. I thought her relationship with the man twice her age was boring. The middle of the book dragged on and I began to lose interest. I enjoyed \\"Otherwise Engaged\\" and \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" more than this and would recommend reading them before picking this up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I cried and laughed and fell in love with the realness of Jane. I read this book all day today and had to go to a dinner party before I finished the last 15-20 pages.

The 'precious' little stories that appeared from nowhere at different parts of the book stifled the narrative and distracted from the story of Jane's romantic entanglements. Simply put-not satisfying or engaging at any point. See Marian Keyes if you want to read something of this ilk that doesnt leave you cold. I found myself not the slightest bit concerned how any of the characters lives panned out and then wanted to 'barf' when Mr Too Good to be True strode in through all that predictable doom and gloom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I put this book on my Christmas wish list because of all the reviews I had read about it in various media. However, once I read it, I was very disappointed in it. It is supposed to be a collection of short stories with a central charactoer, Jane. However, in the middle of the book the author swithes gears and writes a story about the family that lives below Jane's elderly aunt that has nothing to do with Jane at all. Then later on there is another story about a women with cancer that doesn't seem to have any connection with the rest of the book. I also felt no empathy for the herorine of the book at all. I think the author could do a better job at making the reader feel for Jane, but it just doesn't happen. Save your money, buy a better book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A TIME KILLER WHILE ON VACATION","review":"I bought this book while on vacation. I was looking for something light and fluffy and entertaining - nothing deep. The review on the jacket led me to believe something different about the content. I was disappointed in the overall story, but I did read the entire book. I couldn't get \\"into\\" Jane's character. I was pretty much glad when I'd finished reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover was better than the book","review":"I bought this book because I needed a new book and liked the cover and title. I was disappointed. Maybe I have read too many similar better-written books. Nothing happens in this book and that usually doesn't bother me but the main character was also a bit of a nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining novel","review":"Of course this is to be compared with Bridget Jones, and many have compared it unfavorably. Although this one is obviously a more serious look at a woman's development, I don't find it to be a stronger book, just a different one. It is well written, sometimes a bit too self-consciously witty, but overall a rather realistic portrait of a young woman's lessons in life and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Went NOWHERE!","review":"I really disliked the writing style used in this book. None of the chapters flow together, and the speaker is unidentifiable in certain chapters. Most of the book is told 1st person by Jane, and then there are a few RANDOM chapters where you have no idea who the speaker is, nor the purpose of the chapter. I could have skipped 2 or 3 chapters and not have missed anything. Jane as a character is dull and flat. Even though most of the story is first person (Jane) I never got to know much of Jane's inner feelings or thoughts. Reading this book was such a waste of time, I thought it would get better but there was no continuity throughout the book, and certainly no beginning, middle or end. The ending was pathetic, if there even was one. Nothing was resolved throughout the book, and nothing exciting ever happens. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unfunny","review":"I found no humor in this book. I guess it's difficult for me to laugh at someone who obviously has too many issues to effectively deal with. I had heard that this was a good book and had gotten good reviews--I guess I shouldn't listen to others. Jane tried too hard to be funny and made way too many stupid mistakes for me to even like her. She was so neurotic, that it reminded me of that foolish \\"Ally McBeal\\" show on television (which I can't stand). I only read the whole thing to find out what happened--I thought it had to get better, but it didn't. I've passed the book on to my 30 year old sister. Maybe she'll like it--but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an odd, disjointed little book.","review":"I chose the title since I'd remembered its publicized debut. Now, I'm wondering why a first-time author reaped so much acclaim, and why I'm not endeavoring to join the club. The novel is really a collection of short stories; one unrelated chapter comes in out of left field. The protagonist rattles off caustic one-liners, behaves stupidly and exhibits minimal emotional growth. I could not sympathize or empathize one whit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries too hard to be funny!","review":"The main aspect of this novel that made me dislike it was the humor- it is so forced and contrived! She ends each episode with a \\"witty\\" remark and it gets old FAST. An abrupt switch of characters in the middle of the book made no sense, and then those characters are never re-visited again, so you might as well skip that chapter. A fast read, and interesting enough to keep you going, if you just feel like reading something. Some good points are made about dating and how women think they should behave, but that's about it....and these are made in the very last chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed something","review":"I really enjoyed this book - until page 109. For 169 more pages I read in confusion. I just didn't get it. Things switched, they didn't flow, a whole \\"chapter\\" about a family that is never referred to before or again. I had to log on to see what others said about this book. How did I miss that it was a collection of short stories? For 109 pages things seemed great - I liked the characters, the wit and the writing. But then things changed and I felt blindsided, cheated and utterly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher Ripping off Author and Reader","review":"You have got to be kidding me. As of this writing, the Kindle price for this book is 12.99. I own the book and it is one of my favorite chick lit books. I thought I'd buy it for my Kindle but at 12.99? You can pick this book up in any used bookstore for 1.00! I hope the author and other authors realize how publishers are ruining potential profits and scaring away readers. Please authors, sign with publishers that look out for your (and your readers) best interest. Had this ebook been priced at 5.99 (it's an OLD book) I would have one clicked in a heart beat. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catcher in the wry","review":"Holden Caulfield, meet Jane. Soulmates, these two. Although Holden went brilliantly mad and Jane ambles on through life. I enjoyed this book, yet it was sad and strangely disturbing, as if one shouldn't enjoy reading about another's pain. The short stories are cleverly crafted to flow in and out of each other. It's a good book but too fragile to stand up to heavy doses of analysis. Read it and enjoy it and let it simmer a little bit. I think Jane is someone you will remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, real and inspiring; sheer entertainment","review":"Last summer, I laughed at and raved about Bridget Jone's Diary; this year it's The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing. Though both are novels of the smart and witty urban everywoman, I don't see Jane as a rip-off of Bridget as other readers have. The Guide has a contemplative tone, dry, American humor and a protagonist you'll love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written girl story","review":"This is the sweetest book! Melissa Bank has such sensitivity for her characters! And her main character isn't necessarily so likeable -- you can choose to like her or not to like her -- but she makes mistakes; we care about her; she's a real person. Melissa conveys such depth with such simplicity... She makes mistakes too: She falters somewhat in \\"The Best Possible Light\\" and \\"My Old Man\\". But she cares so much that it's hard not to be enraptured by the beauty of this novel. The last story is the best, but even better if you save it until you've read the other stories first to lead up to it, and if you don't already know what it's about."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a disappointment","review":"I found the change in narrators confusing in two chapters where they had little or no connection to the main character. I suppose it's because this novel is merely a collection of short stories but then it shouldn't be passed off as a novel. Of the two \\"hot\\" single, female, 30-something books, I'll take Bridget Jones' Diary any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"enough with the lame '90s \\"heroines\\"!","review":"I found this book to be less offensive than Bridget Jones' Diary, but also less consistently entertaining. I truly wish Bank's editor had forced her to make a choice -- is she writing a novel or a bunch of short stories? The uneven narrative voices often made for a confusing, frustrating read. All downhill after the first chapter, which I'll admit I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"spunky heroines","review":"...and we need them spunkier yet. Jane has a liveliness about her but somehow women writers always seem to get bogged down --- or their main characters do --- toward the end. Nothing much is at stake. I wasn't too dissapointed, but like another reviewer I would recommend 'My Date With Satan'and 'A Manual Of Etiquette For Ladies Crossing Canada By Train' which has a nervy heroine on the run on the Canadian transcontinental, handsome detective, etc. almost a spoof. Also 'Alaska Highway Two-Step' a young woman psychic and her dog divining mysteries in the far north."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane, have you met Bridget Jones?","review":"Very amusing. A book of such cliches, lower-middle-class value and provincial taste can make it to the bestseller list and actually get good reviews. \\"Better than\\" Bridget Jones, did you say? Have you BEEN to London? (New York was still mud huts when that great city held the world at bay as THE metropolis.) And if being a copycat was not self-insulting enough, the author and/or editors and/or misguided readers constantly compared this work to the other, much sharper and wittier work by Ms. Helen Fielding. Bridget is not perfect, far from it; but she is devastating funny, and has the ability to laugh at her own silliness. She has all the charms, qualms and sexuality of an urban woman. Jane, however, is nothing but a sagging bag of self-pity. I hope Robert discovers he's gay and leaves her soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have rather gone fishing...","review":"From reading the other reviews on this site, there was apparently a lot of hype about this book. I found it while wandering through the bookstore and thought that it would be both funny and touching. Unfortunately, I never laughed nor was I ever touched. The book was trying to be overtly different than anything by Helen Fielding or Katie Fford, but in doing so, evoloved character development and a central plot. I kept waiting for the short stories to weave together,as well as for Jane to evolve as a woman and actually be changed by her life experiences. The writing style is choppy, which I also think adds to the uncohesiveness of the entire book. On the posititve side, it is a quick read and you will probably be no worse off for the ware. But it did disappoint me enough to make go online and write this review. In the end, I just felt cheated out of a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss?","review":"I bought this book because I kept hearing words like \\"funny,\\" \\"real,\\" \\"engaging,\\" and \\"life-affirming\\" to describe it. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't find it to be any of the above. I read the first two chapters wondering where the engaging part came in, but soon I had finished the whole book and still hadn't found it. The main character's affair with an older man, battle with cancer, and hardships over the death of her father made me cry more than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Book Ever Written","review":"This book is a collection of unrelated totally unfunny incidents. The main character is Jane Rosenal who is observing life.There is a chapter about her neighbours whom she does not even meet, so why they are there only Ms Banks would know - perhaps to make up the prerequisite number of words?I bought this book as the \\"one of the funniest book ever written ...\\" etc, but read it without so much as a smile - and I am known for my sense of humour.I found the book hard going, but read to the end on hoping in vain for an improvement. It is beyond my comprehension how this book ever got into print."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny and enjoyable","review":"I literally read this book in a day while at the beach. It was a light, easy read. There was a chapter in the middle that threw me off and I still haven't figured out what it was about. I asked some others, and they don't know either. But parts of it were funny funny funny! I read some of them out loud to my beach companions, they were so funny. The character development was good, and the last half was better than the first. Over all, a fun and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange, rambling, and adrift","review":"My primary reaction to this book was confusion; it was just strange. It is similar to many other pieces of contemporary fiction, in that it gave a rather spare account of events and followed the actions and emotions of the characters without filling in much detail. I understood the point of the stories, but I just couldn't make myself care about the characters. I found myself getting annoyed with them for making bad choices and acting so detached. The only part I did enjoy was the final story, when Jane tried to follow \\"The Rules\\" to semi-disasterous results. That made me chuckle because I'm always torn between thinking that \\"The Rules\\" are ridiculous and wondering if maybe they really do work. Overall, this book just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read...leaves you wanting more!","review":"This book took me a day to read and left me wanting more! While she is often compared to Helen Fielding, I see her writing as more real and more thoughtful. One can only hope that her next book (which I hope comes out soon!) is just as fulfilling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!","review":"I was SOOOO dissapointed in this book. This is the hottest thing in all the magazines and reviews lateley, but I have the distinct feeling that reviewers only read the last story, which is the only one that even comes close to any comparison with \\"Bridget Jones\\".I would have liked it a lot more if I hadn't been duped into thinking it was as funny and realistic as \\"BJ\\".Most of the stories are boring, not clever or particularly funny, and the whole storyline of Jane dating a MUCH older man had me a bit repulsed, quite frankly.Looks like heavy promotion (gee, was Coppola pulling in some favors???) will get you far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average chick lit slop","review":"I liked this book. This is a lot coming from me, as I HATE chick lit with an all-consuming passion. But this isn't about lightweight sex, shoes, or the typical idiotic Lifetime Channel woman who can't figure men out but also can't figure out a life without one.Jane is a realistic woman, a woman who is neither desperate nor cloying. She is intelligent and funny, not clumsy and fluffy. This is NOT Bridget Jones.And this isn't even in the same genre as a Bridget Jones-style rant. It's about so much more than finding and keeping a man, it's about life, careers, getting along in a big city. It's about difficult love and difficult life, the stuff that real people deal with every day.So if you are seeking the book equivalent to a Meg Ryan movie, forget it. If you are looking for a well-written book about life and love where the main character just happens to be a chick, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After seeing this book prominantly displayed in my local bookstore time after time, I finally bought it. I was excited at first, but my excitement quickly faded as I muddled my way through the book. I kept hoping that the book would get better, but it didn't. I agree with another reviewer that there isn't enough character development here, even with Jane. She comes off very shallow, and she's not someone I would really care to know.Another mysterious section is one of the stories in the middle of the book. The narrator is Nina, not Jane, and it doesn't really fit anywhere in the book, except she is the downstars neighbor of Jane's much older boyfriend. I kept waiting for any of the characters in that section to reappear, but they never do. Something funny does happen in that section, but you never know what the resolution is.The best part of the book is the last section where she tries to live by the oft-mocked Rules. I wish more of the book was like the last section!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial venture, not literature","review":"Melissa is bright young woman. She saw the market demand, she had the connections, she wanted some cash. She wrote a contrived, self vaunting portrait of the reflective, funny single NY woman many female readers love to identify with by recycling a few ancient short stories written on dateless Saturday nights and spoofing The Rules. She did it skilfully enough with the intelligent spirit yet inner emptyness of an advertising copywriter and hoped for the best. And hit paydirt. A pleasant enough read - we all eat doughnuts sometimes - but literature?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked a compelling plot....a bit boring at times","review":"I really had to force myself to finish this book. I thought the lead character was a rich, spolied, narcasist without a sense of humor (unlike Bridget Jones' Diary). I really hated the middle chapter where she introduces new characters and never mentions them again! What's with that? At first I thought the editors just made a mistake - then I realized it was just a gimik - its just stupid if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Compare This Book to Anything Else","review":"I am really tired of hearing this book compared to books like Bridget Jones' Diary. The key difference is that Helen Fielding writes a demeaning tale about a spineless, neurotic wimp who I can't imagine being friends with, while Melissa Bank writes of a real woman whose wit and honesty make her just the kind of woman I'd like to know in real life. The stories are simultaneously hilarious and poignant, and the writing is strong from start to finish. I can't wait to read Melissa Bank's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very first book","review":"I felt that this book felt like something a person might have written early on in their writing career. I didn't think it was well-written or funny, though it had amusing moments (one, at the end) My reading group didn't like it either, so I'm not alone. They gave it so much publicity with posters and ads and everything, you'd think its good but its not at all good. It's flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative Lorrie Moore","review":"This book is a Lorrie Moore knock-off, complete with the anagrams and fractured words and narrative point of view. Lorrie Moore is a much better writer and reading this book only reminds you of how good Moore really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of anything","review":"I think the title is the funniest thing about this book, along with the jacket design itself which is wonderful. It's the stuff between the covers that I think it lackluster. The stories are of inconsistent quality and none shines. I suppose they link together, but it's almost as if the writer weren't confident enough to write it as a novel, yet didn't want to create a volume of short stories, so she simply created a hybrid. Which is fine, or would be if the writing were terrific. I hate to say it, but I really felt this was the Let-Down book of the season. It really felt like the first draft of a first novel, pushed forward by believing, impatient publishers. It's not awful, not at all. It's just sort of...there."},{"rating":"1","title":"low self esteem, no plot","review":"I was excited about reading this book after all the buzz that had surrounded it. While reading it, I kept waiting for it to get good. It is a collection of short pieces most of which focus on a central character as she matures through adolescence and toward middle age. I kept thinking that she would blossom and become someone I admired. It never happened. I read for escape or for inspiration. I dont have time to read about boring characters who have no self esteem and consistently sell themselves short. Read something else instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stellar","review":"Melissa Bank has a true gift with words. \\"You Could be Anyone\\" is about the most touching piece of fiction I've ever read. Far above the authors she is usually lumped with in the Helen Fielding genre, Bank's work has some true emotional depth to it.My only question is: when the HECK is she publishing her next book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great writing--no wasted words","review":"I am a super picky reader. Rarely do I even finish books that I start. I finished this one in 3 days. Great laughs--great story. Easy to read because it was SO well written. I applaud Melissa Banks and hope she keeps writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah...","review":"My friend recommended this to me telling me it was ' so funny.' I thought the book was more depressing than anything. I kept asking myself when it was going to get funnier, but it never really did. I thought the dating advice chapter started to get funny and hit home a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic heroine","review":"Look, the writing wasn't bad. The story was told in an interesting way--rather than as a standard novel, we learn about Jane through a series of stories about Jane that are hardly connected. But you know what? My favorite story was the one that had the least to do with Jane. And you know why? Because I didn't like Jane. She thinks humor is all that she has when she's not all that funny. She's insecure. She leads men on but then acts like the victim. She's not passionate about anything. I didn't want her to succeed because I didn't feel like she deserved to succeed. I can't get into a novel with such a pathetic heroine.This is what started the \\"chick lit\\" genre? Well, that makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the two mystery chapters?","review":"I believe that I may have missed something somewhere, but did anyone else think there were two chapters that didn't fit into the story at all? I wasn't even entertained by these chapters, I was confused. And then I waited throughout the whole book to see where they fit in. I read quite a bit and have never see this tactic before. Other than that blatant literary mistake, I found the book loosely entertaining. If you have nothing else to read it may be worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad excuse for a novel","review":"I purchased this book because the description on the jacket cover was well-written and seemed to point to insightful ideas. As I was reading the book, I had to re-read the jacket cover a few times to make sure I was reading the same book. It lacked character development, depth in story line and the writing was geared towards 13-year-olds. This is probably the worst book I've ever read and I will never read any of Melissa Bank's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"very superior stuff","review":"Dim girls will not like this book - it's so intelligent, so well written, and so upmarket, it's almost a shame it's being targeted at the Bridget Jones market, because it's much too good for that. This is literary fiction, very well written and with some wonderfully subtle jokes. I love the way the stories stand alone, but also interconnect. Nothing is over-done, it's all beautifully reigned in. It has the tautness of the best short-stories, as well as being as engrossing as a commercial best-seller. It manages to be both literary and popular at the same time - no mean feat. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bridget Jones","review":"I was very very disappointed by this book. I thought I would sympathize with a single career women in search of love (someone like myself) but found that Jane's character was unbelievable, unsympathetic, and just plain boring. The writing was uneven and even the style shifted from chapter to chapter that made it hard to appreciate the book. One chapter was written in a high-schoolish 3rd person (She looked at him. He was her lover). Terrible writing at times made me want to throw out the book. The ending was predictable. The only redeeming part of the book was the cleverness of having the two women from \\"The Rules\\" give Jane advice like the devil/angel scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, and not worth the hype or the money","review":"The wait was not worth it!!!!!Everyone, had compared this much anticipated book to \\"On the Loose\\" or \\"Bridget Jones\\", so what a disappointment it was when I read it. The hype of a quirky look into Jane's life once she reads a self-help book (i.e. The Rules) is mearly glanced over in the final chapter. You must sift through chapters, which one doesn't even fit, to get to a mere 60 pages of plausible life in NY.If your looking for something entertaining, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.Are we that starved for reassurance in our lives, that this can get published?????Buy a guide on how to hunt and fish, you'll get more entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, no thanks","review":"I must admit that I am only writing a review about the first half of this novel since I could not bear to finish it. If you are looking for rehashed plot devices, flat characters, and sub-par literary style, this is the book for you. I admit that I cannot cosy up to any of the contemporary women's fiction books out there right now (ala Bridget Jones). I still harbour the hope that some day a well-written engaging novel will be written with a dynamic and interesting lead female at the helm. Until then, I think this book has signalled to me that I must ignore this genre altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually perceptive and multi-layered","review":"I hardly ever read contemporary fiction was extremely turned off by the likening of _The Girl's Guide.._ to _Bridget Jones' Diary_.. but I picked this one up anyway and kept reading. I really admire the tone of this book- the main character (narrator) is perceptive, THOUGHTFUL, intelligent, but human. So are the other characters. The stories are very realistic and the concept of honesty rides through many of them. I enjoyed it quite a bit and am thankful to Bank for an intelligent book. The last story made me happy. Good books should do that for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"If you enjoy stories about women searching for their Mr. Right, this book is for you. It is humorous and light reading. There was one chapter in the middle of the book that made no sense and why it was even in there was beyond me. I kept on waiting to see how this chapter would fit into Jane's life, but other than proximity to her aunt's apartment, it had no bearing on her at all. I was expecting the \\"Julie\\" from this chapter to end up being the same \\"Julie\\" from the first chapter, but no such luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Jane Rosenal","review":"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing was just what I needed to put my life into perspective. The similarities I shared with Jane were amazing. Having just moved to New York, even the surroundings were familiar! Melissa Bank delivers a realistic and humorous novel that I could not put down. Jane was a great character. I laughed and cried with her. And because of her diverse personality and various 'adventures' I believe there is a Jane in every single one of us...Thank you, Melissa Bank, for showing me I have an ally in the search for my 'true' self in this difficult city!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Spoke To Me","review":"I loved this book and I was genuinely saddened when I finished it because I did not want to end my time with the characters. The honest, down-to-earth, yet incredibly witty way that Ms. Bank writes really resonated with me...I felt like she was expressing all the confusion and maddeneningly unrelenting self-examination that women of our time go through.Thank you for writing this book, Ms. Bank...please put something else out there soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderfully Captivating New Age Novel","review":"As Melissa Bank takes you on the journey through the life of Jane Rosnel, you almost begin to wonder if it's written about you. Being a young woman of this age, I could relate to the book in the most captivating way. It made me cry and laugh and frown all in the same page. I would recomend this book to any young woman out there today. \\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\", is the best novel I've read since Salingers \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", which is an outstanding accomplishment on Melissa Banks' part. Buy the book, it's remarkable. I guarantee you'll be impressed by Melissa Bank's writing and overall charisma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, could not relate to Jane","review":"I read this book in our book club. We all found the book boring. Jane was so insecure, confused,and her life had no direction in personnel or professional life. No explannation whay was she like this. I found her character quite irritating. Can anybody explain those two unrelated chapters? Does this represent the young generation today?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls Guide lacks direction","review":"Melissa Bank's book was partialy engaging, but lacked fluidity. The \\"Girls Guide\\" needed to give readers directions to follow each storyline each time a new chapter began. I found the content to be drab and without laughter. I appreciated what the author was trying to do, but I would rather have actually gone hunting and fishing - than sit through this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read so many great reviews on this book, and when I finally sat down to read it (it was entertaining) I guess it just didn't live up to my expectations. I felt it was kind of whiney and inconsistent. However, the last chapter was excellent. If she could write a book with more like that final chapter, she would have herself a few more stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time!","review":"I can't believe this book is so popular! It is so boring, and the characters, ungodly boring! I mean that old man she shacks up with? What is that? They couldn't have sex, he was an alcoholic and he was twice her age (yeah, I would stay with him). It never dove in deep on the real issues; intimacy, loss, friendship, loyalty and betrayal. It was too superficial, boring and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I had heard so many good things about this book and couldn't wait to read it. I read it and I was greatly dissapointed. Jane was very dull in all of the stories and towards the end I just lost interest in the book. I finished it and wasn't impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book looks at \\"coming of age\\" with insight and humor","review":"I loved this book! Melissa Bank has written a book that every female can identify with, handling relationships and growing up with humor. Everybody should read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is the best part!","review":"I started reading this book almost by default and it irritated me no end (I never finished it). The author is just trying to sound like J.D. Salinger or any other number of superior New York writers waxing poetic about their adolescent experiences. Her humor is so vague and her vocabulary sounds forced and mannered. I think the reviews are inflated and I'd never read anything else she writes. Nothing like Bridget Jones Diary/Sex and the City. Totally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all","review":"**I meant to give this at least 3 stars - sorry for my error which I can't edit** Great book, easy read, complex issues addressed in a human manner. Loved it. You come away wishing that the main character, Jane Rosenal, was your best friend. Recommended to those who like to read about human interactions, young women lives, city life."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's a short-story collection, why does the blurb on the back cover say otherwise?","review":"If it's a short-story collection, why does the blurb on the back cover say otherwise? The back cover describes the book as such \\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing maps the progress of Jane Rosenal as she sets out on a personal and spirited expedition through the perilous terrain of sex, love, and relations, and the treacherous waters of the workplace.\\" NOWHERE is it mentioned that this is supposed to be a collection of short stories, not a novel. WHY NOW? It's not fair to get a reader to like a character and then just end her involvement completely, with no warning! Neither does any of the information on Amazon's site say that this is a collection of short stories. False advertising - I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother","review":"This book was so dumb and a complete waste of my time. There are way too many phenominal books out there to bore your mind with this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I got this book for my birthday. From the title it sounded like an intresting book, but it was not my type of book. It's about this girl named Jane and her love life. She never seems to find the right guy. She gets discouraged and reads a self-help book. She tries out it ideas and finds it is better to be her self. I did not like this book because Jane sleeps around. If you liked this book then good for you, but it wasn't for me. I suggest this book to adults only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I ordered \\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" on 8/10/08 as it was selected as a fun read for my book club. I never arrived. I did e-mail the sender after several weeks but did not hear back. Correspondance from them after my second e-mail stated they did not receive any message from me. Hard to understand as I did not get notice that my e-mail didn't go through.I had to purchase the book from B&N.;Virginia Perry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snappy wit only goes so far","review":"Sure, there is some clever dialogue in The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing, but I found it to be a boring, overwrought meditation on the lives of rich New Yorkers with nothing else to do but reflect on love lost and vacations in Martha's Vineyard. I like my chick lit with slightly rougher edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, clever and a must read.....","review":"I read The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing in one sitting and well...it was worth being sleepy at work the next day. It is one of those books you just hate to finish. Melissa Bank's protagonist hits the gamit of emotions that go along with that little girl whose voice is always riding shotgun with every woman guiding her way through wildnerness of courtship to find her prince charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely loved this book!!","review":"Loved Jane, I laughed and empathized with her the whole book through. My one complaint was lack of continuity and specifics, it was a little hard to connect with her cause you couldn't ever tell what age she was at during the experiences, and, the two short stories were so ambiguous it took a while to realize thery weren't about Jane. I wish that they had been longer though, the majority of this book was so well written but too brief. Read this book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll laugh out loud and miss her when the stories are over","review":"Enjoy Jane through a series of snap shots of her life; each chapter is a short story. You'll giggle at her irreverance and love/hate relationship with her family. She says the funny things you wish you had, but you only think of afterwards. Meet the other characters through telling moments, humorous and revealing exchanges. Her brother is a guy you know, maybe dated once. You get to share the inside jokes. There's no pages wasted with superfluous background of events or people. You jump right into the middle of things and feel at home with these characters. It's a delightful summer read - but it goes very fast. As with the best entertainment, you are left wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beach read..","review":"It's not the great American novel, but it is a great picture of single womanhood during the mid- to late-90's. Funny, breezy and poignant. It reads so true to life, I wonder if Ms. Banks has any friends (or old boyfriends) left who'll talk to her. I loved it and have passed it on to all of my girlfriends, sisters and my mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD FLUFF","review":"The author cleverly uses the same character in all stories (although she's not the main character in every story) which I enjoyed; it felt more like a novel than the traditional collection of short stories. Despite the many appearances of Jane, however, she, as the main character, remains dull and flat. Some interesting pages of dialog and nice prose made me want to like this book but the boring characters made for boring stories. And, as a woman, the author should have been able to give the main character some life without making her seem so generic. Too fluffy for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add mine to all the voices saying \\"Huh?\\"","review":"Ahh, the benefits of a great publicist! Must have been that because this book certainly falls way far from the mark. The \\"Rules\\" chapter was fun - but other than that (which reads like a magazine article) the rest of the book was a bowl of stale microwave popcorn, a flat Diet Coke, and a rerun of Ally McBeal. Disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much said about nothing.","review":"I sat down for a good summer read and felt nothing but pity for most of the characters. I still cannot figure out where the two chapters not written by jane came from and where they planned to go! I kept reading for a reappearance of the characters and a possible tie in. It never happened and made me go back to the beginning to see if I missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it!","review":"what a dissapointment! I read the amazon blurb and was hooked so I bought the book... the blurb was the best part! I am shocked at all the rave reviews. Am I reading the same book??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the bad reviews!","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Girls' Guide...\\" and wanted to see what others had to say... I could not believe the bad reviews! I read it in less than 2 days because I couldn't put it down. I can relate to almost every word! I will admit it started out slowly and I honestly didn't care for Jane/Melissa's snooty ways - at first. But then I noticed little clever details and found myself thinking back on what Bank had to say. I won't forget this one for a while. I would give it 4 1/2 stars but that's not an option and 5 is not really accurate given my annoyance with Jane in the first chapter. Still, you should do yourself a favor and read this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the audiobook version!","review":"Read by the author, this is one of the most compelling books I've ever listened to. I was truly sorry it was over when I reached the end of the final tape. I've shared this with all my friends and we all agree it's terrific. Melissa Banks. I'll be first in line for your next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the print version!","review":"This book sounds like a fun, light read, but the narration in the abridged Audio version kills it! The author recites the book herself, but her voice is very flat and frankly, boring. She makes little differentiations between characters in her voice, and her attempts at acting make listening to the book confusing, since you are never sure who is the current first person in the narrative. The book itself is not bad though, this is just not a great recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hype than substance","review":"I too read many of the rave reviews & was disappointed because I expected much more than what I got. I don't think Banks gave us a unique perspective on relationships or women in love. In fact, I didn't like her protaganist. I too disliked the predictable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to relate to and very entertaining","review":"If you are looking for a light, easy to read and entertaining book, this is perfect. Every woman can relate to the main character, who is sarcastic, confident but who also experiences normal feelings of self doubt and neediness. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending completely killed it.","review":"I was very excited to read this book, seeing how it's been on the bestsellers' list for so many weeks. The opening was captivating and entertaining. However, midway through, the book began to drag on and it finally (mercifully) crawled to an end. I HATED Faith and Bonnie's ideals, and I felt that Banks should have taken another approach to the closing. What could have been a stellar book turned out to be another overated flop."},{"rating":"2","title":"a breath of clean air","review":"I read the NY Times article about Melissa Banks and GGTF&H and afterwards bought the book. Its not The Second Sex, but it isn't meant to be! Its funny, reflective and contemporary. My background is entirely different from Janes so I found her innocence refreshing. She had a certain self confidence inspite of her self consciousness. It read quickly (one evening) and was well worth that small amount of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AM I MISSING SOMETHING?","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this book. The first story was brilliant and funny, but the rest of the book barely held my interest. I have been very into short stories this summer, but after having just read three books by Alice Munro, this just didn't measure up. Melissa Banks is probably a gifted writer, but I honestly don't see what all the fuss over this book is about. Slim pickings this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for those who can laugh at ourselves!","review":"Why is this the book people love to hate? I thought it was terrific. Naysayers claim it only appeals to young, single ditzy women, but I am a Harvard grad with 10 years of marriage under my belt and literally laughed out loud a number of times. My husband also enjoyed the passages I read aloud between cackles. If you can laugh at yourself, you will love Jane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let the Title Throw You Off!","review":"This is a great read with quality characters that you can really care about, because they're not so unlike yourself.While at times this book is screamingly funny, it is also heart renderingly sad. Melissa Bank crawls into her characters and inhabits them, turning them so real you achingly feel every emotion they experience.I hope to see more books of this caliber from Bank in the future. She's a fine new voice and a delight to read. Keep 'em coming Melissa, I think you've found your voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book!","review":"This book is my favorite book ever - I have read it countless times and each time it is a new experience. I hope Melissa Bank writes another book soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so funny, so real","review":"This book is hilarious! Melissa Bank is wonderfully witty. I'm not usually the type to laugh at books, but almost every page contains a clever line. The author takes you through a woman's life, from age 14 to thirty-something, and her struggle to understand love. She goes through a series of relationships and tries to find meaning in her life. When she meets the right guy, she plays mindgames, plays by \\"The Rules\\" before learning that real connection is more complicated and more wonderful than that. The only bad part about this book is that you feel a very slight distance from Jane throughout most of it, but by the end all is well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - I got lost in this book","review":"I did not know when I bought this book, plucked clean off the top of a pile of discounted books, that it was a series of short stories, nor that it would be so absolutely mesmerising. I am actually dreading finishing the book as I have enjoyed reading it so very much. Like the protagonist, or narrator if you will, I had a relationship with a (much) older man and Jane's lover Archie so reminded me of him. Yes it's funny but also quite poignant and honest. I know some were dissapointed with the book but if you read a book with expectations, you generally will be. I had no expectations so was thrilled at how wonderous it has been. Please read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Ramblings","review":"This book is very disappointing...it rambles on with no point. Bridget Jones, the book's comparison, is much, much better. Bank also offended me personally referring to her slurred words as \\"being stupid with a no running water, Appalachian accent\\". How can an author be respected that would lower themself to think so stereotypically? I'm very sorry I wasted my precious time reading this book. It is not even worthy of one star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Confusing","review":"The cover of this book went on and on about how funny it was and that it was about dating. This book started out slightly interesting and went down hill from there. It was less about the main character's experiences in dating and more about one long boring relationship that didn't involve sex. The book was also jumpy from one chapter to the next so it was hard to tell who was narrating or at what point in time that chapter took place. This book is simply poorly written. The whole book is written in first person from Jane's point of view except one chapter. That chapter is also written in first person, but from some unknown woman's point of view for a reason that is not clear. Those characters were never explained or mentioned again in the book. And finally the book was sad at several points. I don't find disease and death to be \\"hilarious.\\" This book is going in the trash. That's how annoyed I am that I read it completely and wasted my time. -A bookloving girl in her twenties"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Laugh Out Loud Kind of Book!!!!","review":"What a hoot!!! Yes, I did use the word hoot. The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing is a complete joy to read. Jane Rosenthal is hilarious with her sarcastic humor. I lost track of how many times I laughed out loud when I was reading this book. I read several excerpts to my husband and he found it amusing, too. I did not want it to end and when the ending did come I was sad. I craved to be let into her life for a little bit longer. Read it and enjoy!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"Great book - easy reading. I read the whole thing on a car-ride home from the in-laws & it made the time fly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girls Guide","review":"This book was not what I thought it was going to be. It talked analytically and figuratively. I did not find a point to the book until the very END. One chapter seemed like it didn't even fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real \\"must not read\\" of the summer.","review":"I rarely read fiction but bought this book because it was half off. After reading it over the weekend, I couldn't even really tell you what it was about. Pointless and non-engaging. This is not what being an unmarried gen-xer in your late 20s is about. I was blinded by the reviewer's hype in two women's magazines I subscribe to and only blame myself for this purchasing mistake. I'll stick to non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not smart","review":"This is below average coming of age fare. Jane is trying too hard to be clever and witty and consistently fails at both. Proves once again that hype makes sales, not quality. If this book had not ridden the coat tails of Bridget Jones, it wouldn't have been published, much less been the subject of such intense marketing. Others have commented on the run of books about single women, but is anyone else bothered by the number of books about single women IN PUBLISHING? Girl's Guide and BJ of course, but also Animal Husbandry and In The Drink. A bit of narcissism on the part of the acquiring editors? I'd say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Another Book on Dating in the 90s!!!","review":"I wanted to like this book. However, I found it disappointing. There were no fresh ideas. The story jumped around and therefore, was hard to follow. Furthermore, the characters were like cardboard. Want a better book on dating?

Aren't there better writers out there who deserved to be published?? This book is tiny to begin with and has more than a few blank pages and what's in between is weak and unispiring. Poor little rich girls are boring to read. 130lbs. and counting, no cigs, five cookies, read another over hyped book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing.......a bridget jones wannabeee","review":"This just didn't live up to the glowing reviews on the cover. It is a collection of somewhat connected short stories that are a little too clever, just try a little too hard, so that one notices the writing, but is left wondering where the story is. Two of the stories are unrelated and don't really seem to belong....one of them is written in the second person for some unknown reason and all I can say is that Jay McInerney did it so much better in Bright Lights Big City. Overall, the book was a disappointment and I will not recommend it.....there are many other up and coming authors who are much more deserving....or just have something worth saying......this book just glosses over material that has already been well covered by other writers....and offers nothing new........"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap knock-off of Bridget Jones' Diary","review":"unoriginal drivel that tries so hard to match the fresh voice and wit of Helen Fielding's wonderful Bridget Jones' Diary ....and fails miserably. Whereas BJD was funny and quirky, this novel was dull with a few funny antedotes here and there, but not enough to save this book. Too bad Bank tried to mimic Fielding in most of the book, and only shows a glimpse of her own literary voice... maybe next time she will be braver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but unoriginal","review":"I liked this book the first time I read it -- when it was called Bridget Jones's Diary. The plots of both books are strikingly similar, and Hunting & Fishing doesn't do anything new. Do we really need yet another book that tells us about the awful woes of being single and in one's late twenties? I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable until the end","review":"I enjoyed this book as a weekend read. The characters are very realistic and one wants to know more about them. The story, even in a short story format, moves along and keeps one interested. But the ending was anticlimactic and just - boring. Yes, I know it's much like real life. The last story had a different feel and a different voice than the rest and it wasn't as much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa Banks-The Girls Guide To Fishing and Hunting","review":"THE GIRLS GUIDE TO FISHING AND HUNTING is an a good book. It goes by very fast! Banks does skip around a little bit but the way it is written makes you feel like your bestfriend is talking to you.The book is about Jane, and young woman who is experianceing and expanding her relationships with her parents, brother, her bosses and her boyfriends. Basicly going through life. She explains her relationships, and experiances as if you wish you were there. Banks also tells Janes story through other people, yet is almost a mini-story of the person. Though Jane never really goes Fishing of Hunting, THE GIRLS GUIDE TO FISHING AND HUNTING is a good book, and I reccomend reading this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"try Helen Fielding or even better, Marian Keyes","review":"It was on the basis of the great reviews that this book got at Amazon.com that I decided to buy it - I will be more careful next time - was I reading a different book or something? 'Laugh out loud' 'hilarious' 'true to life' were some of the comments and descriptions that made me think this would be a book along the lines of Bridget Jones (at least, the first BJ book) and the Marian Keyes books (all of which are excellent). This book was whiny, and melodramatic and did not inspire any of those 'been there' or 'thats exactly what I felt/what I would have done' moments that are all too common when reading the other books I have mentioned. I keep wanting to shake Jane and tell her not to worry about things so much - don't sweat the small stuff, even!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess i missed the joke","review":"i read this book after it was billed as the next 'bridget jones diary'. one difference, bridget was FUNNY and made sense, unlike this novel. the book read more like a bunch of short stories that did not belong together. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A female Salinger?","review":"This is a bunch of short stories sold as a novel. I useually hate short stories. If it is a great story, I would like to have more, if it lousy, why should I even read it? This is a lot of great stories, with a tender, witty, even funny tone sometimes. They are full of emotional insight, as J.D.Salingers books were and with the same kind of interesting and lovable character (s) in it. This book has nothing to do with Bridget Jones books, and is probably not a good book for the person who only takes time to reads on vacations twice a year.This is a book about real people, with fragments of Jane Rosenals life, glimpses of what is and what could have been and of a very charmy, very beautiful person who I would have loved to meet (and who I have realise now, I have already meet a few times!). If you are a reader and like writers like Salinger, Barbara Trapido, Gontsjarev, Tagaki, Murakami etc, then this may be the book for you also. Its more a four and half star than a four."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick light-hearted read.","review":"After reading more serious works this summer I was in the mood for something light and fast. TGGTHF was the answer - finished it in under 24 hours and turned the last page feeling good and upbeat. Having read many of the poor reviews here I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It's a just-for-fun book and worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed reaction","review":"The author is clearly talented at creating character and story, no moreso than with her heroine Jane and her literary lover Archie, which to no surprise became the subject of a movie. Archie really was the most realized character, and I loved their relationship. I also like her relationship with her family. But the final part totally lost me - I felt like, \\"What book am I reading, here?\\" Actually I also felt that with the first departure into a short on presumably Jane and her future family. Who was the dad? What? Totally disembodied from the rest of the book - as was the final segment, which was the titled part. But definitely a talented writer who I'd gladly read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp, insightful tale","review":"Melissa Bank's collection of short stories are fun, smart, and full of little truths. There are 7 short stories. The best are \\"Advanced Beginners\\" (about a young girl's summer and her relationship with her older brother's girlfriend), \\"The Worst Thing A Suburban Girl Could Imagine\\" (about a young woman's romantic relationship with a distant older man--all the while dealing with her father becoming ill), and the title story (a hilarious short about a 30-something woman who attempts to use a self-help book to get her life back on track).What's best about the book is the way that Bank manages both humor and sentiment in even doses. It's a worthwhile read for both male and female audiences and introduces a new, unique voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"While on a family vacation, I read this book and consistently evoked smiles and questions of \\"What, what's so funny now?\\" with every giggle or guffaw I let out from the back seat of the car. When my mom ran out of books and stole \\"Girls' guide...\\", she was even more disruptive, turning completely red as she howled and wiped away tears. A fun, raucous must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was looking for a fun, easy-going book when I came across The Guide. It took me less than 3 days to get through, and I was partially confused the entire time. I never found the \\"fun, sexy\\" main character that was advertised on the book jacket. What I did find was random stories that never gained enough depth to give insight into the art of \\"hunting and fishing.\\" Actually the only time these terms were brought up was in the last few pages of the book. The rest of the book just told parts of Jane's life and two random chapters of other people's life. I found never found any guidance for life, dating, or love... Each chapter started with me guessing who's head I was in and who they were, how old they were, anything. Most were about Jane, but it could of been a new person each time - I never saw connections from chapter to chapter. I will comend Melissa Banks for making it very easy to read and in the end showing hope for love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read . . .","review":"I had heard so many good things about this novel that I think my expectations were too high. It was enjoyable, definitely, but not as good as I had expected. Some of the chapters were outstanding, but a couple of them seemed misplaced and a bit confusing. The characters were very original and likeable, and many things about the story rang true. Her take on \\"The Rules\\" was hilarous!Bank reminds me of Elizabeth Berg in her writing--that same fresh, realistic voice. This is a fun and fast book to read, but not a good choice if you are looking for something substantial."},{"rating":"2","title":"an easy read... but","review":"this book wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. i was looking forward to a laugh, a giggle, some tears but the whole time i seemed to be waiting for that great moment. it didn't come. However i really liked the main character and the way the book was written. it's style i should say. it had it's little moments. i just felt a little let down by all the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relateable but weird at times.","review":"At the beginning I found the book very relatable and funny. As a teenager, I found the settings comforting and encouraging. The stories were dramatic and realistic. Jane is extremely sarcastic and familiar. I loved the book till she started going out with the old guy. He was way too strange for her and I found myself questioning if I should read on. But then decided it might get better and it did. So if you like sarcastic teenagers and mature adults, I recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in S.F.","review":"What are we missing? Scratching the surface, but never had any depth. Who is coming of age in THIS America? In this book club of 30 - somethings we found very little to relate to. Jane never found, or even looked for, herself. We looked for her\\"self\\" as well. It's amazing what a good title, a Fargo-esque cover, and glowing big name reviews can do. Jane was very passive and accepting of what came to her. She may have been fishing but it was in a very shallow fishing hole. Melissa Banks offered us no real insight into who Jane was, how she felt, or what she wanted. The only time there was a hope of a connection with Jane was in the first chapter. Whatever happened to teenage Jane?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-rounded read","review":"While I was expecting this book to be much more lighthearted and funny, I was not disappointed in its presentation. I felt there was a deeper understanding and empathy since this woman could be any one of us. I also enjoyed how, unlike many books today, this was not centered on her desire to find HIM. It showed her career, health and family. And most important, 'So you have him, but do you want to keep him?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Witty and fresh, 'Hunting and Fishing is a quick read (under 24 hours!) and well worth it. Laugh out loud funny, sentimental and human. 5 stars, no less. And stop comparing it to Bridget Jones--this book succeeds on its own merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative","review":"There are many new, skillfully-written books of short stories by women this summer. But I'm surprised Bank's flat style is commanding so much attention. I found the characters thin and the language unimaginative. Do yourself a favor and read Stacey Richter's \\"My Date with Satan\\" and Julia Slavin's \\"The Woman who Cut Off Her Leg at the Maidstone Club.\\" They are the real works of art that stand apart from the contrived, overhyped \\"genre\\" of \\"girl fiction.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HECK WAS THIS?","review":"I cannot understand how so many people gave this book five stars. Unbelievable! It started out promisingly enough, then by the end I was just trying to finish it so I could throw the book in the trash (maybe I'll donate it to the library). There was no cohesiveness whatsoever, and the way it jumped from 1st to second to third person was just confusing. I liked the cover though, that's where the one star came from. Otherwise, lame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent first chapter looking for a novel","review":"\\"Advanced Beginners\\" is good as a stand-alone short story but the rest of the book gets tedious as it wears on. The last chapter is just silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"An obvious first attempt","review":"This book is an obvious first attempt from a writer of magazine columns. The characters lack any depth what-so-ever, which makes you happy it's a fast read. If you're looking for something you don't have to think about from a fairly sarcastic first person perspective, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Read","review":"Bank took forever to write this book, and at first you may wonder why. But her prose is so deceptively simple that it evokes emotion larger than the sentences themselves. The format is somewhat unusual; the novel is written in short installments, sometimes in the second person, sometimes in the first. I hardly noticed the transitions after a while, whether from their actual seamlessness or my simple absorption in the story. The struggle for love is always interesting, and this is no exception. The protagonist, Jane, falls into relationships I certainly have settled for, and performs acts of coquettishness that recall shameful memories. But she troops on, right through the end, and Banks makes the conclusion so tantalizing (I set it down indignantly three times before realizing I couldn't not finish, no matter what happened) that I felt that this, indeed, must be what took so long. And it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Bridget Jones","review":"When I first picked up this book, the first thing I thought of was Bridget Jones, one of my favorites. I got through this book in about 2 days and was left thinking \\"huh?\\" I guess I expected much more. I enjoyed the stories, but not as much as I had hoped. So my advice: if you loved Bridget Jones and are looking for something similar, you won't find it in Jane Rosenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what its hyped to be","review":"I was very dissappointed in this book. The protagonist is a whiney person, who really can't figure out what she wants in life. There is a chapter in the middle that doesn't even relate to the rest of the book. To call this a novel, is a farce, it is a series of vignettes that do not flow all that well. The dialogue is weak.The best part of the book is the last chapter. This could have been a decent short story. None of the rest of the chapters even related to the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book. I was very anxious to start reading this book after I had heard wonderful things about it. As Bank wrote on and on about Jane's life, I felt like it was a chore to continute reading though. I never felt connected with Jane throughout her perilous love and career lives. I found all of the stories on brother's girlfriends and neighbor's personal lives unimportant and unrealistic. The plot did not flow smoothly either. I felt huge gaps from one section to the next. If Bank's perrogative was to reflect love and understanding, I don't think this book was quite right. I commend her on her creativeness, no one I know could come up with some of Jane's experiences, but am not very pleased with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no substance, cute cover","review":"This book was such as disappointment. The only thing that kept me reading was the hope that it would eventually get better. I found it annoying that Jane, the supposed savvy career woman, tried to validate herself by dating/living with, breaking up with, and then getting back together with this guy twice her age and who is also an alcoholic. I found the fact that she did not state where she worked calling it \\"H---\\" annoying. For God's sake, make up a publishing company name. The only likeable character in the book is her father's. Everyone else is either weak or stupid. Save your money, buy a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You-go-girl drivel.","review":"This is an astoundingly simple-minded piece of trash. This \\"book\\" is a compilation of short sentences, short paragraphs and lots of adolescent one-liners. This would be a good effort for a high school sophomore. I'm not surprised that it was somehow published or even that it has become a best-seller, but this drivel was given feature reviews by the New York Times and the New Yorker. Is this what we've come to? Save your money, buy a romance novel and pencil-in your own one-liners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm Lorrie Moore - truly hoped it would be better.","review":"If you liked this book, please refer to Lorrie Moore's Self Help. Moore's take on love is so much more refreshing and original. What truly frustrated me about this first novel is how little work meant to the narrator. It's as if she had little in her life except worrying about her boyfriend. At least Bridget Jones had a funny job with interesting office mates. I found the men in this novel particularly indistinguishable. In the end, I didn't care for Jane, and her grating one liners. I truly hoped it would have been a much more ambitious and sophisticated novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?!","review":"I wanted to like this book. i really really did. But I was so confused by the switching around of the narrator's life (one minute she's 14, the next she's a grandmother, the next she's in her 30s...) that I simply couldn't erase the confused \\"but...wait...\\" from my mind as I read it, which is a rather distracting way to read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever, witty, soporific fluff.","review":"If Elaine Benes, of \\"Seinfield,\\" in one of her dreamy moony moods wrote a book, this would be it. The one liners come fast and often, and you keep thinking, \\"Ah, there's an end to that conversation, or that reverie,\\" but it goes on and on, until you find yourself falling asleep (laughing all the way). As Melissa is, to the bank. What fools these publishers be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book You Could Keep or Throw Back","review":"(I'd give it 2 and 1/2 stars to be exact) The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing consists of 7 chapters- each that reads like its own short story- that follows one woman's relationships throughout her life. However, given that as the link, two of the stories don't really fit with the others. It's a very quick and easy book to read. It is also one of those oddities that entertain you okay while you are reading it, but once you put it down (and there are lots of good stopping points) you do not have an overwhelming desire to pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, not about fishing and hunting :(","review":"This book was forgetable! I like to fish and hunt and bought it on a whim but was thoroughly disappointed with the pathetic nature of the main character. There's way more to life than fishing and hunting for men!

Dembski uses scientific terms to ATTEMPT to explain the creationist point of view, but intelligent design is simply NOT SCIENCE. This is not a matter for discussion, any more than one could discuss using mathematics to define religion. The two fields simply do not work together. If you don't believe me, then you haven't read enough about science to really understand what it is.In terms of philosphy and science, ID has been shown to be fallacious, and since Dembski clearly has a religious agenda (i.e. Christian agenda), he should not be allowed to call ID any kind of science, and you people should certaintly not believe him when he says that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad wine in both bottles","review":"Bill Dembski is at it again.

OK agreed Bill - there is an Intelligent Designer - God - he was commissioned by Brahma the all creator to run this particular Kalpa of 4.32 billion years. This Kalpa is 12 hours of Brahma's day. The next 4.32 billion years will be 12 hours of Brahma's night - and so for 100 such cycles. Problem solved.

I will just say as a mathematician and a deist, I am unimpressed. There's no humility. The \\"theistic evolutionists\\" Dembski condemns (not in this book, that came later) are impressive because they communicate a sense of honesty you just do not ever get from Dembski. He reminds me strongly of statistics obfuscator Bjorn Lomborg and also, frankly, of the radical sociobiologist Steven Pinker - unconcerned with science, in it for the polemics.This is a polemic. It's neither science nor theology. It's a pamphlet for the culture wars. I would write a longer review but Scott Ryan above hit every single note I would have and more, so it'd be redundant.Two, not one, stars, though, because it's not the worst thing this mendacious hack has written, by a long shot.

And the packaging was somewhat poor -- just the knives in a block with plastic loosely wrapped around everything. No warranty sheet, care instructions, or anything but a simple box."},{"rating":"2","title":"These knives will surprise and impress you!!","review":"My wife had been asking for knives for nearly a decade and after a lot of research; decided to purchase this knife set for her. I was a little worried at first when she opened the box because of both the thinness of the blades and the light weight of the knives (Most likely due to the prejudice based on various chef's opinions of what makes a quality knife).Wow what a knife set!!! Not only are the blades extremely sharp and easily cut through everything; your hand and wrist don't get tired because of the light-weight and form of the handle.Really great knife set at a reasonable price. I would be these again and recommend them to anyone looking for knife set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Balance","review":"I have used everything in the set except for the scissors.

His story in particular reveals the dirty manipulations of politics, the dirty minds of moneymakers, the desperate courage of some, of whom several have died unexplained deaths.

DeCamp's halucinations have been thoroughly discredited by virtually everyone who has heard them; a grand jury, federal and state investigators, and just ordinary citizens with the enough sense to come in out of the rain. Reading this book, I got dizzy from all the absurdity. Keeping up with the labyrinthine plots, sub-plots, names, places and acts was all but impossible. It brought to mind that TV series \\"Picket Fences.\\" But at least the writers admitted that show was a comedy. DeCamp's vivid, highly descriptive, almost worshipful descritions of acts allegedly carried out against children was so creepy that it makes you wonder about what kind of sickness is rattling around in the author's head.

For every page that seems clever, there is at least one other that feels like a complete cop-out.As a story teller, I would be much more interested in seeing the actual story structure approached from various angles. Truly the possibilities are endless, even if the graphic style remained constant. So I would say the title of the book is a bit misleading.

After a few pages, the exercise becomes rhetorical, and it lacks the imagination and creativity it would need. Yes, there are many ideas, but almost all of them are carried out in a rather mechanical (and possibly dull) way. And even the few good ones look highly undeveloped. In the end it was not only boring to read, but worst: it was annoying.I would indeed recommend this book to people learning to make comics, but only to them.

At times it is unclear as to what kind of dress the author is talking about, making it useful that the picture of the dress should be right next to the text. The short descriptions of the costumes included with the drawings are also difficult to read due to the text they're written in. I also found that the sections for clothes from about 1930-2000 did not really cover the full scope of styles and fashions worn in that period of time.However, despite these small difficulties, this is a great book, with abundant information and fairly detailed drawings.

Don't buy it for younger kids, or as in my case, if the kid has a sibling smaller than 4.Cutting works well and the handle fits the kid's hand well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Fiskars are preferred","review":"If you've ever owned cheap dollar store children's scissors, you'll understand why Fiskars are superior.* They have a blunted tip for safety.* They have excellent paper cutting ability, especially important for children who are just learning or have difficulty handling scissors.* They can be used by both lefthanded and righthanded children.* Though they cut paper, they don't easily cut skin. I can run my hand over the blade without hurting myself.* Quality construction. The blades line up perfectly and the handles don't fall off.I once bought dollar store children's scissors, but now I only buy Fiskars. However, I don't recommend the eraser capped scissors. We've tried a couple of those. The kids never used them as either erasers or scissor caps. They work just fine, but I found them more of a gimmick which just added to the cost of the scissors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish we could pick the colors.","review":"I got pink ones for my little boy.

I'd also used them plenty, myself (though they're not ideal for big hands, of course) I didn't think twice about ordering them for my daughter's first pair of scissors. I was surprised to find them very hard to open and close- too much friction.

I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for left-handed kids","review":"Dont be fooled into thinking that these scissors are truly for left-handed kids. The handles may be molded to fit either hand. But in order to be truly left handed scissors, the blades must be reversed. It's physically impossible to make ambidexterous scissors. Hold the scissors open in front of you, with the blade pointing away from you and one handle in each hand. If the blade on top is coming from your left hand, then they are truly left-handed scissors. If it's on the right, then they simply won't cut well when used left handed. The natural cutting action of the hand will push the blades apart rather than together and the paper will slip between the blades - very frustrating for a preschooler who is learning to use scissors. If you're looking for scissors for your left-handed child, don't waste your money on these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves his new scissors!","review":"I purchased these scissors for my 3 year old and he loves them.

I ordered two more pairs as extras and noticed that the handles look different than the pair I already have. I read the packaging and realized that these are now made in China (the first pair I got were made in the US) and unfortunately, quality has been severely affected. One pair wouldn't open/close with reasonable effort (young kids would struggle) and both pairs had sloppy flashing on the handles, making them scratchy. I am so disappointed.

However there was conflict between the characters and there was a lot of stress and a lot of scariness. If you have an older child who loves Scooby it might be fun for them as a \\"scary movie.\\" Our 4 yo is not easily scared and he handled the movie fine but he didn't enjoy it and as parents we hated the disturbing images for him. Of course he wanted to keep watching and as he didn't seem traumatized we let him but paused the movie periodically to help \\"pop\\" him out of the movie's stressful world and make sure he was doing ok.Even if the movie isn't scary to the child, the point of Scooby Doo is that it's fun and silly and that kids love \\"The Gang.\\" This movie is low on all of that substance so that is why the two stars. It just isn't fun for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out, parents!","review":"This is not the Scooby you grew up with where the gang always proved to themselves (and their viewers) that monsters were never real and you didn't need to be scared. I loved being just a little scared as a child because I knew, in the end, the gang would come through and show that the monsters were just silly bad guys trying to scare everyone. As a parent, this was a message I liked my little ones to get. I could always say, \\"See? There are no real monsters or ghosts. It was just a sneaky bad guy who is going to jail.\\" This is a great lesson for impressionable minds. Leave it to modern \\"advances\\" to add real ghosts and zombies to this formula! It really confused my kids who kept waiting for the bad guys to get arrested and proven to be fake. That message is obliterated in this movie. I am not a fanatic but this isn't the message I want for my small children and isn't that Scooby's real audience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SCARY FOR CHILDREN","review":"My 3-year old son was so scared when he watched this video that I had to turn it off. He normally loves Scooby Doo, but when the zombies attacked AND FRED YANKED THE HEAD OFF A ZOMBIE, it was way too scary for him. This is not in the true tradition of Scooby Doo. Scooby and the gang unmasks villians and thieves, etc., but this and the other one, Witch's Ghost, did not depict people dressed up as bad guys, but true supernatural occurances. A friend's daughter also watched this and was scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby Doo! How could you!","review":"I bought this DVD for my son who is 4 years old. He has been having the \\"monsters in the closet\\" problem lately. I figured that I could present him with the Scooby Doo I grew up with, which taught us that monsters & ghosts weren't real. They were just bad guys in masks. Much to my surprise, the new episodes are all about the supernatural. In the new episodes, monsters and ghosts do exist. The new episodes are also more frightening than the original episodes. I am sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Monsters? Duh.","review":"By using \\"real\\" monsters, this movie completely misunderstands the legacy of Scooby Doo that made it such a classic. It is a sad but unsurprising commentary on the anti-rational times we live in that so many reviewers here applauded that decision. Mulder beats Sculley every time--it's so much easier not to look for real answers to unexplained phenomena. My three-year-old loves Scooby Doo but won't be watching this farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love the old ones best.","review":"I still love the old Scooby-Doo's the best but this is not half bad. My 3 y.o. loves Scooby-Doo and has really enjoyed this one. Especially since I bought it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie! My son loved it....","review":"The gang was great and as was the story line. My 3 year old enjoyed it as much as I did as he is in the \\"RAARRRR\\" stages and he loves this. It surprised me when I found out that they were real monsters and was wary about my son watching it, but it being a cartoon and all, i am sure it won't have any long term effects on him. He wasn't scared in the least. He was \\"Wow, Monster! RARRR!\\"I cannot believe some of the ratings some people gave this. I can understand where they are coming from, but come on, this is just a cartoon. Let the kids know that this is not real and that it is a little scary, if they scare easily. Also if you are uncomfortable to show it to them at night, do it during the day.

Great movie my personal favorite out of all the Scooby-Doo movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood","review":"This movie was an essential part of my childhood. So glad I was able to get it on DVD. It is my favorite Scooby-Doo movie because they are searching for REAL monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooby's Back!","review":"I purchased this movie the night our local video store got it and I have to say that I loved it. It still has the \\"feel\\" of a Scooby-Doo episode, although the animation is more along the lines of what one would expect from the Bat-Man animated series. The only returning voice from the original series is Freddy. Daphnie and Velma's voices are noticeably different, but that's okay. Shaggy and Scooby are portrayed by people who are quite talented in impersonating the original actors. The movie is dedicated to Scooby's original voice, Don Messick, so I assume that he's dead. The movie is a bit more dark than I was expecting, and actually scary in some parts. The fact that the monsters are real kind of make me think that the writers were trying to appeal to a younger \\"X-Files\\" audience. All in all, however, it was a wonderful movie. Let's hope that it prompts a new series! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Scooby Doo movie of all time.","review":"This is a great movie for the older fans, and not so goofy a kiddy like the other ones. Great story, great music, great animation, great writing, everything fits. And to the nutty parents that gave it a 1 out of 5 stars, you really need to go read what a review is about. You can't give it that kind of rating just because it's not for the age you thought it was. Just look at the box and the title! It's obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original Scooby-Doo, Where are You?","review":"This is the worst Scooby-Doo movie that I have ever watched. The original \\"Scooby-Doo, Where are You?\\" series was based upon Scooby and his friends finding a logical explanation as to why there were mysterious situations occurring. This new movie drastically departs from this, and is very dissapointing. The plot revolves only around real ghosts, monsters, witchcraft and the supernatural. I can't believe that parents find this an appropriate movie for young children. I wish I could give this movie a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what was delivered to me","review":"I ordered Scooby Doo on Zombie Island, my favorite movie from when I was a child, I was so excited to receive it in the mail but when I got it and opened the package the movie was not any kind of Scooby Doo movie, instead it was Wyatt Earp. Completely different to what I ordered. I have yet to return this item, but I was disappointed in the product because I bought from Movie Mars due to all of the good reviews that I read about them. I guess be careful of what you order. Could have been an honest mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Movie","review":"I loved Scooby Doo as a youngster and still enjoy watching it sometimes with the kids, but was really disappointed with this movie I bought them. It starts out good, but the ending is poor. In fact my younger one (3yrs) who watches the old scooby doo's is afraid of it. Even my older two (10 & 7 yrs) don't care the way they talked about cat gods and killing of people in a swamp. I would recommend you consider a different Scooby Doo movie for the youngsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Overall, this movie has got a bit of everything- it is funny, exiting and superbly animated. The characters have been modernised, yet the whole movie still has that old Scooby Doo feeling. Buy it or miss out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be rated \\"R\\" - pretty scary!","review":"It was totally awsome. It was a reunion with Scooby Doo and his pals on a scary island.

I don't keep up with who writes or directs these various episodes and movies, but this one seemed completely out of the same league as all the others. None of that great subtle humor that I am used to in the others, and downright too scary for little kids, not to mention just plain stupid. But, if you are tired of the other Scoobs and want one where the danger actually turns out real, then this might be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a \\"Scooby-Doo movie\\"!","review":"Wish I had read the reviews before we bought this; other reviewers have accurately described that this is not a true Scooby Doo movie. It is way too scary for Kindergarteners. It is about \\"real\\" zombies and \\"real cat people\\" that have killed people and want to kill the gang. It is a crazy stupid story and NO FUN for children. It does not follow the traditional Scooby Doo story line that we all know and love. This is a different Scooby Doo. Not worth it. My 5 year old never wants to see it again. We threw it out. So sorry that we bought and watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"*NOT* for young children","review":"We were watching this with our 5-year old son, and we had to turn it off. The ghosts are supposed to be real (not a big problem), and there is a horrible scene where innocent people are driven into a swamp and eaten by alligators (they don't show it, but it is quite obvious from the screams and the alligators they show). I think there was also a voo-doo reference. Our kids were very upset they couldn't see this, but it's not like the typical Scooby Doo. It's along the lines of the Witches Ghost, which I also do not allow them to see. I give it a 1 for children, passably interesting to the older viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought it was fun....not so different from original","review":"Although I did notice that Thelma seemed to of lost weight and Daphne seems more educated and liberated...Shaggy and Scooby haven't changed a bit....Fred even seemed a bit more manly....according to my daughter Katelyn.

There's a scene where Fred tries to pull a zombie's \\"mask\\" off and ends up pulling off the creature's head -- in a kids' video?? What were the video makers thinking?!We made the mistake of letting our 6-year-old Scooby Doo fan watch this without screening it ourselves first (we figured \\"It's Scooby Doo, it'll be fine\\") and we were very sorry -- it gave him nightmares. So we advise other parents of young children -- see this one yourself before you decide whether your kids can watch it; it's not the Scooby Doo you remember from your own childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents... be warned!","review":"If you are a parent of a child under five, or a parent seeking to avoid disturbing content and images for your older children... this is not the Scooby Doo you saw as kids! Certainly, it's animated, but animated can absolutely be intense and scary. As a kid, I felt a sense of relief (everything was right with the world again) when the \\"monsters\\" were unmasked. They were just \\"bad guys\\" after all, usually out for some monetary gain. In this updated version, the monsters are \\"real\\", some intent on draining the blood from innocent victims as part of a ritualistic sacrifice. At the end, the spirits of very scary zombies are \\"released,\\" no longer forced to roam the island. Not what I had in mind for my child's entertainment. I turned off the movie three-fourths of the way through, and regret not having done so earlier. Stick with the classic version... why anyone would knowingly present their child with such storylines and images is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children!!!","review":"Unlike the original classic Scooby Doo, this video/movie has no place in a young child's view. My 4 year old is still having nightmares from it -- my own fault, I trusted Scooby Doo to have remained family friendly, and it wasn't. The scenes of people turning into zombies, cat creatures, and werewolves are too much for a young child's imagination. In this story, the ghosts are *real* and when the masks don't come off at the end, there is no happy resolution that lets a 4 year old sleep well at night. Disappointing to have to pre-screen SD from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children","review":"I have two preschoolers who LOVE Scooby Doo (as I did when the shows were 1st run). I mistakenly got this tape, thinking it couldn't be bad.This is MUCH less funny and more graphic than the original series. There is no carefree mood in this movie that I could find.It is fine for grown ups, but small kids will be horrified. My oldest had bad dreams for a week from watching it one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Fetched","review":"Just like in the 70s and 80s, the producers of Scooby Doo made a movie completely out of Mystery Inc.'s catagory. Though called the most realistic of the fictional Scooby movies, it doesn't make up for the poor voice and mediocre animation. The highlight of this film is the music, though. The soundtrack combines rock and classic scores together. Another good thing is the interesting twist at the end of the movie. But sadly, the good things of this movie cannot help this poor quality film enough to make it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I forgot how much I loved this movie when I was little.

My son and I love Scooby and watch everything from the television shows to all of his movies. This one is different because the zombies and cat monsters are real--no masks with bad guys under them! Great, that's all I need. I have a hard enough time convincing my son that monsters aren't real. In the other Scooby Doo shows, this is reinforced, but not in this one. I was disappointed that the box didn't have a warning to keep me from buying such a horrible show. I would NOT recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALERT!!!!!!!! this isn't for young children!!!!","review":"this is not a movie for kids! it has real monsters (i know the box tells you that but the art of the film is very grapic and the story is very much ment for adults) so be sure you watch this movie before you show it to kids.now as for the movie it's self it really isn't very good and isn't part of the scooby-doo series as far as i see it!!! just plain not good!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disgrace to the scooby pedigree","review":"this movie takes a departure from the orginal series, and not a welcome one at that.

The text covers a variety of valuable topics, techniques,and tools that both the lay leader and the pastor/teacher can glean from. Also covered in the book is the identification of the Big Idea of each bible passage. This is so key to our understanding of the text and our interpreting and teaching it properly. I agree with the author who states that the most important part of any bible school program is the teacher! This book will enable the teacher to become a better, more effective bible teacher. The principles can be applied to classrooms and the pulpit. At our Bible Institute we use the text for one of our course offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but disappointing","review":"The back cover of this book states correctly, \\"Compared to preaching, books on teaching appear only rarely. Good ones, designed especially for those who teach the Bible to adults, can scarcely be found.\\"Given the pedigree of the authors, I had high expectations when I purchased this book. I especially thought that I had found a book that approached education from a *distinctively* Christian perspective. I was disappointed.The first chapter or so was more like what I expected, discribing the need for effective Bible teaching. But the rest of the book contains what are basically the same perspectives and techniques as any other book on education. It was not *distinctively* Christian pedagogically speaking, but rather the same old educational theory applied to teaching the Bible.Perhaps my expectations for this book were too high. Perhaps the book I'm looking for is not yet written. Any suggestions would be welcomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Easter Songs!","review":"Sweet Easter Songs. They are so fun for kids.

It starts with the start of Rosh Hashanah and ends on right at the close of Yom Kippur.While many may feel that the Day of Atonement may not make for a good story, this book does a very nice job of it. It touches on the home and the synagogue. The children experience the joys of the holidays while also reflecting on the more serious aspects (the are sorry for the bad things they have done in the previous year and promise to do better in the coming year).

We have a farm, and were surprised that it even goes in the grass some. It does a beautiful job on pavement and can reach pretty high speeds! Because it's battery powered, it doesn't go up hills all that fast, but it made it up with my 100 pound daughter just fine. We liked the display that shows when your battery is beginning to wear down so if you're far away from your home, you can begin heading back.

The packages arrived all torn up and missing cardboard in many areas, those areas had been package taped to keep in the product. Both scooters were scratched due to the missing protective cardboard... I saved around $40 each... NOT WORTH IT... These are advertised as \\"NEW\\". They may have never been purchased but they are certainly not new! Poor Christmas presents at that rate.Also note, Chain is shipped to tight, loosen the chain for best performance. I am around 185lbs and these scooters pulled me around on a flat surface and a full battery.

We called again and now they want us to charge it with the power on. It still doesn't work... They said they will send a new battery, but we'll have to wait again over a week.

I can't tell the difference between these and Smartpots to be honest. The roots of the plants get more oxygen when grown in fabric pots, and are less compacted. These pots are very durable and convenient. I can fold them when I'm done and store easily. I think they are comparable to the 10 gallon size. I have grown both tomatoes and potatoes in them. For tomatoes, one full size indeterminate can be place in a pot at a time. Potatoes do so well in these pots, I don't think I'm going to bother ever planting them in the ground again. I can plant 3 larger potato plants in one. 2 years later, they are still going strong and I'm still very happy I bought them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Clip fails","review":"Good: The metal protection is nice and the Palm is a snug fit.Bad: The screw attaching the belt clip to the Palm case fell out within 1 hour of using the product, and the palm fell to the floor.

Riveting and emotional it sends the viewer to a place noone wants to be. From the cliche action beginning to the touching end, this is Vin Diesel's shinning momment. His onscreen persona throws you in to the mix as you feel all of his confused emotion, not many can do what he does and he did it well. If you are out this weekend and want to see a movie that is action filled and emotional stimulating at the same time this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diesel is A Man Apart","review":"Where can I begin? I loved this movie. I am an avid Diesel fan love all his roles, but in A Man Apart he proves that he is a true actor. Diesel does a wonderful job in the role of DEA officer Sean Vetter. Vetter goes on a revenge spree after his wife is murdered my a new cartel head called \\"Diabol.\\" The movie is full of twist and turns and is narrated by Diesel. My advice go watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Egads","review":"Wow...this is just tripe. I love the wannabe hefty drama/emotional movie title \\"A Man Apart\\". This is just another gang bangin' shoot 'em up.I thought Pitch Black was very good, and I liked the Riddick character. But as soon as I saw the previews for Fast & the Furious, XXX and A Man Apart I knew Vin had fallen into the once promising actor pit. This movie just sucks.Oh yeah, to the guy who wants Vin to admit he's black, guess what? Vin has stated several times that he's of mixed background, it's easy to see(how many african americans have german names?). Get off of it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment!","review":"I liked Vin Diesel despite Riddick and thought that he can be a good action star. Unfortunately, this movie at the very least didn't demonstrate his acting abilities (unless you consider looking tough as an acting skill). Grunted, the movie doesn't help. It is badly written, badly directed. Overall, mediocre B-movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News/Pathetic","review":"I saw this film expecting some action. The title is very undeserving for the movie I saw. I stopped watching the movie 20 minutes before it ended. It was endlessly unappealing. There was not one scene in this film that made feel or realise the emotion displayed. Direction,Screenplay,Action all lacked detail and co-ordination. I don't think I'm a Vin Diesel Fan anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another weak action flick","review":"I went into this one thinking it was gonna be good. What was I thinking?! The previews made the movie out to be an interesting action/drama, and it looked as though Vin Diesal was going to show some range in his acting. Well, I went to it, and I was wrong! It's just another cliche riddled action flick, with too many shoot em up scenes and abosolutly NO character development whatsoever. I have to admit, Vin Diesal did try in this one. There are scenes in this movie where he is really believable. It's just the old revenge plot that we have seen over and over again, in dozens and dozens of cop movies. Every action movie that is released these days lacks any originality whatsoever.Diesal basically plays a man who is trying to find his wife's killer and bring him down. He has to turn in his badge after he goes nuts on the wrong guy, and he takes matters into his own hands. Thats it. I lost interest in it about half way through.SKIP IT, or wait for the video atleast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Vin Diseal Bomb","review":"This movie steals so liberally from so many movies It felt Like I'd already seen it a dozen times.

Wanted to walk out.","review":"The previews hinted at an average-plot action movie. It was wrong. Now, I don't mind Deisel as an actor. But this movie was so poorly written that I was rooting for the bad guy to kill him just so the movie would end. The dialogue is forced (at best) and just awful. How someone got paid to write this (and continues to get paid to write other things) I have no idea. The plot was thin. The characters were thinner. The only intriguing character was the older crime boss, and they didn't do much with him. This is the first movie I have wanted to walk out on in a long, long time. Of mainstream movies, they don't get much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly lame","review":"Director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) is at the helm of this ludicrous mess which features overmuscled wanna be action hero Vin Diesel as a DEA Agent out for revenge. A Man Apart is pretty much a vehicle for Diesel and nothing more, it is allegedly supposed to demonstrate Diesel's acting range by trying to feature a large emotional scope, but the whole thing is a mess. Everything just seems so cliche and generic, action scenes and scenes where Diesel is trying to be \\"emotional\\" just have a \\"I've seen this before, and I've seen this done better\\" feel to it; and in the end, A Man Apart is pretty much another excuse for Diesel to flex his muscles and blow stuff up. I liked this guy better when he talked with an Austrian accent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the preview","review":"I saw this movie the first day it came out. According to the reviews, Vin Diesel gives a powerful performance. Boy were they wrong. I am the biggest movie fanatic and I dozed off about two or three times. The action scenes are two spaced apart and the movie is so repetitive. They say the exact same thing about twenty times. The movie was promoted good but the movie was unable to live up to the previews. Trust me, save your money and go see something like The Core which was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man made movie","review":"I enjoyed this great movie. I usually enjoy the movies that Vin Diesel stars in ( like xXx and the Fast and the Furious). All those movies were great and this is no exception either. 'A Man Apart' also has a storyline that has more heart than those other movies. The storyline is also more enjoyable and much deeper than before. Even if you didn't like the other movies Vin Diesel was in and just dismissed him as a strong bald guy who stars in heartless action movies, this is different from those. There is still action and stuff, but its much much deeper. Check out this great movie sometime soon and be sure not to miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cop action drama...","review":"I went into this movie hoping that it would be one of Vin Diesel's better movies. I left feeling just that. Vin does a great job of portraying a cop who loses his wife and is at the breaking point. Some people say he can't act...well they've obviously never seen this movie. For any Vin Diesel fans or any cop drama fans, this is going to be a must-have for this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Steven Segal?","review":"This movie was supposed to be the vehicle to show off the versatility of Vin Diesel's acting talents. It failed on that objective. Vin Diesel has proven that he is solely an action movie hero. If he attempts to stray from that formula, it will not be a convincing acting performance. The movie had entertaining portions to it, but overall I would say that the movie did not do it for me. When I see a movie I would like to feel something. I want to become attached to the characters and see them either struggle or succeed. This movie spent way to much time have shots of Vin Diesel staring into space for an action movie and too much action for a movie trying to tackle an emotional man's attempt to deal with his wife's death. This movie was the typical action movie star film and could have starred any of the sterotypical action movie stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canadian Blu-Ray has incorrect aspect ratio...","review":"The Canadian blu-ray version of this film is presented open matte to fill a 16:9 television screen instead of the proper 2:35 to 1 scope ratio of the theatrical prints. This means you get more information at the top and bottom of the screen than originally intended. Your best bet is to seek out the Dutch all-region blu-ray that presents the film in the correct theatrical scope format.The film itself is a pretty standard cop flick, somewhat better than a cruddy cable-TV cop show, but not by much. Diesel should have searched longer for a better script, particularly if was going to have a mundane director like F. Gary Gray at the helm. The cop revenge bit has been done to death, and this one is weaker than usual. It's not up to what any number of other action stars have produced in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie...with a nice, surprising twist!","review":"I recommend this movie...it was very enjoyable...even aside from all the drooling I did just looking at Vin on the screen...that man just rocks my world! haha...but really....Great story, nice + unexpected twist.

Many of us have been waiting for a group to provide lyrics like Springsteen combined with the harmonies of groups like the Eagles.

(He also has the distinction of writing lyrics for two of the most abominably wretched songs ever recorded: (You're) Having My Baby and My Way.) His RCA re-recordings of earlier ABC-Paramount hits like Diana and Put Your Head On My shoulder are also not as good as the originals. I got this CD for Eso Beso (That Kiss!), which I couldn't find anywhere else at a reasonable price. Not a great song, but fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Justice, Vengeance, Arseface...\\"","review":"This fifth book in the Preacher series begins with a backstory on everyone's favorite hard drinking Irish vampire Cassidy and his meeting with another vampire in New Orleans. That story is great on its' own and has its' moments of the dark humor and insane violence that Preacher readers know and love, and is a good read on its own. The next story continues where Proud Americans left off as we see Jesse and Cassidy re-uniting with Tulip in New Orleans. Cassidy plays a huge role as he drunkedly confesses his love for Tulip while he is being stalked by a group of Goth vampire wanna-be's that he met in his backstory. Arseface finally sees his chance to take his revenge on Jesse and co., and believe it or not that ends with some very humerous results. Dixie Fried relies more on story and dialogue in the beginning as opposed to the usual action, and while it isn't the best book in the Preacher series, it is still worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great graphic novel. Worth buying","review":"While not as good as the second volume, it's considerably better than the first and third. Contains all the graphic violence and provocative material which loyal readers love. If you're a first time reader, I urge you to pick up the first volume; it'll really get to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype...","review":"...the Preacher series is graphic literature's most over-rated example. Is it good? Somewhat. But you get the impression that the creative team is making it up as they go along, and, at this stage of the game, that's not a compliment. With this volume and the Preacher off-shoot Ancient History especially, the creative team of Ennis and Dillon have lost direction and are simply keeping it going with all the blood and guts and their attempts at gross-outs - which with this volume consistently miss their mark and are at this point redundant - only because, as far as I can tell, that's what they're paid to do. Don't get me wrong. Earlier volumes of this series are good - particularly \\"Until the End of the World\\" - and the later edition \\"War In the Sun\\" is also recommended, but Ennis and Dillon should take a cue from the likes of Gaiman, Miller, and Moore and stay focused on the story they're supposed to be telling and then, once that's finished - end the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Low Point in the Series","review":"I'm finding The Preacher to be wildly uneven. A great start, then it's gone downhill, with just enough perks along the way to keep me interested. Dixie Fried was the worst of the bunch. Aside from the entertaining first story about Cassidy meeting another of his kind, the bulk of it was just boring, contrived and frustrating. Ennis sort of ruins Cassidy in this one, and there's very little action at all. At this point I'm halfway through the series and will likely keep going, but my advice is to skip this one altogether, and find a synopsis online. Definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dillon & Ennis take the piss on Vampires.","review":"This collection contains Preacher 27-33, and the Cassidy: Blood & Whiskey one shot.The Blood &amp.; Then it's on to the guts of it - the seven collected issues.Previously, in the Preacher story arcs, the violence that has occured in and around the main characters has actually been slightly frightening and very much the focus. In this collection the story takes a slightly different tack, with the violence used as a plot device to show us that good ole Cassidy ain't a nice feller aller the time, and Jesse is just a wee bit too trusting.A great read. Still got more balls than any comic this side of Hellblazer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"This product is so easy to use. If your results vary from normal range it tells you what you need to do correct the issue as well. Would recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST LISTEN","review":"A 'must' for any Francophile or anyone who likes French comtemporary music. 'Les Tyrans' is somewhat controversial and typical of Veronique's gift for interesting music and lyrics. 'Je me suis tellement manquee' and of course 'Indestructible' are also part of the songs that make this album so unique and fantastic. You can't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"\\"Then & Now\\" is expected to show old and new photos of interesting places. But most locations are not interesting, like backyard pools, living room sofas, and taxi cab drivers. Most of the Before and After photos are not of the same location.

Terrible Editing! Not for beginners","review":"Be aware that this DVD begins with FIVE chapters all called \\"Power Up: The Best of Rodney Yee\\". Those chapters (which eat up a significant portion of the 80 minute DVD) contain Gaiam ads, Rodney Yee doing advanced yoga poses with NO instruction on what the poses are, how to breathe or position the body during the pose, what the names of the poses are, etc. Only approximately 14 minutes of the 80 minute DVD are usable for the beginner (Reflection and Surrender chapters). Mr. Yee seems to be an excellent teacher. It just seems that whoever produced this video edited it very poorly. The video should be marked \\"Advanced\\" somewhere on the DVD jacket. If you're a beginner, like I am, try Rodney Yee's Meditation & Yoga DVD. I thought that because Mr. Yee has been on Oprah and because this DVD was produced by Gaiam (who normally has great products) it would be a good DVD. I was wrong.

The flow is terrible, every single section is broken up with a section of Rodney blabbing about the set of poses he is about to show you, and you cannot simply skip past it, you have to carefully \\"fast forward\\" because the dvd is not split into smaller skip-able chapters or sections.

I'm glad it wasn't the FIRST one I bought because there are no instructions for the poses, but with a little experience from the beginner DVD's it is easy to follow. When I'm not totally sure what he means I can just look up at the screen and see what he's doing and I'm all set. I like how soothing the music is in this one and I also like how the segments are separate, but still can be played all together. Over all I really like this yoga practice. The only complaint I can come up with is that Rodney is wearing a lot less clothing than I am comfortable with. (Just an underwear cut pair of shorts.) But I don't look at the screen much when I am following along, so it's not really an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Rodney","review":"I had this particular Rodney Yee program for years on VHS, until it wore out. I was glad to find it on DVD. With over 30 years of practice, it remains my favorite routine. Divided into 5 short mini-routines geared toward different times of day, you can choose which ones fit your need.

Plus it left me feeling really frustrated with my lack of flexibility with the yogis on the video. It really wasn't a good experience. I invested in props to help me through but he goes so fast that you can't keep up.

Although that interview was given back in 1999, or so. I think this is his best video, of the ones I have seen. I did this every day for 6 months, the middle three workouts, and got in great shape. this is just a great healthy way to get in shape. If you have never done Yoga before, you might want to do the Patrica Walden \\"Yoga for Beginners\\" for one or two weeks, and then go to the \\"Yoga for Energy\\" tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Energy","review":"This is a fabulous yoga video. The way it is sectioned off is very convenient because it allows you to do only the sections that you feel you need at the time. I like this feature of the video because I have two small children and, with frequent interruptions, find it difficult sometimes to do all the sections at one time. It's definitely for those who have already had some instruction on how to do the poses. It helped me to first attend a yoga class with an instructor who can spend some one-on-one time showing me the correct way to do the poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great, but needs a longer warm up section","review":"I really enjoyed this video. I appreciated its format of little chatter, and the asanas chosen are terrific. My only gripe is the warm up section is a little short, and doesn't quite get your muscles as loose as they perhaps should be. Overall, a wonderfull video."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like gongs & windchimes, this is your tape!","review":"Am I the only one who hates this same music in all Rodney Yee tapes? Not only is this the music used in AM & PM Yoga, it has also been used in Yoga Remedies for Natural Healing AND Back Care Yoga, as well. Since I'm tired of it, from my other 4 yoga videos, I did not give the tape more stars. I enjoy the first & second segment, however, the first segment is VERY similar to AM Yoga, and the 2nd segment is very close to Yoga Remedies' stress segment. I won't be buying any more tapes from the Living Arts & Yoga Journal series because I'm tired of the gongs & windchimes, and similar footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book.","review":"If you only buy one real estate book in your life, make sure it is this one.

I recomend this 100 porcent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Different Edition","review":"Flatland is an excellent book: clever, insightful, and a joy to read. But this \\"dry bones\\" version is not the one to get. I bought this because I thought crediting the author as \\"A Square\\" was a cute idea, and while I still enjoyed the book, the main problem is that this one has TONS of typos. I forgave a few at first, but then I almost couldn't believe my eyes as I was running into at least one typo per page, throughout surprisingly long sections.That was the only problem I had with this book, but for me, it was a big problem, and greatly detracted from my reading experience. If it doesn't sound like something that will bother you, by all means pick up this copy - you'll enjoy it. If you're like me, though, and you want the books you read to have survived a spell-check (at least!), then I highly recommend buying a more professionally produced edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the melancholic","review":"Fourth album of Gothic rockers Flowing Tears from Germany. Compared to their previous work, the album Serpentine contains more Metal influences. The songs are groovier and a little bit faster and less dreamy. It makes the album more divers. Compared to other Metal bands with female vocals, Stephanie Duchene has got a very unique voice. Her voice is strong, deep and melancholic. The songs are short but catchy. The guitars are groovy and the keyboards complete the songs. I highly recommend listening to Serpentine on a autumn night with headphones. If you like melancholic Rock/Metal with suitable female vocals, then check out Serpentine."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes dashed by lackluster effort","review":"I am of the opinion that Flowing Tears put out one of the best albums in the last five years with Jade. I eagerly awaited this follow up. When I heard it though I could not help but be disappointed. It starts out o.k. but never really seems to build any momentum or go anywhere. Where Jade was consistently interesting Serpentine is downright boring. I guess all the fresh ideas have just ran out. I also thought lyrics were a strong point on Jade and an exceptionally weak point on Serpentine. Starfish Ride along with others are just plain horrendous. I will buy their next album but with far lower hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean fun, hilarious comic","review":"Kenn Kington's routine is truly bust a gut humor.

If you have alot of hair, forget trying to use this knock off brand as well, as it won't hold your hair at all! Plus, the connecting lope breaks within a few months of use. Every single one I got broke.

What I got was the story of a couple of yuppies saying, \\"Whoa, were worth a bundle and if we refuse to pay for our kids' college we can retire early\\". Not too impressive to me.

It's easy to choose voluntary simplicity when you can live off the interest of your investments. I also understand that one of their tenets is to borrow whenever possible, including borrowing a friend's van to transport a group of other VS types to a gathering. During the trip, the van broke down. Did Mr. Heitmiller offer to pay for the repairs? Oh, heck no, it wasn't his fault because the van was due to break down. Guess the friend won't be able to adopt the VS lifestyle because he will have to work to pay for the repairs. Mooching off your friends doesn't qualify as VS, does it? People who are living the VS lifestyle because their economic situation forces them to do so are in a better position to write a book about how it's done. People with a million bucks in the bank have a rather comfy cushion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order this product","review":"I ordered this product on June 28th and it took 3 months for it to arrive!!!

I am using the new edition in my methods courses for future English teachers, and it's even better than the previous edition I'd used in years past (something I didn't think was possible!), with updated literary references, activities using technology, and a new section on classroom talk. Extensive sections on teaching literature and writing, along with chapters on drama, assessment, unit planning, etc. make it an ideal text for a methods course as well as an excellent resource for experienced teachers who are looking for better ways to engage their students with English studies. Student response has been overwhelmingly positive, both during the classes and when they refer back to it once they're teaching. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BO-RING","review":"I bought this text as required for a course, but as it was intended as a supplementary text and not the main text, I didn't get a chance to read it then. I finally read the whole thing recently, and BOOOOOOOOOOOO. I found nothing illuminating, was bored by the text ... so many things that would be excusable in other books.

After I bought the first unit I decided to buy two more. Will be buying a couple every month until I get all my cabinets organized. I recommend using a power drill to prep the screw positions and to finally screw them in. Measure your cabinets carefully. Some cabinet doors have portruding hinges that may make the actual opening smaller than what you think it really is. In a wide cabinet I combined a 14.5 wide with an 11.5 wide.

While you may not find entries for absolutely everything in the series it's pretty darned close to everything.

Rob is the Hunter S. Thompson for the 80's, 90's, and decades to come. Fear and Loathing in Cleveland isn't a far fetched description. The \\"reality\\" of Rob's fictional life, given the deep character development, jumps into your own reality. We suspect these people live in our circle of friends, just under the surface. We always suspected they ran the grand scheme of the universe.Read this book - think about it for years to come!

It provided some basic insights into Dutch culture that differ from American culture. After the 10 day visit, I feel as if the book helped me understand the behavior of the Dutch people I met. My only complaint would be the book's claim that the Dutch are extremely friendly. This is only partially true. They are incredibly warm and welcoming if you are introduced to them by another Dutch citizen.

Obviously the authors - both non-Dutch (why? they couldn't find a local [out of 14 million people?] to write this?) have absolutely no idea what nonsense they are ejaculating on page and after page. This is self-evident from the notes about the authors on pages 220 and 221: \\"Hunt Janin (an American) \`visits the Netherlands frequently' while Ria van Eil has obviously spent way too much time abroad to have kept an accurate finger on the pulse).This \\"guide\\" is absolutely rubbish and I grieve for the trees that had to die for this pathetic attempt.

The whole game is just cool, it's fun to pretend you are Ding Chavez hunting down terrorists (especially on the alcatraz level, which reminded me alot of the move \\"The Rock\\"). It is probably the second best (Halo being number 1) 1st-person-shooter 1st player game i've ever played. There is but one problem. The multi-player. I was expecting more of a Ghost Recon type deal, but that it is not.

My advice is not to waste your money. But everyone else seems to love it. So... I could just hear Adolph Green saying the \\"funny\\" lines. And the speeded up photography sequences were not so cute. Only Judy Holliday and Jule Styne saved \\"Bells Are Ringing,\\" though Comden and Green (their only talent, and they're almost very good at that) wrote some acceptable lyrics. There now.

How quality actors like Paul Newman and Robert Mitchum allowed themselves to become associated with such a flop is beyond me. Save your money and your time and skip this movie. There is a fine line between good satire or good comedy, and just pure silliness. This movie is way over the line into silliness to the point it is not even cute and is certainly not humorous. It is as weak and unsound as most of today's unfiltered city water is, with just one absurd mini story after another. I thought it would never end.

The nod to several different movie genre was PERFECT!Since my focus for the movies I'm reviewing is Paul Newman I will start there. Mr. Newman plays Larry Flint (how weird is that?), an American in Paris (I am smiling as I write that because that is another all time favorites of mine) He is a struggling artist. But aren't we all?The French movies from the 50s and 60s with the bohemian lifestyle is the theme here and Shirley MacLaine is big-haired and turtle necked when she has clothes on. Paul Newman is bearded and scruffy. They roll in the sheets and bathe together in a funny scene. I am surprised that one of them doesn't pass out. They are kissing the whole time. I won't tell about the whole movie since its been covered pretty well here.Paul Newman is funny and full of himself and his art.I wish he was my neighbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"This CD is a must for all MH fans.

As has been mentioned, many large words (which often seem out of place) are used which most children will not understand. The artwork is disturbing.

It feels like the author is trying to show off a grand vocabulary more than trying to tell a story. His choices of words are astoundingly complicated and often ill-suited to the story. Its just not a good kids story. Heck, its not even that good of a story in general.

I sat down to read it with my five year old only to be disturbed by the theology. Heaven is perfect. There will be no irritation, sadness, disobedience, punishment. These are all depicted in the story. Angels are beings created by god to be just that, angels. They are not dead children.I enjoyed the larger adult words. I thunk it's important to expose children to such language. And admittedly the ending is sweet and touching. If only it weren't so incorrect it could be a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A troubled little cherub finally finds happiness.","review":"Although an adorable little angel, he is very worldly. He rides an emotional roller coaster of emotions and creates displeasure among other angels. He is finally content when he has a trinket box retrieved from his past mortal life. When the angels are gathering gifts for the Christ Child, he is terrified over God's possible wrath, should he not approve of his insignificant gift. It is chosen to become the Star of Bethlehem. I question the amount of negativity and his fear so great that he \\"rolls himself into a ball of consummate misery,\\" in the presence of God.I feel that it depicts heaven in a 'worrisome' manner for impressionable young readers. His initial behavior is troublesome. The illustrations are great, and is a strong point for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIttlest Angel","review":"Love this book, ordered the DVD to go with it for grandchildren's library.

However, I must admit that that $10 word thing is a little over a three-year-old's head, but being a writer, I just rewrite it as I go along so he can understand the story too. The ending is just wonderful - how God chooses the Littlest Angel's gift over all the other angel's gifts to be presented to the Christ Child. Then, God turns it into the Star of Bethelehem! Pretty awesome and gives you goosebumps every single time. The jist of the story is to offer whatever you have to the Christ Child, no matter how poor it may seem or out of place to others, give of yourself. It's the same story as The Little Drummer Boy - he gave what he had, his gift of music. Great book for the holidays but be sure you read it first yourself before reading it to a younger child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddest book, NOT for children","review":"A 4 year old in Heaven crying for his Mama?

The story is an enjoyable classic; however, the illustrations are bizarre and unappealing. Some pictures that show just the little boy's face are sweet.

The acting, voices and voiceovers are great and I think this could easily be made into CDs.

The story is intriguing and you hear about these people who you've never read about in your history class. Everyone knows Thomas Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, and Paine, but you don't hear about the many people that had an opposing view to this revolutionary idea to separate from the British Empire and form their own country. There a couple of scenes where you're just caught up in what's going on that you get emotional because you feel like you're re-living Patrick Henry's speech at the Virginia House of Burgesses or watching the scene where the final vote to ratify the Declaration of Independence and just how close the revolution was lost or how until the final hour no one knew that the declaration would receive the unanimous support it needed.

I liked the interesting format of the story, shifting between Colin's directorial eye and the plot itself. The only problem I had is that at times it was a little too unbelievable. First that Colin would be so willing to to put up with the trials of being with Gina and second that Gina would be willing to put up with the trials of being in America.Overall, it was a compelling story, and a refreshing change of pace.

This guy is unbelievable to put up with all the antics in Ireland with her and her family, and hard to believe anyone would try to continue a relationship with such an unstable and looney woman! I found the language written in the Irish slang hard to follow and get the gist of the meaning of these words. I felt he overused some of the obscene language and the use of \\"feckin\\" on almost every page.

As other reviewers noted, assembling the computer within the case requires some patience and experience, especially with regard to the order of assembly because of the limited space and how things fit within the case, but it all worked fine.

It is overly simplistic and provides no information that any MBA couldn't have thought up in 5 minutes.There are two major sections to Beatty's book. 1: How businesses think \\"today\\" (really, 1996) and 2: Basics (and I mean basic) on the executive job search. The first part is pretty useless because as an MBA, you should have your own thoughts and opinions on today's businesses. This book provides nothing worth spending money for. The second part is okay if you know nothing about executive job searching but is much better served by John Lucht's \\"Rites of Passage\\".For real insights on Executive career movement, John Lucht's \\"Rites of Passage\\" is a must read.

A masterpiece of smooth jazz! Gregg treats us to one of the most enjoyable collection of songs, incredible really! Every song on this CD is great, having it's own unique groove. Gregg employs some incredible guitarists on this project, each guitarist blending his unique style with Gregg's keyboards. This has become my favorite CD, I play it over and over and still love it! I WOULD NOT be without this CD, it is a true work of genius. I liked Gregg Karukas before, but now I LOVE Gregg Karukas. This is a 10 out of 10, you can't go wrong!

The challenge was daunting, being limited to approximately 15 tracks.Four tracks came from this wonderful CD. Gregg Karukas, always a skilled keyboardist, has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks. Track 1, \\"Girl In The Red Dress\\" is a fun, upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure. Track 5, \\"First Flight Home\\" is an immensly sexy and driven song. Track 7, \\"Corner Club\\" is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun. And then there's track 8, \\"Isabella\\". In my opinion the best single Smoothjazz track of 2005. It is the kind of track, when a friend asks \\"what exactly is smoothjazz?\\" Play \\"Isabella\\" for them. They'll understand.Buy this CD, you'll love playing it for years to come and the artists deserve your support for putting out music at this quality level."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREG KARUKAS CD LOOKING UP","review":"FANTASTIC CD FROM BEGINNING TO END--COULDN'T POSSIBLY PICK A FAVORITE SONG.

I have found that with Gregg Karukas, you get more than you pay for. Anyone who wants to venture into the smooth jazz arena would do well to start with Gregg Karukas. Looking Up is just another stellar performance in a long list of great CD's from Gregg. \\"Girl in The Red Dress\\" kicks it off with a bang and the smoothness never stops. No matter how many times you listen to this CD, it never wanes. You say you're traveling and need a nice CD to listen to, this is it. You're chillin' out by the fire with that special someone, this is it. You're entertaining guess at a dinner party, this is it. In other words, this CD fit any and every occasion.

When I set wood onto and carried it into the house I was genuinely concerned the nylon would tear through. That's how cheap and useless the tote is.I'll be keeping my tried and true old (decade old) canvas/leather carrier and just use the stand.If you don't have a good carrier already and are looking for a complete stand/carrier solution, don't buy this.

Does it sit there and hold a firebox full of wood? Yes. Is the canvas bag hearty enough to hold wood while you carrry it? Yes. BUT....the problem I have is this: the tubular unit that holds the canvas bag is in 4 parts - the two sides that sit on the ground, and thetwo \\"A\\" frames that point upward to accomidate the canvas tote. the issue is this: the frame, no mattr how well you put it together, puch on it, bang it, pound it....it falls back into four pieces whenever you jostle it. I even brought out my hammer and tried to HAMMER the pieces together - the next time I grabbed for the canvas tote to haul wood, it crumpled to the floor. Now....I am an experienced handyman. I plumb, I wire, I frame, I build cabinets, wood floors, tile, paint....everything.

And, the never-ending procession of rocks and ocean was endless -- to say the least. A complete disappointment -- clearly a low-budget rendition, rather than showing us the real beauty of villages and cities in Normandy and Brittany.

I had a VERY hard time staying awake-I found not much plot or story in it other than keeping me as bored as possible. There was nothing frightening about it too--something of comic books.

It begins when Kirie discovers her friend's father videotaping a small snail and she is completely unaware of the significance of what he is doing. However, the minute incident of her friend's father begins to snowball and she realizes that she has a monstrous disaster on her hands.

Maybe in the last 1/2 hour...","review":"As far as Asain Horror goes this one is pretty bad and I've seen quite a few bad ones. They hardly show anything to scare you until the last 1/2 hour of the movie. It's incredibly slow to start and has several scenes where people are really scared of something but you never get to see what it is.

The first 110 minutes were a fairly faithful adaptation of the first volume of the three volume Uzumaki manga series. The film explores the characters and begins the builup of creepiness. Then, the pace quickens. The slime-geeks are given short shrift. The effect of the mud on the heroine's father is unexplained. Then, the film just ends. There is no resolution of anything raised theretofore in the film. The part where her boyfriend yells \\"It's got me\\" is not in the manga. And then his face turns demonic as in some cheapo horror flick. And that's just it. A bunch of pictures of (I guess) the \\"effects\\" of the spiral on the townsfolk are paraded across the screen and nothing else. This totally ruined the film. It seems as if they intended to do a multi-part film with sequeals covering all three volumes of the manga because they covered most of the first one, but then ran out of money and just slapped the ending on as best they could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The next best thing to the TV show itself.

It's a lo-fi, technical treat -- more from-the-gut than poseur artsy. The bitingly satirical opening track \\"The Good Punk\\" is a standout, with Jamie Stillman's guitar work recalling Steve Howe of Yes (and in other places Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi). The rocky-riffy \\"Cover Me\\" raises the mania stakes, submerged vocals and all and \\"Science Reasons\\" is industrial-lite meets surf, meets punk. Highly inventive and literate.ADRIAN ZUPP(April 8, 2003)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth","review":"This book has a 12 stage process. It gives ideas on what needs to be done - mostly common sense like \\"make a good first impression\\" or \\"use interpersonal skills\\" but it does not go on to elaborate or give examples. It lacks depth and because the steps are fairly common sense anyway, the book lacks quality and is really not that helpful. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"To start or refersh...","review":"This is a very good book to read for both new and experienced employees. It guides them on how to start correct and avoid common mistakes most experienced employee make. It's quick to read and easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy for beginning linguistics students!","review":"Excellent for beginning linguistics students, language learners and language teachers. In encyclopedic form, this is one of the best books I've found that gives concise but thorough explanations of basic words such as adverb, clause, conjunction, passive, subject, pluperfect, reflexive, etc. Each of the 100 entries includes plenty of examples, comparisons, notes and short exercises to test that the explanation is understood. Descriptions of terms are thorough and come from several different angles. Plenty of examples are given which is great for people who learn best from context. Many linguistics textbooks cannot be used to look up terms quickly the way that this can be used. It does not assume that the reader will have already read the other entries, but includes terms to cross reference for those interested. Most examples are in English, but several other languages are also used. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FOX LORBER IS THE WORST DVD COMPANY ALL OVER THE WORLD","review":"Please edit this review to prevent some people of throw out money.It is not the first time ihave a bad expireance with this company.Once i had STELLA a Greek title .It was just for throw it .Please save your coustomers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie EVER!!","review":"I purchased this movie based upon the reviews and recommendations from others on Amazon.com who ( I assumed ) had watched it and liked it. Not knowing the titles or directors of good erotica, I based my decision on those comments. I have to say, and I'm usually NOT one to go off griping about things that don't deliver on their \\"advertised\\" qualities, but this was by far and without a doubt the WORST movie of ANY category I have ever seen. I considered selling it on e-bay just to recover some of the cost, but I refuse to subject any poor unsuspecting man (or woman) to this garbage. If you're looking for something to set the --mood-- this movie will NOT do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Define","review":"Excellent job with rereleasing this--lots of nice extrasThe film is beautifully directed and well acted. It is hard to define in terms of genre, but definitely a classic film worth being in the Criterion Collection. It is definintely for adults only. You should not watch this if you are uncomfortable with the explicit sexuality, but by the same token, if you are looking to watch pornagraphy, you will be disappointed. This film is about the characters and their storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film as Art--Life as Film","review":"This is a film that redefines relationship. It is irreverant, but there is a total beauty to the truthfulness of the ways that the individuals lose their identities into the maelstrom of sexuality. Not only do they lose identities, they lose...well, I guess you have to see that one. To say that this film is \\"porno\\" or \\"sexually explicit\\" is to class it with flicks that have nothing to say. Not only does this film have something to say, it shouts about relationships, the ways that people lose themselves into the abyss of sexuality, attempting to return to the symbiotic pre-birth state. I think that I have seen this film five times. Each time I come away with a different nuance into the demands of a relationship, and the varieties of demands that human beings make on each other. In some ways, it's not terribly unlike a conventional marriage...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good...to put it lightly","review":"Some eroticism, more of a soft-core porn movie but unlike most of those there is the plot. The problem is perhaps that some of that plot gets lost in the translation, and there is much about Sada that goes unsaid and you are left to guess.The movie wasn't overly graphic in terms of sex, in my opinion, but the non-sexual images and some of the story was quite freakish. Not worthy of the class people are putting it in on many of their 'most erotic movies' lists... or maybe it's just not a very good movie.Was looking for an artistic, erotic masterpiece...this was about as erotic as a clockwork orange, but nowhere that good. Some of the reviews here would have been more helpful--we wish we had read them, but I admit I didn't want to spoil the plot completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Don't get me wrong I can go for the erotic every now and then but this was ridiculous. The characters were to underdeveloped and from the beginning all you see is sex, sex, sex. I would have liked it more if they mentioned each characters background, especially what the wife thought about Sada. The scene when she was on her period, in my opinion was disgusting. and the part when she touched the filthy bum I wanted to throw up. The end shocked me because ole girl pulled a Bobbitt move that they actually showed. Not the best erotic film I have seen. Definitely not sensual enough. All the sex they were having got boring after awhile and there conversations were almost always the same. More like softcore porn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inkwell","review":"this a great movie. i can't belive it is not on DVD. I would like to see it on DVD.

I finally found a copy of the uncensored film online. It's like watching two cars speeding at 90 miles an hour, getting ready to crash. You know it's gonna happen, but you don't want to take your eyes away from it. It's everything I thought it would be...shocking, erotic, amazing. It's in the line of Bertolucci (Last Tango in Paris), but with a slash of the Mitchell Brothers (Behind the Green Door) in it. Hollywood is still struggling to do something similar. It won't happen, because there are too many prudes running the show. If you value your artistic ignorance, then don't watch this film. If you're looking for a film that knows no boundaries and you're looking to explore a different movie experience, then this is the one film for you.Leave your egos and prudish grandma at the box office!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the realm of the misogynist Gutter","review":"First off-this movie isn't\\"sensual\\" at all--unless you're into female abuse/degradation--not that the male lead doesn't get his share of abuse at the movies end. Basically, a rich guy \\"F's\\" like a jack rabbit--every female he can get his slimy hands on.One rather unbalanced woman decides she wants his attention to be hers alone--but of course he doesn't comply. Both leads are unlikeable--the sex is either very \\"R\\" or barely \\"X\\"--take your pick--but it's pointless either way. The story is dull-even played at fast speed and reading the sub-titles--this movie moves too slowly to be interesting.I'm not offended by pornography--and by pornographic standards--this movie's sex isn't all that explicit--but it's also pretty darn boring--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutally honest.","review":"Friends who have watched this film tell me that there's no one like the girl in this movie. I say they're wrong. I have met men and women so obssesed with themselves that they have the power to drag others into their obsession. This is the story of one such person. Some people call this a beautiful love story but I call it the slow descent into insanity by both of the couple. She slides into obsessive compulsive territory and he, a middle aged man infatuated with her youth, allows himself to be dragged along. The ending was inevitable.This movies is filled with graphic sex scenes which is an honest change of pace for this type of movie. These people actually do it the way you and I would do it at home. There is no attempt to be artsy of fancy. In other words, it is NOT \\"gratuitious.\\"I found it hard to feel any sympathy for either of them. Maybe more for her than for him because it's obvious she's disturbed. He has no excuse.Check it out, you may be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Realm of the Senses","review":"This movie is quite amazing. It shows physical desire and sexual passion taken to the edge of madness. It was banned for 20 years because of the explicitness of the screen sex. The story is a true one but its depiction on screen makes us aware of the voyeuristic nature of our participation in the observation of raw passion. The actors are all serious professionals - not porn stars - but Oshima persuaded them to perform real, not simulated , sex for this film. The tone of the film and the shocking ending could have been made morbid or depressing but it is not. The film flows to its conclusion with an inevitablity that seems quite natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic, but not for the squeamish","review":"The principal actors are beautiful, and the eroticism is beautiful as well,but the passionate attachment and the violence it evokes will be repugnantto some viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie...","review":"I have to say that this movie is most certainly not one for everyone. That's quite obvious from it's NC-17 rating, and the fact that it was banned for quite some time.But aside from that.... It's an interesting movie about obsession and sex. The characters don't really get too deep, and you don't necessarily feel much sympathy for them, but that's part of the point of the film. You're supposed to feel the obsession, and the fact that the two lovers really only ever have sex on their minds, that it's taken over their lives.It's graphic, violent even, with tons of sex... But if you know what you're getting into and can look beyond just the simple act of sex, you might find it a worthwhile movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a comment on the DVD transfer itself . . .","review":"Please DO NOT waste your money on this DVD. I'm not commenting on the film content itself. This is the most shoddy treatment of a film that I have ever seen. I was so disappointed when I got this in the mail and played it. It is truly horrible. There is a lot of grain, colors are flat and terrible, images are fuzzy and objects look slightly stretched from top to bottom. I'm really not a stickler for DETAIL, but this DVD is literally awful. If you like this movie, then just wait until some other company does it justice. There is no joy watching it in its present DVD form. It's as if someone found an old, beat up VHS copy of this movie and transferred it to DVD.

Sure, it might look nice in your collection, people coming over and saying, \\"Wow! You have 'In The Realm Of The Senses\\" on DVD!\\" But after they see how bad the transfer and the delayed subtitles are, they know that you just bought yourself an expensive drink coaster.

Some of the poses in the forward bends session are very difficult. The really unfortunate aspect of this DVD is that there's no menu selection that allows you to immediately start a session. You either have to sit through the opening dialog for each session or keep hitting the next button. The DVD should have at least three sessions, minimize the opening dialog, and provide better verbal instruction through each pose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners, or anyone else","review":"Attempting difficult poses, even modified versions, is a sure-fire way to discourage beginners from the practice, or make them feel inadequate, which is not what Yoga should cultivate. Even as an intermediate yoga practicioner, I did not like this tape, primarily because it throws you into the difficult poses without first generating sufficient heat in the body. The warm-up poses are minimal, static, and do not prepare your body sufficiently for the extensions and compressions of the advanced postures that follow. Besides all that, the instruction goes from excrutiating detail to not enough information (you have to break concentration and look to see what's going on) in the course of a single series of poses. Very frustrating. As if that weren't bad enough, the instructor's amazing flexibility is about the only inspiring aspect of the tape; her monotone delivery and the spare studio setting with no students make for a no fun experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video to increase flexibility","review":"Great Yoga video.. good length.

If you want to analyze the openings you need a Good understanding of the openings to begin with.The analysis is an in depth, practical, step by step analysis, which is very complete.Sam doesn't cover every line in every opening. He's not supposed to. This book is about Understanding the openings. The lines he chooses are chosen for the instructional quality and to show most aspects of the opening. This is where you begin. This is the Understanding that is needed to analyze the openings.Buy this book, and you'll treasure it. It's easy to read and understand.If you want an Opening Reference Book I suggest \\"Nunn's Chess Openings\\" or \\"Modern Chess Openings\\" 15th edition.

Granted, Chemicals Between Us, Spacetravel, and 40 Miles From the Sun were alright, and being that I really like Bush's first two CDs, and my favorite songs are from them, like Cold Contagious...this lacked any stand out songs. Chemicals was their first single, but it wont be highly thought of and any following singles will fall even faster from the public eye, sadly. Surprisingly the new KoRn CD was more enjoyable. Sorry guys, it was as disappointing as the first hour and a half of Phantom Menace.(the dual was hella good), but I'm sorry, The Science of Things falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bush effort of all time","review":"I wish I could give 0 stars.

The rest is unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love the song \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\" and the weird sound of \\"The Disease of the Dancing Cats,\\" but the rest of the CD seemed like the same old stuff that they used to (Don't get me wrong, it's awesome stuff) even though they said that they had changed themselves for this album. Overall, it is a pretty good album even though I know they could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparking interest where there was none...","review":"Although I can't give a complete review of this album, as I haven't heard all the songs, what I can say is that hearing \\"Letting the Cables Sleep\\" on an episode of ER is what sparked my interest in Bush. Obviously I knew who they were, but was never really interested in their music. However, as soon as I heard that song, I instantly went looking for it on the internet. I have since furthered my interest in this group after hearing \\"Out of This World\\" (although this is off another album, Golden Road). If one or two songs are enough to draw in a previously disinterested avid music listener, I would think that this album would be able to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired Of The New [JUNK]???","review":"If you are sick of boy and girl bands...rap [junk] and 90's grunge rip offs like Incubus and Nickelback...then go in reverse and get the REAL thing... Bush and The Science Of Things is just plain great. Why they were ever referred to as Nirvana rip offs I'll never understand. The lyrics may not be the greatest...but who cares??!! I want something with MUSIC that grabs my soul and this is it! Gavin Rossdale,along with Eddie Vedder, have the most unbelievable voices of the last century...try it..you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok cd","review":"I just picked this one up the other day and its ok. Sixteen stone was obviously there best but this one is still classic Bush. I suggest picking up 2002's Golden State from them. That cd rocks harder!

The music doesn't engage me somehow. The lyrics don't connect and are usually meaningless. The big exception on this album (and its irony) is \\"Chemicals Between Us\\" - one of the best songs this band has done. Very poingant for our age and beautifully rendered. I just can't be bothered with the rest. Sixteen Stone is still their best. Why do so many bands make a brilliant first album then go downhill from there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"how do I put this nicely?","review":"I think you people listening to Bush are the same people listening to Creed, Godsmack, etc...this is not real grunge, please, go get some Soundgarden or Alice In Chains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush used to be better","review":"First of all, I'm not an anti-bush person, I've been to their concert and I have their two previous albums. I just think that this new album is a poor effort to put Bush back under the spotlight. Whatever message they tried to pass with this new album simply didn't get through. This is the most god awfull piece of c**p I've ever heard. I mean what the hell are those electronic beats on The Chemicals Between Us? There are absolutelly NO good songs in this album, not a single catchy guitar riff, nothing. I can only hope that Bush will eventually snap out of this creative blank and show up with a decent album as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reallly good","review":"I have all of the bush cds and I think this one is the best one.

They were tolerable with \\"Razorblade Suitcase\\". But in their lastest try, \\"The Science of Things\\", their true colors shine through: They are unoriginal no-talents! I have but one point that will sum up all I am trying to say. Bush's newest single \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\"? Well Gavin and Co. I am sorry but that song has already been done. It was called \\"The Chemistry Between us\\" and was recorded by Suede in 1996. Plus, it is obvious that Bush has ripped off songs from lesser known Brit. bands such as Ash. In conclusion, Get some new material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs, but...","review":"Well, to start this review off I must say there are a few good songs on this album, tracks 1-3 are strong as are 5, 6, and 8. I also must say that Gavin Rossdale has the song-writing ability of a 7th grade dropout. Some of the lyrics are truly awful- \\"all the fishermen and their families, all sickly crumbling cerebellum\\"- etc. If you buy the album expect a few of Bush's trademark guitar riffs, but not too many. There are too many filler songs on this album to warrant a better rating. \\"English Fire\\" may be one of the worst songs ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could of been better, still great though.","review":"Some of the songs, needed to be developed more, but the good songs make up for it, some interesting sounds on this album as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD- Typical Bush","review":"There are great moments to the CD and like a normal Bush CD there are the dragging ones. Great CD overall and a great followup to their previous"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money but it could'vw been better.","review":"After waiting ages since 'Razorblade Suitcase' i rushed out to buy this. Its definately more polished than the others but lacks the power of Razorblade, it also lacks a song of the calibre of 'Swallowed' but there is enough variety here to keep me listenening, but although its a good album i keep heading back to the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Science Of Bush","review":"Pretty good album but I expected more out of them from the previous 2 albums! I still say that Razorblade Suitcase is still their best album, but this one still needs to be appreciated! My favorite song is neither the 3 supposedly-best songs on the album: \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\", \\"Jesus Online\\", or \\"Letting The Cables Sleep\\". The song that needs to be more appreciated is \\"Warm Machine\\"! The great catchy-guitars and lyrics will keep it in your head for the rest of the day! Also, \\"40 Miles From The Sun\\" is great...I'd say it is the love song of the whole album! These 2 songs were played at Woodstock '99 along with \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\". All along this album is not bad at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS GOOD STUFF!!!!!","review":"This is a great album.i can listen to it in any mood.It is so unique because it combines so many things,and instead of mixing together in one big blur,it sounds wonderful.I just wanna say that I think BusH is during a great job.They have managed to make every one of their albums a masterpiece.BUY THEM ALL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush is back!","review":"This is such a great cd.

It's great. a mix between more hard rock stuff with soft stuff (like Alien :) i got it the day it came out and i love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I bought this cd a few days before it came out (because the Best Buy in my area put it out on the shelves last Tuesday) and it hasn't left my cd player yet. It's the only thing I listen to in my car now. I can't stop. I love the new sound and intriguing lyrics. The best songs are \\"Letting The Cables Sleep\\" and \\"Warm Machine,\\" but all of them are great. If you liked either of their first cds, or a fan of rock that actually has a meaning, you should definately pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as the critic bandwagon says (3 1/2 stars)","review":"It seems like it has been cool to hate Bush as soon as their first CD came out. While some of the razzing was deserved, the critics act like they're the only group that has 'ripped' from other artists. That aside, 'The Science of Things' is not a bad CD - in fact it's a bit more tuneful than their other albums. 'The Chemicals Between Us' and 'Letting the Cables Sleep' are great tunes, especially when cranked up in the car. Judging by 'Cables' and the other slower material, it seems Bush is better off going this direction. Unfortunately, they still substitute intensity at the expense of melody at times ('English Fire'), but it occurs less on this CD than their previous ones. Ignore the critics...and judge it yourself. You may actually end up liking it. Take it from a so-so fan of Bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply painful","review":"I'm sorry Bush fans...but this CD is pitiful. I wish Gavin Rossdale would get over himself and stop trying to act like Kurt Cobain. There is nothing innovative about this disc.

I wish i could give it less than one star, but this review thing wouldnt let me. alternative rock stations that play this stuff are wrecking all good music. take slipknot for an example: they play the slowest song on the cd; then as people start to like that song, slipknot thinks that people like the slow music. So then the next cd that they put out will be slow. DONT YOU PEOPLE GET IT! YOU ARE WRECKING GOOD MUSIC BY LISTENING TO THIS SH--."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Awful Lyrics Between Us","review":"This cd was a waste of plastic. It is the worse thing I have heard in my whole entire life. The music is very bad and Gavin's voice and his lyrics are pitiful.

I would give this CD zero stars if it would let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..........","review":"Didn't grunge go out of style like five years ago?

I didn't know they had such a depressing sound. Having heard the cut \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\" on the radio I was expecting more of the same. Chemicals is the only track on the album worth listening to. If I wanted to commit suicide I'd pick any of the other tracks for my exit music. I realize that \\"real\\" Bush fans probably enjoy their sound, but if you are expecting more tracks like Chemicals keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since 16 stone","review":"After I was fairly disapointed by Razorblade Suitcase (partly because sixteen stone was one of the best albums I've ever heard) this cd gains the lost ground. With different sounds, but keeping the grunge edge, Bush continues to prove that they are some of the best and most original groups out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the cohesiveness of the two previous studio efforts.","review":"This album is a poorly structured extension of Razorblade Suitcase. Although there are a few notables-Chemicals Between Us,40 Miles from the Sun, and Prizefighter, the rest of the album is essentially wasted. The guitar pieces lack the solid riffing of the first album and the dynamics of the second. Although Gavin's vocals are better than ever on this album, they do not overshadow the lack of songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of thesame filler","review":"i cant see how anyone can call this music, let alone innovative music. simply take a couple of greedy musicians, recycle old, used and empty ideas, and you get a dime-a-dozen band like bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"They waited way too long for a new album.","review":"I've been waiting 3 years for this and couldn't have been anymore disappointed. I hated the lyrics and I don't belive I would ever compare Bush to Foo Fighters. Gavin's voice seemed to be annoying on this new one> I have both of their older ones and that's all I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Vu?","review":"The first track, \\"Warm Machine,\\" says it all. Not much of a creative stretch for Gavin and Crew. Although I enjoyed the CD, I found myself thinking, \\"Gee that kinda sounds like, Comedown, Little things, Machine Head, etc.\\" I guess you get the point. If you're a big Bush fan and/or don't mind repetitive riffs from previous albums this CD is a good buy. \\"Warm Machine\\", \\" The Chemicals Between Us\\", and \\"Letting the Cables Sleep,\\" make it all worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are interested throughout the whole CD.","review":"This Cd is absolutely fabulous. It keeps you on your feet and you feel as if you are at the concert and Gavin is playing just for you. It is a vey personal album that alot of hard work was put into. I highly recommend all you true Bush fans go out and buy this CD because it is a very good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy=-(","review":"I must say that after almost three years of waiting for my favorite band to put out a new album that was more than disappointed. I wonder why Bush is a band that thinks that they must change. There are a few songs on The Science of Things that seem more like those of the earlier two albums, but the majority of the CD seems experimental. If you love Bush for their hard songs and clever lyrics then pray that they release a single of The Chemicals Between Us because that is as good as it gets onthis album that would be a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"hey! this band sounds like.....","review":"The thing you guys are missing is the sheer unoriginality on this album. Still two stars for effort, one star is overused. The only album that deserves one star is \\"devil without a cause\\" (and that \\"i wish i could give it zero stars\\" is just stupid). If you like unoriginal bands that steal music from others, you'll like this. Have you heard the new Bush single, its called \\"smells like teen spiroot\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chemicals Between Us","review":"Maybe I should've rated this a five, but I think that Bush will one day blow all of their old albums away. Gavin Rossdale keeps getting better and better. The Chemicals Between Us is one of the coolest songs ever, and the rest of the cd rocks too. I actually think that Institute was an under publicized improvement to Bush, so when or if Bush get back together they'll have the experience needed to outsell all their past albums. Rossdale's songwriting keeps getting better and better, but I prefer to hear him on heavy melodic rock songs. The guitar in this is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen before you buy","review":"Not a bad CD at all, although about four songs sound the same. Chemicals between us is indeed the best track on this CD, yet a few others aren't bad at all. Best advice is listen before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not good - and I wasn't expecting it to be...","review":"I had no high expectations for this album - so I wasn't really disappointed. \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\" is PATHETIC and I can't stand it. Their last album was the best - mostly because THE LYRICS MADE SENSE. On \\"Sixteen Stone,\\" words were just thrown together and melodies were just overlapped to take up time; However, \\"Glycerine,\\" whch of course - DOESN'T MAKE SENSE... is a great song. The others aren't good at all.This 'album' is still worse than that.None of the tracks are of high quality. I can't listen to songs over and over and their music has become simply annoying. AVOID."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to see Bush back on the music scene!","review":"This is a good effort from Bush, but it still can't compare with Sixteen Stone. There aren't really any obvious made for radio hits, but The Chemicals Between Us and Warm Machine are my two favorites so far. The whole album is similar in sound to Razorblade Suitcase in that the songs are slower, but it lacks the energy in the music and the loud, more energetic guitar sounds of the first album. Bush fans will enjoy the album, but Sixteen Stone is still number 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS CD!","review":"It seems every time Bush comes out with a CD the worse it gets! I can't believe what I heard. I was very upset that the only song worth listening to was The Chemicals Between Us. All the other ones were pretty bad. You will not like this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Science of Suckiness","review":"Dear reader, please choose one of the following to this question: What do you think about the band Bush?1 They suck2 They suck3 They suck4 They suck5 They suckOur reviewer apologizes for being unoriginal but he felt there was a need to parallel his lack of originality with Bush's lack of originality. He despises their arrogance and whiny self-loathing. He believes the songs are crude and miss the effectiveness of getting the meanings across. Instead what we have is a case of mistaken identity.

I had then 2 realizations, Damon Knight's bio still stands as the only legitimate bio on Fort (who is worthy of far better than this mishmash) and a paragraph by Keel is often more insightful than entire books by others. I'd read Bennett's \\"Looking for Orthon\\" and enjoyed it, an adept descriptive travelog of the saucer mania in the 1950's. But this alleged study of the life, work & ideas on Fort is a travesty. This book is more about Bennett's fortean awakening, his political education and his various axes he wishes to grind in public. All in all, it's more about the author and less about Fort. My conclusion- don't bother. Get Knight's book through inter-library loan or out of print book services."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Fort who greatly enjoyed Damon Knight's biography as well as Fort's work. I also found this book to be a wretched, worthless, and unreadable book of post-modern gibberish--I couldn't get past about the first 30 pages, though I did skim the rest, which appeared to have little to do with Fort. If you would like more insight on Fort, I recommend Knight's book and the pieces that have been published on him throughout the years in magazines such as Fortean Times by authors such as John Michell, Mark Chorvinsky, and Mike Dash, which I cited in my entry on Fort in Gordon Stein's Encyclopedia of the Paranormal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old time music..","review":"Cliff Edwards is a great forgotten artist, his style of singing is truely unique. Some people associate it with scatting, but I think its much different then that. This kind of music really makes you wonder about what the 20s and 30s were like, it has a lot of the roaring 20's feel to it.My only dissapointment is the sound quality stinks, its like listining to the 78's the songs were taken from, these could be touched up a lot better than this with todays technology. I guess there wasnt any money in it. I mean for $6, this is a steal and a great addition to any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Ike collection","review":"This little collection of Cliff Edwards releases is a great way to understand him as a jazz singer, no doubt about it. His \\"Its only a paper moon\\" shows him at his most expressive. However, this is only the SECOND best ukulele ike collection...the best is the Yazoo album Bear in a Ladies Boudoir, which shows the mastery with which Edwards combined his awesome voice with the ukulele. \\"Hard Hearted Hannah\\" may be only a fun old collegiate romp, but Edward's recording is sheer mastery. I don't know if that's out on CD, though.Still, you can't go wrong with this album...get it if you're a Ukulele Ike fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story, amazing cast","review":"Jack loses his wife in childbirth and is left alone to take care of his newborn daughter, Sarah. In addition to spot-on performances by Richard E. Grant and Samantha Mathis, Jack's mother is played by Judi Dench; his mother-in-law by Eileen Atkins and his wacky friend by Ian McKellan -- quite an impressive cast. The beginning is very sad as it depicts a man who is wallowing in the depths of despair over his loss. Slowly he's brought to life by his growing love for his new daughter. At first, he doesn't quite know how to be a parent, but he's helped by Amy, an American girl who becomes the live-in nanny, as well as family and friends. This is ultimately a story about second chances -- not just for Jack but also for other characters who learn about both letting go of the past and reconnecting with what's important in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real chick flick","review":"An excelent Movie, one that I could watch over and over again.

Too many young or new directors make the same mistakes when they try to make their films \\"edgy\\", and this film is like a checklist of what not to do.1. Zero character development. We want to know why the characters act like they do.2. Scenes that should be only a few seconds long, stretched out for minutes and minutes.3. Jerky, swinging camera work that makes the viewer nauseous.4. Extremely quick cuts that disorient the viewer.All of this adds up to a movie that you KNOW is a movie.

The slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends. This thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but without all the hassle of the smell. One warning...do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device. Please use a real loud whistle. You wouldn't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid. If I heard farts in an empty parking garage I would most likely run the other way. This whistle is for good times only."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"My daughter tried the whistle Christmas morning, it sounded more like a duck.

The plastic tube had stress marks that it will break along. The rubber whistle part was cheaply made, stuck together, and I have been trying to pry it apart for half an hour now, concerned that I will puncture it and never hear the promised sound. I bought it for a classroom discussion on sound through vibration, but wonder if it will ever make a sound of any kind. I have used a paper clip, screw driver, and pencil to try to ease the rubber apart, but it appears melted shut in the center. It is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not as good as expected.","review":"got this for my 6 year old niece. she likes it but it doesnt make a very good \\"fart\\" noise. when you first get it you have to stick your finger into the rubber whistle part and pry the rubber apart in the inside to let the air be able to flow through it. on the package it shows the whistle is cut on the sides, haven't tried this but it couldn't hurt im sure. would probably not ever buy this again. would find something else like a woopee cusion or flarp."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kids Review","review":"This toy was junk... I would not recommended it. The whistle's rubber was stuck together, and I had to stick a pencil through it to loosen it up. It got a small rip in the process, because it was like someone had glued it together. I blew into it,and if you put your hand around the end of it, it sounded kind of like a fart. It stopped working after about 5 blows.This product is cheep, so I am not surprised that is did not work...NOT recommended, spend your money on something else, you will be much happier :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun...","review":"This product does not sound anything like a fart.

Levy deftly captures the day-to-day life of early 20th-century baseball through the many triumphs and catastrophes of an astounding and bizarre athlete and personality. An insightful story, Levy's bio. is also good baseball. The review by Brookner makes strange claims; Eddie Plank is hardly the victim of a cover up here, and Brookner's notion of \\"a dead ball era without much hitting\\" is flat wrong. Stephen J. Gould, Bill James, and various baseball encyc's all show batting averages to have been just as high back then. (It was slugging averages that were markedly lower in the dead ball era.) Levy gets it right. Rube comes forth in the endearing and exasperating ways he must have been to his teammates. This is one of the best new baseball books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Levy uses good research in depicting one of baseball's most unique characters. The author stresses that to Rube Waddell, baseball needed to be only a game and not a life-or-death compulsion. In the book, we are taken back to a time when people viewed life much differently than they do today. Rube was a magnificent product of that time--flaws and all. A good read for anyone interested in early twentieth-century baseball.Charles BenderGeorge Town, Cayman Islands"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Baseball Treasure","review":"I have been fascinated with Waddell since boyhood when I read of his almost unbelievable antics in an era when baseball was not the big business it is today. This book documents the zany and troubled life of a one-of-a-kind American Original whom Ken Burns called \\"the strangest man ever to play.\\" He died tragically young at age 37, never having won a World Series, missing the 1905 Series after injuring a shoulder wrestling for a straw hat a month before. If you like Waddell and are moved by his tragicomic spirit, read \\"Brass Bonanza Plays Again\\", a novel where Waddell returns as a guardian angel of another \\"goat\\", a hockey goon who causes his city (Hartford) not only to lose a championship but also its team."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPOINTED","review":"This disc is one of I beleive 6 in a series realeased earler this yr.I brought the live disc(5 star) from Amazon.After much consederation and listening several times too the new essensles collection( also 5 star{@ a local target})Both live and Ess Coll:Are extremely well (RE)masteres:Where as the R&B set is poorly re-mastered(picked up@boarders) by comparison.The main song on the R&b set I wanted was \\"I got a Woman\\".This track(along with the others)sounds worse then a almost 20yr old cassette(which also features mentioned title) I have.Because of the poor re-mastering of R&B ,I am not bothering with the other disc in this set.One plus for R&B - it features less popular songs,that are frequently featured on other cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Modern Christian Worship Band","review":"Simply put, this album is a great example of a modern worship band's ability to make great music. I have spent several years searching for Christian bands that can play music that appeals to me. Raised on alternative rock music, for years I considered Christian music weak. Delirious is one of the bands that has changed my mind.I really like this album because it has so many strong songs, and a wide range of music from the band. I do not like every single song on both discs, but I am very impressed with the overall album. Songs like \\"I found Jesus\\", \\"The Happy Song\\", \\"I Could Sing of Your Love Forever\\", and \\"What is this thing called love?\\" really opened my eyes about modern Christian music.I highly recommend this album to any Deliriuous fan, or anyone looking for a Christian band that is making great music these days. If you have never bought a Christian album before, take a chance with this one. It just may surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!!","review":"This is a very powerful album.

The reason : even a minuscule grain of dust will create a \\"princess and the pea\\" effect, generate a very visible bubble when the screen is off.

I can count 3 days in 6 years where I was toying with something coming on and even if it did get me down for the first day, I'd up the dosage and sweat it out that same night to a healthy next day.

Virtually tasteless. Put a little in their food or water. Does not harm them, all natural. My cats have always gotten better. Me too! Give it to my kids too when they are sick.

The story of the grandmother will be familiar to Tan and Kingston readers, but this is where similarities end. The book mostly focuses on the rise of communism in China, from its idealistic beginnings until the author leaves China in the seventies.The book is split into three parts. The grandmother was a concubine to a warlord and later marries a kind older doctor. The mother joins the communist party, and marries a communist official. The daughter struggles between dedication to Mao and her own ideals. Most of the book focuses on the life of author, the daughter in the story.What I took out of this book was a greater understanding of communism, why it appealed to the people of China, and how communism can be twisted into something far less ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful memoir","review":"The strength of these women is incredible.

You will never look at the Chinese in the same way after reading Wild Swans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Chinese family history","review":"\\"At the age of fifteen, my grandmother became the concubine of a warlord.\\" That's a grabber, if ever there was one. Author Jung Chang, who now lives in London, leads readers through the traumatic events that befell her family members as the Communist revolution overwhelmed the country. Even if you think you understand the far-reaching and pervading effect of Chairman Mao's edicts, I guarantee your eyes will open even wider as you read the 500 pages of Wild Swans.Although Mao's rise to power destroyed the corrupt Kuomintang and brought quick relief from their brutality, subsequent events proved the truth of the old axiom, Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, for Mao created a maelstrom that ultimately resulted in the deaths of 40 million Chinese. The country plunged into years of famine, torture, and chaos.Written by a member of the Red Guard and the granddaughter of that concubine introduced in the beginning, Wild Swans will stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"list of facts","review":"I didn't think there was much to this \\"story\\".

I really think the author is a talented and smart person, and from what I hear from my parents I also think what she is telling is mostly true. But I feel sorry for her for what she must have suffered from her selfishness and her own negative view of everything around her. I used to be like that many many years ago and I know how it hurts. Anything has both good side and bad side. I think it's more healthy to remember what good things happened rather than how terrible things were which nobody can do anything about.This book could be much better if the author had more sense of humor and described everything in a lighter tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I specifically ordered a hardback from this \\"business\\" and received a paperback.

Now, how would you rate business practices such as these? Would you want to do business like this? It's an ongoing headache as I had to dispute a month ago.

This novel must be a historian haven because it only deals with historical facts and lacking the exicitement, thrill, FEELINGS in a book.

The first part of the book is actually good. it is exciting and interesting. The second part is where the book falls apart, though. the author just spouts off about herself, and causes the book to be many extra pages. The book ends up being more like a fact book than an actual book. It is like reading a list of events...only having the list be very long. It isn't much of a book, in the end. I wouldnt suggest reading this book...it ends up being a waste of time, in my opinion. read the first part, then just put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"This book gives people a real picture of the life of the Chinese people after the Chin Empire was overthrown.

I loved everything about it and learnt so much. I learned about Chang's grandmother's feet being broken and the effect Communism had on her family.A truly unique and wonderful book.By Parisa Diba Age 14 England"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Portrait of Soaring Above","review":"Ms. Chang (whose birth name Er-Hong means 'another/second wild swan') leads us from the anonymous shadowy past of her great-grandmother's enforced ignominy, her grandmother's struggle to find redemption and peace, through her Mother's blatant heroism and to the emergence from her own chrysalis of Maoism.Beautifully told, Ms. Chang leaves no one in her family whose story can be shared left out, and like ripples of fingers touching the water's surface, she weaves the lives of those around her family artfully and honestly into her story. While the tale often reads like a Sysiphean struggle, Ms. Chang never neglects the beauty and stubbornly pervasive hope that blossoms through the cracks in 20th century China.Historical, lyrical, part biography and autobiography, tragic, romantic and inspiring, there are few readers who would not enjoy this book with great satisfaction and end it with a hunger for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey in time","review":"I read this book as I travelled through from Japan to China and through China to Mongolia. I didn't really see a great deal of China and felt that I learnt a lot more from the pages of WILD SWANS. From the first numbing pages that describe the barbarous practice of foot-binding and thoughout the book's long history that spans a century and three female generations, I was hooked and blinded to life outside WILD SWANS. I was wholly absorbed and felt for once that I was being educated at the same time. This is a book for lovers of fiction who feel they should know more about history. A brilliant, moving gritty, chilling saga all the better for being true, and also an enlightening treatise on a century of Chinese Socio-political history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Context","review":"Jung Chang vividly describes the atmosphere in a communist China. It is not only a story about three women pioneers, but it is also a story about the political struggle of a nation. Although the book moves slow at times, the reader does not lose interest because of the desire to learn more about the lives of these heroic women. If anyone has any doubts about the harsh lifestyle of the citizens of China during this century, read this book and you can actually feel the political tension of that period. A wonderful book, not only educational, but thought provoking as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Swans","review":"The book arrived in very good condition. The graphic details are pleasant when she decribes nature and disturbing when she descibes the many wars and the political uprisings. I recalled the USA uprisings in the late 60's and 70's when I read about the uprisings in China during those years.It makes me wonder if we are due for politiacl uprisings here in the USA. I was in Beijing for 4 days in 1992 and saw the Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, the Great Wall and other sights. Our guide would not talk about conditions in China.I know China has built a new airport since then as well as many other attractions in preparation for the Olympics they held a few years ago. Reading this book would make a person shudder at the thought the USA would become a socialist country, much less a communist country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Moving, Thought Provoking","review":"An eye-opening, true story of the plight of 3 generations of Chinese women. The map pages help the reader track their journeys as they simply try to survive and raise a family in a country where unimaginable starvation, brutality, and war, not to mention the low status of women in general, were a part of everyday life. The pictures put faces on the characters and make the story that much more meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Swans used book purchase from Amazon","review":"Surprised and not at all pleased to see notations written in pen in the book's margins.I would never present a book for re-sale with a single mark in it and didn't know Amazon did so."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"The book started off pretty well. The story of her grandmother with the bound feet, living as a concubine, trying to escape the culture, yet integrally woven into it; this was all very interesting. And the area when Mao took over with his foggy regime is enthralling. But then the book trails off and becomes frankly boring. Granted, she's had a more eventful life than I, but she sort of lost track of the focus about halfway through, as though she were excited about writing the book in the begining, but lost her concentration along the way and just sort of wrapped it up at the end. Overall, I would not recommend this book. 60 to 80 pages of interesting material, and lots of filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple-minded, self-pitying anti-socialist propaganda lies","review":"Jung Chang was the privileged daughter of China's communist elite. Her father was a Grade 10 official. She grew up in a protected, walled household with a wet-nurse, a nanny, a maid, a gardener and a chauffeur, all provided by the government. She was educated in a special school for officials' children. After being sent to the countryside, she was able to leave just a few weeks later. She then became a student at university and got a generous Chinese government scholarship to study in the UK. All this happened during the Cultural Revolution, years before her father was officially rehabilitated."},{"rating":"1","title":"too factual","review":"It felt like I was reading a history book and not a story book. I know it was historical, but I really couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on previous reviews, I wanted to like this book. BUT.","review":"The subject matter is clearly fascinating . . . an insider's description of the turbulent history of China over the past 150 years . . . And yet ultimately the book disappoints. The writing is stilted and often turgid . . .where was the editor? The high drama of China reads like an old-fashioned text book, and reminds me why I used to \\"hate history\\" in school. A good editor or secondary writer could have made this a blockbuster. I'm sorry. It didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the first quarter of the book is good...","review":"I delved into this book immediately, relishing the wonderful description of a life so alien to my own. I could admire the dedication of Chang's mother, grandmother, and father when they were presented historically.Then the chick started talking about herself, and it all went downhill.Interesting events turned to petty, schoolgirl tales. Wondering about the noble intentions of people changed to reading -- over and over again -- whiny justifications of ignorance and stupidity. And even worse, it seems as if the editor lost interest in the book at about the same place, since the self-obsessed nonsense goes on and on and on...By all means, read the first part -- but stop before you too resent the hours wasted on the later drivel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, it's that good.","review":"For ten years, friends, relatives, and acquaintances had assured me that I must read Wild Swans. We had two copies in the house, both gifts from people who had loved it. Still, I didn't get around to reading it until my book discussion group added it to our list. Wow. It was the most compelling book I'd read in a long time, and it sticks in my mind like few others. My book club has a membership with varied tastes and experiences-including a botanist who has lived and taught in China-but The Wild Swans cast its spell over every one of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most thought provoking book I ever read!","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend who is studying Chinese history. I never knew anything about the Chinese culture and history, only that it was under Communist rule. This book has changed my outlook on life in general totally. Before I read the book, I took life in a secure family and a democratic country for granted, almost blind to the suffering in other countries such as China. I was amazed at the courage and strength of the author and her predecessors. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone and not just to read and forget about, but to inform and bring about awareness of the bravery of the Chinese people who survived the horrors of Mao."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books","review":"I read this book in paperback quite awhile ago but remember it as one of the better reads I ever had.It was very interesting to read about a China, that had been hidden from the rest of the world for so long, via this woman's family saga that starts with her grandma back in the early part of the 20th century when women still had to have their feet bound (unbelievable cultural norm in those days!)It continues via her parents who tried very hard to be politically correct/current during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution under Mao (a psychopathic ruler if ever there was one).Concurrently with her parents' story, is the author's own as she watches/experiences her family's trials/tribulations under Mao. She eventually leaves China in the 1970's using her learned English skills to become a teacher in the UK.I was fascinated to learn about what China had been like during the era when it was firmly behind a bamboo curtain. This book vividly did that for me.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Strength Under Tragic Conditions","review":"This is a beautifully written family memoir which will educate readers about the history of China since the 1920's through the eyes of three women who lived it.We hear of the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" and Chairman Mao in passing, but there's very little understanding of how it really played out for those living there. It's sad, and at times I was angry about what happened in China, but in the end I realized the beauty & strength of Family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"Before I read this book I had limited knowledge of china's history, specifically when Mao was in power. This book does a very thorough job of explaining this period of history in china when Communism took root. It is a heartbreaking story of a family of women and the tragedies they suffered.Some parts of this book where details of every little battle and riot could have been left out if you asked me. Overall it is a good education of China's history and the level of brainwashing that was \\"forced\\" upon a group of people whose aim was to create a better country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing look into a different world","review":"Like many Americans educated in the standard world education classes covering the history of everything in a year or two, I had only vague knowledge about the history of communist China when I began reading this book. I learned an amazing amount about life under Mao from the stories of an incredible family. The author skillfully weaves her family's personal stories together with information of the history of the country as a whole, demonstrating how deeply affected every family was under the regime. Jung Chang's prose is captivating, and while the book is quite a lengthy read, I was never bored or tempted to quit reading. Wild Swans is definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a book I would have thought I would like.","review":"I came to this book through my participation in a book club that focuses on cultural diversity. We've read both good and not so good books, and to tell the truth my initial feelings on reading this book were less than positive. I was surprised and impressed to find that Jung Chang makes the cultural history of China, something I knew NOTHING about, fascinating. She weaves her family's personal story of gain, loss, joy and anguish together with the historically accurate tale of a nation in the midst of wrenching change.I have never been happier to be wrong than I was with this book, it deserves to be read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking Story","review":"If you want to learn more about China during the last century, this book is a good one. It is a gripping story about a family with almost incredible perserverance in the face of nearly constant adversity.Although the book does have a happy ending, the majority is very sad bordering on depressing. These people have had very tough lives! It was also fascinating to learn about Mao and the extent to which he controlled every facet of people's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"An excellent history lesson.I couldn't put the book down.

It's a classic, still banned in China. The ebook edition has some typing errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best historical books i've ever read!","review":"I am usually not a fan of books on history but this book intertwines the stories of these three women so well that I was actually able to learn a lot of China's history without ever getting bored. The chinese culture of women is so fascinating and reading it's evolution was a big eye opener. Being taiwanese, it was a very interesting (and often shocking) perspective into the history of China that I was never ever taught in school. I have new admiration for the chinese people who went through these difficult times before, during and after the cultural revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Banned in China","review":"This book is well written and very informative. I learned a lot about the history of China and the lives of it's people during the 80 years covered by the author. We are lucky to live in a country where we can read whatever we want. The people of China whose story this is..are restricted from reading it. Americans can barely imagine..a country where political criticism is not permitted. The author Jung Chang obviously loves her family and the people of her native country. She honestly tells the story of her family and the events that shaped their lives. Her writing reminds me of Pearl Buck's. She has the ability to grasp how governmental issues affect the citizenry."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible book depicting the hardships under Mao","review":"This was an outstanding book. It kept me turning page after page all night long. I had to read this for my Asian history class at Ohio State. We have had other books to read for this class. By far, this book was much more interesting. The main reason is, that it talks about a personal struggle as well as the struggle of the population in general. It tied very large events that we have learned about in history such as the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" and \\"Mao's Personality Revolution\\" into a personal perspective and actually made me realize what Mao's thought control programs actually did to the Chinese people. This shows us another example of what can happen when someone gets too much power."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of an unusal family","review":"The story of this family is not usual. The grandmother was the mistress of a warlord, the mother was a communist revolutionist, and her daughter, the author of the book has escaped form China as a young girl. The thing I respect the most, that the author has only used personal experiences, and only written about things she has seen with her own eyes, or things which has happened with her family, and never used unchecked stories in her descriptions. She never tells a word in her story against the regime, even when she writes about the most shocking events in her family, but leave the reader to create his or her own opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it.","review":"The subject matter is fascinating and I tried to stay with this book, but I found myself having to make myself keep reading. A good book is one where you want to read it, not feel like you HAVE to.Couldn't figure out why I wasn't liking this book until I read some of the other reviews here and some of the reviewers nailed it: the book lacks feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings you back to Chinese History","review":"This book will definitely glued you especially after the World War II part. The lifestyle of the author's parents as well as how China evolved to being a Communist country is definitely an eye-opener. My favorite part in reading this book is following through what the author's parents have to endure their sufferings and changes from being one of the top officials to being a peasant. I did not like the part about Jung Chang's personal sufferings that much (last few chapters). It sounds to me that it's all about her sufferings and complaints. But overall I love this book and would recommend to anyone who loves history as this book describes the scenes really well and will definitely captivate your imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written book on some rather exceptionaly exciting subjects.","review":"It is quite difficult to determine if this book is a documentary or a novel. The overall style of narration points to it being a documentary, while some, rather out of place phrases, such as \`he walked away into a snowy night', attempt to present it with a flavor of a novel. While English is clearly not the writer's native tongue, it is hard to overlook editor's poor job. A published work should not have blunders such as \\"teachers demanded a pay rise\\". While the subject of Chinese (and for that matter, World) history in 20th century is very exciting and one learns a lot from the book, dealing with 5th grade level English is rather frustrating and soon becomes very tiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"A must read for anyone interested in Chinese history and modern changes among women. Beautiful story of three generations of women. Truly moved by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Swans","review":"We are leaving for China this month. This book has been very informative.

At times, I think it's a little unbelievable in the detail that she knows about family members who were no longer alive when she wrote the book. However, the writing is easy and her descriptions emotionally charged. This would be an especially good book to read in preparation for a trip to China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was dirty and marked with black markers","review":"I ended up returning this because my \\"new\\" book was dirty on three sides and marked up with a marker. The price at the time was great though.

All in all, a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Thumbs Up","review":"This memoir is superbly written,two thumbs up.It's not simply about the life of Jung Chang and her family members but it also tells us the situation in China and what happened politically from 40's to 70's,particularly about the Cultural Revolution.This memoir has shown me how did Mao Zedong conquer the whole China ,how cruel he was,how greedy he was and he might be considered as the devil of 20th century...You'd be grateful to live in your own safe country and you might don't want to leave a grain of rice on your plate after reading the part of Cultural Revolution and \\"Great Leap Forward.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"As close to real as anyone could write.","review":"Having both read and taught about China for years, and having been to China in 1981, I was impressed with the clarity and accuracy of Jung Chang's book. I read it after my second trip to China this past June. I only wish she had continued to write more about her own life. Maybe she will in another book. The map and timelines were very much appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for anyone in China Studies","review":"After digging through numerous academic and fiction textbooks on China, my encounter with Wild Swans has changes my perception of China for ever.Never I read a more compelling and dispassionately written story that is so incredibly unbelievable that you have to read it from the first to the last page without a minute of interruption.This book re-positions any publication about the great Chinese leaders, about Maoism, about propaganda, about Chinese culture and life.This work should be read by anyone interested in China and especially those with inclination towards socialism.Applying a quote from the book \\"if this (China) is heaven, how does hell look like\\", now if this is non-fiction, how does fiction look like?"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOWDOWN ON THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION--AND THEN SOME","review":"If you want to know about China before, during, and after the Cultural Revolution, then read this book. The story starts in the era of the early 1900's and goes up to the present. The author's mother's name in Chinese means Wild Swans in English hence: reason for the title. Ms. Chang's parents were high up politically in China and she did get extra favors during her life, however, there was a lot of suffering goin' on due to Mao's policies. How a billion people can get sucked into ravaging a country points out the importance of educating and training the youth...properly with high values! This is one fine read."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended view of chinese women","review":"Others have provided excellent descriptions of this book. I'd like to pass on reasons I consider it the best book for insight into Chinese women. Twenty/thirtysomething Chinese colleagues recommended it over other English texts. Relatives who had lived in China during the 1920-30s aggreed.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't go the China W/O this book","review":"I made the mistake of stepping into Beijing without first reading this wonderful book. BIG MISTAKE. Because I wasn't in the know, I had no idea that the big portrait of Mao standing above the forbidden city should be looked upon with disdain. And to think that I had a picture taken in front of the thing like thousands of other Chinese (oh the humanity).Wild Swans is filled with insights about China - things you don't learn by just merely going there. For instance, where is all that wonderful Chinese history? Why its been smashed and burned. And who exactly was free from tyrannical reign? The leaders? Yea, right.If you like paranoia, un-righteous dominion, and especially a book you will not only not be able to put down, you wont be able to go without telling everyone you know to read it - then Wild Swans is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to read.","review":"An extremely sobering look at 20th century China from an inside perspective. The anguish through which the author was put through was very difficult to read. Recommended to anyone, regardless of whether or not you know much about the history of China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Inspirational","review":"Chang's \\"Wild Swans\\" is an informative book about three generations of women's lives in China from before, during, and shortly after Mao Tse-tung. Ms. Chang shows through descriptive words how it is to be a supporter of the Kuomitang, of Mao and even against it all, through the eyes of family, friends and acquaintances. If you are searching to know more about China's communist history, this is an intresting and easy readable book. This books has sparked an interest in me to know more about China and about other atrocities around the world. Though this is a sad part of history, it is a part of history that everyone should be informed about. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"It must be extremely difficult to remain objective when writing a biography of yourself and your family when the setting is as tragic as 20th Century China. This book surpasses the excellent Victor Villasenor family history of his Mexican family's exodus to the United STates by providing a great deal of historical and political background to her incredible story. So, you not only get the remarkable story of her struggle through the excesses of Mao's China; but she more than adequately outlines the reasons for these excesses.Tragedy often affords certain individuals to display a courage and patience that inspires and instills optimism in the human condition. Ms. Chung writes a very human and moving account of one woman's struggle and triumphant over a society gone mad.I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in the China and toll Mao's ego inflicted on his own people."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book you can't put down","review":"I read this enormous book in about 5 jet-lagged nights.

The author follows the life of three generations of Chinese women. The story rings true because it is the story of the writer's family. In most readable style, the reader absorbs the history of China. Not only did I get a history lesson, I loved every minute of the education this book provided. I was fascinated by it. After, I sought out other books that spoke to the plight of Chinese women through history. It led me to Pearl Buck, more Amy Tan, whom I love, \\"The White Haired Girl\\", \\"Red Azela\\" and others written by writers I'd never have found had \\"Wild Swans\\" not peaked my interest. I often send it to friends whom I know will enjoy it and would probably never discover it otherwise. A must read for those who choose to stretch well beyond the bestseller list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood Style, rated high mainly by Westerners","review":"I read Wild Swans in 1995. Since many of my American friends rated this book highly, I tried to read it again two years later, but I could not finish it. Something is missing in the book from a Chinese point of view. Many of my Chinese friends who are all great writers, have the same opinion as mine: it was written in Hollywood style to appeal to Western readers, but it does not appeal to Chinese readers and writers.I like \\"Life and Death in Shanghai\\", \\"Daughter of China\\" and \\"Flying High Out of a Tibetan Valley\\" better than \\"Wild Swans\\". Those three books are true to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compulsory read","review":"A powerful, thought provoking experience. Modern history brought to life.

The tail broke off and had to be taped on and then the actual fusilage broke apart. I have used other air hogs toys and found them to be of much better quality than this one. Even if the plane hadn't been a cheap piece of junk, it only flies in circles, so it doesn't present any educational value or challenge for the kids. If you are thinking about an R/C plane, don't be suckered into this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toy on the market if they offered 0 stars I would have given it to this toy!","review":"This toy looked cool in the package so I bought it for my 10 y/o son. He played with it for less than 10 minutes and it was trashed! The nose was caved in, the wings were broken, it was in like 5 pieces. If I hadn't been sitting there watching him play with it I would have swore that he tore it apart.

Harv Ecker or this guy. Wayne Dyer always cracks me up. And yet fills me with hope at the same time. This DVD presents his early notions on life and living but with a dry wit and sometimes (when he is confident in his own message) with a real punch.Although this isn't his usual down to earth, lets get to the point, \\"verbally practiced for soundbites\\" answers to living life more \\"graciously\\"... He does still find a place to \\"still the mind\\" with logical and respectable inner calm expounded concepts and observations, that my soul eats up and licks the plate clean....but the DVD.. i dunno... is edited like something you'd see on your local church channel. It's actually a bit of a turn-off...reeeeally bland... Someone should re-edit this DVD and repackage it & I think it would be a wonderful companion for inner-self-maintenance that shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the most comfortable sandals I have ever owned and they seem to last forever without wearing out.

It's a cartoon version of a documentary of surfing penguins. Because it tries to feel and look like a documentary, it is neither cute nor funny. So there is no reason to see it. Some consider it a mockumentary but it would have to be at least a little bit funny to qualify as a mockumentary. Admittedly, I find the whole genre of mockumentary stupid. Even the \\"best\\" of them,This Is Spinal Tap (Special Edition), was unable to hold my attention in spite of several attempts to watch the thing based on its inclusion in Top 100 lists.Want proof? I took my 7 year old to the local drive-in to see it. He'll even watch Pokemon. He lost interest quickly and began to play with the other children in the area, all of whom had also lost interest. The adults lost interest just as quickly and began standing around in groups discussing anything but the movie. Yes it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back please?","review":"Boring.

In the meantime Sony, please concentrate on the Marvel movies and Sony Pictures Classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This movie was not very impressive. It was simply a documentary formed as a cartoon if I wanted to see a real documentary I would have just rented one with actual humans! This movie is a cute concept but is for older kids, as they use concepts such as bad language and death throughout the film. This is not for little kids due to those two things. Plus my three year old and five year old, watched it for the first ten minutes and then where totally bored and left the room. So this movie did not hold there attention. I thought this was going to be a cute movie about penguins that they could enjoy because of the spectacular reviews this movie has recieved. Turns out it was just the opposite.

The last few animated movies that were claimed to great weren't that great, so I expected this movie to be that way too. BUT IT'S NOT!!!!!! I thought it was adorable.

I really hate this movies for the fact that the voice is so terrible. Seem like these folks is on medication when they are doing their voice acting. the voice must be attractive not annoying. Have you ever seen any thing so repulsive? The voice acting in this movie is the same. If there is a half star or less rating, it would deserve it.

We read to our children from one of them every night and this one is by far our favorite. The illustrations are good. There is a color illustration on each page.

Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited. She has the nose of a lab. She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways. They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite. One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give. You can give 1 or 10. The bag never seems to finish. There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits. We love them also because they are healthier than other treats. She loves them because they are good. That's all that matters.

The visuals are great. I think the songs are pretty catchy and... not terrible. I appreciate the Wiggles for the use of harmony and interesting instrumentation while not losing the simplicity that appeals to kids. They are definitely one of my favorite kids' groups.The only negative about this dvd is that the dubbing is just terrible! It is rare that the lips of the performers are mouthing the same word that we're hearing. My kids are not bothered by it and as long as I don't actually look at it, it doesn't bother me either. But goodness, you'd think they could get a better dubbing engineer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Vid!","review":"This video is SUPPOSED to be a remake of Wake Up Jeff!

I was left wanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas; Dead on Arrival","review":"111 pages of a story with a lot of promise, and evidence that Rehak had definite talent and good ideas. But he tries to do too much in a book that doesn't know if it's a philosophical foray or a television drama. The one lesbian sex scene has its place in the book, but Rehak handles it like Penthouse Forum. 111 pages is not enough room to have philosophy, cliche television moments, and bland erotica.What Rehak shows is ambition in his effort to bring together interesting ideas, his writing style is clear, and he is organized in his thinking. He shows himself as a writer trying to challenge himself and his readers. Lots of promise here, but what is delivered is subpar and dragged down by corny plot twists, and overambition . However, with all sincerity, I think Rehak will improve and his second book should be worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what I need","review":"I will offer a caution that one can probably go to a retailer and buy notebooks for a comparitable or better price, with that said, I'm a writer who bought notebooks from various providers and it is convieniant to have everything you need in one fall swoop. Be careful with the wire spirals though because they can become unwound if not properly cared for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Empty Pot","review":"I read this book outloud at a church variety night to the children present.

This album is not intresting, nothing like his last two albums.I dont know why They cover their voices with wack beats. They need to turn down the volume and turn up the MIC because Bone Thugs dont need background music.This album is not PROFESSIONAL. It was half assed desperate for money.

If you are a supporter of capital punishment, you will question your beliefs. (Assuming, of course, that slightly open mind.) If you are like me, a moderate who had come to believe that the death penalty is probably wrong, you will be shaken out of your complacency. This book is terribly disturbing. How can I be sitting here, comfortable in my cozy middle class life, going to my lovely church and teaching Sunday School. How can I be just going about my life, unconcerned, when MY government is killing people in MY name? How can Christians sit by and let this happen? We can't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book!","review":"I ordered \\"The Death of Innocents\\" by Helen Prejean, as shown in the item photo. However, I received and will return \\"The Death of Innocents\\" by Richard Firstmann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and lacking logic","review":"I admire Sister Helen's dedication and am grateful for the comfort she has provided people, but this book is a one-sided representation of the facts surrounding the death penalty. Furthermore, it is riddled with poor logic. Nonetheless, I take seriously the argument she presents. I recommend that people get informed about all aspects of this complex issue. The Death of Innocents can be a start, but make sure you utilize more resources than just this biased book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejean is biased and not credible; avoid this book","review":"This book omits a lot of information pointing to the guilt of the two men that Prejean claims are innocent. She twists the facts of these cases to suit her own agenda. And her agenda is to make sure that rapists and murderers are shown kindness, compassion and mercy. She has little compassion for the victims of these criminals and their families. Her mission in life is doing as much as she can for the rapists and murderers she encounters and she will lie in order to save them from execution. Don't bother reading this book. Prejean cannot be trusted to tell the truth. And it's infuriating to hear her defend these men as \\"innocents\\"; they were both very dangerous, immoral creeps. They were guilty of the crimes they were convicted of, and were duly executed. Justice was served."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining not comprehensive.... :(","review":"If you are serious about the subject that Prejean writes on you should always do a little research on your own. That means you don't limit yourself to what defense attorneys or anti-death penalty groups disseminate. It's what doesn't get printed or written about that makes you wonder more. Omitting evidence that indicates guilt where it exists is a disingenuous tactic.These works represent wonderful \\"entertainment\\" but are not conclusive or comprehensive. As noted in other reviews, Prejean excludes certain facts that don't necessarily agree with what makes her works interesting. Check court opinions on the Internet or the fine print in old news articles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distortion of facts in Dobie Gillis Williams case","review":"Sister Helen Prejean certainly has a right to voice her opinion regarding the death penalty. As a family member of the victim in the Dobie Gillis Williams case, it was very disturbing to see that she only presented a one-sided view. She did not attend Williams's trial nor bother to review ALL of the evidence. So many of the statements she makes in this book regarding the Dobie Williams case are distorted. It doesn't seem that accuracy and truth are as important to Sister Prejean as promoting her views on the death penalty. She did not even show enough respect to the victim in this horrible crime to spell her name correctly. Her name is Sonya Merritt Knippers, not Sonja. This is only one of the erroneous or misleading statements in this book. I am simply saying that everyone has a right to his or her opinion regarding the death penalty---but if you are writing a book about particular cases---it should be fair, accurate and truthful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional drivel.","review":"Helen Prejean has elevated her beliefs above God and everyone else who does not share her emotional, \\"growing compassion.\\" The mere suggestion that if God does not meet Prejean's human standard of compassion, then he is not worthy of her worship, is offensive to me. Hey Sister Helen, It's not about YOU! Prejean's beliefs that scripture has been misinterpreted to support the death penalty and that she knows the true mind of Christ are, while warm and fuzzy, inaccurate and misdirected. That innocent people are sometimes convicted of crimes and ultimately imprisoned for life or executed is a tragedy. But to say that this justifies the abolishment of the death penalty is ridiculous. Don't bother with this book it is an old lady grasping for straws to support her cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armitron Women's watch","review":"Had a watch just like this one for 18 years.

It disrupts the flow of information and order. Reading it straight through is fine but when you do that how can it be interactive? What make this book different from any other book ever published? Nothing. The writer claims to be an expert or pioneer in this field yet the irony is in the title of this book! If she truly wanted to make this book interactive, she should have published it on CD-ROM links and all and made the plates in the back of the book interactive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype","review":"If you don't know anything about technology before reading this book then be careful -- it conveys a very hyped up view of it (you'll need a serious reality check when you're done).

Quite well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost fell asleep","review":"I'm trying to find why people liked this movie so much, but I still don't get it. The characters are self-centered, not very insightful, and not particularly believable. The monologues and dialogues are endless, and sound like nobody anybody knows. Usually when one finds somebody, even remotely close to this level of pretenciousness, the natural instinct is to flee. I've read people describing this as the \\"voice of a generation\\", but I hope the generation it's describing isn't as pathetic as this. So to sum up: Kicking and Screaming is about narcicistic, pathetic pretentios loosers, with no redeeming qualities, who lounge around groping for a meaning to life that's never going to arrive. Sounds delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like somebody stayed too long in film school","review":"I just couldn't care about these just past college 20-somethings, struggling to find themselves while engaging in annoying fake quiz games.

In all honesty this review only covers the first of the movie due to the fact I had to turn it off. I don't know if it was just bad acting, a bad script or uninspiring direction - actually it was all of the above. I have read other reviews and keep asking myself - did we watch the same movie? This high school project of a movie will be bundled with Catwomen, Gigli, and Norbit. (I hope I can get $1 for all these paper weights). If you want to watch a great movie about the same subject - check out Fandango (now there is a great flick - one of the best comedies ever)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I just saw this movie, and I thought it was terrible! As a college student, I take offense at this \\"I-just-graduated-and-I-have-nothing-better-to-do-than-make-out-with-girls-half-my-age\\" male flick. The most interesting parts of this pointless film were the recurring flashbacks of the lead character's first encounters with his estranged girlfriend portayed by Olivia d'Abo. Other than that, however, this movie is sorely lacking in interest and character."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a gem, don't miss it","review":"There is a certain quality about this film which makes it watchable over and over again. I think it has to do with the success of the flashback sequences providing just enough overlap of weaving the story and the characters together. There is cleverness and a humble attention to human reality that just packs every little scene - you can watch this totally out of sequence and still enjoy it. I don't think it has anything to do with the post-college setting, it has more to do with the universal nature of fleeting relationships, bad choices made out of pride, and the sort of instant nostalgia you feel for things that you knew were good and let slip away. This is a very smart, funny movie I highly recommend. There's no gimmicky death, illness, or obsurd plot points - just an honest story about lost love and friendships as they mature through time, played by skilled actors and filled with great dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Script","review":"A classic post-college movie, filled with great lines and identifiable situations.

The drama always hits that perfect note of nostalgic melancholy. And they are intertwined with the grace evident in the best of Neil Simon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talkie But Fun","review":"Let me just say this right off, I am a die hard fan of independent films. I enjoy character driving movies rather then the big explosions and thin story lines of big budget hollywood films. This film was very entertaining and witty, but the people were never explored more then just the surface. I would recommend this movie anyway, if just to mavel at the clever dialogue between John Hamilton (Grover) and Chris Eigeman (Max)."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you make God laugh?

The story of 4 friends, who really aren't sure why they're friends, and the confusion they experience after college graduation, \\"What now?\\" kind of feeling. Throw in Grover's (Josh Hamilton) girlfriend (Olivia D'Abo) leaving for school in Prague, and a bartender who is working on his umpteenth degree, and you have a wonderful movie.

It is a dialogue heavy comedy piece, complete with characters you knew from college. You'll find yourself imagining similar conversations that you had with friends/classmates taken from the movie. Although released in 1995, it is somewhat timeless. Moreover, if you caught Stillman's \\"Barcelona\\" or \\"The Last Days of Disco\\", you will find this film far more engrossing (as it doesn't have the forced social commentary that Stillman instills in his works). Ultimately, this film is rare as one will truly identify with the characters - particularly concerning their faults and apprehensions towards adulthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost like being there","review":"I saw Tanya in concert for the first time in August '05 and this CD is pretty much what I experienced, minus a few songs and some chit-chat with the audience.

I found it a much better book, still resonating in my memory over ten years after I finished reading it on 6 April 1991. Unless you are really interested in the various units fighting, the account of those units' various actions and inactions is a drag for one who had no relative in the AEF or is not a wargamer. Incidentally, on page 10 Eisenhower says that on April 6, 1917 the USA was at war with Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But I find that the USA did not declare war on Austia-Hungary until Dec 7, 1917. I am curious as to why war was declared on that country at that particular time, and would like to know more about the reason for that particular timing.

The most important map in the book on p.211 is flat out wrong!Finally BG Eisenhower mentions the effects of the Spanish Flu on German troops and the bout that Gen. Pershing suffered.

And the end that fits into the nav unit is at a fixed 90 degreee angle, so unless you are using the suction cup (illegal in at least two states) or the friction fit, the design of the cord means that the nav unit cannot lie flat.

The film deals with colonialism -- it could have been written by Fanon, for how radical it is. It's also presented in Italian, with Brando's part dubbed (but not as badly as you would expect) into that language. If this version were released on DVD, I would buy it promptly.

The genius of this film is in the questions it raises in our own minds, and there are many.This film does not storm the senses but plays gently to the mind the eye and the ear. Brando gives us a rogueish,taciturn yet tragic hero, while Morricone weaves a rich musical blanket which is both enigmatic and beautiful and which comforts us through the varied scenes.

I can't say if a wider version exists or if this is correct as this is the only version I have seen. 4:3 translates to 1.33:1...so this is not 4:3. You will notice that the black bars on each side are thinner than if you were watching broadcast non-HD programming which is presented in 4:3 (or 1.33:1) aspect ratio. Widescreen 16:9 which is what our new widescreen televisions display translates to 1.78:1. 1.83:1 would mean black bars top and bottom, even on a widescreen tv.

Don't expect much in that way of instrumentals or notable lyrics.

Of course, at the beginning of the film, it states that those editing it wished to stay as close to what Orson intended, in it's making. TO me, Orson takes a page from righ out of his character, Will Varner, in The Long Hot Summer. His acting skill as a crude, clever, bawdy, worn out Detective, who wants to run all of those in whom he runs into, in his course of administrative sleuthing is unmatched. To me this is the style character Orson was made for. And I must say that the film had a good cast - with other leading stars of the day - like Charleton Heston and Janet Leigh. Charleton Heston's Character running into Orson's - as Ole Hank, reminds me of what Forest Gump said in getting a box of chocolates, \\"you never know what you're going to get.\\" I highly recommend this film, but I must admit I am a great fan of Orson Welles, and anything he acts in.

The cast is A+ and the acting is just as good, especially the classic performances from Charleston Heston and Orson Welles. If you like a good mystery then you should check this out. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Touch of Evil","review":"This movie was OK. It was not what I had expected from heavy hitters like Charleston Heston and Orson Wells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant","review":"I don't know why I don't like the film Touch of Evil. I should like the film with a very good cast including Orson Welles and Charlton Heston. It's regarded as classic film noir. But there's an unidentifiable unpleasantness about the film. At my age and with my sensibilities, I don't need to be watching films that strike me as unpleasant. I'd much rather watch North By Northwest, which was made at about the same time as Touch of Evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parts Greater Than the Whole","review":"In terms of performance, this film is much less ambitious than Welles' other work, particularly the choice of Heston to play Vargas; yet, the camerawork and frame compositions are as staggering as one would expect. Unfortunately, this leads to a case of the parts being greater than the whole, as there's a reason most people have only heard about this film's opening sequence. (8/10)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the real thing!","review":"I am the Japanese who lives in Japan.I am sorry to be poor at English.I looked forward to this DVD very much, and imported it. But, those contents were very disappointing.It is because Welles of the truth was found nowhere there.This is not a wide screen!They are the cruel remains that a head and a leg were cut off!Welles is supposed to feel sorry. @Then, we feel sorry beyond him.It looks forward to an original work from far Japan. @It asks for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great Movie?","review":"Two star for the story, I thought that it was quite interesting, but all these good actors acting SOOOO BADLY.Orson wells was like a cartoon character, Charlton Heston a mexican? Por favor! and the rest of the actors all look like a joke.Marlene Dietrich looked ridiculous.When you are watching a good movie you \\"get into it\\" and forget that you are looking at a screen, but in this case I knew at all times that I was watching a bunch of people \\"acting\\" and quite badly in spite of theirmovie and stage pedigrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"A touch of laughter?","review":"Two stars for the story that's somehow interesting, the rest is rather laughable.The great Orson Wells looks like a cartoon character, Marlene Dietrich looks simply ridiculous and Charlton Heston a mexican? POR FAVOR!!The rest of the cast are like a joke,the Mexican villains are simply offensive.What a waste of a good cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't go back","review":"You can't go back... Last time I watched this movie was when it first came out in the late 50s. At the time I thought it was marvelous! We really looked forward to going back in time and seeing it again. What a total waste of time. I guess this is proof that you can't go back. Orson Welles was a slobbering moron who needs a drewl cup. Charlton Heston just sort of floats through and does not even try to act. The rest of the cast could be from another planet for all I know. Save your money and buy something good like Unbreakable with Bruce Willis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Filmed mostly at night which renders most scenes dimly lit and extremely hard to see. Additionally, the plot itself is compromised by a jumble of farfetched characters who are difficult to decipher. Are they caricatures, comedic portrayals or something deeper and more sinister? Had to turn it off well before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classic in my book","review":"Orson Welles may have been a great man, but this is no great movie. Greatly boring, yes. Aside from the restored opening sequence of a car exploding, the rest of the film is a jumbled-up mess of shambling actors muttering nonsensical dialogue. My mother went to bed halfway through; my dad fell asleep in his chair, and my husband and I simply laughed and shook our heads in disbelief.I'm not a student of film, so maybe there's some nuances of cinematography or screenplay or something that I'm missing, but I don't think so. I'm standing up to say that the Emperor has no clothes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered","review":"Any claim that this is the correct aspect ratio is idiotic. From the very beginning, it is obvious that the black bars are covering up the upper portion of the spinning Universal globe. That is valid proof right there.And anyone with half an eye for photography can instantly see that actors' heads are cut off, lots of interesting eye candy is gone, and the entire presentation feels claustrophobic. Orson Welles would've PUKED if he'd seen what they did to his film.BEWARE...a LOT of folks are butchering films this way, and the result is always the same: heads chopped off, close-ups with the eyes or lower part of the mouth covered up, etc.Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the blu ray?","review":"Any word on how much longer the UK Region B will be the only blu ray version of this film? Truly disappointed that this is one of the classics that didn't receive a full treatment restoration like To Kill A Mockingbird, and is instead still limited to dvd in the states."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Fake Widescreen","review":"Well, once again, Welles' artistic vision has been compromised. Apparently a common practice (SO BEWARE), the makers of this DVD have added fake-widescreen...adding black bars across the top and bottom, thus giving the impression of a wider aspect ratio, when in fact the film was never intended to be \\"widescreen.\\" In other words, you are being robbed of the upper and lower portions of the picture. Would Orson have approved? NO! Neither should we!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent direction","review":"It is not the story, but the direction by Welles that make Touch of Evil a great film. The use of lighting in particular is excellent. Welles creates in the corrupt cop Quinlan one of the best screen villains of all time. Must see for noir fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touch of Evil, One of Welles' Many Hidden Masterpieces","review":"This is one of the greatest things that I have seen happen in a long time. Almost all of Welles movies (Citizen Kane being about the only one) had been cut down by studio heads. Magnificent Ambersons being the greatest example as it was cut down by 40 minutes and an entirely new ending was filmed. The footage was then burned. Fortunately all of the footage that was cut out of Touch of Evil was kept. And finally a few good men have decide to peace together the one of the greatest film noir pieces. The greatest part of the restoration comes at the beginning with the restored car scene. There are no credits and none of that annoying music. It is what Welles wanted it to be a true walk down the street. I believe also a documentary comes with it which is also very interesting. If you loved Kane there is no way to shun this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"they buggered a classic film","review":"For some reason, the jerks who made this DVD decided to change the movie, editing and deleting scenes, deleting/changing music, all according to some notes of Orson Welles'. Well, one of the greatest films now conforms to Orson Welles' alleged desires.This film was great for the past forty-something years because it was great, not because Orson Welles made it, and to change it now in the way they have does it a great disservice. I can't sit through it now.Now the Touch of Evil I love only exists on video tape, and that's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bar? None!","review":"Universal restored this movie well. However, the studio stupidly released it in widescreen format on DVD. Welles' full-screen ONLY flick now has black bars lopping off maybe the top and bottom fourths of the picture, ruining his original composition and eliminating important details (such as the shoebox Quinlan's partner carries when leaving the Mexican youth's house). If you want to see the flick in its original format, buy the videotape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark film that's showing its age","review":"\\"Touch of Evil\\" is one of those movies that you always hear about in film classes, but may have never actually seen. This crisp, re-edited version gives you a good idea of why it is considered a classic; some say it's Welles' best movie. The movie holds your attention, but fails to create edge-of-your-seat tension most of the time, as it moves slowly by today's standards and the plot seems contrived.Part of the fun watching it today is seeing various actors in their younger days. Charlton Heston does a fine job as Vargas, squaring off with an elephantine Orson Welles in a world of deep shadows and hidden motives. Janet Leigh is lovely as Vargas' American wife. And try to spot Dennis Weaver in a role where he hides in plain sight!Definitely worth watching. If you're a real movie buff, you might even watch it more than once, to catch all the nuances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Across the Border","review":"Touch of Evil is a film set at the border between the United States and Mexico, the site of an explosion that took two lives. There are cops from both countries investigating including a Mexican newlywed (Charlton Heston) and a crooked American veteran (Orson Welles). This is no romantic easy case, though; it is twisted in lies and deciet.The film has a nice cast including the aforementioned Heston and Welles along with Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich.The camera angles used here are highly unusual and artistic, a typical element of Welles films. In fact, this is perhaps what keeps the film exciting despite its somewhat confusing plot. Thankfully, the camera never becomes distracting or showy for the sake of being showy. It enhances the film greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Celebration of Gay Friendships","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought it was cute. As I read through it, I found it to be a sometimes comical, sometimes bitter, always genuine reflection on the unique relationships that develop among gay friends. I have since purchased and shared copies with many friends. It is a great gift item, and something I will cherish and chuckle at throughout my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Uplifting!","review":"Every song on here is uplifting and awesome!

It has a flowery smell to it. It is like walking through flowers on a summer shining day. It is a more mature flower-like scent. I would recommend it to women around 20 that want a clean and flowery smell. The scent is not strong, which means others can breathe. It is more of a light scent than a strong scent. The scent can last up to about 3 hours depending on where it is worn and your activies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tea!!","review":"This tea is incredible!!

It is almost a shame that some of them are no longer in the same shape as when this book was originally published. I think that the research used by the author to be very accurate and makes for very entertaining reading. When I wish I was out exploring but can't go I pull this book off the shelf and it is as if I am there. The pictures leave a little to be desired but that adds to the mystery of the ghost town being described. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a thorough guide to western ghost towns. Well worth the cost of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's entertaining, informative and well researched.","review":"This book is the most extensive ghost town book I have ever seen or read. I believe the content is well detailed and documented. Though true of many ghost town books, I wonder if Florin's photos illustrate current conditions. Florin does not appear to leave any stone unturned in order to find historical details to compose each town's history in an interesting and many times comicial combination of text and pictures.To the book's detriment, the pictures are horrendous. Many are too contrasty, poorly exposed, and lack detail. I would have rated this book 10 if the photographs complemented the extensive research and text. If you are interested in ghost towns, it would appear that this publication could be a benchmark by which others are judged (exclusive of Florin's apparent lack of photographic expertise)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The transitional music mostly hints at jazz","review":"Shortly after the IAJRC label came out with a CD reissuing all of the music recorded by James Reese Europe's unusual band during their four 1919 sessions, Memphis Archives put out a CD with the exact same material. The difference between the sets is that while IAJRC put out the material in strict chronological order, Memphis Archives instead chose to simulate a Europe concert. The liner notes of course differ greatly on these two competing sets, and the edge is given to Memphis Archives for Tim Gracyk's very extensive essay. The transitional music mostly hints at jazz but does not contain much improvisation. Europe's brand of dance music occupied its own category, including some Noble Sissle vocals, marching music, rags, waltzes, novelties and future jazz standards, and either of his sets (recorded just a short time before his murder) are recommended. Now if only Europe's eight groundbreaking titles of 1913-1914 would be reissued"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great home school science","review":"I use this with my kindergarten and 3rd grader. We really like it. It really makes them think and is totally hands on. Activity one, we looked at a picture in the book. Then we made a list about what we saw in the picture like what the person was wearing, she's happy, she's pretty, etc. Then we classified our statements into three categories: observations, inferences, and opinions. Once prompted, my 5 year old caught on. This really makes them use their brains!
