The only difference from the picture is that the orange cap on the muzzle doesn't cover the entire length of the muzzle, but only the barrel opening (this didn't bother me, I just thought I'd point it out).While I haven't tried it on camera yet I'm sure it'll look fine.

Bloom dominates, so if you already have Love and Friendship and a copy of Symposium you might feel gyped because the only new thing is Benardete's small article.

You get 10 classic songs, digitally remastered by MCA and Verve.This highly recommended for any Larry Carlton or smooth jazz fan.ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product does not work on most computers","review":"Dont buy this.

It worked for one DVD, then the next one it would stick on \\"loading\\". On the third DVD I tried, it got me to the main menu screen, but then it didn't let me choose anything to watch and then recycled and gave me the blue \\"loading\\" screen again. I tried a fourth DVD, it worked just fine. All of the DVDs I tried were brand new (or watched once) without scratches or defects.If you asked me, the defect is in the product.

The video that it outputs is too dark. I was puzzled so I tested it on a professional video monitor. Instead of outputting a video signal with the \\"black level setup\\" value at 7.5 IRE (the standard for American NTSC televisions), the Mintek is outputting a signal at 0 IRE (the NTSC-Japan and PAL standard). This is not changeable. What a pain. If you were ever thinking of hooking this up to an American television, think again. Yes, I know that some DVD players pretend it's a picture-enhancing feature to allow 0/7.5 IRE switching (some manufacturers call it \\"black level expansion\\"), but really that switching is just to allow better compatibility with different TV systems. This model flunks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Piece of Junk","review":"Got one for my birthday. Broken right out of the box. Returned it to my friend. Took six weeks for a replacement.

Learn what you are doing first, get a strop and a styptic pencil, because you will need them. A hone(I own knifes so I have several) is good to have also, but this blade unlike others comes very sharp and is hollow ground. A good straight razor shave can last you two days before you feel stubble, if done right. I have had professional barbers look at this and awe at it. It works great, but be careful and watch out for the jugular, one slip there and times up. Highly Recommended.The Time Keeper"},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL.

If you have facial hair that's even slightly course ( like most men's are ) this is not going to cut it. After the first few painful strokes that felt as if it was pulling the hair out instead of shaving it off I decided to strop it. 150 strop strokes later ( properly done with the edge trailing I might add ) it improved a bit but still wouldn't take the hair off properly. Pulled out my old trusty Mach 3 and finished shaving. Came honed from the factory but I guess I will try honing it myself and stropping. If I don't get anywhere with it after that to the garbage it goes and a well known more expensive blade will be purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the application?","review":"The steel band clamp should only be used in one type of application. That being where you are putting two SMOOTH surfaces together, like a garden hose or radiator hose. But with a DC application of a ribbed hose, DO NOT use the steel band clamp, use the wire clamp.The steel band clamp will only strip and never be fully seated trying to secure the wire rib. The steel banding is not designed to do that task. Whereas, the wire clamp will actually strattle the rib on both sides and create a perfect clamping fit.I tried to save the twenty cents over the wire clamp, and wound up stripping the clamp thread on about 50% of the applications with the steel band clamps.

It provides enough light for me to not need to turn on the room lights unless I'm trying to use the mirror (wouldn't advise anyone to try to shave or apply makeup in its light, for example), which is a huge energy save. Not to mention effort and hygiene save, since no one ever has to touch the light switch when just using the restroom. And all that for only drawing 7 watts, and only when it is dark out and someone enters the room. Perfect for its purpose, which in my case was lighting the hall bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOES THE JOB","review":"This movement activated light works every time.

Was looking for a light that would light up enough for him to see, come on automatically, not be too bright, and turn off during the day. This light is all those things.If there were half star ratings I would probably give it 4.5 stars with little dings for the following: 1) occupies a plug. Would have liked an outlet on the light (but not a huge deal). 2) The motion sensor might be a little over-sensitive as it comes on really easily even when I'm pretty far away.

I hand dry and sharpen all my knives personally. Never leaving them in the sink. I purchased this set because it seemed like a reasonable price and fit the bill as far as everyday needs in the kitchen. Otherwise, the blades are sharp and could look good if the paint didn't chip.Update on the knives: After 2 1/2 months I broke one cutting some Gouda cheese. The paint continues to peel off the rest of the knives. All said and done this is a poor product. If I could change the star rating I would change it to zero. I just trashed the set.

This short novel however, did not share the depth and intrigue that I found in his other efforts. The boy meets girl; boy gets girl plot was shallow and the storyline had an ending that was predictable after the first three chapters. Needless to say, I was disappointed in this most recent effort. It was almost like the author was behind in a deadline to get a book out and this was it. I can say however, that I do have a better understanding of the origins of the Protestant/Catholic conflict in Northern Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I could not believe Jack Higgins actually wrote this insipid book. I kept looking at the cover to verify the author. I am glad to find out this was first written in 1963 therefore should not be an indication of author's current abilities. The plot was shallow. Boy meets girl..everything works out rosy. Seemed more like a cheesy romance novel. I have read numerous Jack Higgins works and loved them all.......until this one. Take my advice and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a 15 year old","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, as the story seemed stolen from a Disney movie (\\"Zorro\\" or \\"Scarecrow\\"). It was rushed at best and made no attempt to explore the history of the English occupation of Ireland. Nor did it deal at all with the Finnians in North America (their attempt to invade and capture Canada, and negotiate with England for its exchange for Ireland). I only noted one interesting fact, and that was that an acre of land planted with potatoes can feed many more people than if planted with wheat. If a potential reader is a fan of Sean Dillon, he/she may better spend their time elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Confederate soldier in Ireland","review":"Take another stereotypical Confederate gentleman soldier, honorable to the point of ridiculousness, his black valet who is treated with respect and affection and you have just one more bit of unbelievable historical adventure. Higgins takes this hoary old convention and moves it to Ireland where our hero finds himself taking the side of the Irish versus their English oppressors. From the predictable culture clashes to the even more hilarious \\"masked rider\\" bit, (Zorro, anyone, or perhaps Dr. Syn, The Scarecrow) this book moves briskly from one cliché to another. Higgins has written some fine thrillers, but this is almost their exact opposite."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun read","review":"Its a fun story that I recommend for light weekend reading.

The story is very quick. Higgins introduces the main character very quickly. They are easy to identify with.This is the classic story of good v evil. Might v Right. The lowly Irish peasants against the aristocratic English gentry. Into all of this is thrown a Confederate cavalry officer with American ideals about freedom and liberty. He must choose sides.A good book if you are in a hurry. Not a lot of depth to the story or the characters.

On icy roads or trails, on extremely compressed snow, on ice with a layer of snow on top, on cross country skiing tracks, even on melting ice: the grip is just crazy. I have tried the tyres on the side of an ice rink and even there the grip still feels like on a gravel road.If you are riding these on really icy roads the experience can be quite disconcerting: there you are, speeding away, leaning into curves and braking at will while everybody around you (including cars) just loses it. You forget the ice to an extent that dismounting your bike can be dangerous because your feet slip the moment you set them down.There are drawbacks of course: these tyres are heavy (about 900g each); on asphalt with no snow or ice they roll really rough; and they last only for about one winter season if you cycle a lot.Still, if you want to cycle in snowy or icy conditions then nothing holds a candle to these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mineral-oil free product","review":"I looked high and low to find a wood oil that actually has no mineral oil in it.

What struck me this time was how 'up to date' Darwin is. Considering how long ago it was written it seems very clear, profound and leaves one with a believe in natural selection without feeling that there still is a Creator of some kind.I think that Descent of Man should be read by ALL people to get a better understanding of why religious wars are so unnecessary.10 stars for this history making book - one that changed the world, not just by bringing science to our world, but by shaking the shackles of bad church leaders who want to keep the masses in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed the course of history!","review":"Darwin's, \\"The Descent of Man\\" and \\"The Origin of Species\\" introduced to man the power of observations and gave the world the conclusions of this remarkable man. In the greatest \\"a ha\\" moment in the history of man, Charles Darwin gave us biological science and quite, literally, changed the way we understand the evolution of life on earth. He overcame the fear of rejection from the Church, and he knew his seminal work would cause by challenging all prevailing creationist theology. By doing so he freed man to think freely, and the world has not been the same since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Suspense","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was my first Elizabeth Adler book. It was maybe a little more romance than I normally like in my suspense books. But I did still enjoy the book.It takes place in Boston. Harry Jordan is a cop from a wealthy background with an adorable dog named Squeeze. He is on the case of a serial killer. The killer is attacking young women and raping and murdering them. But one of his victims does not die at the scene. They get a partial description of the killer from the victim and the the witnesses who scared him off. Harry takes this drawing to Mallory Malone. She is the host of a show similar to America's Most Wanted. He needs her help to catch the killer. But she acts strange when she sees the drawing. Something from her past maybe? Sparks appear between Harry and Mallory. And the 2 of them must join forces to catch the killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carol's Review","review":"This is a great book with a great balancing act between a love story and a thriller. It's very readable and the main characters are loveable. The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the graphic descriptions of the murders were too horrific for my sensibilities. I believe the book would have been just as readable without some of the gruesome details of the murders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mix of crime and romance","review":"This is part crime story and part romance.

Since I am from Vermont, and the hermit thrush is the Vermont state bird, I was more than intrigued by this piece: \\"A Hermit Thrush at Morn.\\" I was amazed to find how modern this piece sounded, at least for the day in which it was written. Parts of it were based on the Wagnerian style so common in late nineteenth century music, but there was a feel about this, as though the bird whose song she had copied had unwittingly dragged her into the modern era. While I would not avoid listening to Beach's more substantial works on this CD, such as the stodgy \\"Prelude and Fugue, op. 81,\\" I find Beach is more interesting in her shorter pieces which are full of fun and good humor. You should also check out the last CD in this set, FIRE-FLIES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I would have thought that \\"Natural Bodybuilding\\" means bodybuilding without chemicals, including exotic supplements.

Another contributor describes Cort-Bloc; yet another talks about taking effervescent creatine, insulin mimickers, androgen precursors, HMB, etc. This is \\"Natural\\"???Too much of the bodybuilding industry rides on profits made from pitching exotic substances whose long-term effects on human beings is unknown.

That being where you are putting two SMOOTH surfaces together, like a garden hose or radiator hose. But with a DC application of a ribbed hose, the steel band clamp is NOT the preferred choice, use the wire clamp.The steel band clamp will only strip and never be fully seated trying to compress and secure the wire rib to the smooth DC fitting. The steel banding and worm screw is not designed to do that task and provide the needed pressure to fully seat the ribbed hose. Whereas, the wire clamp will actually strattle the rib on both sides and create a perfect clamping fit.I tried to save the ten cents over the wire clamp, and wound up stripping the clamp thread on about 75% of the 3\\" hose applications with the steel band clamps. I antied up and spent the extra cash and got the right product, the wire clamps for the ribbed DC hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desire of Ages","review":"The very best account of the life of Christ that I have ever read, aside from the Bible.

I could've used a little less tape hiss, but doing so would've taken out the dynamics of her voice. No...you're not going to mistake it as a 2002 recording with its stridency in spots, but trust me, any fan of this seminal album will be absolutely blown away by this painstaking mix. \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Tapestry\\" are reason enough to either 1) Sell the original Stereo SACD release asap or 2) Get a Multi SACD player outright.

Perhaps it was the year their father and I were divorced. This album is filled with so many \\"events\\" and emotions that were part of my life for years. \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" makes you move and bounce for joy and could brighten up a sad mood, while \\"So Far Away\\" seemed to relate to the fact that while married to a Navy man, we were often parted and it would make me sad. Carole's singing her song \\"Natural Woman\\" was different from the wrenching Aretha version, but definitely made you KNOW you were a strong powerful sexy woman when you sang along. It also gave the kids something to laugh at as they watched you singing and grimacing.

All classic songs! This edition of Tapestry also includes two unreleased songs \\"Out In The Cold\\" and \\"Smackwater Jack\\" (a live version). The entire cd is remastered and sounds great. Carole King was one cool and talented lady (she also wrote songs for The Monkees among others). If you like Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon, Linda Ronstadt then you'll love Carol King's classic \\"Tapestry\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"King has such an expressive, raw sound which is easy to listen to, yet which is actually somewhat cerebral. She is an especially thoughtful songwriter -- \\"Tapestry\\" is an incredibly thoughtful and insightful track.

But I can certainly live with that. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE","review":"First of all,let me just say I am only sixteen-years-old,but I know a masterpiece when I hear one and tapestry IS one. I know,I should be off listening to Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera(who happen to be two of my favorite artists/groups)but I love all music. This has to be the best album of the seventies. Tapestry is amazing. It's no wonder that it spent 15 weeks at number 1 and stayed on the charts for a fantastic 6 years! Carole King's voice is unmistakable and powerful. Her jamming piano completely makes the song \\"I Feel the Earth Move.\\" Then there are such gems as \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"It's Too Late\\" which also make the album outstanding. All music lovers have to have Tapestry in their collection. It can appeal to everyone of every age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Classic","review":"This is the greatest album that Carole King ever recorded. Every song was a hit. I'm referring to the 12 songs that are included in the original album. Tapestry, has become the largest selling album by a female recording artist in history. I think it has sold some 20 million copies since it was released 32 years ago in 1971.

She is my favorite female artist.Carole King's music as well as music by Carly Simon,Linda Ronstat,Roberta Flack,The Mama's and Papa's,Chicago and Wings over America bring back memories and is still good music for today.

At first hearing I was disappointed with the thin production, and Carole King singing is not always perfect. However I recommend you to listen to it when the sky outside is gray, when you got the blues, it would sound a whole lot deferent. I guess music is all about feeling and being in a certain mood, suddenly you won't care about the thin production and you'll know that she sings from the heart.

The other is a live version of \\"Smokewater Jack\\",which doesn't really improve much on the studio version.

This one ought to get a Sixth Star.Tapestry in relation to her other albums:I wanted to add this addendum to the review in order to say that \\"Tapestry\\" is only part of a larger trilogy of albums. The other two albums (that belong alongside Tapestry) are her albums \\"Music\\" (which followed Tapestry) and \\"Rhymes & Reasons\\" (which followed Music). If you love \\"Tapestry\\", you will be happily stunned by listening to \\"Tapestry\\", \\"Music\\" and \\"Rhymes & Reasons\\" in succession.

It's interesting from a factual standpoint, as I learned a number of things about Sting that twenty years of fandom had failed to impress upon me. But the way Sanford writes is just so darn annoying that it approaches worthlessness at times. At times he's insightful, and you're pleased at how much sense his views make. Other times, you're amazed at just how hard he's trying to be hip, to be cool and dispassionate.

The third film had some fun excitement. This one is a depressing, boring work of smut that wants badly to be a martial-arts flick, but instead feels more like a late night soap opera. Full of horrid dialogue, bad choreography, and characters you learn to hate, this film pretty much kills what could have been a fun series. If you're watching the \\"Kickboxer\\" films, stop at the third.

Perhaps her transphobia is the problem not socalled gender identity disorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of Confessions of a Gender Defender","review":"This psychologist is yet another person who claims to be a friend of the transsexual community. She pretends to be our advocate but calls us gender dysphoric and considers us diseased. She speaks of her relief that her own child did not show gender confusion.

Few people are aware today but mine warfare, both on land and in the water, saw great advancement, mostly in the hands of the Confederates as mines are primarily a defensive weapon. Charleston saw considerable use of mines to keep Union soldiers at bay and landmines made the assault of some rebel forts almost prohibitively expensive. Offensive mines (spar torpedos) encouraged the development of submarines, torpedo boats and destroyers. Unfortunately for the Confederates they were never able to effectively use this slight technological advantage to defeat the Union."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable shoes","review":"I purchased these shoes to wear in my wedding on the Island of St. Thomas in November 2007.

I was also confused at some points while trying to follow the story line: Mary skipped the family Thanksgiving for a warm weather trip South...but later in the story, she claims to have visited her aging grandmother in upstate New York over that same Thanksgiving?

The adventure was not all that adventurous but I did learn a little about trawlers. I really did not care for the interjections about her personal life, but not because she is gay. I found her, personally, to be whiney and quite full of herself. Maybe it's normal for East-coasters to be rather snobby. She certainly sounds like someone I would rather avoid.

I always handwash it.To those that said the clips snapped off - they are designed to be removable, you can just clip it back on easily.My only problem is when I made a triple layer cake with standing decorations on top it would not close as the cake was too tall!

It is sturdy plastic, with 3 easy side locks that work well and do not seem to be fragile. I recommend cutting out a piece of non-skid waffle-textured shelf-liner to fit the bottom.

There were brief moments of some of what I've come to expect from Ann, but nothing that lives up to anything previously done with Heart or even in duets with other artists. I had \\"Hope\\" for an album of \\"Glory\\"-ious songs, but just never hit the mark for me.

This album is deep, edgy, and beautiful. Why wouldn't Ann sing about the times she is living in, we are all living in a war torn world. Ann sings these songs from her gut. The song choices are songs that she grew up with just like the rest of us. I think that makes them even more relevant today. She takes these songs and reinterprets them for a new generation. Her voice is deep and bluesy on this album, and she can still sing the high notes. Darkness Darkness and War of Man are moody rockers, while other songs of peace like Get Together and Jackson are beautiful and introspective. The guest appearances just add to the flavor of this diverse album, and none of them take away the spotlight from Ann. This is truly her shining hour. Get this album, it is a classic and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing album!","review":"I've owned this CD since it came out in 2007. Ann Wilson is one of those classic rock voices that simply puts chills on you. She stand out even today among the younger generation of female rockers. Her voice is as unique as Stevie Nicks, whom I also love, but the exceptional range in Ann's voice is staggering even after all these years.Initially I was disappointed that it was an album of covers. It's not just an album of covers ... it's Ann speaking out about what was going on in the world in 2007 ... it's Ann pulling rock classics that transcended the decades to remain relevant. My favorite track is not a remake ... Ann wrote one track for the album - a simple song called \\"Little Problems, Little Lies\\" and I still tear up a bit every time I hear it. Her voice as a storyteller in this song is powerful. She makes you feel like you are in the song.Guest spots from sister Nancy Wilson, Elton John, Allison Kraus, Wynonna and others make this an album worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The welcomed return of \\"The Voice\\"","review":"It appears some are complaining about Ann doing an \\"homage\\" album and not a full album of originals. Well, I would personally listen to Miss Wilson sing the phone book just to hear THAT voice, and I'm happy to say that this album of covers is also a wonderful opportunity to hear it once again. These aren't just \\"any\\" covers, but songs that are personal and dear to Miss Wilson, and it shows in every note she sings. She has chosen a great variety of quality and timeless songs, and of course, she adds her special magic to every one of them. Every track is a keeper, including her sole, self-penned original as the album closer. Out of about 15 CDs I've purchased this year, there's only two that I can put in the player and let them play in their entirety while enjoying them immensely. Those two are John Fogertty's \\"Revival\\" and Ann Wilson's \\"Hope and Glory.\\" Great work, John and Ann, and I thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Wilson - Still One of the Best Rock Vocalists Ever","review":"Ann Wilson reinstates herself as rock vocal goddess on Hope & Glory. I give it four stars, really only because it's an album of cover songs. But her unique voice, power and subtlety all combine nicely on these vintage songs from the 70's...One of the gems includes It's a War of Man and this is textbook Ann Wilson combining power with melody to evoke raw emotion, creating a wonderful ominous sea of melancholy angst in her interpretation of this Neil Young poetry. I've also witnessed her live show recently and her voice only seems to get stronger with each passing year/album/decade. Hope & Glory solidifies my claim that Wilson is the best female 'rock' vocalist of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cable!!","review":"I was a tad skeptical about this product when I first saw the price, but the cable came just as advertised.

(And in my opinion, these changes are not the result of what is often called the \\"folk process.\\") Instrumental accompaniment and singing style also too often do not fit the mood of the songs. One example: the version of \\"Barbara Allen\\" would make Barbara and her lover turn over in their grave! To give credit where credit is due, there are some well done songs in this collection.

They flutter, hover, scream and joust with one another in music that is both confrontational and cooperative. At times guitarist Fred Frith sounds like two guitarists, I'd love to have seen his setup. Though in general he takes a more supportive role. Anthony Braxton's woodwinds dominate the proceedings by sheer forcefulness of tone and the dervish-like swirl of his arpeggios. Together these two make some fine and complex music that demands to be listened to, in other words it's not for casual entertainment. I find myself needing to be in the mood and prepared to listen in order to fully appreciate it's conversational and unconventional charms.

If the hole on the grater plate isnot filled with the center pin, then your Grater plate is probably upside down, smoothside up or \\"concave\\" side up. This will not work so flip the blade over.Step 4: Once the grinding plate center pin is in place, Push down slightly on the centerpin spring. This will allow you to hook the arms into place.

Except for Lee Marvin, who, as somebody said, had dynamic and mesmeric impact in every film he ever made --- possibly excepting Paint Your Wagon. As soon as he arrives on the scene the picture starts to come alive. But to sit taking in nothing but an ancient fashion image for the rest of the 76 minutes is asking too much. The characters are completely uninteresting on both sides of the social divide: you might call them dull and duller. Vacuous dialogue vacantly directed. Don't be misled by the kind-hearted comments you read from people leaning over backwards to be generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Brando but....","review":"OK........Brando is pretty good being Brando towards the end of this film..Lee Marvin is good...the bikes are ok..but all those black and white,sound stage,Mayberry RFD,enclosed,interior shots of the outdoors,interior shots of bars,restaurants,that look, at best,sterile,cannot save an actor ,no matter how great he is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"46 years later...","review":"I look at this film today through very different eyes than when I first saw it as a high-schooler in '54.Of course a lot of it seems hokey now, and with good reason: the world is a far less innocent place than it was in those bucolic, Eisenhower, pre-R&R days.But when it first came out, it was Hot Stuff.

It's fun, and does not take itself too seriously. The stock characters and overacting start out great, but when the town descends into chaos and the inevitable vigilantism rises up they won't let me stop. I've seen it ten times, and still enjoy it.The DVD itself is well done, and has stood the test of several viewings. I'm not a big Brando fan, but he does have a presence.

At times she sings with the self-assurance of a country siren; other songs are imbued with a haunting and melodic delicacy. \\"Man of Steel,\\" in particular, grabs the listener at the first line and doesn't let up, the lilting refrain disguising a powerful meditation on the passing of time and memory.The album has an understated elegance to it, and charm to spare. Ms. Billings' voice is rich and deep, full of wisdom and laughter and the arrangements are complex and evocative. A slide guitar fades in an out. A piano track builds and fades into nothing. After hearing \\"All Slip Away\\" for the first time, I found myself returning again and again to the sound of this lament full of hope and loss. The whole album had the same impact on me, its melodies wrapping themselves into my thoughts and coming to me unbidden in quiet moments.

I read the summary of the film and was mildly curious about it. When it came on I couldn't turn it off. It runs like an indy film, not a lot of flash and bang, no car chases or expensive stunts or CGI effects, and no blaring sound track showing off how great the latest Dolby system is. It's the story and the acting that makes this movie. It could stand on its own as a great story, but when they cast Michelle Monaghan in the lead role it changed everything. She makes this movie. It's impossible to stop watching her or not care what happens to her.Everyone else has already summed up the story for you, so I'm just going to tell you, whether you know who Michelle Monaghan is or not makes no difference.

As for his male nudes, Victorian 'morality' may have dictated his choice, as female nudes were considered obscene and disgusting by that society and any woman who posed for a nude study would have been ostracized, whereas male nudes were considered 'classic' because they were based on Greek and Roman archetypes. Other Victorian painters got around the taboo by placing nude women in classical settings.

This book follows Josephine from the early years of Napoleon's era as First Consul of France, through their coronation as Emperor and Empress, their divorce and Jopsephine's final years. It paints a portrait of a fascinating woman. The reader finishes the book with an understanding of how little control even the most powerful people have over their own lives.

The band leader, Bobby Sadzak throws in drum programming, movie samples i.e. PLANET of the APES, female background vocals and techno sound programming to create something new and unique with cookie monster growls.I find this effort refreshing but most likely, purist death metallers are dismissing this album because of it's deviation of their definition of what death metal is supposed to sound like. Is this the reason why Bobby only put out two albums? Whatever happened to him?His contribution to the DWELL RECORDS CELTIC FROST tribute performing MORBID TALES was one of the best tracks on the disc (along with OPETH's CIRCLE OF THE TYRANTS) but the drum programming becomes annoying after awhile.For open-minded fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko watches","review":"Watch arrived promptly, well packaged, and safe.

I picked up the HD-DVD for cheap a while back and only just got around to watching it today. I assumed since I had it on HD-DVD that I could sell my DVD version on eBay, so I did. Now I'm stuck with this crappy version of the movie. I have to say the Director's Cut absolutely ruins the movie. It's shorter and it ruins the end of the movie. It is not the same movie and in no way can I recommend buying the Director's Cut. Buy it on DVD or wait for them to re-release it on Bluray either in a dual format (theatrical+director's) or just the theatrical version. Most times the Director's Cut is a decent improvement, or at least it doesn't do enough to really change the movie at all. This is not one of those times. Do NOT buy the director's cut in any format if you want to see the good movie that made it past the cutting room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"unexpected","review":"Anyone looking for the theatrical version needs to look elsewhere.

When I first saw this in theaters, I was so disappointed because, as stated here, the studio wanted a LETHAL WEAPON type film, not a \\"Parker\\" film. Well, thankfully that was been totally rectified. Now, we have the dark, tough as nails story, based on Stark's THE HUNTER, the first of the PARKER series with Gibson as \\"Porter\\". Why he wasn't just\\"Parker\\"is beyond me, but the effect is the same and right on. It is so true to the vision that it was meant to be.So, if you're looking for the theater version, stop right now.

Do yourself a favor and find the other Blu-ray release which contains BOTH the theatrical and director's cuts. (Don't be afraid of the European release. It's region free and the NTSC/PAL problem doesn't exist on Blu-ray) They are much different cuts.Personally, I prefer the theatrical cut because it has more of a sense of humor and a cleverness about it. In comparison, the director's cut is not darker but is instead dulled and dour. The ending is anti-climactic without being any edgier than the theatrical version. I also prefer the opening, the look and the score of the theatrical version.**The one bit I did enjoy from director's cut was a quick bit at 1:18:20-- which wouldn't fit into the theatrical version because at that point the plotline has diverged from the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the theatrical release instead","review":"Warning: Spoiler alert. I was not impressed with the rework of this movie. And the fact that it doesn't include the original theatrical release made me even less impressed. They lose the voiceover in this version and simplify the plot. Kris Kristofferson's character is completely eliminated and the kidnapping of his son is gone as a result. The end of the movie is simple: Meet the bad guys and kill them for the money. Any of the cleverness of Mel Gibson's character is gone and all that's left is his brutality.

At least I did.","review":"I saw the original theatrical release at the theater and liked it so much, I bought another ticket. There was a dark comedic thing going on, but the bad guy wasn't a dirtbag. There was a degree of chivalry and honor. In this version, I hate the bad guy. He is just a thug who beats the crap out of his wife. Ok, she deserved it to a point, but the original Porter loved her despite her drug addiction and forgave her for the most part. The music in this new version SUCKS! The original was lively and enthralling. In this version the music is an afterthought and gets in the way. This new version is a completely different movie, a sucky one.

The \\"third act\\" is completely different. The dog doesn't live. Those were all things I loved about the theatrical version. The original ending is very weak. I feel sorry that Helgeland's art originally got hijacked so execs could make more money off of it, but at the same time, I'm happy that it was made into a better movie for it. !!SPOILER !! SPOILER !! Helgeland's third act makes no sense at all anyway. Why would you send ten or so people to kill Porter where he asks for the money to be sent if you were going to give him the money?

All I can say about the director's cut is that Brian Helgeland couldn't have screwed it up more if he intentionally tried (and I'm not so sure that he didn't).The first two thirds of the movie are more or less the same and the character development is adequate. But he totally destroyed what was a clever and entertaining ending and replaced it with short-cut tripe. For anyone who has not seen this movie yet, I strongly recommend the original theatrical version. It occurs to me that this version may be nothing more than an attempt to make more money from the same film, but they could have done that anyway by relasing the original on Blu-ray.

A good bit of the beginning of the movie is the same with a few added scenes. However, the further into the movie you get, the less it resembles the theatrical release, and it ends much, much differently.I'm far from disappointed, just very surprised because I didn't know any of the backstory behind the production of this movie.

A totally different movie. Missing is the great voiceover by Mel, the dark humour of the original script replaced and from about the halfway point on a completely different plot. It ends up being what goes in Hollywood today for an action movie, that is, blood-letting and killing with a terrible script, lousy dialogue and cardboard characters. The original taut little gem of a movie ends up being a bloated mess. If I could give it zero stars I would. Do yourself a favor and stick with the original production."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I have the orginal Payback DVD and now just saw the Director's Cut version.

This cut of the film is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the theatrical release... even going so far as to change the gender of the head of the syndicate. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT in some pivotal places. Starts soft. Ends soft. NO NARRATION. Weird. Did this filmmaker get brainwashed by Syd Field after releasing the first cut?I'm not against change. Peter Jackson scored BIG with the new cuts of all of his films. But this just seems to have been done from boredom.BAD FILM in it's Blu-Ray form.See the SD version.

I personally enjoyed this film. It isn't a masterpiece, but I really liked Mel Gibson's character in this movie. He isn't a nice guy by any stretch of the imagination, but his raw determination to get his money back(Which really isn't his-he stole it before it was taken from him)makes you do just what the movie preview says, you \\"root for the bad guy.\\" His is also a somewhat realistic character. He is smart and has a variety of skills to suit his occupation, but at times, it is just dumb luck that saves him. I would recommend this film to anyone that likes action movies and is not squeamish about violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"True adventure on screen.","review":"Not often do you see a film where the good guy wins by doing much the same thing as the bad guys.

Mel Gibson is a superlative tough guy character actor without a capable film industry. With an extra 20lb and aged ten years he would have made a great DeNero alternative in 'Heat' and 'Ronin'. The movie captures the feeling of the NYC urban decay of the seventies, through music, script and prop, but continuity robs the film of it's credibility (catch the Chrysler Neon cruising by). A good action film, a story well told by hard men, bigtown hustle made art, the pathos of life in the 'business', a fight to maintain some kind of personal principle in a sewer of deceit. There are many stories in this film. Worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzz","review":"well whats up with the blue light through the whole movie? ok, i thought mel was supposed to be the \\"bad guy\\", he seems more of a anti-hero than bad guy. this movie is really boring, i was expecting mel to be a evil mo fo going around getting even, well thats what it is but mel is just not evil and kills only if shot at, what a wuss. and he has a stupid girlfriend i don't care about, some bad guy. the movie is slow and boring considering mel is not the \\"bad guy\\" he was advertised to be and when it finally picks up and gets violent it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the real version","review":"For those who enjoy the movie Payback in its original form, this movie is a huge disappointment. Gone are the wisecrack remarks from Mel Gibson and jokes from Lucy Lu. The original movie did a good job of portraying porter as the good guy. This movie shows his dark side. For those who enjoyed Gibson's movies in the genre including Conspiracy Theory, you will wonder why they ever made this directors cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hubba Hubba Hubba !","review":"What!!

The director watered down the movie's character and stripped away some of the artistic stylization by making that cuts that he did. This is an inferior piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Produced","review":"'Payback' can't decide if it's black comedy, edgy action/thriller, or pulp fiction. In typical Hollywood fashion, this was a project pulled in too many different directions by producers, et al.

This is a movie to watch for the performance.The plot seems like it ought to ruin the movie, but it's simple enough to be fun and acceptable. Some great supporting work from Lucy Liu and Kris Kristopherson as well.This is a film that will hold an important place in my collection--I'll go to Payback when I want to watch a \\"movie\\".

It is violent, has no good guys and has little social redeaming value. I loved it. It is a great guy movie.However the same title was re-released on DVD as a Directors Cut in 2006. The Directors Cut is very disappointing and not half as entertaining as the Theatrical Release.

To be fair I personally like more main stream movies, and I would say that anyone that enjoyed the original version of the film as much as I did probably won't like the changes made in this.While this is my personal opinion I would at least treat it as a warning to the \\"average\\" movie watcher that you're probably better off with the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"My husband and I were both completely disappointed by this product. To begin with, we did not enjoy the director's cut version. I understand this is what the director had in mind, but I found this version to be a flat story without any climax - it wound around but didn't have the finishing touches of the theatrical version. I know not every movie is meant to entertain, but I just liked the theatrical version better. That being said, I would have preferred if the disc had both versions, so you could watch the one you liked better, or at least compare the two. Many films do this, but it is frustrating that some do not. Now the director's cut is the only one you can find. Whenever a movie is released as a director's cut, I think it should have the original as well. That it didn't was a serious lack, especially because we felt cheated by the new version.

You are not suppose to like the charcters they are all evil its time to route for the bad guy.

It had a great balance of both. Usually when you see directors cut its a few changes the ordinary viewer wouldn't notice or the movie could have done without. Either way it still stays true to the main movie you remember. But this movie sucked big time! I see why they cut this out and went with the one in theaters. It is almost a totally different movie. The end was AWFUL. To make matters worse, They changed the mian bad guy in the movie into a women it wasn't a good idea. You see her and your like WTF.

To only have this version available on Blu ray and not even include the theatrical relase as an extra is really unacceptable. The people who put out this product ought to be ashamed of themselves.

Plus the ending of the original was very clever vs the this version. Ending more moralistic SPOILER ie porter is almost killed.In commentary, director states that porter would not have kidnapped the kid. but i honestly wouldnt have cared if porter did. It\`s not like he killed the kid in the end ie just bait to get dad.so if you can get original version or you have seen it, then dont get this one. but if you have not seen it & like anti-heroes, then it\`s not a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Payback-The Director's Cut","review":"I purchased the movie Payback (The Director's Cut) for my husband.

Mel Gibson is in full mean mode here. It's a role that comes close to several of his other characters but never goes completely into Riggs mode. Even though he is made to be the bad guy right from the start it's still a little shocking and out of place when he kills a bad guy helplessly layng on the floor, although after everything this guy does to him seems to justify it.The supporting cast are all good although most aren't around long enough to appreciate. Lucy Lui is over the top creepy as a twisted dominatrix and James Coburn delivers some pretty funny lines.Unlike a lot of movies in this style I thought the ending lived up to the rest of the movie and wasn't just a sell out gun fight or quickie wrap up. It was clever and very suspenseful.Payback was a funny, mean-spirited (in a fun way) movie that I've enjoyed watching over, which is something I don't do alot any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please step forward 32 Years","review":"An excellent remake of the 1967 film 'Point Blank' staring Lee Marvin as Walker.

That's a looooot of Christopher Durang.There's also numerous errors in the index of the book that make finding the monologue you want very difficult.

There was so much potential, but not much came of it. No one in the book is likeable: Rory is whipped and dumb, Bruno is a total jerk, Meg is a pain, and Austin is confused and stays that way. The only characters I liked are Meg and Austin's two young boys, who we don't see enough. This book couldn't have ended fast enough for me.

If it didn't work properly, it could cause a lot of hassle (air gaps / hoses coming off). The two wires fit easily over the end of the hose and seated snuggly on each side of the hose groove and then clamped up nice with just a phillips screwdriver. The wires strattle the ribbing on the hose, creating a nice tight fit. I put in 24 of these wire clamps without one problem, air leak or lose hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands Down - The Best Clamp","review":"I read other reviews before purchasing this clamp and am really glad I did. What I like is that the wires make great contact between the ribs of the hose and screw down very tight.

I got it with the Epson 580! The scanner and copy abilities are an added bonus. (I would give this printer 5 stars, but copy quality is a bit fuzzy.) However, my photos are fabulous! No lines, sharp and clear. Also, it was up and running within 15 minutes of being out of the box. (I am a computer illiterate, hence my love of Mac.) I am a little worried about replacing ink cartridges, as I've heard they don't last long, but all in all I highly recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst printer ever","review":"I bought this printer two and a half years ago and I absolutely hate it. I hate it so much that I will never buy another epson product for as long as i live. I swear it eats ink, you can put a full cartridge in it, not use it once and in two weeks it will be at the 50% level. I have put in brand new cartridges at a cost of almost 70$ and only printed about 10 things before they are empty. In addition to that Once even one of them is empty, it is useless you cant print even in black and white or use the sd, or flash card slots.Next time this thing runs out of ink I am buying a new Kodak printer in lieu of new ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epson Stylus Photo 580 Do not Buy","review":"This printer is nothing but trouble since day one.

Love the photo quality when using glossy photo paper. One of the things I love best about this printer is that I can go for months (literally!) without printing a photo -- maybe only doing a few black/white document prints -- and when I finally print a photo, the ink hasn't dried out and it prints as though I just put in brand new cartridges. I've had several photo printers in the past, and this is the first one that doesn't get gummed up or dried out if left without being used for longer periods of time.The printer is easy to use. Making copies is a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use the printer if any of the 6 ink cartridges are out of ink.","review":"This is my fourth Epson printer and probably my last. The Epson RX580 needs several ink cartridges. If ANY of them is out of ink, you can't print at all. If you're out of yellow ink, you still cannot print a purely black/white document!! The system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out.I really resent that Epson is taking advantage of customers like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great output but teeny weeny expensive ink cartridges","review":"Just bought it today. The print quality is excellent. However, I had to go back to the store for more ink later in the day (about $90 for a full set) after printing only a couple hundred pages of medical lecture notes for school. Ouch!!!I'll bet cleaning the heads costs about $5. This will probably be my last Epson because of the high cost of ink.

Photo print quality is magnificent: Colors are true-to-life,vibrant, and the resolution and detail are outstanding.I printed a series of scenes from a recent trip to Colorado, and the photo quality is so good it's like being there.Old, muddy looking photos take on new life after I've scanned and restored them.

Some do and some don't.That way Epson will get the message on this series and change something. $3 to $4 ink for a 8.5 x 11 plus paper price plus your time isn't worth it no matter that the print is great.

Certainly the reviews have been good. My beef - and thus the one star - is with the software installation process. Now, I am a Mac guy, have been since 1988 and I have never had to call tech support for help, for anything. Certainly not to get a printer up and running. I currently have an iMac running the latest OS and the printer I replaced was a Epson. Didn't have to call tech support to get it going. But I sure did for the RX 580. Now the good news is that the tech support person was superb. I was connected to him very quickly and he knew exactly what to do.

I owned an HP Deskjet before that and what people say about HP ink fading after a couple of years is true.I am very satisfied with the print quality. The software is a little clunky, especially the CD printing function... looks like Windows 95 to me. What really, brought my rating of this printer down is the fact it literally drinks more ink that any other printer I've owned. I print mostly black and white, but the other colors run out very fast too. They are very expensive to replace and I don't feel the printer cartridges last nearly as long as advertised.The ink replacement frequency, coupled with high ink costs, make me regret this purchase. I am looking for new printer soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Epson Printer I have ever owned....money down the drain","review":"I had Epson back when they were the only printer still supporting the Mac....and most of them have been pretty good....but this one guzzles ink like crazy.

Is this worth almost double the price of a black hose?That can only be answered by the user. I'm using the clear hose only off of machinery where large chips are make, my lathe and bore machine (drill press). Other than that, I opted for the cheaper black hose.

It is a clouded pseudo-history littered with deluded conclusions resulting from her own fears as a female improviser. The talented people I had the pleasure of working with of all colors and genders did not play out of this place of fear that is evident throughout the book, but a place of love for each other and what they do. But I must say kudos to her for even putting a pen to paper about a most neglected subject and I wish that some of the brilliant teachers mentioned in the book would write their own truth about their theatre histories and theories to share with budding improv students throughout the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sadly wasted opportunity","review":"Dr. Seham has the makings of a potentially valuable book here -- she comprehensively details the histories and inner workings of almost all the major improvisation/sketch comedy companies (as of publication date), including The Second City, ImprovOlympic and others.

It perpetuates the myth that the Chicago scene somehow stifles women. Which is, if you ask most WOMEN in the Chicago scene, clearly a bass-ackward accounting. In fact, most groups around town are actively LOOKING for women to join; it's not a \\"all-white boys club\\" because of any exclusionary policies.Also, somehow lost in her diatribe is the mere fact that half the teachers and coaches, as well as the owner/operator of IO, are women.Sad, sad, sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!

Living Things is nothing short of exceptional. Like all of his releases, it boasts killer melodies & very strong vocal arrangements (plus top notch musicianship courtesy of Velvet Crush, etc).Just like Badfinger, Matthew Sweet is responsible for some of the finest power pop around - & just like Badfinger, he won't be restricted by that genre. I for one am thankful he didn't just keep on remaking Girlfriend or 100% Fun again & again. New songs like The Big Cats Of Shambala & You're Not Sorry display an artist willing to mature (& are stunning to boot).Other highlights include Season Is Over & Tomorrow. After three or four listens, they easily rank with the best of anything he's done. Tomorrow in particular boasts such a gorgeous melody that it could have sprung from the pen of Paul McCartney or Ron Sexsmith.Truly one of the strongest albums of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A career in steep decline","review":"If you like Matthew Sweet then stick to listening to your copies of Girlfriend and 100% Fun. In case you didn't get the hint from In Reverse or The Thorns, Sweet's glory days are behind him. Living Things has no appeal even to a longtime fan of Sweet's work. The late tempo change, feeble anthemic ending, and indulgent, poorly chosen, overly loud steel drums in the first track give you an early indication of just how many things go wrong with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet's best album","review":"I don't understand all the references in other reviews to \\"repeat listenings necessary.\\" This is immediately accessible sugar-coated melodic pop, the kind of thing Sweet (never a more apt surname for an artist) has always done best. Thing is, it was immediately (after one listening!) clear to me that this was his best record. I say that without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"give this one time to soak in","review":"I hated this album the first time. I didn't even make it all the way through, and I'm a huge fan of his. However, it seems to get better each time I play it. I admit there are still two songs I don't like - though, actually, \\"Cats vs Dogs\\" is not one of them. That one is just a variation on the kind of thing Randy Newman or Harry Nilsson used to do. This isn't a rock record, but it's a good record. For some reason, Matthew's later work doesn't jump out at you as quickly as the Girlfriend/Altered Beast era. The quality now sneaks up on you. He's never going to be a commercial force again, but I wanted to say that - if you ever liked him - you're missing out in the long run if you blow this one off. If he puts out a home record like this every year or two, it's good for all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing to say the least","review":"I am a huge Matthew Sweet fan, but this album doesn't make the grade. The music just feels lifeless and there isn't one song on here that caught me with the usual Matthew Sweet \\"hooks\\". I have seen Matthew play several times, I own every stitch of material he has ever released and consider him a \\"pop\\" music genius, but I seriously doubt this one will ever make it to the CD player drawer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under My Skin","review":"QUESTIONS...Does this album break any new ground for him? Not really.Are the songs a little too long and ragged? Yeah, maybe there's a little too much jamming...a little editing might have helped.BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY...Is it packed with the hooks, melodies, harmonies and sentiment that make Matthew Sweet one of the great pop-songwriters of the post-rock era?

It was fine at first but soon there was always water on the deck next to it, I could not see it leaking at first but gradually it worked its way up to a stream. Kohler sent me a free rebuild kit- It went back to the Imperceptible leak mode. A few years later I put another free o-ring kit into it. I thought \\"what a great company, it's out of Warrantee and they still sent me free parts\\" I guess they knew something I didn't. Instead of fixing it again I threw it out, and bought a Grohe.

Smokey Places is a wonderful mix of strong vocals and unique background harmonies that haunt early rock and doo-wop devotees. When you add the obscure Click-Clack, featured on Dick Clark's American Bandstand Greatest Hits 45rpm album, well the blend is fun and refreshing. Who doesn't know the words to What's Your Name? ...and can't help but sing along when you hear that intro. And thank you for including the Cascades' Rhythm Of The Rain often overlooked in early rock mixes. A must for lovers of late 50's to early 60's doo-wop and rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty grater, not sharp?","review":"Nice heavy-duty metal grater. I am generally pleased. I bought on Amazon because I couldn't find a grater locally that had a full-length grid of one size, for quick & fast grating of cheese, primarily.

My order came with the fine cut and in no way could be mistaken for a coarse model. Sent it back and will wait to see if they send this same on back since the photo is correct but the part they sent is not as pictured. Triple the number holes and make them about 4X smaller. Also noted in the description paragraph, they state \\"medium\\" holes. Not sure who's common sense is off but course, medium and fine aren't usually that hard to tell from one another, especially in a cheese grater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"I bought this for my daughter as she wanted a flat grater that she grew up with(my foley grater from the 80's)that had the grating serface running the whole length.

There were some nice elements to this story; the characters were beautifully developed and the setting and situation made for a great read. But in the second half, the warm, feel good Christmas story I was expecting turned into Bible quotes and preaching.

Currently, quite a few 25-26 episode series can be picked up for between $40 and $50, and yet, today, we are being asked to pay nearly double that when much less in terms of quality, packaging, and extras are being offered in compensation. If the fast food service of the anime industry thinks it can charge for gourmet fare, they have not seriously sampled their own service.And why, oh why, did Funi once again alter an opening sequence?

The fence sticks and it's impossible to get straight, and then it moves and the tiles bind. I yanked it off and in the process I broke one end (it's poly something or other and thinly made so it was easy) I went to MK looking for parts and they provide a list of distributors. ..$12.00 for the fence (OK) $14.00 for the shipping (thanks a pant load). What I'm gonna do is bend a piece of steel to go around and catch the groove that runs along the back. It's not worth it to me to buy another saw. You could also draw a line on the tile and cut by eye but that's a nuisance if you have a lot of similar cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good saw for money","review":"Saw performed satisfactorily on straight cuts on flat tile.

I've laid tile, not as a profession, but as a Home Improvement Do-It-Yourselfer\\". So, I won't pretend to be an expert. I'll only state that the difference is obvious. I've used the cheap wet saws, and the diamond blade wet saws. The cutting quality is night and day. If you want a clean, non-chipped cut, go with the diamond blades. I started out on the cheap saws because that was all I could afford, and foremost, because I didn't understand the difference the few extra bucks could make. Those extra bucks make a huge difference if you want a professional looking job. Diamond blades are the only way to go. And I did a lot of tiling with the lessor garbage before I used the diamond blades and understood how much of my time was wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"MK Diamond","review":"Excellent product, excellent service.

So, I think this saw is good for smaller tile job."},{"rating":"2","title":"MK Diamond-good saw for the $","review":"I have performed numerous tile jobs with commercial saws. For the money the MK gets the job done. I have used it on 2 small bathrooms and it has performed well. The only negative comment is the water run-off. You have to fill the resivoir back up after every cut because most of the water runs off the tile and not back into the grooves around the base. This was with 13inch tile. Smaller tiles (8inch) would not have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Plasplugs","review":"I bought this saw after finally burning my Plasplugs 4 year old saw out because I thought I'd save [money].

Save yourself some time and energy buy Plasplugs first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wet tile saw for small jobs","review":"I would recommend this saw for anyone doing small jobs, or even larger jobs if time is not a factor.

I had to make 2 cuts going into a doorway that were 4\\" inch rips, with 3/4\\" inch legs of 3\\" on the left and right sides of the door. This saw performs very well.

The guide is to tight that after a few times adjusting it, it cracked. oh did i mention that you must wear a rain coat when using this saw!do your self a favor, spend some money and get something worth it weight in plastic. like I always say: you get what you pay for. dont be fooled by the MK name"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that it's cracked up to be!","review":"The first thing I noticed after assembling the saw was that the motor was loose causing the saw blade to wobble. I had a deadloine to complete a small project so I didn\\"t have time to return the itme and wait for another...who knows if the next one would have the same problem. The fence is practically useless. It's nearly impossible to adjust the fence to your desired cut and then tighten the fence and not watch it move. I ended up not even using the fence. Very time consuming!! Also, I'm not sure if this is the saw's fault or the cheap tile I used but at the end of every cut the tile would chip rendering one peice useless.

Either buy a more expensive one or rent a heavy duty one from a rental center. This saw is for an amateur and not for professional results. Bottom line is that you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the neck","review":"This could be a good saw if only the company had made the fence a little more durable and user friendly. If not just perfectly aligned the saw binds and chips the end of each cut. The guide could be easier to see also, as it gets filled with crud very quickly. I used it for about an hour on a small job that required many cuts and got so frustrated I put it back in the box for return tomorrow. That is why I deal with amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Used it for a small slate tile job. It seems to cut fine, the instructions stress cutting slow so you don't stress the motor. Not sure if it cuts slower than other saws but didn't seem to be an issue. It's plastic for the most part, including the guide as others have mentioned but as long as you double check measurements it didn't seem to matter. It has a little plastic blade guard which, along with the design of the saw, actually reduces \\"splatter\\" quite a bit--it didn't make as much of a mess as I expected.

That's what this book does. It's a good read if you're seeking to reinforce the comfort found in your beliefs. The author states that the virgin birth story is too weird to have been made up, yet virgin birth stories already existed at the time the biblical one was written (the stories of Apollonius of Tyana, Krishna and Mithras to name a few).

As an example consider his treatment of the book of Joshua. He said the archeological evidence seems not to agree with the book of Joshua about the destruction of Jericho. Then he said that the evidence seems to support the conquest happening about 1250BC. Evidence of destruction of Hazor fits with that time. Then he says new evidence seems to support the destruction of Jericho in 1450BC. He doesn't see or at least doesn't emphasize that this conflicts with the other 1250BC evidence.

The story was well thought out and rich with meaning, and in all the places where creative license was taken it was done with the utmost care and taste. The music and emotion of the film were so easy to get caught up in. It truly made me feel as if I were there observing the life of the princess as she grew into womanhood and discovered her own inner strength. The role of Hawaii's last queen was also well done and I would now love to see a film done by the same director and crew on her life (well one can dream). Overall an excellent film, and one that I feel honored to have in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically inaccurate but accurately captures feeling of loss","review":"There was a Princess Ka'iulani, she did go to school in England, and the kingdom of Hawai'i was overthrown. That much of the movie is true. Most of the rest is fictionalized. What this film does very well is capture the feeling of loss. For many people, this is the first time they will learn of the illegal overthrow. What I dearly loved about the movie were some of the characterizations. Leo Anderson as Queen Lili'uokalani was magnificent. Some of the extras brought much to their small roles. A guard at the last banquet tells a story of pride and disgust with his facial expressions. The locations were beautifully photographed. All in all, I recommend the movie highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T: Princess Kaiu-likely to bore you into hating Hawaii","review":"I saw this in theaters, and it was so slow. It will bore you.

In the movie there was a lot of kissing which in fact back in the day, the true hawaiian look down on public affections because it was disrespectful. The first half of the movie was boring.

This is a flip phone and there are no buttons on the side or front of the phone that allow you to place calls, so it was not a case of me accidentally pressing on one of the buttons in my pocket. I just took the phone to my local AT&T store, and they showed me that barely touching the headphone jack on the side of the phone brings up the recent calls menu and dials my last call. The people at AT&T informed me that I am not the first person they have seen with this problem and the only way I can get it fixed is for AT&T to send me a replacement phone.

She tried this shaker out as soon as we got it, and it leaked everywhere. At first she thought it was her doing, so she cleaned it up, and asked me to close it and shake it, same problem. It doesn't matter how tight you hold down on this lid while you shake, or how lightly you shake, it leaks. Finally, she tried pouring her drinks into glasses... and wonder of all wonders, it leaked then to! It is completely unusable, we checked for product malfunctions (dents, etc) and found none. We asked other people to try shaking it, to make sure it wasn't us, and it leaked no matter what you did. My recommendation?

It was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine is a Leaker - Beware","review":"First, the good: The shaker comes well packaged and looks attractive. The capacity is good and it sits with stability on flat surfaces. Unfortunately, mine leaks profusely. Not only does the shaker spray liquid everywhere while shaking, it also dribbles from the perimeter sleeve when pouring. In short, expect a mess. The problem might be attributable to a slight warm in the middle sleeve (from which is intended to remin on when you pour). This might be unique to one particular sample, but the metal seems very thin and therefore vulnerable to warps. This item is touted as commercial grade, but no bar would use this item more than once. I am not waiting to check the reports of rust. This is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS--WASTE OF MONEY","review":"By far the worst shaker I have ever used.

She also has a nice mix of guests on her various tracks, but not too much to the point where you start feeling as if the CD wasn't her own. It's nice to have a CD from a female rapper without feeling like you lose any street cred or hard-core image.

Turning the 12 string into a percusive back up, his vocals and trumpeting sounds harmonized then soared with power and emotion that took me way back to Richie Havens doing Freedom at Woodstock.

As the plot dragged on, I kept asking why I should care about the sufferings and torments of this man who didn't seem to care himself what happened to him. No matter what happens, Brody's reaction is always a bland, disinterested smirk that becomes more and more irritating. Too bad: the story deserved a better presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"More proof that the Oscars are a total crock!","review":"Even though I'm simply echoing stuff that a lot of other negative reviewers have said, I feel I must help counter all the mysteriously great reviews this film got! Adrien Brody TOTALLY didn't deserve the Oscar for this -- hell, he hardly even has any lines, and spends most of the movie hiding like a rat, with an expressionless face, watching Nazi atrocities out of his window! And (though this is not Brody's fault) his character is totally unsympathetic and cares for no one but himself. All the Nazi brutalities have been shown ad nauseam in other, far-better movies like \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Life is Beautiful.\\" As someone else said, I think this movie (and Brody) did well because 1) it's a Polanski film (whoopee), and 2) it's about a politically correct subject. Frankly, I don't need any more movies about the Holocaust unless they have something new to say about it -- and this film definitely doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in a long time. The events that it portrayed are horrible and tragic, but the movie and its presentation of the events were severely lacking considering the awards it was given and the huge budget that it must have taken to make the movie. There was nothing that has not already been said repeatedly from Hollywood, and the movie spent more time highlighting bloody scenes than any sort of plot line. I realize that it is unpopular to say that anything portraying the Holocaust is not magnificent, but this movie was tragically lacking in anything like substance or quality.In my opinion, if you've seen ANY other Holocaust movie in the last 10 years, save your money and the 2 1/2 hours for a movie that has something new to say and says it with intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art. See it.","review":"A moving, understated, almost documentary-like story of a Jewish pianist's attempt to survive the Nazi holocaust in Poland. Polanski's direction is beautifully restrained, there is no spelunking in violene nor melodrama, but a simple, unrelenting story of both a people's suffering and especially one man's suffering and survival in a world temporarily gone mad. The note of hope at the end is realistically done and mitigates but does not cancel out the suffering we have just spent the past two hours witnessing. Adrien Brody's Academy Award was not only deserved but indeed ineluctable unless Hollywood wanted to publically confess it is no longer interested in film as art. This is an infinitely sad, infinitely moving but also infinitely human testament to the art of music, the art of life and the art of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrian Brody: Total Immersion","review":"This is not a movie to watch if you want mindless entertainment. It is a gut-wrenching depiction of the most horrible atrocities in human history. Adrian Brody totally immerses himself in the title role of a Polish pianist who somehow managed to survive,against overwhelming odds, the horrors of the Holocaust. If this story doesn't put your problems in perspective,nothing will.Wanting to turn away from the horrific views of all this brutality, I found myself staring in disbelief at the brutality of the Nazi soldiers \\"acting under orders.\\" These willful acts of violence display humanity at its absolute worse. Yet, the determination of this young pianist to survive shows the inner strength of the human spirit to overcome. Hopefully none of us will ever be pushed to such limits but this movie makes us aware of the inner strength that lies within us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words Cannot Describe...","review":"The saying goes that \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\"...if that is the case, than this film is worth millions of them.Very few films have the ability to make the viewer cry, feel pain, or joy. This one will take you through them all. At the close of this film you will feel as though you have lived through everything that Szpilman lived through, as well as those who were not so fortunate. You will feel weary at the end...you will feel like you have triumphed over something. You will feel a duty to live your life to the fullest and to allow others to live their lives as well. You will learn a lesson that we all should learn. The human spirit cannot be broken so long as there is something it can hope for.Brody is exquisite as Szpilman, taking on the burden forced on the musician by the oppressing Nazi invaders. You can look in his eyes and see the pain that Szpilman must have felt. You can also see his strength.You will not regret seeing this film.It's simply not possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, defective DVD","review":"Universal Widescreen, will not play through, but stops at ch. 13.I have seen the film, which is excellent, but am very disappointed at the poor quality of the disk, which will not finish playing, even on a brand-new Sony DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD HD (High Definition)","review":"Please be aware that when you sell a CD that the customer should be able to use it.

Additionally, the Bluray player played it right away just like it was a DVD; Blurays usually take a bit longer to read at first.

This war is not easy to watch, the things that occured are difficult for any of us to fathom, but stories like this really illustrate that humans are not only capable of horrible things, but incredible things. There is a balance between beauty and ugliness in this film that is reminiscent of Shindler's List. I really feel that this film is Brody's finest work to date.

After all, who wants to spend their recreational time reliving one of the worst atrocities in history?The Pianist puts a very personal face on the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, and walks the viewer through the struggle for survival of one man and his family. This interesting perspective should bring something fresh to a topic that isn't very appealing, yet has been relentlessly overdone by Hollywood.But it doesn't. The story isn't terribly interesting, though the unique hero perspective this movie chooses should be fertile for a new treatment of the subject. We don't get any additional insight, and are treated to countless acts of violence hung over a thready plot.I distracted myself with the movie's excellent cinematography, editing, and music. It's sad that I spent the time watching the movie for its technical qualities instead of its story, but I found the story to be less than enthralling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New, Liked SCHINDLER'S LIST Better","review":"This film is competently made, even very involving in the beginning, but the disappearance of the Pianist's entire family so early on and endless shots of him staring out of various windows made me think there was a more interesting story going on elsewhere.It would have had a much more profound effect if I'd never seen SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg's best \\"adult\\" masterpiece, but I kept comparing the atrocities of this film's color scenes of horror with Spielberg's black-and-white ones and had to go with SCHINDLER every time.I've always loved what Polanski did with THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, ROSEMARY'S BABY and especially CHINATOWN, but I've been scratching my head since then with efforts like FRANTIC, BITTER MOON and THE NINTH GATE.THE PIANIST is one of his great films told at the pace of one of his bad films.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"skips scenes","review":"the disc has circles scratches all over the disc and it keeps gliching it skipped 3 scenes and it was described as like new this is crazy i want refund"},{"rating":"1","title":"freeze/jump problems on widescreen version","review":"I bought the widescreen DVD of The Pianist at Circuit City and it froze and jumped within chapter 13.

The main actors ineptitude and lethargy at times was frustrating, but it is a true story, and remarkable none the less.Great entertainment and well worth the small purchase price, this is a movie that will be played several more times over the years.My wife, 13 year old son and 10 year old daughter enjoyed it also, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"World War II, Germans treatment of Jews in Poland","review":"If you like war movies, you will like this one.

It is well acted and well photographed, but the Brody character is just not very interesting. This guy escapes the holocaust through the efforts of a series of other people, does very little to help himself other than scrounge for food, does essentially nothing to save others and shows little gratitude towards the people who help him. There are seemingly endless scenes of Brody sleeping or staring out a window. This is a yawner. There must be a lot of politics behind all the awards this film got."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate film","review":"An excellent film made even more dramatic in that elements of Polanskis actual life are included in the film. Take the scene where Szpilman is pulled to safety by his old friend who has now become a guard, he runs away but is told by the guard \\"Don't run\\" (I assume in order to not raise suspicion) In the book he is told to \\"Run\\" These words are actually from Polanskis life in the Ghettos when he was given the chance to flee.This film has got to be one of the best 2nd world war films you can find, simply because it is one mans story, one 'ordinary' mans story of survival in almost impossible conditions. The German officer at the end is quite rightly a symbol of hope that there is still good in the world.This film may not have received the same attention as Shindlers List perhaps because while that film is about the collective horrors of the 2nd world war this is more the story of an individual. Still that takes nothing from the film. 5 stars and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extrmely sad, yet AMAZING film","review":"I just saw the pianist a couple of weeks ago.

Adrien Brody's perfomance was spectacular!! He deserved 110% the oscar he won. The directing oscar was very well deserved too. This film shows how extreme and devastating the holoucast was. I've always cosidered the holoucast the most horrible and unhuman things in history... and this film made me realiza that i was right.

It doesn't require any pressure against the car, it simply empties out by itself. And unless you wash very fast, the soap will be gone before you've even washed one side of your car. If you have to spend any extra time cleaning a particular spot, the soap will be gone before you even move on.

Well, it was used once and the strings kept snapping. We know what we're doing so it wasn't us. The thing was strung over half a dozen times by several different people and it kept snapping.

The concept is good because the little amp is fun, but the connections to the guitar is bad, so it fades in and out and you're always having to play with the cord. The sound is very tinny and no matter how many times I tune it, it's back out of tune WITHIN MINUTES. The look and feel of the guitar is really good however. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT PINK. IT'S RED. So if your little girl desires pink, this is NOT the guitar you should order. It says metallic pink on the box, but it is not in any way pink. Santa brought my 4 year old this guitar, and she doesn't like or enjoy it. She still likes the old acoustic pink guitar much better.

I called Panasonic to have my tv fixed (5 year warranty) and I was told that they could not fix the tv because I received the tv as a gift and therefore I was not the original owner of the tv. I have been fighting with them for almost 3 weeks with regard to fixing the lamp. My sister has the same tv bought at the same time and she was told that her warranty expired and she would have to pay for it herself. It cost her $495.00 to have hers fixed.

All this in less than 2 boxes of nails.Ended up purchasing a manual nailer which never let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro-Level Tool","review":"This nailer has made quick work of every hardwood project I've thrown at it thus far.

This nailer delivered, no jams, getting the depth setting(s) just right, takes a little tweeking but that's normal for ANY tool one uses for the first time. If you're a DIY'er I'd recommend a less expensive pneumatic, maybe even a manual nailer, but for you guys that make a living throwing down planks, it's a solid investment.

The overall experience is hair-raising, in other words, not to say life-changing. The only criticism might be that the release is rather skimpy in length; there was plenty of room for the Toccata and fugue in d and the Fantasy and fugue in g (S.565 and 542).

In her first novel, Millea Smith creates the well-detailed universe of Omaha in the 1960s and 1970s, and the results are breathtaking.

Still, at least Brooke's speculations were interesting and consistent with existing literature.

Although the material in the book is mainly taken from Western chroniclers, it doesn't minimize the barbarity and slaughter committed by the Crusaders."},{"rating":"1","title":"if picaso did drum & bass","review":"well the track listings are greyed out, so this purchase was on a dare. i liked what BL did with Panthalassa so i thought this workover of (someone said) techno/drum & bass would be potentially great.how do i describe it? ehm, well to my ears, it's just loud, white noise; angry and industrial crapola.makes me think of my younger years and how an old favorite: skinny puppy, by comparison sounds absolutely full of rhythm compared to this picaso of sound. i do like a variety of music but, sadly, could not listen thru any of this.i'm only doing a review for those who, like me, like to try new music: if you are not sure what this is, fire up some P to P and download some tracks first. i wish i had =("},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Emotion over Not Very Much...","review":"Good actors in a bad movie. Nolte and Bridges play childhood buddies with a dark (dark-ish, by Hollywood standards) secret, which comes back to haunt them. Why now, after so many years, do things come to a head? We don't really know. Characters (like Catherine Keener's) float around with no apparent purpose. Bridges and Stone experience emotional meltdowns rather too suddenly to be believable. The hysteria just isn't warranted, given the crime, and the time that has passed.Even Albert Finney--a great actor by any standard--seems to be wondering what's going on. As always, though, he's a pleasure to watch, and his character possesses a bearing and dignity that the others could stand to learn from.Expect one thing from this movie: a keen sense of disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"one the worst movies I ever seen (zero stars!)","review":"The movie sucks big time. The script is a fluff. All the characters behave irrationally. Motivations are totally artificial. Poor Sharon looks like she is 20 years older than she really is. Keener must have been in desperate need of money to get in to this after her stellar perfomances in ''Living in oblivion'' and ''Being John Malkovich''."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Awful","review":"We rented this film because of the cast and the blip on the cover sounded intriguing. I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it anything lower (minus 100 would be closer to what it's worth.) A totally pointless story about characters plagued by a silly scam that took place years ago and is now buried in the past. Why bring it up now? God only knows--the audience is never told. And why is everyone so upset over it now? Beats me. We never know anything about how the characters went from the past to where they are now, but they are all so unlikeable, you really don't care. The ending has to be one of the most idiotic in Hollywood history. Avoid this movie, you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Hours of My Life I'll Never Get Back....","review":"UGH. This is a perfect example of Hollywood gone bad. What the heck??? WHY WAS this movie made?? It was perhaps the most boring 2 hours I have ever spent and I have my share of dull moments...believe me! I'd rather get a root canal than sit through this flick again. I rented it because of the stellar cast which obviously is having a hard time getting decent work. This film was muddled and just plain uninteresting. You couldn't care less about the characters, and even the nice horsey setting in Kentucky didn't help one bit to make this movie watchable. I'm taking the time to write this because if I can persuade even ONE person to not waste their money either buying (God forbid) or renting this movie, then it was worth my effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely lost","review":"This is a movie in which I could not understand what they wanted to convey and what the movie meant.The storyline is weak.

Beautifully filmed in Kentucky and California, the movie however is merely a cinematic version of one of playwright Sam Shepard's character studies. It's plot is so convoluted and erratic, it's hard to keep up with. And the twists the movie takes, most notably the seeming reversal of the two male characters, it becomes annoying in its duplicity. Credit goes to Albert Finney and Catherine Keener particularly for at least trying to flesh out otherwise cardboard characters. Sharon Stone doesn't show up until the movie's almost over, and we get to see her do her sleazy alcoholic hasbeen role once again. Ditto to Nick Nolte, who seems to have made a career playing scruffy looking nobodies. Even the usually reliable Jeff Bridges gets lost in the muddled film. I don't know what I was expecting, but SIMPATICO doesn't win, place or even show for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Enough to Watch, But...","review":"The plot and the characters become incomprehensible about midway through the film. About three quarters of the way through, I was thinking, \\"What is the point of this movie?\\" Then, for no particular reason, Sharon Stone shoots a horse (a big \\"what the...?\\" moment). Finally, the ending left me with an \\"I don't get it\\" feeling.Nolte and Bridges made the film watchable and interesting for a while. But when Bridges' character suddenly changes his personality and starts acting just like Nolte's character for no good reason (I guess it was supposed to have some deep symbolic meaning, but it means nothing when it's totally arbitrary and illogical and unbelievable given the premises of the story), I thought it might be time to give up on Simpatico and try another DVD. I should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Chicken Soup books have been a good read in the past. This one seemed to be the perfect Christmas gift for friends in recovery, so I purchased three copies (there were no reviews to assist my decision.) After reading some of the book, I quickly became disappointed. The stories seem to lack substance or the inspiration experienced in other Chicken Soup books. The stories described difficult events, but no insight as to how the individuals came to find peace and serenity.

It's a real sturdy stand that let's me move the saw easily - down 50 yards of gravel driveway from my shop to my house, then up six steps to the deck without hassle. I also wheel the saw to make the best use of shop space. I move it inside my shop as needed to cut large boards, or into a corner for storage.

Most of the writing is about the weather and how his cotton crop is doing, however, there are a number of annecdotes which are amusing (reflecting his sense of humor) and comments which today are startling. The startling comments are those about the actions of and his treatment of the slaves on his plantation. While regarded as a kind man, he frequently talks of administering \\"light whippings\\" when the slaves did not meet his expectations on cotton picking. It's hard to relate to that at the end of the 20th century.The author of the diary is my great, great grandfather and through this book I feel that I have gotten to know him. So this book is very special to me. But I think others would find it very insightful, although some aspects viewed in today's world are very troubling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A restful alternative, when you can't sleep.","review":"I'm buying a second copy of this CD, because my toddler scratched up my first copy.

The LaserJet 6L can feed paper back into an upright bin after printing, or out a slot in the front. A small lever on the front left side of the printer selects where the paper will be directed. After a few years, I experienced jams when the switch was in the upright position to feed the paper back up into the bin. When I put the switch down, to have the paper come out the front of the unit, the problem went away. Print quality is excellent and the cost per print is a small fraction of what ink jet copies cost. Before the 6L, I owned a LaserJet 2 for nearly 15 years. I think that the 6L might equal that record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add Christmas Angst, Boyfriend, Family, and Stir","review":"Emotional ties bound up in family Christmas traditions complicate but ultimately help strengthen the bond between two gay men, who are sympathetically portrayed, but sadly conceived along stereotypical cardboard-cut-out-gay-character lines. Why must the good-looking tall doctor be rich? Why must the suffering but sensitive hospital administrator (a hemophiliac no less) be HIV+? Why must a moment of unprotected sex be glorified as the impatient imperative of true love? Why must the form of the novel confuse several Christmas periods that shape the relationship? Better gay fiction than most, with honest observations about flash points in a budding romance, but ultimately a bit soggy with its own sentimentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche and Juvenile","review":"Comfort and Joy reminded me of the books that I had read as a teenager. The conflicts seemed artificially black and white. The dialogue felt forced and overused. The story lacked signficant creativity. The characters felt like unreal archtypes. As a younger and inexperienced adolescent, I might have enjoyed this book more, since it gives a glimpse--albeit simplistic--of love between two men. I might have even found the conflicts of the main characters intriguing. As an adult with more exposure to life's complexity, I instead found the work lacking depth--lacking a pulse for how people really interact or for the subtlety and irony of existence--compared with the standard I've come to expect from comtemporary works--gay-themed or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and predictable","review":"Grimsley's talent isn't on display on this boring \\"gay novel\\" about a guy and his boyfriend and family.

Try Dorothy Allison's work instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay melodrama is tiresome","review":"If you want to read a book by this author, read \\"Winter Birds\\" and not this far-fetched gay melodrama. Some of the dialogue is laughable. I feel like the publisher has scraped the bottom of the Grimsley barrel and ought to wait for him to write a fine book and then publish that."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Joy Here","review":"\\"Comfort and Joy\\" is a whisper-thin novel that can be consumed in less than two hours....two UNSATISFACTORY hours. It seems that the usually brilliant Mr. Grimsley wrote this story while he was half asleep. The characters are so slight and underdeveloped, you'd never guess they were created by the author of \\"Winter Birds\\" and \\"My Drowning\\".The story revolves around the unlikely pairing of Dan Crell and Ford McKinney. Let's be honest - there is no way we can believe that a relationship could form between a Captain Marvel-Ken Doll- Doctor with tons of cash and an emotionally-stunted, homely, poor, HIV patient. Maybe it's Jim Grimsley's feverish fantasy to land such a prize lover, but it doesn't work for the reader.People who remember \\"Winter Birds\\" with the same fondness that I do will hate the fact that Ellen Crell, Allen and especially Amy Kay have grown into people with no dimension."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable and \\"calculated\\" novel","review":"This implausible tale of a gay relationship between a handsome doctor and a homely guy with not much going for him seems \\"calculated\\" by the author as a romance to appeal to gay men.

I would definitely pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"I can hardly believe that the talented Jim Grimsley of Winter Birds is the same author of Comfort & Joy (and of Dream Boy for that matter). Mr Grimsley here delivers a story and characters he himself is not convinced about. Without mentioning his seedy, amateurish style, all his characters are lame and stereotyped. Take Ford's mother for example. Take her phone conversation with him before Christmas. She clearly comes down as an idiotic upper class woman. Only not a believable idiot, but a cliché one, straight from a soap. I can understand a brilliant young writer being pressured from agents and publishers, but why accepting to tarnish one's career so indelibly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful love story","review":"This is a beautiful book which can be read by both straight and gay readers. It focuses on issues that can be understood by everyone - living up to parent's expectations, making your own way in life and how to keep a relationship together. You root for Ford and Dan through the whole novel; you want to see it work out for them. It's a lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"I enjoyed reading Comfort and Joy. The relationship between Ford and Dan is interesting and sad and complex. Grimsley also provides an excellent description of Ford's brief relationship with a drunkard named McKenzie that I found to be one of the highlights of this book. My only real complaint is that Ford's parents were a little too stereotypical of rich white Southerners. I guess I wanted them to be a little less predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing results","review":"This stuff is awesome -- really produces a dramatic difference in the quality of my skin. I literally glow (in the best way) using this. It helps to exfoliate your skin and reveals the nicer skin underneath. I love this stuff.

If you are 5-10 or taller, you will really appreciate this item. Get your ply or MDF vertical, hook this centered under the edge with your knees bent. Grasp the sheet at the top with your other hand and straighten your knees. Don't bend your back, just your knees, and the mechanical advantage will allow you to move the sheet ith minimal effort.

The knives themselves are so lightweight, they feel very unsecure when you hold them.It's time to remember, you get what you pay for - don't be fooled into thinking this is a good deal - put out the extra money and get a real set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item, bad product","review":"I was sent these knives apparently by mistake, as I had ordered the Henckels 8-piece stainless steel set at the same price. I considered keeping them, but decided not to because the knives were very light weight, and the handles were very narrow. You almost felt as though you may snap them if you actually attempted to cut with them. I believe that a steak knife should have some heft, and these definately don't have it. The eversharp blades also scream chintzy to me, they just don't have the bite I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steak knives","review":"Excellent knives, I bought 2 sets, they resist very well ti being washed in the dishwasher, I am thinking of buying another set. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"long lasting","review":"I have had this set for at least 6 years now, still sharp and looking great. Love the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"It may be Henckels, but they are cheap and they rust. Save up for a couple of higher end Henckels that will last. And don't put them in the dishwasher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know what everyone is talkin about","review":"I got mine for like 15 bucks at the store..so this isnt a great deal. As for the performance, these knives are horrible. Very fine serrations cause the meat fiber to gum up the blade. Even if you arent \\"cutting\\" something as gummy as meat fiber, you still feel like you are ripping through the food rather then cutting it. Overall, Id say stay away. Im getting rid of mine"},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality","review":"these are good quality knives - very sharp saw blades and they cut through the toughest steak! we've had another set for years and this set was for a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every bit of the price","review":"No they aren't the same quality as those steak knives that cost $24 each, but for the price they are wonderful. I didn't want to spend a fortune on steak knives because my family abuses them. That's right, we open the mail, slice through cardboard and cut through those impossible nylon bindings. The we wash them and set the table with them too! So when I saw these I snapped them up, hoping they would last a year or two. They're wonderful! Perfectly fine for table wear and do a nice job. They are worth every bit of their price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Excellent Quality!","review":"We purchased these new knives about 2 weeks ago. The price is excellent, and the quality is superb. The tangs (that is the metal part of the blade that goes inside the handle) goes right to the end with 3 fixtures keeping in place, making these a very solid knife.They don't weight too much, and the handles are not too chunky. Add to this, the extremely sharp blades, and you've got a winning combination at a price you can't beat!- Davey"},{"rating":"1","title":"know what you're buying","review":"The International Eversharp line is Henckels low-end, stamped stainless line. It is not carbon steel. It is not hand-forged. It does not compare to the other Henckels lines which are. You get what you pay for. These are cheap knives.This is the first time I have seen a set of Henckels knives which could go in the dishwasher....but, that's because on this line, you do not get Henckels lifetime warranty (which is voided by dishwasher use)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set of knifes","review":"These knives are really good, very sharp and sturdy. They've been washed plenty of times in the dishwasher and have not lost their finish or sharpness. One minus is the size of the handles, a little too small to feel like a real steak knife. Other than that they are a pretty good set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set","review":"We use them as steak knives but also to chop veggies or else. Hopefully they will stay sharp as they are right now. Very nice handle, smooth and fits well into your hand. Happy with that purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This cd was really awsome because i was able to hear how killer whales really sound like out in their natural habitat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instantly Forgettable","review":"In the ever-expanding sea of downbeat albums, UKO drift with the plankton. I'd read that these guys are likely to fill the void left by off-the-sceners Kruder and Dorfmeister but it's the very quality that has crowned K&D the 'chill-out' royalty that UKO have forgotten to include in their mix. Tunes.Songs meld into each other leaving in their wake dubby bass, bog-standard breakbeats and pointless sampled snippets. As instantly forgettable as their moniker I'm afraid.Collectives bringing something new to a saturated genre are Eighteenth Street Lounge label's Blue States which veer more towards John Barry style movie soundtracks and anything from Manchesters Grand Central label (try one of their compilations first.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these glasses","review":"This would be the second time ordering this pair for me, after a full year it finally broke on me. These are great for people who have sort of a bigger face than normal. The standard wayfarers from raybans never seemed to fit me properly, (always too tight), but this one fits perfectly! Although i was pretty upset when i got my order in and saw that the ear piece was broken. However being the good guys that they are, they sent me a new one immediately!

I remember Ladybuy describing her album as \\"music\\", rather than tying it down to a single genre, and the album is evidence to its truth. From her classic hiphop/spoken word vibe from DP, to her ventures into alt-rock vibes, pop-ish sounds, jazzy and new-age sounds, the album's all over the place, yet they all share a similar ambiance that Ladybug's vocals create.No other featured vocalists (aside from the skits), but it's nothing to trip about, ladybug keeps it poppin. Def recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this purchase they made it look 10 times bigger than the actual size they should be specific when they advertise this if it wasn't for someone out of state i would have return it.

Motivated by a gypsy's fortune (and to get the girl), the one steals, lies, and outwits the cops. As the story progresses tragedy escalates until the very end. I was impressed with the raw depiction of life as it really is out there, as subjects like death and its aftermath are handled well by Prince Charming and his girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check The Titles--It's Protocol","review":"I just finished Season One of the series and enjoyed the ride, despite what I thought was an overly repetitious use of the word \\"Protocol\\" in every episode. BUT, with that said, I am still searching for logical connections between all of the episodes' titles being Led Zeppelin songs, and in Season Two, why they're all titles of R.E.M. tunes. It's that sort of \\"Easter Egg\\" frivolous play that makes the show even more fun. Kudos to the producers and creators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sight unseen...","review":"I really feel ripped of buying this episode!!! Want my money back. 20 minutes is not a complete show. My partner enjoy this show, but come on, this was awful and I'll repeat, a RIP OFF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite show","review":"Love the show hard to beat, unless it is white collar.

I really liked her heels and wish I was that young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covert Affairs Season Two","review":"Its real interesting to see what a special agent goes through. Keeping secrets of your job from your family members and keeping them safe at the same timeis a lot of work especially emotionally. I wonder how many directives are thwarted. I find it odd that a agent that goes against protocol isn't fired. I don't know if I could sleep with the enemy. I do like the relationship with Annie and Augie. Glad to see it come back for another season. Also like the theme music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covert Affairs - great tv","review":"The show is great. But one of the DVD's (I haven't watched all of them yet) was scratched so it would not play two of the episodes. According to the return policy I can't return it since I opened it. Which is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covert Affairs Revealed","review":"I had not seen Covert Affairs before and decided to use it as a test for the Kindle Fire. I enjoyed the program, and watching on the Kindle. The only problem is paying so much to watch what is on free TV. These programs should be 49 cents an episode. Let's get real Amazon, you're making money. I'd watch more if your pricing was better. Also your platform should be integrated. Do I really need two clouds? And why doesn't my changes on the Kindle sync with the cloud? It is obvious that you had at least three programming groups working separately and with no thought of the consumer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"COVERT 2","review":"I really enjoyed the second season COVERT AFFAIRS even more than the first season..Always action and you really believe you are ion the CIA agent area solving America's problems.."},{"rating":"1","title":"great clamps but I ordered a 10 pack and received only one","review":"I had the same problem as others, I ordered multi packs of two different sizes of these clamps and only received one of each.

Those are some expensive clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does my university use this book?","review":"Why does my university use this book? The University of Washington uses this book to weed out the pre med students. Why do they choose this book? Zumdahl purposely wrote this book to be confusing. Try reading pp. 668 through 670 in the fifth edition. He wrote this to be especially confusing by not being consistent with phase signs nor giving clear statements, such as \\"When the phase of the right orbital is reversed and combined with the left orbital.\\" What orbitals is he talking about? The ones on a figure, that happen to be on a different page, which is not in view when reading this page? This book is horrible and is designed for the student to fail. Thank you Zumdahl and UW for trying to ruin chemistry for your students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Not only did my chemistry class not use this book, but I cannot imagine how ANY class could use this. This book is so badly written, that it isn't even worth opening. It doesn't follow any particular order, and it frequently jumps back and forth between highly advanced topics and surprisingly dumb examples. Reading through even a single chapter of this book will lower the intelligence quotient of any sane individual. I suppose this book could serve a useful purpose, but only if that purpose was to teach the students to forget what they already knew about chemistry. I think I've made my point: do not buy this book under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ivy Tree needed pruning","review":"So, I after reading all the superlative reviews of this book, I wished for and received \\"Ivy Tree\\" as a gift. First off, what was with the font used for this book? It was painful to read. And, anyone who is a lover of mystery books can figure out the plot within the first few pages. I wish I could compare the book to an ivy tree, but if I did, it would I would have to talk only about pruning. Like, cut this book back to its roots and start over. Not even the copy-cat Jane Eyre/Edward Fairfax Rochester, mad wife, fire and scars can make this book worthwhile.

I started on it about a month ago. I'm not even half way through it. No, I'm not busy doing other things. This is the kind of book where I can't even force myself to finish the chapter before I put it down. I would normally finish reading a book this size in a day or two if I liked it. I just can't get into the story. While the writer is very, very descriptive it seems she forgot to add depth to the characters. They seem so one dimensional. I can't care about them, identify with them- nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a really awsome book. I couln't stop reading it. It has a really good opening chapter and unfortunatly not every book has that. This book is full of mystery and suspence. The ending of the book is what you would never expect. It has your heart racing at the turn of every page. It is such a joy to read this book. I know that there are alot of books out there but this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAGE TURNING MYSTERY!","review":"My mom convinced me to read this and when I finally was persuaded to read it I found that Mary Stewart is a literary genuis.

The print is at times a little dark, but overall it is not bad to look at. The biggest problem with Madacy's version is that they not only have cut out the title's beginning and endings, they also removed the chapter recaps as well. This seems an odd choice on their part, considernig all chapter recaps were left in on their Painted Stallion, and New Adventures of Tarzan DVD's. Without the chapter recaps the serial loses some of its flare. I would reccomend waiting for the Image version of the serial. I understand that theirs comes from the original negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zorro at His Cliffhanging Best","review":"\\"Zorro's Fighting Legion\\" (1939) remains one of the great serials with its impressive cast, energetic direction and first-rate action sequences. Reed Hadley is terrific as Don Diego/Zorro, while Don Del Oro emerges as a classic villain. When it came to serials, Republic Pictures was second to none in terms of quality - and \\"Zorro's Fighting Legion\\" is Saturday matinee escapism of the highest calibre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed my 10 year old tape better","review":"I was going to write my own review but michaeljmoore2 beat me to the punch. My old VHS version of this serial beats this DVD hands down. I still can't understand why the DVD version did not include the synopsis from the previous chapter. For me, this was one of the fun parts of the serial. It can't be because they ran out of space on the DVD since there are two DVDs with this set. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun stuff!","review":"If you were brought up on the Disney Zorro TV series, this might not be your cup of tea, but if you enjoy the old-time cliff-hangers, you'll love this one. Reed Hadley (real name Reed Herring) is great as Zorro. One episode includes the famous stunt by Yakima Canutt where (as Zorro) he climbs from the team of galloping horses under the stagecoach and back up to save the day. The stunt occupies only about 2 seconds on the screen, but it's a classic. It's been recreated countless times since then, mostly with trick photography. Watch for Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger in the TV series) in a bit part as \\"Fernando\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republic's Best Serial","review":"I first saw ZFL on tv in 1953 when the networks were looking to fill time slots. Yakima Canutt's one of a kind stunt in chapter 7- falling under the moving stagecoach convinced me that I wanted to be a stuntman when I grew up. The climax- Don Diego and Don Del Oro in hand-to-hand combat- rolling around the floor of the ceremonial cave until Zorro pulls off the Golden God's helmut revealing ? as the villian. I've seen all of Republic's serials & none show the hero & villian fighting it out during the conclusion. The very best serial ever. ZFL ranks as my favorite movie of the century. Look how often scenes for modern movies have been taken from ZFL. I highly recommend it. 5 stars- the very best rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Serial","review":"The famous under the Coach leap seen in Indian Jones was born here and much used in those days.

It does cover his work from the 60s to the early 90s... however, this is more a collection of his singles and the selections from the 80s are POOR choices!! Nothing from \\"Cat People\\" \\"Scarface\\" \\"Flashdance\\" \\"Top Gun\\" -- unbelievable!! His most accomplished works from the 80s are on those albums!! Instead they stuck in some boring 80s tracks including one from the 84 Olympics called \\"reach out\\" which is horribly shallow in music and lyrics -- i am a fan of Giorgio Moroder and was highly disappointed with the selections -- Now, if you are interested in a collection of his singles then this is the album to buy - but if you want to hear his best stuff i recommend the albums i already mentioned above as well as \\"From Here to Eternity\\" \\"E=Mc2\\" and \\"Midnight Express\\" which are great electronic feats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of Giorgio Moroder","review":"If you liked 2001, A Space Odyssey, You will love this CD. The creativity used in this music is out of this world.

He rants for pages about descriptions, and has a habit of splitting the verb from the subject with many inserted phrases and clauses; by the time you get to the verb the thought is lost. He does it with sentence upon sentence until he confuses you, and with added verbose and boring descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knights and Ladies for Children","review":"This is an action packed account about Knights and Ladies.

The book droned on and on for over 500 pages, and reading it was pure torture. To give you an idea on how verbose the book was, Sir Walter Scott went on for a couple of pages describing how one of the characters was dressed! Also, there was little depth to the main character, who was Ivanhoe.

Then, when i took a screen weriting class in college, i became obsessed with the idea of adapting ivanhoe into a screenplay. so, i purchased the book and a copy of the 'cliff notes'. the cliff note helped me to understand the dialoge and the action a lot better and i could not put the book down. i've read it at least a dozen times dirung the last four yers. though i've yet to adapt it, i still enjoy it every time i pick it up. two characters stand out: the independant minded Rebecca and the strong, powerful Richard the Lionhearted. a great read and i recemomend it to anyone whomay be a little older than your high school kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"waterlilly","review":"I really enjoyed the book and the characters some of whom were good, others clearly evil, and others a bit of both. Although what characters were good or evil was not always clear. Was Friar Tuck such a good guy? I don't recall a single clergy member that was honest. I felt Rebecca was interesting in that she was brave, kind, courageous, and spirited. Rowenna took a back seat as a hollow character. Bois-Guilbert was truly fascinating. One sees a progression towards introspection in this valueless but brave man of action. You start to hope that he will evolve through love and contact with the good into a true hero. Although some progress seems to be made, where he is morally at the end is unclear. We never can tell if he would have lost the last battle on purpose. Perhaps the book should have been titled \\"Brian and Rebecca.\\" Ivanhoe was not present during so much of the book and the ending is a bit unhappy and not satisfying. Overall it is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where does commentary start and narrative begin?","review":"There is no clear place where the extensive commentaries end and the actual story begins.

My English teacher suggested it to me and my friend as a 'challenging' book to read for a paper. My friend and I agreed to read it together, but were both instantly bored with the overwhelming detail. To get through it, we made a contest to see who could finish the book the fastest, and this was probably the only reason I continued to read it, but I'm go glad I did! Once I got into the plot and action and intrigue, the detail was hardly superfluous.It was a bit thick for me at thirteen, but I read it again a few years later and absolutely loved it! Every time I read it I'm so caught up in the action and so invested in all of the characters. There's a clear line of who is on whose side in the story, and Ivanhoe is clearly the 'good guy,' but the 'bad guys' are the real source of action.

It isn't long before he finds himself fighting the enemies of his king and kinsmen. If you're looking for an easy read, this may not be the book for you. The language is a bit complicated, and though the description is vivid at times it is overly detailed. Historical purists will find a large number of anachronisms. Nevertheless, the speed and quality of the tale make it hard to put down. Ancient combat, romantic triangles, scheming princes, this is where the tradition of the historical romance began. Not many authors can claim the created an entire genre. Filled with great characters and situations, Ivanhoe was fresh in its time & still reads well today -- a testament to Scott's skills as a teller of tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is a classic","review":"Although this was written hundreds of years ago, it is still a wonderful adventure to read.

What a great tale, I absolutely loved this story and I'm shocked that I haven't heard more about it in school or through other academic or literary circles. It's a wonderfully written, compelling, balanced, engrossing story which I couldn't stop talking about for a few days after finishing it. I wish reading like this was more standard in schools, and it reflects a very Shakespearean plot structure, as well as some of the dialogue, while it's somewhat more recent date of creation makes it a bit more accessible and easy to follow for the average high-school-er or college student. A great tale that also reveals an important and somewhat lesser known period of history in mother England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!

He even admits that despite all the research one can't assume that the dialogue and customs are truly authentic.

My parents have the same little buttler at their house and have had to replace the tank twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reputation for quality counts--I'm disappointed by reviews","review":"I had a Franke instant hot water dispenser installed about 5 years ago when I renovated my kitchen. About a year and a half ago it started leaking so I just turned off the water and stopped using it. When the plumber came out the other day for an unrelated problem, I asked him to take a look at the hot water dispenser to see if he could fix it. His advice was to replace it and suggested that I go to Amazon to check out prices. However, from the reviews I'm reading, I don't think I want to buy another Franke product. If Franke monitors customer feedback, it should be ashamed to hear what's being said about the quality and service of it's products. Meanwhile I think I'll either replace it with another brand or simply use my Keurig coffee maker and not even worry about it. To my way of thinking, reputation is everything and these reviews turn me off to your company and hence your product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroyed a kitchen cabinet","review":"What can I say that others haven't said. I replaced two leaking tanks, a couple of plastic hoses and had the inside of my kitchen cabinet redone twice because elements of the unit leak. As of yesterday a slow leak had developed from a hose or from the tank and over time had caused mold to grow under the sink ruining the flooring below the cabinet. Even if Franke lived up to their warrantees, why would anybody risk ruining cabinetry without any recourse. I'm thinking of just getting a cold water dispenser and using a tea kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"When working, the Franke Little Butler performs as advertized. The problem is, they don't last. My first one went out after about 4 years, my 2nd one after 18 months. Unfortunately, the warranty is only one year. I'll be searching for a replacement from a different manufacturer. By the way, I've had their faucet too and just replaced it with a Moen, which in my opinion is a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Lil Butler water heater","review":"This is not a review because I just bought this item, but a review because I have had two leaky heaters from Franke in four years. I would suggest to anyone looking for one of these heaters to look for some other brand than Franke. It's expensive and if they don't last longer than four years, there is something terribly wrong! The original was purchased from a kitchen and bath shop and professionally installed. The replacement came from the manufacturer, Anaheim Manufacturing in Anaheim, CA. The warranty is only for a year. Actually we've had trouble with the whole system, the filter cap and the hot and cold water valves all needed replacement. Bad Lil Butler! Buyer beware!UPDATE 11/4/2011 Just wanted to add this comment...just replaced heating tank with same Franke model purchased on Ebay from davidsfind. Brand new in box, fast shipping incl for less than Amazon price (sorry Amazon). Excellent price. Excellent seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked after 26 months","review":"We had one installed in February, 2010 and it started leaking in April, 2012. Unfortunately, most of the reviews here were made after I started the purchase process. I took the unit apart and it looks like the inlet fitting that is in the corner broke. Unfortunately, this is a plastic part, so there is no easy way to replace it. I know that heaters do not last forever, but it should have last longer, I would expect 5 years. I'm looking for another manufacturer. I recommended that this unit be installed locally, two other units were installed. Now I'm going to recommend that the Franke tanks be replaced pro-actively so as to avoid failure. Franke, you have a PR problem here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Purchase!","review":"This Franke water heater has all plastic fittings that are ill-fitting and it was very difficult to get the heater to be leak-free. I eventually went to the hardware store with the unit and asked for the appropriate fittings to install the heater. He sold me the fittings and then showed me a heater he had in stock with the fittings I purchased. The unit in the store was far cheaper. Also, I paid for one-day shipping and received it in four days. This is not a product that I would recommend to a friend--or even an enemy for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franke-nstein","review":"Thanks, Frank.

We installed 2 of them, one upstairs and one on the main floor. The failure of the downstairs unit resulted in a major flood because my wife and I were away from home. That was a significant insurance issue. The failure of the second device happened while my wife was using it, so we were fortunate. I discussed the issue with my plumber who said he has had other customers who have experience failures and recommended replacing it with a different, more reliable brand. He also used the term \\"cranky Franke\\". Beware of this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jury is still out...","review":"My plumber came this week to install this unit for one of my clients.

Will update when resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"fails if your original unit was made before 2003/2004","review":"We ended up buying 2 of these units that both failed - only to find out they are now being made by a new company that said they only work with faucets made prior to 2003/2004 when the pressure was changed in the faucets. Our original unit was 1999. They will work if you buy a new faucet! List price of faucet is between $550 and $600+ but Franke will give you it at 1/2 price if requested at customer service - will also give you a tank at 1/2 price (which was less than we paid here)if your tank failed. A very frustating process! Sure wish this vendor explained that you could only use this with faucets made after this change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks after 3 years","review":"Not worth the money with all the leaks.

So this is European quality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, poor quality, no customer service","review":"Franke is great for aesthetic design, and I love my Franke sink. But the Little Butler water heater developed a leak in under 5 years, and the Franke faucet started falling apart soon after. I'm sticking with Moen or Delta (lifetime warranty on faucet & great customer service) for faucets and switching to Insinkerator for hot water dispenser and filter. Insinkerator filters are half the price of Franke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen Better","review":"This book has an interesting title and premise, the author's background is intriguing and his promise to teach valuable lessons exciting, however, the body of the book delivers on few of these expectation. The text is simplistic, the situtions outlined uncomplicated, and the author's attempts to paint rosy pictures of the business environment just too good to be true. Perhaps it has value for the individual just starting out in business with no people or working experience, yet even here unrealistic situations and clean-cut advice will do nothing but set up the beginner for a career of disappointment and failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"rks","review":"The one that I got did not work.

Ms. Holmes paragraphs are overly descriptive, rambling, and corny, and she definitely lacks an understanding of human nature, men in particular.\\"Gianna\\" is laced with spelling errors and an incorrect name of a male opera role.

Years ago, I paid over $200 for my Rotozip and am pretty angry that such a potentially dangerous flaw would find its way into such a widely sold product. Aside from attempting the Loctite fix, I'll probably replace this tool with a Craftsman brand rotorary cutting tool simply because it would seem that brand would make a difference in this case - especially if you plan to use a product for more than a few years.

The Zip-Mate is incredibly handy and does just about anything an angle-grinder can do.My only complaints are with the switch, as mentioned below, and the cost of the accessories.

Then when they changed the ending into something ridiculous, that's when I blew my stack. I have read the book and I've seen other versions, and this is the worst.#1, after almost everybody dies fighting over the treasure, the captain was going to turn the treasure in to the government as contraband? Sure, that's why they risked their lives and fortunes, to end up turning the treasure in to the government! :-p#2, they decided to split it up between them instead, but Jim - who is going home to life of penury, throws it all overboard (what an idiot)!

I didn't even buy it as a period piece, it seemed much more modern. And then they made inexplicable changes to the characters. The doctor is now a really pathetic coward (why?)

Those who study the Freddie Green style of \\"minimalist\\" rhythm guitar playing and wish to emulate his technique are in for a real treat on this album.

It helped me to visualize more clearly what life must have been for those sent into the training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-changing","review":"As with most Rivers books, this one if life-changing. This series is what the Lord used to bring me back to Him after 3 years of trying things my own way--what a gentle Lord He is. I highly recommend this series. The characters are believable, you feel for them, and you get a better sense of how God works in life (even though it is fiction). It will challenge your walk with the Lord, in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rizpah","review":"I can identify so much with Rizpah, that I even named my screename for her. I enjoyed this last of the trilogy. My favorite character has to be Theophilis. His quiet and gentle spirit, and his faith and love, comforted me. He seemed like the kind of grandfather I always wished I'd had. I cant wait for the next book to come out so that I can find out what happens to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book series","review":"This is part of a series by Francine Rivers and I bought it because I love her writing and the subject matter of the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Loved it.

There is no useful information in this book if you are going to be involved in caring for a mare and her foal.This is a nice book for absentee owners who want to talk about their mare and foal at cocktail parties. This is a great book for an 8 year old girl who dreams of having a horse and foal of her own (but who never will). This is not an acceptable book for children who will really be around horses -- the pictures show too many examples unsafe practices."},{"rating":"2","title":"yet another awesome moby live dvd","review":"more of the great stuff following from the previous dvd. the most outstanding track for me was the live rendition of \\"Next to the E\\". note that in my PAL version, there is a music/video sync glitch in PCM stereo 2.0 in the song \\"Feeling so real\\". however dolby digital is flawless. it's a must buy if you are a moby fan, or even slightly interested in his music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby Rocks!","review":"Moby Rocks!

It's not an overnight accompolishment, but it is the next best thing. This book gives clear, precise activities to do with you child on a normal persons schedule.

When I taught 3rd grade astronomy, I looked through all the books I could find on galaxies. I liked the stories and illustrations from My Place in Space by Robin HirstMy Place in Spaceand Galaxies, Galaxies by Gail GibbonsGalaxies, Galaxies!; however, this was the best book with actual photographs. I especially loved the picture that shows the Milky Way and has a tiny dot to show where our sun & solar system is located.

Big type to take up space. Very basic descriptions. I already knew 95% what author wrote. Very disappointed. Will give book to my nephew as birthday present. That way his mom can show him the pictures and read the basic descriptions.At least someone will get enjoyment from it. No real substance to use as a reference book. Good for a 7 or 8 year old only. Even if your a new amateur astronomer you will want more meat and potatoes about Galaxies than this book offers.Save your money on this one. You can find a better book on Galaxies for grownups.

The story revolves around Duncan, a hapless adventurer and Mallory, a machiavellian, vegetarian dragon who is also an outcast. With Mallories 'Guidance' they get into many predicaments that still bring a chuckle today. If you like Asprin's work, his brand of humor abounds here. White's work is remeniscent of Phil Foglio's but retains a zany originality of it's own. If you want to read one of the funniest graphic novels of the early 90's, THIS is the one to get. 10 turnips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Said to be Forster's favorite of his novels not not mine.","review":"The story and the writing seem to be both odd and at times difficult to follow.

It is slow to take shape but eventually it really comes through and is vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Philosophers should enjoy this one. The story is about coming to grips about who you are, expectations and perceptions. This book can be insightful for some, but for me, a little dry. Forster did not foster a logical basis for Rickie to fall in love - or a hopeless romantic one for that matter. From there, the story lost steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social commentary and metaphor","review":"Like all Forster's novels, the plot of 'The Longest Journey' is secondary to the underlying themes - the new 'mechanical' society that Forster hated, being true to yourself and class structure.

It's always great to hear fresh music from Don & Walt. The band sounds tight, the songs are very good and the recording is super. The Last Mall, Blues Beach, Things I Miss The Most and Godwhacker are a very strong lead-off for the album. The hooks thin out a little, but the attitude continues throughout, with Pixeleen sounding like top notch Dan and ending with the intricate title tune. Great solos and a four-star effort! Not the BEST Steely Dan album - (Who can top Aja?)A VERY good Steely Dan album - and better than ANY recent release by anyone else. Everything must go is a fine addition to the Steely Dan legacy. The tour starts in July!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, they're back","review":"Just listened to the new one for the first time. The bar for these guys is too high to proclaim any new release one of their best, and I won't do that here. If you're a Steely Dan fan, though, it's probably high enough praise to tell you that you're not going to be disappointed. It's the same great sound Becker and Fagen have been spoiling us with for years. My first impression is that the second half of the album is a little stronger; the first half seemed a touch familiar at times. I had Kamakiriad flashbacks at a couple of moments. This doesn't mean a lot...after I've listened to the album a couple dozen times, my opinion will start to matter. Bottom line, anyway -- Steely Dan at their most pedestrian is better than anyone else out there. This is another strong addition to the most significant body of music in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great but extremely good","review":"Steely Dan couldn't make a bad tune if they tried and if I was to list all thier great songs here, what would be the point. There's nothing on \\"Everything Must Go\\" to rank alongside \\"Deacon Blues\\" or \\"Do It Again\\" to name 2, but there's also nothing on \\"Everything Must Go\\" that would prompt any Steely Dan Fan to press the jump button. The album is extremely listenable but nothing really stands out which is not such a bad thing as it helps the album contain a consistency that makes it very listenable as a whole.Nobody does easy listening with as much style and skill as Donald and Walter and \\"Everything Must Go\\" is very welcome indeed, keep them coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thougt they missed, again","review":"Got home poped it in, shocked I thought the dynamic duo had finally missed. Played again, can't turn it off. That's the same thing that happened with Against Nature, Kamakiraid, Tracks of Whack, back and back and back. I think I finally figured why this always happens with this duo. Their music is at such a high level, you have to listen to it a couple of times to elevate yourself up to that stratosphere, I guess. That's the best I can come up with to explain this phenomena anyway. Sorry got to go, Gina and Pixeleen are waitng."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece!!","review":"this new dan cd is second to aja.shortly following their grammy winning two against nature, emg is far more interesting than their previous 2an,which some of the songswere just plain uninteresting. in the emg cd this is clearly not the case.in one years time don and walt created this masterpiece,which is clearly in sync with this post sept 11 era,with all of these corporate scandals that have occured in recent times, can be expressed in \\"everything must go\\". they cleverly begin the cd with\\"the last mall\\" apocalyptic,i'll say. the songs in between reflect a backward overview of the times and leading to the finale of everything must go. this is a must have. i highly recommend purcasing emg and adding it to your dan collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reeling in the Years","review":"Is it really 2003 or did I accidently step into a time machine and end up in 1975? \\"Everything Must Go\\" matches the brillance of \\"Pretzel Logic\\" or \\"Katy Lied\\" without the bellbottoms and polyester shirt.Donald and Walter lay down a 42 minute infectious groove just begging you to head to the nearest beach house, open a nice frosty one and slip into the music as you dare your feet to stay still. The lyrics are as biting and cynical as ever. Fagen is in fine voice, and you get a shocking treat--Becker's vocal debut. Nice try by Walter, but you keep thinking Donald would have really nailed this sucker, called Slang of the Ages.Long time Dan fans will call this a deja vu experience...the songs seem to echo long lost riffs. But like the old Lays Potato chip commercials, I dare you to listen to this CD just once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Disc, awesome recording.","review":"The album is great start to finish, the engineering on this audio DVD is the best I have herd het, I play it in DTS 7.1 wow!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is one hell of a funky album from beginning to end.It's different to 'Two against Nature' as it is more organic sounding with a very warm texture to it. The songs hit a groove and stay there, but in a good way, with smooth guitar lines and organ riding over tight drum beats.\\"Godwhacker\\" is a beautifully funky track - \\"things I miss the most\\" is playful and fun.There simply isn't a dud track on the album.The lyrics are sly and soulful.If you like blues based funk with jazzy flourishes, you are more than likey gonna love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Steely Dan's worst music!!!!","review":"Being a fan for many years I always look forward to a new cd from the band, however after just one listen I was very dissapointed. This sounds like leftovers from Two Against Nature,the songs sound about the same and mundane. I've tried listening to it several more times, but just can't get into it.I just recently seen them in Denver,and was glad they only played a couple of songs from this cd. Mostly they dove into Aja,The Royal Scam etc... This cd will be in the dust bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not their best work","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Steely Dan and of Becker and Fagen individually. I have all their albums, and recently picked this one up. The album is not bad, but clearly not up to their previous efforts. I heard nothing on this album that made me want to listen to it again, unlike Two Against Nature, which played nonstop in my CD player at work for hours the day I got it. It's almost like someone else making a poor copy of a Steely Dan album, or perhaps a collection of Steely Dan studio rejects from previous recording sessions. \\"Slang of Ages\\" clearly shows why Fagen should handle the vocals. \\"Green Book\\" has a quirky, repetitious groove that is the best track on the album. Otherwise, the lyrics make for better poetry than music. Definitely at the bottom of my Steely Dan collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part 2, Chapter 2","review":"When you have created perfection in the past, how do you outdo yourself? Well, for one, Steely Dan doesn't seem so obsessed with perfection as they once were. Or do they? Whether they are or not, they still know how to make great original music.This one as well as \\"Two Against Nature\\" take some time to appreciate. The songs are more subtle than their songs were back in the 70's. So give this one a listen. Then listen again and again. Soon this one will grow on you like it did with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight, Funky, and Smooth...maybe too smooth","review":"Being a \\"Dan Fan\\" for many years of course I like this new release. I must admit it takes two-three listenings to get the full feel. These guys are the best when they go \\"dark\\", that is weird strange esoteric lyrics and off tune notes. This album offers up some of that but when Fagen tries to ryhme everything it sounds forced and very commerical...too \\"smooth\\". Keep it dark guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I started listening to SD about 2 years ago. i first the the \\"two against nature\\" album. i then listened to \\"Aja\\" and have been hooked ever since.since then iv tried to get my hands on all the steely dan albums. picked this one up today and have listened to it thrice already! its a notch above \\"two against nature\\" in my opinion. it isnt as good as \\"aja\\" or \\"katy lied\\" but its not possible for SD to come out with an album that doesnt deserve 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time and Steely Dan","review":"For my sixteenth birthday, my parents took me to the last Steely Dan concert. I have been a die-hard Steely Dan fan since I was very small. I love the new album and find it interesting, witty, and new. I think the major differences that Steely Dan fans will see in their newer work is the Jass influence, and less solo songs. Most of the older albums consist of witty solos, which were both intricate and catchy; however, their newer more laid back albums contain less of their hot solo songs. This will disappoint many initial listeners who are expecting a continuation of their older repertoire. Yet, if one is patient, you will find that the music is as slinky and twisted as ever. On the whole, I lover Everything Must Go, and recommend it to any one who is willing to listen for the heart of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to rate continued greatness","review":"It takes all the discretion I can muster to not give this one a 5 star rating. That's only because I don't think these guys can ever match \\"AJA,\\" the best LP of the 70s. But what a joy to buy a cd, put it on and be delighted with the music from the first note to the last. These guys are in a class by themselves and the high standards they set and always meet keep them fresh and innovative without ever losing their signature \\"sound.\\" As far as I'm concerned, they've never made even an average album. As Lawrence Welk would say \\"Thank you, boys-ah.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, pour me another","review":"Simply a wonderful CD. Great musicians, great beat and that good old Steely Dan sound. When two musicians click like this the outcome will always be fantastic. A must have for Steely Dan fans and everyone else who wants to hear what true musicians sound like. Be careful, I went through a whole case of beer before I realized the CD had played through 4 times. A perfect way to spend the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast for the Ears","review":"Nobody sounds like Steely Dan......NOBODY!!! Their latest effort shows some growth, but still maintains that classic Steely Dan sound. They sound very funky and of course jazzy, with a touch of pop thrown in. You have those always present chunky horns and those good Donald Fagen vocals too. First rate production by Becker and Fagen brings the whole thing together. There seems to be different sounds coming from all directions. This album is indeed ear candy. Some interesting song writing too. The best is 'Things I Miss the Most'; where Fagen talks about his divorce, the good and the bad. 'Pixeleen' is another highlight, with some of the prettiest harmonies I've heard in awhile. Credit Fagen's backround singers for a fine job. Steely Dan seems to have caught a second wind since their reincarnation a few years ago; and aren't we glad they did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Killer Masterpeice!!!","review":"Once again, as usual, Steely Dan has blessed us with the privalege to listen to some of the best music available. As good or better than their last album \\"Two Against Nature\\". If you have ever liked anything they do, you'll love this. Over the hill and still managing to put out timeless music from their very soul. This powerhouse band dosen't seem to slow down, and it is not known when they ever will.

Of course \\"new\\" simply means playing the same old boring songs that sound like every other non-hit-single that this band has ever recorded. Truly great bands evolve over time, always creating new sounds and experimenting with different techniques and arrangements (The Beatles, REM, etc.). The stuff on this album sounds like it could fit on any record the band has released over the past 30 years. Maybe change some notes around and add different lyrics, but the songs are basically identical.

I have read reviews describing this material as defecient based upon thier past triumphs. I say this EGO must be based upon it's own merits, because it strengths lie in NOT following old and tried and true formulas. Thank God. Quincy Jones said it best about Miles, \\"He doesn't need to play the same note again, he's played 'em all\\". I'm going out on a limb here for Don and Walter by echoing what Quincy's observations about Miles. The Dan have always created music to their own standards, and thankfully have kept me, as well as others(thankfully) in our own sonic Nirvanah. EMG is full of smoldering grooves(check out Green Room), solid driving 55mph and then suddenly 85mph easy phunk(See Lunch with Gina-*rhythym guitar is chunky as hell, killer synth solo) and beachworthy tunes( Blues Beach ). All the tunes are solid and full on. the Dan lives and breathes again!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs, poor engineering","review":"Sorry, this is not a well engineered album. Listen to Nightfly or Aja or Gaucho. There is some dynamic range. I am surprised SD fell into the modern trap of compressing the hell out of everything until there is no life in it. Chromatic jazz means color, and trying to play the volume wars defeats it.Songs are interesting, not as good as Aja or Nightfly or Royal Scam or Countdown. I'd rate it about equal to Katy Lied.From a huge SD fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars are not enough","review":"once again these guys come up with new musc that shocks me and makes me wonder why other artists dont or cant match what these guys do.. we live in a time where an album that gives you 2 maybe 3 hits is considered a good to great album.

If you have an advanced audio you may question the quality of recording - drum is lacking focus and has wash-away sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gem","review":"As with most Steely Dan albums, this one keeps getting better with every listen. Check out Godwhacker, Pixaleen, Everything Must Go. These are destined to be classic Dan songs just as Almost Gothic, West of Hollywood and Janie Runaway were on Two Against Nature.Buy it and listen to it for a few weeks. I guarantee that you won't be able to get certain songs out of your head. And if you want to give yourself a real treat, check them out on tour this summer. Their live shows are impeccable, just like their albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst yet from Steely Dan, not worthy of the duo","review":"A Dan fan since '72, to me this was a disappointing product. And I say \\"product\\" because it's not much more than elevator music, quickly turned out, with little creativity, the same quasi-disco beat in nearly every cut. It makes Kamakiriad sound like a masterpiece. Reminscient of the decline of Paul McCartney, this one. None of the wonderful, inventive jazz solos of the Steely Dan past on this CD; very little that's even slightly interesting. One has the impression it was put together in about two weeks in Fagen's basement, in preparation for their tour. $... concert tickets to hear THIS? That's insulting, Donald and Walter! Save some money on this one, dear reader--there'll be plenty at bargain basement discount prices on half.com and eBay very soon, if not already."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Are the Things I Miss the Most!","review":"Words of advice.... Do not expect to fairly assess this album with anything less than a handful of listens! Like any detailed and musically intricate recording in the realm of Jazzdom, a patient and appreciative ear is required. This is a culmination of sorts, with echoes of different 'Dan' eras permeating throughout. There are shades of Fagen's \\"Kamakiriad\\" solo wizardry and Hugh McCracken's contribution recalls that laid back \\"Hey Nineteen\\" feel of Steely circa 1980. The wry humour and brilliantly obscure lyricism are further proof that Becker and Fagen have never extinguished their spark of genius nor their wit. One can't help but wonder about the intention of the words which close the album.... \\"We're going out of business.... everything must go\\". Does this signal the swan song of Steely Dan? If this happens to be the case, Fagen and Becker are ending things on a very high note."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor shadow of a Steely Dan album","review":"If this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" album, count me in the hate-it camp. Steely Dan is one of my top 2 or 3 favorite groups; I began listening to their stuff 30 years ago and began playing their songs in jazz and fusion combos 25 years ago. Everything Must Go can't hold a candle to any of their earlier work. With 200+ reviews posted already, you can read plenty of longer discussions of why, so here is the short version: Almost everything about the music -- the vocal melodies, chord progressions, tempos, instrumentation -- has a deathly sameness to it, both across songs and within songs. This is either forgettable background music or, if you work _really hard_ at listening, a professionally crafted platform for still-great lyrics. I don't know why anyone with a Steely Dan collection would play this album rather than any of the earlier ones after the first few listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything Must Go","review":"I'm surprised how many of you loyal fans think this is good stuff. I think the guys didn't wait long enough before coming out with this one. The production and grooves are great of course, but it's pretty much devoid of great hooks and melodic CONTENT in general. And, yes it sounds mean spirited but please, please don't let Walter sing any more tunes! When I want to hear Fagen at his best I'll still pull out Nightfly or Aja, thanks very much. So the bottom line, if you're fan for over 25 years like I am, you'll have to have this in your collection. Just be ready to be kinda disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Number 9, number 9...","review":"I take away stars here not because EMG is BAD but because it says nothing new, even compared with Two Against Nature! I would have been content with a single comprised of the simple, fun, party inducing Blues Beach b/w the dark, jazz-colored Green Book. The rest is old-story all over, modern-Steely-Dan-by-numbers, some tracks even sounding like rejects from older (and I mean older) solo recording writing sessions. But Becker does play good guitar this time out, with some raunchier bite and more taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar Arrangements","review":"In my opinion, this is the weakest of Steely Dan's efforts in the last few releases. These arrangements were so similar to those in Two Against Nature, that I thought they had just put a new name to the same album. I've been a fan since the AJA album and have enjoyed most of their releases. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!!","review":"From the somewhat blasphemous \\"Godwhacker\\" to the hilarious \\"The Last Mall\\" (about a pre-apocalyptic shopping spree), this album represents SD at their best (and from me, that is saying a lot). There are two songs especially that I cannot stop playing over and over again and again (both on the CD and in my mind): \\"Everything Must Go\\", about a failed dot-com company whose employees still have \\"the sky, the moon, good food, the weather, and first-run movies\\" to ease their pain; and \\"Pixeleen\\", about a guy with a mad crush on a cyber-heroine. SD and their music never, ever get old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not the bast.","review":"I'm a big Dan Fan but as good as this is it's not AJA. Also not much texure to the rhythm section. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All","review":"While not as great as their ABC/MCA stuff, this album is actually full of some great tunes. \\"Blues Beach\\" is a strange song that grows on you if you listen to it the right way. Certainly a must have if you going to get everything they ever did, but maybe not for the lighter fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Nature!","review":"\\"Two Against Nature\\" may have snared a Grammy but\\"Everything Must Go\\" captures the true essence of SteelyDan much better. Gone is the lethargy and jazz abstractions(distractions) that characterized \\"Nature\\". \\"Everything\\" revisits the tight, focused, melodicjazz compositions of \\"Aja\\" and \\"Gaucho\\". The middle three songs, ( Godwhacker,Slang of Ages and Green Book) even have a \\"Royal Scam\\" feel to them. It's great funafter 31 years to to hear Becker singlead vocal on a song for the first time. Most melodies arebreezy, upbeat and challenging.

The musicianship is superb, as always, but the tunes are weak, and the percussion, which in the \\"old days\\" with Steve Gadd, Jeff Porcaro, et al had lots of tasty little embellishments, the past two albums have been uninspired and \\"drum machine\\" like."},{"rating":"1","title":"how the mighty have fallen","review":"who is this, air supply? it certainly isn't the steely dan who wrote haitian divorce. they should have stopped with gaucho. this is strictly elevator music, heavy on slick hooks, very short on dan sarcasm. when you juxtapose this ear candy with, say, the royal scam, you've got to wonder what went wrong with these guys. they're even thanking wives in the album acknowledgements...egads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This will just have to grow on me","review":"While this is by far and away the most musically polished and tight Steely Dan album ever.....it's also their least expressive.I keep listening waiting to hear some of those trademark quirky lyrics and hooks that have come to symbolize these guys over the years...and I'm still waiting.Damn It! I knew getting a Grammy was a curse.I'm a die hard fan, and I guess that considering there has never ever been a bad Steely Dan album, the guys are entitled to take a breather from the formula with \\"Everything Must Go\\"Hope it's a short break thoughIn the meanwhile, this one will just have to grow on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks You, Thank You","review":"Finally! - The dynamic Fagan/Becker flame on. This is the CD they should have gotten the 'recognition' Grammy for - not the unlistenable Two Against Nature. (90% of my fellow Grammy members don't bother to listen to the music they vote for.)Stylistically closer to Fagan's 'Nightfly', they both seem back to the squirrely vibe of former glory days. 'Pixeleen' is as good a Dan song as anything they've done. My one caveat, and the reason for 4 and not 5 stars, is the lack of a Larry Carlton or Dean Parks - or Bernard Purdy or Victor Feldman, et.al., adding their memorable and remarkable musicianship. Becker is a fine guitarist and bassist, but the added color of those players made for a far richer sonic pallet on SD's best: Royal Scam, Aja, and Gaucho.Don't hesitate - buy Everything Must Go now. And for the Dan devotees, the DVD is a scream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steely Dan's latest model....","review":"I just wanted to make this one brief, good collection ofnew Steely Dan, yeah similar to their last very good effort.Great Production, strange lyrics as usual, lots to like aboutthis one.

But what were the guys thinking of when they decided to include the additional DVD option (at a price)? Don't expect concert footage or music video.

I hope that this isn't the Dan''s epitaph ...","review":"I sincerely hope that this album isn't Steely Dan's epitaph.I'd pit Aja, Royal Scam and Can't Buy a Thrill against any album, any day.Countdown to Ecstasy & Gaucho have many sublime moments.(Indeed, Third World Man has perhaps the most stirring guitar soloI've ever heard.)Two Against Nature was a refreshing return, tho' not my favorite,and Pretzel Logic ... s'okay (tho' I'll be fine if I never hear Rikki again --right up there with Alanis Morissette & Norah Jones for 'painfully overplayed'contenders.)And I'm always happy to hear FM or Here at the Western World.But Everything Must Go sounds like Fagen & Becker weren't trying & didn't care.Nothing particularly noteworthy lyrically or musically.And nothing that I ever need to hear again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grammy Winner!","review":"My husband has been a fan of Steely Dan for years and has every album...and I can understand why. This is another wonderful album, one you never get tired of listening to. I now love their style of music just as much as my husband. The music is fun to listen to, and you just have to admire their songwriting creativity...to be doing this for so long, and to have an album this fresh, is amazing. We would highly recommend adding this to your collection...it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a DVD-AUDIO!!!","review":"I bought this, thinking it was a dvd-a (dvd-audio), playable in 5.1 surround.While this album DOES come in that format, this particular Amazon product is NOT the one you want, if you're looking for DVD-AUDIO!!

Nice, a bit Kooky perhaps but a good listen. Then a few days ago I picked up \\"Everything must Go\\". Some of the grooves hit the sweet spot and it seems they deliver this one with \\"Panache\\". Every song opens up with a catchy riff or beat or rhythm or all three put togather. Nice, very good. I want more. Thanks Steely Dan for making good music again!The improved sound quality of recordings nowdays show how talented these guys are, their attention to fine detail and ability to knit everything togather stirs something inside ( the need to move to the music). Dynamic, powerful yet subtle at the same time with lots of personality. Highly reccomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock Bottom","review":"I've loved Steely Dan since the early days and was excited about this new release. Unfortunately, they've taken the worst qualities from Two Against Nature and stretched them out for the entire album. TAN had it's moments but suffered from a thin, dry recording mix and mechanical arrangements.It's ironic that a band known for it's high quality recordings would put out an album lacking any bottom end. The highs are crystal clear but the mix is not anchored with any depth from the bass and drums.More importantly, the material on this album lacks the edge that made old Steely Dan so great. Their classic albums always maintained a balance between jazz sophistication and raw rock energy. EMG sounds like easy listening radio music from beginning to end. None of the tunes lodge in the brain for longer than a few minutes. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Light Special","review":"Attention all shoppers!My daughter, who is nineteen will not sit in the car unless this album is playing. Period. She has memorized the lyrics. I have grown sick of it. Yet it is so damn good, that I can't leave it alone.Every songs very well performed, lyrically interesting and musically sophisticated. There isn't a sour note on this thing.Just about every song is about \\"the end\\", \\"bygone days\\" or \\"after the fall\\"; yet cheerful. It's just cool. I can relate to them all. But if Fagan and Walter slurred their speech badly, you would still be left with the best performance in years. If you hate Steely Dan, you should still buy this one and pretend it's someone else or something. Otherwise, you will wind up hating yourself if you head one of these songs. They are better then chocolate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything Must Go - except the band","review":"The only flaw with this album is that Dan fans tend to forget - because of lengthy timeout between albums - that Dan material does NOT provide spontaneous gratification. It requires perseverence.From the opening track, 'The Last Mall', revealing uncharacteristic Fagen animus to the final wistful 'Everything Must Go', an album well worth persevering with. Many Dan fans groaned on advance notice that Becker took lead vocal on a track ('Slang of Ages') but he carries it off well.A good album for the thinking rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Tired Stuff","review":"Nothing new here - self-indulgent cynicism. Have been a Steely Dan fan since 1971. The cuts on this are akin to the excitement experienced with paint drying. This is not the wry East Coast sound that I remember - and good god, enough with the tired soliloquies on ending affairs in some upscale dump in Manhattan. So unhip. I feel so old and out of touch after hearing this. What shines (as it has in every thing this man touches) is Elliot Scheiner's mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crusty, boring release from old-timers still certainly competent","review":"2 1/2One of the Dan's more geriatric adult contemporary grooves, Everything Must Go holds very few genuine musical thrills, though they do manage to squeeze a few inspired passages, mainly revolving around their players soloing or an occasional chorus worthy of merit. I understand many of the groups older fan's may have grown with the band into this smoother, single-friendly sound, but the slick production only ends up magnifying the (relatively) dull songwriting. Fans of the band's jazzy influence will be able to find enough worth considering, but anyone weary of their slicker material on stuff they made even in their heyday may be more then a little depressed with these comeback albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steely Dan? don't think so","review":"This is what happens when musicians think they have nothing left to prove. They show up with nothing to sing and play, only they don't know it. With 40 minutes of tedium these songs could more aptly be named dull jazz grooves #1-9 and this isn't even good jazz. Fagen's vocals sound like he's trying to be a back-up singer. Becker's bass sounds like he plays a few bars and then loops the rest of his part.Somebody should stop these guys using the Steely Dan name. The legacy demands more. Sure, Becker and Fagen claim to have written and arranged all the music during their 70s heyday. Fagen hasn't written a good song since 1982. As the band shrank during the 70s so did the musicmaking. That says a lot about the contributions from the original members of the band. Everything must go? It left a long time ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain good stuff.","review":"'Everything Must Go' is really some good solid Dan work. The tunes are all addictive, growing on you as you listen. It's hard to put my finger on it, but there's something here that Two Against Nature just didn't have for me. The sound just seems more...full. I'll concede that it isn't as dark and slow-paced as some of their older albums, but it has its own flavor that's delcious. The only song I don't really enjoy is 'Slang of Ages' simply because I'm not a fan of Becker's voice. The chorus is still good stuff though.I can't really be poetic about this album, nor can I say it's a \\"Must Have\\". It certainly isn't the best, but it's just another branch of Steely Dan (with Becker singing on a tune and all). I think that if you're a Dan head, you'll enjoy this album.Ok, enough rambling. Give a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quo vadis, Steely Dan?","review":"It was bound to happen - the blandest chord progressions (for Steely Dan standards, at least) & melodies, and grooves so metronomically clinical they sound like out of a Japanese toy factory. Nothing against Walter Brecker's voice (who doesn't appreciate his old \\"Lucky Henry\\"??) - or some toe-tapping rhythms of \\"Hey Nineteen\\"- nature, with one or two catchy bridges or choruses (try \\"Things I miss the most\\") thrown in for good mesure. Yet I can't help feeling this latest rendition equals an elevator soundscape of smooth-jazz proportions which even a two-year old would appreciate in his stroller, not to mention the \\"masses\\" who would more commonly associate the name Steely Dan with that of a motorbike repair shop.Making your living really used to sound so much better, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Girlfriend but far from Mars","review":"Matthew Sweet made his indelible mark on the music world with albums that resonate with Pop, Rock, and a sense of fun. Girlfriend and the aptly titled 100% Fun are two such examples of the musical legacy he has left in his wake. Recent releases have not lived up to such lofty standards but have been decent nonetheless.Kimi Ga Suki, a fan \\"Thank You\\" cd for the devoted SweetHeads in Japan, is a semi-return to form. Fun, energetic, spontaneous...none of the baggage that or writing-by-numbers performances that drag down some other releases. You are not going to find songs that will define the decade for you as some of his earlier work has for me (can't hear Divine Intervention without opening a time-capsule of memories from a distant era gone by) but you will find an enjoyable listen from start to finish. Buy this album. Enjoy this album for what it is...a thank you note from a pretty cool guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"album of 2003","review":"This is hands down the album of the year for me. His last record \\"In Reverse\\" was lush, yet it did not hook me in the first time. I found myself enjoying most of the tracks live. This record hooked me from the first song. He came back to basics, and it's great. Thanks to friend in Japan for making sure I got this record asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lord","review":"I am so glad I spent the money it took to obtain this album. I intended to buy it, listen to it for a while, and sell it again (it's not available in the states and has a high sticker price.)I'm not selling it.It reminded me of the effortless, astonishingly heartwrenching harmonies and messy guitar solos from the Girlfriend and Altered Beast eras. While the production quality is not as high (you kind of have to fill in the potential with your inner ear), I am thrilled with this album. It's simple and expectation-free and I hope Matt makes more records like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Hooky Sweet!","review":"The only reason that I am not giving this 5 stars is the price. I was loath to pay [the money] for an import CD, worried about the quality of the work, and leery of the lack of US-distribution.I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the production, which showcased some of the very best of Matthew's jangly style (track 10), the more somber, bass-note driven melancholia (track 7), and upbeat voice-dubbing (most others!). I am a self-professed Matthew Sweet fan, and if this does not get a US release, it is a crime.By the way, the re-acquaintance of Matthew with Richard Lloyd brings a lot of happiness. The Girlfriend-era band still sounds very, very nice.If Matthew recorded this in one week in his basement, then someone should entomb him in a studio with his band, coming forth only to produce jangly power-pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"34 minues, 49 seconds of pure pop heaven!","review":"This is a very enjoyable disc -- especially for those who might have felt Sweet's last several albums were overly fussy. Basically using the core ensemble he had with \\"Girlfriend,\\" this album is actually closer to \\"100% Fun.\\" Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"This one was well worth the price for me. If you're a Matthew Sweet fan this is very good stuff. I had been wondering what the heck he had been doing for the last three years! The entire affair was recorded in his home, written in one week, and performed with an approximation of his band circa \\"Girlfriend\\". The performances are more raw than on his more recent efforts, likely due to the fact that he did not demo any of the songs prior to recording his master. If he can come up with this much material in a week, I wish he would come out with more albums more often! In the meantime, we have The Thorns to look forward to! A great Valentine to Japan. It's a shame that we won't get this release in North America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music...","review":"Matthew Sweet is a talented artist with a big range from loud guitar chords to ballads. All his music tells a good story but this collection feels more personal some how."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Vintage Matthew Sweet. At first appears uncomplicated, yet after repeated listens, it soaks in and stays with you. He still creates unbelievably catchy tunes. With some, he leaves them just that way. With others, he hides them under a sonic blanket of noisy guitars, drums, bass, and effects. Sometimes I feel like he's almost daring you to stay with him through the noise.Those who do, are rewarded.A Must for any Matthew Sweet fan and a You-Really-Should for any fan of power pop/rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This breaks form for me: the awarding of a single star. The sound quality here is finally that bad: it sounds as though the master tapes did not hold up at all well in the years between their recording and this remastery. I bought this as my introduction to Callas, and it only disappointed deeply. Callas had, as I have come to discover, a lovely voice...this becomes lost in this recording, though. There are both better versions of Anna Bolena, and better introductions to Callas (Opera d'Oro actually has a pretty nice Callas compilation, as does GALA)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you enjoy church history and the relationship and dangers of the Church merging with the State this is a must read.

The only complaint I have about the book is I felt the ending was abrupt and he could have expanded his options with the characters a bit more, but all in all, this book is highly recommended, especially to those of you who work in a medical setting. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"help me I'm sinking","review":"Darn, it felt like it never got off the ground and predictable characters with little or no surprise.

You can skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fertility Problems","review":"I like the main character Laurie and I can empathize with her. I was thrown out of the story repeatedly though because of Dr. Cook's misinformation regarding fertility. Google fertility statistics for 43 year olds to see how improbable it is to conceive at this age without the help of fertility treatments and donor eggs. SPOILER ALERT: Laurie would have thoroughly researched this and concluded at the end to go ahead with some sort of fertility treatments or at least forced a conclusion to the romance one way or the other. Leaving them in a tentative truce re marriage and kids was lame. What's next? Laurie spontaneously conceiving at age 48 in the next book? That book would need to be titled \\"Miracle\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why every book he wrote has to be with a Medicare problem?

This book almost gets your interest, but is just too easy to put down. So if you like a thrilling read, turn to The Innocent by Harlan Coben, and put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the mystery?","review":"[CAUTION--arguably a spoiler in this review] This could have been a really enjoyable book, but instead it was maddening to me. Why would an author title the book \\"Marker\\" and then not expect the readers to figure out from first chapter that the mysterious deaths were because of markers?? This entirely ruined the aura of mystery to me and made the book frustrating to read. And, as if we're not already unable to put one and one together, the author also begins the very first page with a description of the fertilization of the egg of the heroine, and then drags out her \\"revelation\\" to herself and the readers that she...hold on to your hats...is pregnant! Who would have guessed! I don't get it. Why would the author pretend to hold out events in this book as mysteries to be solved when he tells the reader right out front what's going on?Had this not ruined the book for me, it would have gotten 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark it an A+","review":"THE SETUPMedical examiner Lori Montogomery observes the unexplained death of a number of healthy young patients and suspects a serial killer. In a converging storyline, Lori breaks up with fellow medical examiner Jack Stapleton over his inability to commit to the relationship. That's the setup.COMMENTS--contains spoilersThe premise that a for-profit medical company is behind the deaths to reduce costs is implausible--mostly because such savings would be hypothetical and in the distant future. Such a scheme might be plausible if the cost savings was assured and in the immediate future.THE VERDICTThis is one of the best Cook novels. The characters are few, and the \\"good guys\\" are appealing, and well characterized. The plot is fast-paced, captivating, relatively straightforward, albeit predictable. The resolution is satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I've read all of Robin Cook's books and usually enjoy them but this one drug on for FOREVER. I just wanted to get to the end to confirm what I already knew halfway through the book. It seems like he layed out all of the information that would keep you interested pretty early on. The he must have just kept writing and relized 200 pages later that the story had ended some time ago so he writes a lame ending and calls it a day. The most excitement happens in the last 10 pages.

But this last book may turn me away for good.I agree with other reviewers that the book was way too long and it was hard to slug through it to the end. But what bothers me the most was the terrible dialog between the characters. I don't know where he lives but in my 50 years I have never heard people actually talk to each other in such an unrealistic way. I think that even Shakespeare would have thought the dialog to be pretentious and unbelievable.I'm sorry Dr. Cook but I think you need to listen to REAL people converse before you publish your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Not quite sure how so many positive reviews came about for this book. It took me about two weeks to slug through this snooze-fest! With the title called Marker anyone who couldn't figure out that the plot was going to be based on something found in genetics and that somehow insurance companies were going to turn around and use this against us must be asleep at the wheel. How could anyone say this book had any suspense??? I could have easily read Robin Cooks commentary at the end to figure out the entire plot. He basically wrote a 500 page cure for insomniacs.Needless to say this is one author I have officially given up on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this man a real editor","review":"This novel is...unfortunate. It's not just that it has the exact same plot as every second Robin Cook novel that precedes it. It's just that:(1) It's at least 100 pages longer than it needs to be. Arguably 200. I gave up around page 250 and skimmed the rest, encountering no surprises.(2) The dialogue is atrocious.(3) The murder weapon, which is revealed early on to be the same substance that is used to stop hearts in state-sanctioned lethal injections, would in real life have been considered immediately by any medical examiner worth her, um, salt, once she were as convinced as our heroine that things just didn't add up.Cook's concerns are socially relevant, to be sure, but he simply isn't a good enough writer to drive the point home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I remember Robin Cook from the good old days of his early novels. I have to wonder if he even wrote this book! It reads like something a 12 year old child would write; the plot is ridiculous, the characters wooden, cliches are everywhere.

It does that very well, but like the other reviewer, when the lid is closed the light remains ON in a very dim manner. Forgetting to turn the light to the off mode ends up running down batteries very quickly. I think that the motion switch does not entirely disengage when the lid is down causing this problem. I have tried changing positions on the handle and that has not worked. I had hoped that given a little time it would fix itself as these things sometimes do, but no luck. I will have to return it and see if another one works like it should. This is not typical of Weber quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"the fun won't last","review":"All of the above reviews are correct. It is nifty, it iluminates the grill quite well, its a great gadget, etc.BUT I've had mine for eight months now, and by the third month, it started to loose its grip on the handle (because of the heat I guess), so much that it will not hold its own weight and slides so the light will not iluminate the grill anymore.When you close the lid, this thing is supposed to turn itself off automatically, it did that at first, now it stays dimly lit, so everytime I close the lid when grilling I have to turn it off, this kind of ruins the whole auto-shut-off feature.Please note that my grill is always under a roofed terrace and always with the plastic cover when not used.This product is not up to Weber quality standards, not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stepping-Off Point","review":"This book is written for people like me, with a curiosity for the science and history of the cosmos, who went to a crummy school that skimped on science.

Along with the Da Vicci Codes ( Dan Brown), I have read two stupid books lately and also have wasted my time here to warn others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Paradigm Bang!","review":"Simon Singh arranges the historical development of the big bang theory in a superb way drawing in ancient elements such as the Greek philosphers and atronomers right up to the recent data obtained by the COBE satellite. The big bang theory is a very unique one in that it predicts the method by which it can be verified or dismissed. Should the theory be correct then there should remain a residual background radiation and if this weak background radiation can be detected it would surely add indisputable evidence that the universe did indeed originate with one very BIG BANG! The chapters are very easy to read and only include mathematical equations when appropriate. Suprisingly, there is very little citation and referencing of comments and therefore sourcing the original material is not possible.The story of the big bang theory can be used to highlight how science works and develops and indeed how paradigm shifts can occur in science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make the case for the Big Bang","review":"When you get through the hype associated with mainstream physics you are left with trying to find logical support for its most cherished assumptions. Singh does no better than anyone else at propping up the fast fading concept of a big bang. At least 6 different assumptions, none of which can be proven, are needed to establish the existence of a Big Bang. Singh fails miserably in his attempt to find logical support for a Big Bang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating mix of science and astronomical history","review":"Anyone with a speck of interest in science or wonderment about what they see when viewing a starry night sky will thoroughly enjoy this book. Chronologically, it spans the earliest recorded observations and theories about the galactic formation to the present including a lucid lay presentation of the development and \\"proof\\" of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. It is rich with interesting prose with its account of the prominant cosomological and physicist personalities accompanied by wonderful methodologies for explaining complex and abstract ideas and concepts.

I savored every single word. The way the book is written makes it easy to grasp the concepts, which were given an equal amount of thought and consideration. The summaries at the end of each chapter, as well as the tables of comparison, constitute an efficient way of serving the objectivity with which these topics are discussed throughout the book.

The sound is quite good for a live recording. Both artists are at their peak - Corelli does not exhibit too much of the underattack which would later be his undoing. Nilsson is freer and more brilliant than in either of her two studio recordings. An added plus is the Liu\` of Galina Vishnevskaya in her La Scala debut season sounding youthful and poignant (get a load of the crowd's reaction after \\"Signore ascolta\\"). Gianandrea Gavazzeni brings out all the nuances of this fascinating score. The balance of the cast is made up of La Scala stalwarts of that era (Zaccaria, Ercolani). The one drawback for me is the chorus which sounds a bit shrill - particularly the upper voices. Whether this is a result of the recording process or not, it still is not enough to detract from a truly exciting performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love Italian opera!","review":"Call me a little old-fashioned, but nothing says romance than an Italian opera playing in the background as you indulge in fettuccine Alfredo and a glass of fine wine.

This role was her debut at La Scala and we can just hear from the reaction of the audience what kind of impression this incredible woman created. There are not too many recordings of her awesome true spinto voice currently available, look for \\"Eugeny Onegin,\\" \\"Boris Godunov\\", and \\"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.\\" Of course, the rest of the cast is great, if not too loud at times, but get it for Galina and only for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punctured Preconceptions","review":"... Dan McGuire, drawing on a lifetime of study and research, in conjunction with scholars from other religions, finds that Christianity and other faith traditions have many strands of thought expressed over the centuries. The common thread is a passion for the givenness of our human life, and the sacred dimension of making critical decisions affecting reproduction. McGuire and the other writers survey the less well-known attitudes in the historic faiths and suggest that that univocal opposition to planned pregnancy is in sore need of review. He offers cogent, yet powerful reasons for doing more research. The book will be welcomed by all who want more open discussion, including Catholics for Free Choice who want freer dialogue in their religious communities about options for men and women regarding their fertility. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"important, beautifully written book","review":"White Coat Wisdom: Extraordinary doctors talk about what they do, how they got there and why medicine is so much more than a jobTheologian Dan Maguire is such a fine writer.

As a long-time student of the world's religions, I found the way this book was crafted to be very disappointing. Instead of going forward into the 21st Century with a more universal perspective that is \\"beyond pro-life vs pro-choice,\\" the reader is dragged back into the collective carnal mind of 20th Century feminist-ethicists and theologians.

Apparently the author Deborah Crombie found a subject, Glastonbury, which she found fascinating and around which she attempted to construct her story. However, automatic writing from a centuries-dead monk and visions of musical chants are a bit far-fetched. I will grant that the legends and myths of Glastonbury are an interesting subject, but Ms. Crombie's attempt to incorporate them into a mystery to be solved by Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James just didn't work.

Having really enjoyed it, I borrowed this book from my will be mother in law after spotting it on one of her shelves and was pretty disappointed with it. There is very little story in the 600 pages of this book and what is there isn't worth making it all the way to the end for.

Some deserve no star and just a comment...unfortunately this book is one of these.Don't get me wrong, I am a Noraholic, but this book is dreadful.It is obvious this was written at the beginning of her career.

For this book, it took me 3 days to read the first story. The plot is shallow, the characters were stereotyped to the point of being unbelievable. I'm still trying to read the last story of Leilah but I keep falling asleep. The book contains 3 stories and the first 2 ended abruptly. There wasn't a good flow from the characters as they appeared in the first story to the second story.

You have to buy more books.Second of all, the first two of the three romances are neanderthal type. These \\"romantic\\" male leads manhandle these women. In one instance it is definitely physical abuse, but the author wants us to think it is romantic??? If a man decked me the last thing I would do get moony-eyed and think it was erotic. This is sick romance, and I can't believe any woman would enjoy this. Violence against women is NOT OKAY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hidden Hanks treasure","review":"A 1986 film featuring pre-Academy award winner Tom Hanks. A young American pilot falls in love with a Jewish Spanish girl in Israel and there frequnt partings get in the way of love as much as her family. Hanks' character is the son of a Protestant minister while the girl's family are devout Jews who fled Spain 400 years earlier but preserved the language over the centuries. It is beautifully filmed, much like A Walk in the Clouds, and brings a touching rendition of love in a time of war in an ancient city."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Classics","review":"This is an underated film that presents itself in understated way. It is a quiet movie that constantly moves you although you don't realize it. I takes you through the lives of the two main characters as they become helpless to the love they share.It is an accurate portrayal of a families involvement, and a young womans ties to tradition and that of her own heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"I love it.

He wants to date her and does not understand the strict mores which rule her life and forbid such a relationship. The subject is delicately and deftly handled with a young Tom Hanks as the soldier."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie great price","review":"enjoyed this movie and found it to consider family values and traditions.

The wheels are great it and over rough surfaces with ease. The problem lies in the design - the wheel wells are too big and inhibit you from raising your arms over your head.

Talked to the owner. Absolutely disgusting how he will not stand behind his product to fix the problem. Problem is the head and neck rest is molded in a 3 dimensonal logo out of some very hard product. Feels like a bunch of rocks under your head or neck. Seems company is more interested in a logo headrest instead of comfort for the customer that has to work with it. I would never ever do business with this company again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and mean","review":"I recieved this book as a gift. I read it and immediately threw it out. It is a horribly misleading book that should not be sold at all. It states that rats will not come when called by name or that will not bond to you. Tell this to my 12 rats that do exactly that. The author knows NOTHING about rat temperament. Other statements about what you can teach your rats are just plain wrong. The trifling details that are given about rat care are not enough to fill a thimble. Any current ir prospective owner should get Debbie Ducommun's books, Rat health Care, and Rats for Today's Pet Owner (this is available here). Debbie is the \\"rat lady\\" and her books should be considered rat owners bibles.Just because a book is written by a vet does not mean it should be taken at face value. I give this book no stars because it deserves none. (no stars was not a valid choice, so I am telling you)"},{"rating":"1","title":"misinformation","review":"This book said that multiple rats would fight and did not recommend getting more than one. I thought that this was a really incorrect recommendation, rats are social animals. Unless a person can spend alot of time with a rat I feel that it is cruel to only have one and there are alot of rat lovers that agree with me. I have 5 male rats at one point, they got along really well. At one point some of them did start to fight, I tried natural remedies-which can definately work in some cases-but they continued to fight so I had the trouble makers nuetured and then everyone got along great! If you have rats that fight check out rat web pages for solutions, alittle bit of bickering is to be expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is very, very good. I don't think there are two guitars on any of these tracks. These are great if not perfect interpretations. There is no egotism showing in this playing, it's very true to the music. And there is no effort to be speedfreaks on some of the fast passages (ie. Etude Nos. 1 & 2) like some classical guitarists strive for. Nothing is too slow (ie. Yepes) or too fast. Very relaxing. The recording itself is very good, the sound is forward without any hollow areas. The bass and the trebles sound great. I usually don't like 2-guitar music which is why I first avoided this CD but I haven't found any duet music on this CD. 2-guitar music to me sometimes gets to sound like mosquitos jumping all over the neck and it all starts to sound like Brazilian music than anything else. This is better than Fabio Zanon's, Timo Korhonen 's or Narciso Yepes' recordings. This is the best I have heard from the Assad Duo. Get this CD, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated...","review":"There were several other well written reviews so I will keep this brief.First of all if you read nothing else in this review...stay away from this book!I have never read such a weak and unprofessionally written story. Spell check cannot stand in for an editor. The plot is weak and the characters are paper thin. The story is hard to follow becuase the sentance structure is so bad.So you know, I love zombie movies/books and based on experience I have pretty low expectations. There are so many well written zombie novels out there this one can be missed.Instead try some of the following (not in any order): \\"The Rising\\" by Keene (not great but not terrible), \\"Reign of the Dead\\" by Len Barnhart (not bad, the story is a little weak), and finally \\"The Dead\\" by Mark Rogers (One of the best zombie books out there).Before You say I am being overly harsh, I paid $20 for this piece of garbage. By reading this book I EARNED the right to be critical."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT MY MONEY BACK","review":"This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read.

You're gonna need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was embarrassed for this man","review":"I love zombie stories don't get me wrong. I read alot of fanfic and truly do understand a work of love as opposed to writing to make a living. HOWEVER; this book would turn a zombie's stomach. It is that awful. I'm embarrassed for him. I actually read some of the paragraphs out loud to my husband to see if it is actually as BAD as it looks to me as I read it. It almost seems like a bad joke but it isn't. DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THIS BOOK. You'll be disappointed and god forbid we give any encouragement to this man. AND who the hell told him that the author picture on the back was cool? Jeez. Could you look anymore like an idiot? AND is that a nudie calendar behind him? I bet he lives in his mom's basement. This is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so at best...","review":"The first thing you need to understand is that this is an IBOOK -self published. It shows!While the IDEA is sound, it goes downhill fast. The writing is a mishmash of ideas borrowed from Romero films, Return Of The Living Dead, and oddly, the bible. The story is woven together in a reasonable way...more or less...and the author doesn't skimp on the gore or perversion (Touching on necrophilia and pedophilia in places) but gore alone doesn't save this one.I wouldn't buy this one mainly because of the godawful spelling problems and syntax errors. - They make it a painfull read. Still if you must have anything zombie this could add to a collection if only for completion.

Not good, although there were some good ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to give it one star just to post this review","review":"This book is A-W-F-U-L!!! I have only just started it (first few chapters), but the spelling & grammar (word placement?) is so bad, I feel like I am trying to read a foreign language!The author claims his ideas are original, but almost everything has been taken from a combination of zombie movies or video games.I think he spent most of his money on the cover art, when he should have spent it on an editor.... Shoot, he could have probably even found a high school English teacher somewhere to proofread his book for free, if he could not afford an editor!Very poorly written & a pure rip-off.....Do not waste your money on this book, unless your idea of fun is trying to figure out what he heck he is saying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How in God's name did this guy get published?","review":"This book is unreadable. Yes, I read the reviews, and I still wanted to take a chance on it because, hey, what the hell, it's zombies, and how badly can you f@*& up a story about zombies, right? I will agree with several of the other reviewers and say that he does present some good ideas, but, man oh man does he need an editor. I really would love to finish this book, and if the author ever considers having it professionally edited and re-released, I just might give it a try. In the meantime, I'll stick with Mark Hunter's The Dead, The Books of All Flesh series, and Skipp & Spectors Books of the Dead series. Sorry, Darrin, I really do share your passion, but you need to stop smoking that crap before you sit down in front of your word processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Quite Work for Me","review":"This book didn't quite float my bar of soap. But there a lot of subjective reasons for that.1. I've never read Godwin's fiction, so I have no connection to her as author or a person.2. I found it difficult to relate to her lifestyle and personal problems.3. I was hoping for more writing-related tidbits, instead of Godwin's social life.The tidbits I did find were interesting and encouraging, as comisserative comparison between authors often is.

Never gets too dull or boring, at least to these ears.Docked a star however, for no information on when this recording was made or any release information. It almost sounds pasted together with perhaps some recordings done at different times or locations.Overall, though, a good listening experience to those who like virtuoso bluegrass guitar and banjo duets.For those investigating Arthur Smith, pick up this one and the B.A.C.M. release titled \\"Arthur \\"Guitar Boogie\\" Smith With the Crackerjacks\\" and that is about all you need for a starter of Arthur Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, finish poor","review":"Had this kettle for almost two years.

Boy George - real name George O'Dowd - approaches heteronormity, trans-issues and childhood memories all with his distinctly witty and confessional lyrics with, surprisingly, a very acoustic ambiance to the sound of \\"You Can Never B2 Straight.\\" The album is a definite grower, however, and some tracks stick out from the first listening like the latin-flavored \\"She Was Never He\\"and the sorrowful \\"Letter To A School Friend.\\" This album will probably be forgotten considering the market - but if so, it will be one of the most underrated albums of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE BOY GEORGE but NOT THIS CD !","review":"It's simple, I'm an avid fan of BOY GEORGE (solo) and CULTURE CLUB but unfortunately truly do not like this CD at all ~ !The production sounds muddy and the overall concept of this CD sounds tired and rushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"George knows to ruin a good career","review":"I've been a fan of George's for 20 years now. I was 9 when it all strated. I can say I'm a hardcore fan in a way. This is actually the 1st time in 20 years that a CD by Georgina has really disappointed me. It IS NOT a new CD (only a few songs) but a plain compilation with a Gay thematic. George clearly lacks inspiration and time for his music (Nightclubbing and DJ mixing are exhausting, aren't they George ?!). It's kinda funny to hear George on 'Wrong' saying 'How did it all go so wrong, it was nothing like this on the magazines...'Well, i might have an answer : wasting time, energy and talent in DJ mixing, forgetting fans and your style ! Don't buy this CD, choose 'Cheapness and Beauty ' or 'Don't mind if I do' instead if you really want good stuff.

Not only is the film tough to watch, Passport has added the words \\"Reaching for the Moon\\" in the right-hand conner of the frame which appears throughout the running time of the film. The viewer knows the title of the film. It's an annoyance for 72 minutes. Lastly, there are no chapter stops on the DVD. So if you stop the DVD prior to the movie's conclusion and your DVD player doesn't remember the location as mine doesn't, you must watch the whole film again or scan through the movie to the section you last watched. Also annoying. The only good thing going for this DVD is the price, the chance to see some incredible art deco sets, and Fairbanks in his first talkie, if you can manage to wade through the fuzzy, low contrast image."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR THE HANDY MAN","review":"THIS IS GREAT FOR THE HANDY MAN.

With only a small mounting area, they hold a fair size table very steady & support a ton of weight. A great base for a planting table, shooter's bench, etc. Not cheap, but super duty, good locking latch, and are shaped to fold nearly flat on each other so you don't need to take their thickness into account when you mount them.

Like a Rolling Stone is especially amazing with Corky Laing handling vocals. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"Yes I was pleasantly surprised by this CD. I was hesitant at first in purchasing it because I wasn't a very big Dylan fan only really liking a few songs he did but knowing Leslie West's style I thought well what the hell and take the chance. There are some songs on this CD done by Dylan I didn't care much for but love the way Mountain does them. Leslie's chord structures and leads do Dylan's music justice I think with the Mountain touch. I hope Bob Dylan takes a listen and appreciates what is done here.Also nice to see Kenny Aronson plays bass on a couple tunes. I met Kenny back when he was with a band called Dust and then again later when he did some shows with Leslie after the Leslie West Band album was released.Ritchie Scarlet and Corky do a fine job too. This CD is well worth the cost and the time to listen for sure. You know Leslie is what 62 I think and he still cranks.

What's going on here ? Mystic Fire was at least an attempt at something original and interesting. Looking back I think things started to unravel with the untimely death of Felix Pappalardi. I think he was a big loss both professionally and personally to the band's spirit and creativity. Although there were some real glimpses of hope in West, Bruce and Laing, it's just not the same caliber of band anymore. I have been a fan since 1969 and this latest offering is just disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"great cd it's a cover CD but worth the money great renditions of Dylan songs.

But, where are all the other wonderful, colorful characters I have come to know from all previous books?

Thats right, Eve, roarke, Peabody, and the rest, go all over the world to ask people about paper! Then, the killer is a dead giveaway.

Even considering how quickly they must be written, this is the first one that I thought felt rushed. It wasn't shorter than the others, but it just didn't feel like your typical Eve Dallas story.I felt like there was very little in depth character interaction. The premise was a good one, but I even thought the villian could have been more interesting, considering that premise.I'm still giving this a four, because I did enjoy reading it, but compared to the last book in the series, that I thought was among the best, if not The best, this one was a bit of a let down.

I thought the character development of Eve still proceeds at its usual rate. She learns more about her mother in this one. Peabody is developed more in this story. The interaction between Roarke and Eve is solid and sexy as usual. As with another reviewer, I like that Eve's compassion for the living is highlighted with the victim as well as her compassion for the dead. I liked the scene between Eve and the coroner. Where is there \\"lack of character development\\"? I enjoy the small nuances as well as the deep ones. This book is full of those wonderful small nuances... loved the family BBQ at Mira's. Other Death books are more exciting, but I look forward to seeing how all the characters keep growing in Ms. Roberts' books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I know the title for the review sounds kind of lame, but I'll explain.

And I always finish reading books, no matter how bad. (Not that it's bad.)

I thought she tried too hard and it fell flat. The characters too cliche. The main character especially was portrayed as a combination of tough as nails police chief who's seen the worst of it by day and sexaholic wife at night (who at their age has sex 3 or 4 times back to back in one night, I'd like to know)- which just didn't fit at all. I found it conflicting. And the descriptions of the violence is just a little too detailed in a perverse fixated way. Not so much. Sorry.

That short fall damaged the bar beyond repair. The front grid bent in several places and due to the extremely soft nature of the material, I was unable to reshape it adequately enough to refit it to the bar.

Instead, I may have simply gotten a defective unit but I am not ordering another as a replacement to find out. The highly reflective metallic front doesn't show in the stock photo but does show in customer photos and mine was slightly warped. Be careful, the face by be easily scratched by metal.The biggest issue was that knives did not hold with the same force along the entire magnet. I got stronger holds toward the middle while there was an area on the left half that actually repulsed the knife (I don't know know how this is assembled, it's almost like two of the same magnet ends (North or South) were put together in that area). Removing and replacing them made the other 5 knives slip just a little bit each time. I bought the Chicago Cutlery ones a couple of years ago and will stick with that. If anyone had any idea what was wrong with the knife bar, please add! Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good product, if you use cheap knives.","review":"This knife rack is not for the serious cooks with good equipment. The knives rest directly in the metal and every time you put your knife on this rack, if you are not careful, you can damage your knives. If you are just a regular, cook at home person with walmart knives, this is perfect.As far as the construction, I can't complain much. It's unuasally heavy and hard to mount. The mounting hardware is very cheap. Also found it very hard to level out due to the weight and garbage hardware.Again I say if you are the run of the mill at home cook, this will do the job for you. If you are serious about cooking, DO NOT buy this. Spend the extra money and get something that won't ruin your beloved knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I have two of these mounted vertically to my backsplash so they'll hold the knives horizontally. Glued to the tile with silicone glue. Absolutely no problems. Except I have one knife from China that isn't magnetic enough to hold its own weight horizontally. It sticks but slips. Not the strip's fault, and I just put it above a stickier knife that holds it up. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic knife holder","review":"Very strong magnets to hold the knives.

When we got this home, my wife installed it in like 5 or 10 minutes, and we were able to put our 9 piece Wustoff Trident knife set on it with no problems and room to spare.This one was perfect the space we had available in our kitchen, Though you would probabaly not pick this one, if you have limited wall space to attach this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"The item I received was clearly used. The box was not sealed (the item box, not the shipping box) and the Styrofoam was damaged. The reflective face was dented in several places and was warped on one end. One side of the holder was nicked/pitted and looked like knives had already been used, at least several times.Aside from the fact that it looks used, I am also not pleased with the product itself. Within the gaps between the reflective face and the edge I can see what looks like adhesive sticking out. The reflective finish shows fingerprints with the lightest touch. The bar should mount using 4 screws instead of just two on either side in the middle.I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews, but I am certainly not satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one complaint","review":"My only complaint with this product is there is no rubber rim around the magnet.There is a raised lip around the border, and if this were rubberized, it would get 10 stars.I feel like the metal on metal (while providing a nice satisfying sound and feel) is not good for my knives, and degrades over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIU Magnetic Knife Bar","review":"This MIU Stanless Steel Magnetic Knife bar is very well made and easily holds my heavy knives safely. It was easy to install on my ceramic wall and looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"very secure yet items easily removed","review":"Strong enough to hold my 10-inch cast iron skillet without sliding but can easily be removed by mastering a twisting motion that doesn't require great strength - by far the best I've seen. I know, it's for knives, but I want you to know how strong it is, and yes, these racks are great for keeping other tools handy. The downside, however, is that it itself weighs nearly 4 pounds and needs to be solidly mounted - my husband says the best is to the studs rather than just the wallboard. The complaint is that the mounting brackets are spaced at a non-standard 19 inches. My other complaint is that I was expecting a 24-inch magnetic strip. In reality, the magnetic part is closer to 18 1/2 than 19 inches and the overall length is 20 inches. Also, the attractive stainless steel shows fingerprints and scratch marks, so be realistic about your own expectations. I've tested other racks that are strong enough to securely hold knives, but don't have these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This came with no directions, and while most people could hang this without thinking, it was a bit confusing.

I usually like Adrien Brody in some of his movies, but this film left me a little distressed with him. Attracted to a creature that resembled a child with child like curious behaviors, was perverted. Even his character struggled with his feelings toward her, but eventually gave in. He and his fellow female actor did not have much of a connection to me. This picture left me disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Mutant Love!...","review":"Two geneticists, played by Adrien Brody (OXYGEN, THE JACKET) and Sarah Polly (DAWN OF THE DEAD, NO SUCH THING), develop a female, human / animal hybrid. They name her DREN (yep, NERD backwards). DREN seems OK at first, but this is a horror film after all, so, unbelievable terror awaits! The idea of \\"Don't play god\\" (aka: \\"Don't mess around w/ nature\\") is older than this or any movie. SPLICE is a modern take on this theme, w/ the scientists facing the ethical / moral dilemma of their creation, as well as it's lethal potential. DREN is a well-realized, FX creature, and has several surprises in store. SPLICE does have it's silly moments (the dance lesson!), but makes up for this w/ originality.

I was looking forward to this one: a smart, well written 'adult' screenplay; thoughtful, intelligent story; some good sci-fi tension; a few scares perhaps; and terrific acting by (at least) Adrien Brody. Unfortunately, not one of the above panned out. The story had so many silly holes and turns that it became somewhat embarassing (for the writers and director). The ending was simply ridiculous. There were so many 'eye-rolling' 'how could they've been so stupid' scenes throughout, that I developed a mild headache. I won't go into any of the lame scenes and thin turns I'm referring to.

What starts out very promising as great Sci-Fi rapidly devolves into a inter-species rape fest (whether statutory or actual). Too bad because the film had possibilities.

It would have been nice to learn more about these characters and it would have helped to have a better writer as well.

I am by no means a movie snob, but I do like those movies that fly under the radar, and aren't big, ridiculously expensive, blockbusters. Like this one did. I also like movies that take a formulaic idea, and do something original with it. And, finally, I like movies that are entertaining, and hold your attention. And this movie certainly was. I liked how it went where most movies would back off. You'll know what I'm talking about, once you watch it. And, how could you not like a movie with Adrien Brody in it? He is so likable, as is his character in this movie, that you want to root for him, even when he crosses some serious moral boundaries.I would recommend this for people who are into sci-fi, horror, psychological suspense, and human drama. This movie's got it all. Definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"The kangaroo cockroach girl???

The plot meandered all over the place and obviously there was little or no research into the science of biotechnology to support it. The film rushed through as quickly as it could with no real point to make except the same warning that was given to Victor Frankenstein with a bizarre sexual twist.. I don't see how this film created such a stir or that it even got produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly stupid....(SPOILERS)!","review":"This movie had an interesting premise. A creature created by manipulating genes and who appears to be invincible and extremely adaptive. We can forgive standard violence we've come to expect and the questions of morality that have been discarded. We can even forgive questionable science.But somewhere this movie leaps into the absurd and disgusting. I feel the need to warn you before you get caught off guard as I did. I mentioned that I wanted to see this movie to several people who had seen the movie previously and I would have appreciated a warning.SPOILER...the Thing seduces its father (not biological) and rapes its genetic mother....YUCK! and the mother gets pregnant! Really, it went there!!!!It's like some extremist individual's argument against genetic engineering and research. It's going to kill our men and rape our women.Good luck!

Yes a real horror classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splice was two hours lost that I will never get back","review":"I do not understand it!! This movie received rave reviews. Even Roger Ebert, a critic against this type of genre, gave this movie high marks. With much convincing, I brought my girlfriend to see it. The movie's premise was interesting, but the movie was dull, annoying and the actors were very one dimensional. Cardboard cut outs will do a better acting job. I wish I had my money back, when this movie was over. The ending stinks. It left you hanging, so you have to probably endure another two hours of dread and boredom with a sequel in the near future. Oh boy!! Can't wait to cross that movie off my list to see, when it comes down the pike. Very disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding!","review":"The movie was ok until zoophilia takes place. Then after that you either conclude that you have serious mental problems or your press the stop button. Luckily I did the latter. The weird creature was on big signs everywhere in LA.

The Brody and Polley characters are also a couple when they go home from the lab.When a conflict with a sponsoring company bans some of their research, they continue, but hide their work. In fact, they take their work home with them. Big mistake.Driven by their dangerous curiosity, a fast growing mutant, humanoid-like creature, Dren, is the result of their secret experiments. Of course things get out of hand.This promising film goes off the rails and loses whatever theme it set out to explore.Too bad, there are lots of relevant issues here that resonate with daily headlines about the morality of harvesting embryonic cells. Also, I thought the creature was not consistent in its appearance.I think we were supposed to feel sympathy if not affection for Dren, but that never really came across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailer Is Misleading, Film Disappointing","review":"From the trailers I thought this might be a decent sci-fi movie, but I was horribly disappointed. There were a couple of interesting aspects, like (spoiler alert) having the female turning to male. Obviously we know this can happen in the womb, all babies start as female, but having it happen so much later in the development of the creature was a decent concept. But really, (spoiler alert) when Adrien Brody ends up doing the creature I thought, \\"Geez, filmmakers do men a horrible injustice when they show that apparently they cannot control their _ _ _ _ _ at all.\\" One reviewer wrote that the creature was HOT. Well that's definitely a personal opinion, but the creature was also a FREAK, emotionally and somewhat physically! There are also some scenes that are extremely disturbing. Bottom line, not for the weak of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"Short and sweet folks, dont bother watching or buying this tragic \\"sci-fi\\" farce.

Man, it wasn't even worth the price I paid! In fact, I couldn't finish it! There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie. Splice plays out more like a poorly-written science fiction drama. The acting was only average at best. Some of the cinematography was fairly well done, but the over all plot killed it.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone that I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, debasing, demoralizing","review":"Sick, they should just rename it \\"Sick\\".

This movie was not worth the effort of even putting it in the DVD player.The story line was lame. The boyfriend's going along blindly with his crazy ass girlfriend was lame.

The female and male lead roles were very...hmmmmmm...annoying. Stupid, actually. Both characters behaved so improbably for scientists that I had a difficult time not stopping the movie. Once started, I had to see where they took this story, so I only fast-forwarded periodically after the halfway point. The last few minutes were actually the best since both characters then began to behave as real people would behave.

Two scientists decide they can splice human and animal DNA to create a genetically perfect being. This being would naturally produce cures to many diseases and could change the world. The whole time I was waiting for this thing to go crazy and kill everyone, but it doesn't quite happen that way. First, the scientists treat it like a pet, than a baby, than they have sex with it... Oh no, I'm not joking! This film is disgusting! ...and how come everything these scientists make looks like a big penis?

Both \\"Splice\\" and \\"Go\\" are without a doubt films that you can watch over and over again. I highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it yet. Please do not be fooled by the low ratings.

Natually, being that the average mind is now brain-washed to think of all this as being the norm, I disagree. Although I'm a Christian man, I have always been a fan of horror movies as long as there done with at least a little good sence or taste. This discusting film left a bad taste in my mouth.

There are rare glimmers of wit and comedy (in the naming of the other mutant \\"children\\"; in the film noir performance of the French billionaire fundress) - but nothing ever comes of it.

I'm stunned that two talented actors like Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were in this dog of a movie. I love great science fiction and I'm willing to suspend a fair amount of disbelief to enjoy a nice film, but that simply wasn't possible in this case. The movie is silly and implausible from beginning to end and revolves around two brilliant scientists who make infinitely stupid, unethical decisions - one after the other.

But for me the most problematic was the acting and the dialog.Here are two supposedly intelligent people creating life, but at no point in the movie did you ever find that plausible. The dialog was something you'd get out of grade school, and the actions taken by the two main characters was just ridiculous. Not even just what they did to create the creature, but afterwards, it just was too implausible. I don't mind suspending belief for a good fantasy or sci fi movie, but the characters have to at least be something you can connect with. The female lead just acted like a spoiled brat the entire movie, a complete distraction. There seems to be no cohesive flow from one set of actions to another, no believable justifications for their actions and decisions.The only performance that wasn't a distraction was that of the creature they created.

To clean it, you undo the few parts that it has and put it in the dishwasher, which is great. But, the main housing has a black plastic part that fits over the zig-zag blade and has to be in place for the chopping to work. Well, I can no longer get that black part to fit over the blades. I tried for about 10 minutes tonight and finally threw the damn thing in the garbage. So frustrating. Either the blades bent or the plastic thing changed shape a bit - it has to fit the zig-zag of the blades just perfectly in order to work. I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"it did work fine for a couple of weeks but then....","review":"The handle you depress to push down the chopping mechanism is built in two parts.

Got here in 4 days and I ordered this from Fun Squared. Second the gum I got was not the one in the picture, it was the one that had the Wild Cherry wrapper. The gum is not that durable because if for example someone pulls it and jolts back and drops the gum you have like a 50/50 chance it will still work. I got 2 and that happened so i only have one. Overall this is a pretty decent product but it doesnt look the realistic so people would think twice before pulling it. If you want it to look better buy a pack of gum the size of the gum that comes in like 5 pieces and switch the wrapper for better results. And you also can replace the battery (mine came with a AAA)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I believe this product is dangerous. My son bought it.

It limps along from one poorly staged scene to another until Leonard apparently ran out of cliches. It should have been played for straight comedy since there are so many unintentional laughs in it. Charles Bronson was strictly a supporting character actor and when he stepped into leading roles he simply didn't have enough depth to put himself across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Majestyk","review":"Love Bronson's laid back style and tolerance against injustice, but will only take so much before letting rip.

I have been using these tablets before breakfast and dinner, and again before I go to bed. The taste is OK, chocolate with a hint of coconut, but they don't seen to be helping me.

When I received the two bottles I thought they looked smaller, and sure enough - the bottles are quite a bit smaller than previously purchased ones. I decided to open one to see the tablets themselves and they are quite a lot smaller than before. No further discount, just sneaky business by the manufacturer. I hate stuff like this. Do they think the buyers are morons? I'll find something else to use for my stomach.

There is really nothing new,different,exciting...anything that would recommend one waste a moment watching it. The character designs are about average at best and even if they ran around bare bean and buck naked (there is zero fan service)there would have to be SOMETHING else catch and hold one's attention.

Do not let the bad reviews put you off.This title teaches you some of the essentials of writing; showing vs telling and how to describe through narration and dialogue. If you are new to writing and you want a book full of a diverse range of examples and some simple tips to get you on the way, you can't go wrong here.Obviously, if you want to really master the skills that this serves as a foundation for, you are going to have to move up to the next level after reading this and find information more specific to your chosen genre.But, as a starting place, a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Basic","review":"There are some solid tips and helpful exercises in this book designed to help you write readable descriptions and settings. I think, however, like any book on writing, you get out as much as you put in. In other words, you've got to practice as you read.I did find a lot of the helpful hints repetitive (in that I've read them in other books), but I guess good advice gets repeated.

(The other is the book on revising your novel, which includes maybe two or three chapter that actually address revision.)What was the author thinking? The text winds around and contradicts itself, the exercises are just plain stupid, we learn far more than we need to about the author himself, and although he gives us far too many of his own examples of descriptions, he fails to tell us how to write our own. I actually have a headache from reading the book.I also have a gripe with the author's choice of \\"good\\" and \\"better\\" words. He's so freshman-English cliche, I expected him to give me an example like, \\"The yellow waves puked and giggled beneath the angry purple purile sky.\\"Avoid this one. There are books out there that actually explain how to write successful description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money.","review":"In this book you will learn what you should do but precious little about how to do it. I took two things away from this book. One, you should use good description. And two, use a journal to write down your sensory observations. The rest of the book's content range from the superficial to the obvious to the questionable. This is the first writing book I've read that extolled the virtues of using adverbs as a writing tool. This from a book on description.Any writers out there looking for a good book on creating the words for good fiction should look to Monica Wood's \\"Description\\". It's one of the best books on writing, period, that I have yet read. 5 stars for that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy thought mars this effort","review":"The other volumes in this series have all been excellent, but careless editing and some wooden writing weaken this book's advice. Spelling errors (Wurthering Heights, racquet for racket) and weak prose (Rozelle likes to split infinitives with adverbs) weaken credibility, and some of the advice is questionable. Rozelle favors using adverbs to clarify prose instead of finding strong verbs and specific nouns. He also tends to use older books for examples, many at least 15-20 years old. This is especially true when he discusses genre fiction in superficial terms. Some of the book is irrelevant, too, discussing characterization without relating it to setting or description. I'd suggest Monica Wood's book on Description instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest link.","review":"Although this volume is part of the excellent \\"Write Great Fiction\\" series, it's really for those who wish to write mediocre fiction. Grab the other volumes (Characters, Emotion and Viewpoint; Plot and Structure), but skip this one. It's riddled with spelling mistakes, inaccurate quotes and is downright self-contradictory. On top of it all, the suggestions are, at times, poor and there seem to be sections drawn from high-school english lessons just to fill space. It's a struggle to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one goes to the trash can ...","review":"Sorry. I hate to pile on, but I must agree with Lit Teacher on this one. The thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. I bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until I could get around to it. I pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes.Boy was I disappointed. I thought maybe I was having a bad day. Maybe my concentration was off. So I pulled out Truman Capote. Smooth as silk. So it wasn't my fault. It was Ron's. I finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was really nothing new here, nothing interesting.I wish I had not wasted the money. I must be more careful. But, as for this book, there is nothing I need to refer to later, so I'm putting it in the trash. It is Saturday evening. They will come on Monday to take it and the other garbage away.Roger"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I recently purchased this item for my daughter who has been wanting to paint. I thought this would be great because the paint is in the brush and it won't be messy. Although all this is true, both of us found it very frustrating that it was difficult to get out of the tube. If this is made for children, shouldn't it be easier to use and should an adult really have trouble with it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"one time use","review":"My 3 year old and I played with this toy today. The paint is in the brush, but it is very difficult to squeeze it out. I ended up squeezing big globs out for my child to spread. She enjoyed it once we used that method. I at first wondered why it only came with 3 pieces of paper, but we found out shortly that we only needed 2. We made 2 paintings, and we drained all 3 brushes dry doing so. It was a 10 dollar one-use-only toy. Maybe we'll use the paper for another color wonder product. My advice is to buy some good washable paints and real brushes. It'll be a better experience for you and your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neon Rules!","review":"\\"Our signs tell us who we are.\\" That's they key point of Tama Starr and Edward Hayman's wonderfully evocative book, \\"Signs and Wonders.\\" This account of the animated super-signs called spectaculars, whose principal habitat was Times Square, is both compelling history and personal narrative-Starr's company is largely responsible for the Square's landmark signs. Thus readers gain original, first-hand information on the creation of such memorable displays as the \\"smoking\\" Camel sign as well as the most enlightening exploration yet of signs as cultural and technological markers. (One lesson learned is that the great handmade neon signs have been totally usurped by prefab vinyl and LED displays--making neon an ever-hotter cultural item.) Photo-illustrated, the book is the best and most comprehensive work on its fascinating subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving dribble !","review":"What a disappointment ! This book goes to show that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. The glitzy, superficial cover accurately warns of the trifling and shallow literary contents awaiting the reader. Ms. Starr would do well to gather her family's 100 + years worth of photographs and compile a coffee table book on the history of Artkraft Strauss rather than pretend she can write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively and Fascinating!","review":"I had no idea until I read this book how much signs mirror American history and imagination.

Accurate manual - or automatic - focus while using the ring light is just about impossible in anything other than absolutely calm conditions - a situation seldom encountered.

Granted I do not really like short story collections--although I had more success with a previous book of short stories picked for my book club. I tried jumping around this book to find something I liked, but it didn't work. The lead characters seemed somewhat interchangable, and I had trouble telling one story that I had begun and not finished from another one that I couldnt stick with. I couldn't stick with a story for more than 2-3 pages. But, that's just me. Give me a novel, or better yet, some non-fiction book of interest any day.

Once you read your first Alice Munro you will be addicted.

I think its great that they portray girls that dont all look \\"butch\\" or \\"femme\\". Awesome that Showtime shows you that your co-worker or neighbor can be gay and you would never be able to place a label on her because she doesnt have short hair or constantly sport a rainbow item giving herself away. For those of you who are complaining that they \\"should have more butch and femme like me\\" come on...the show wouldnt be as interesting. I love their styles, and the storylines dont lack anything.

It's pornography pure and simple, a commercial attempt to main-stream porn by making it look PC. The plot is meaningless, the dialogue ridiculous. The whole point of the series is to show nude women having sex in front of the camera. I'll bet the actors aren't even lesbians. I only watched three episodes of this sexist crap. Enough is enough.Those who think this series will aid lesbians in their quest for equal rights are kidding themselves. \\"The L Word\\" is part of the same context as obviously sexist serials such as \\"Deadwood\\".

I learned that most lesbians are rich white chicks who live in California. They are all extremely good-looking too, but they don't like men in general (unless the men themselves happen to be gay). I also learned that the term \\"dyke\\" is not offensive so long as the term is used among friends.I am glad that this show really broke up the stereotypes that I had as far as homosexual women goes. So the next time that I meet a rich, attractive, white woman from California, I'll know that she is probably gay.I hope this review helped.(P.S.

The writers are absolutely brilliant. The characters are so well developed and the storyline keeps you breathless. Imagine how talented these actresses are if they can make you believe that they are 100% lesbian, and in real life, they may not be. I did wish, however, that the DVD would have more of the extras that we've grown accustomed to. Perhaps some interviews, bloopers, \\"back stage passes\\"... All in all, I am a die-hard fan and it takes quite a bit to impress me like this. Most people think this is about a bunch of lesbians \\"getting it on\\", but it is so much deeper than that.

This show is like a lesbian soap opera, except the writing is so much BETTER! The L Word showcases some very common things in life that lesbians encounter. There's a tough, but caring woman who tries to use her crotch instead of her heart, there's a basket case who calls herself bisexual (we all know she's a lez!) There's a loving couple who want their own family, there's a closet case, a wisecracking bisexual, and other interesting characters who bring it all alive. The comedy and gay terminology along with the sizzling sexuality make this the show to be watching. The show also includes a few misplaced guys from time to time, but as in real life, their stay is brief and they leave nothing memorable. My wife and I have seen all of the episodes and we encourage YOU to see it. Hope you love it as much as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, yes, yes","review":"I just watched the entire first season in 24 hours! This is an incredible show!

So much so that I came back today to buy more copies to send to friends and family to introduce them to this fabulous guitarist. This is an amazing show, with top notch musicians. Eric Czar on bass is particularly good. Although I understand that this is an old line up for the band.I'm going to see Joe play live for the first time next month, and I can't wait.

I've been an avid collector of his work ever since. Just purchased this DVD yesterday and, on first viewing the picture and sound looks fine. My fav songs, \\"New Day...\\" and the Blind Faith number \\"Had to Cry Today\\" rock big time. it is gratifying to see younger players take up the flame of this fine tradition of playing.

My problem is with whoever engineered this DVD. There is too much zooming in & out ,weird camera angles .Repeated pans to the back of the venue where all you can see is the bald spots on many of the crowds heads. Then when he zooms in on to the band , it is on Joes face for long solo shots . Mate the guitar is played with his hands & if I was at the concert thats where I would be looking . It should be simple It's a live concert , pretend your eyes are the camera ,If you come up with whats on this dvd you have to be on drugs . I want to see & hear the band not a lot of wanking with camera tricks ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Show!","review":"I had never heard of this guy until the other night on Sirius sat I heard Had to Cry Today, a Blind Faith song originally. The cover Joe did of this song blew me away. It is a great concert, well recorded, video great. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've heard","review":"I've been lucky enough to see Joe B several times here in northern Virginia. The venues have been small where Joe has a real connection to the audience. I do hope he still can play the smaller places but after the new Royal Albert Hall DVD he probably won't be able to play the smaller clubs anymore. Such a shame he and his group are such likeable guys and do take the time to talk and sign autographs after their shows.Buy this and all Joe's CDs and DVDs. This guy is the greatest thing to happen to the electric guitar since Jimi Hendrix. You will not believe how well this guy can play."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real guitar hero","review":"As a guitar player,I'm always trying to find people who can still play like the guitar greats of the past.This guy is one of them.He has a wonderful tone and a lot of feel.He's versatile and has a soulful voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Bonamasso Live Dvd","review":"This dvd is great , especially for the newcomers to the talent and diversity of Joe Bonamasso. I highly recommend this for all the lovers of the blues and just great guitarists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio is outstanding, but you have to have a DTS decoder","review":"Based on the complaints about the lack of surround sound, I almost passed on this DVD. I'm glad I didn't. There is a DTS soundtrack. That stands for Digital Theater Sound, and it is not the same as AC3 (Dolby digital 5.1). Your DVD and Amp must be able to read and decode DTS for it to work. Most newer ones do, though I've got a 5 year old amp that does, too.That out of the way, this performance is great. I've seen Joe and the band in person twice (and keep checking his tour schedule hoping he'll get close), and this DVD captures the raw power of his voice and the sheer brilliance of his playing. I saw none of the \\"tension\\" between Joe and Eric that one reviewer found distracting, though I hate that he and the drummer have left.So get this DVD. It'll probably be the last of the original lineup."},{"rating":"2","title":"My JB collection is now complete!","review":"I just bought a brazilian edition of this DVD. Not only I completed my collection of JB's videos but also got a chance to watch and listen to another bunch of great guitar solos and amazing musicianship from this guy, who will certainly become (maybe he already is) a legendary guitar player in the near future. Yes, some other reviewers pointed out some minor flaws, like too many camera shots and awful camera angles, but they didn't bother me at all. This is Joe, alive and kicking, young and on fire. For guitar lovers and JB's fans, this DVD is a must. The reason why I didn't give it five stars? \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" and \\"Beacon Theatre\\" DVD's are even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a mind bending waste of time","review":"This early movie is I guess some sort or artsie nonsence, as it has absolutly no story line, and at times it's not only weird, but plain psyco, with some occasional downright disturbing footage. I suppose there is a sort of barely discernable romantic theme, but it's not unlike a Dali concept as far as that is concerned.One can't help but scratch ones head after watching this movie, and wonder what the heck you were just wasting an hour on. The only reason I give it a single star is simply because of the age and it's place in French History, whatever that might be. No doubt people at the time would have been hard pressed to even give it one star.This is one bizzarre movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Archtypal Surrealism","review":"There is a history of important art creating strong outrage when debuting in Paris. Coletrane and Dolphy earned derision, and Stravinsky's Rites of Spring generated general unrest. The screening of L'Age D'Or engendered direct assaults on the theatre and even rioting on the street.Bunuel was a self-cenfessed atheist (though much of his body of work examined the spiritual) and there are many images in this film that mock church heiarchy. However, these blows seem more a humorous critique of the authority of beauracracy, that match well a total effort to turn the constraints of societal norms on its ear.It's doubtful that some 70 years after the fact that viewing this movies will induce riotous outrage. But the dreamy, surprizing images continue to amuse and stimulate an out-of-the-box viewpoint. Not as jarring as the Andelusian Dog, it is perhaps the stronger of the two and absolutely requisite viewing for Bunuel afficianados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun music accesssory","review":"I bought several of these for a project my daughter was doing on Flamenco dancing, so her fellow students could try them out and keep beat with the music (this was an elementary school project).

More like an \\"Afterschool Special\\" directed by a mad genius (Anno) from a story by another mad genius (Murakami). Alhough sometimes a tad preachy, the final shot of the girls walking through the open sewer at the end, their legs ever so slowly becoming submerged in the muck (accompanied by an inane J-pop ending theme) is pretty unforgettable. Worth watching for fans of subversive cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anno Hideki at his most severe","review":"Dont get me wrong, this was a great movie. between the mad low res camera, and the disgusting sexual situations, it suceeds in what it sets out to do: Disgust you. For at least two hours after I watched it I felt literally sick to my stomach, and even now I find it hard to to sleep as I think about it. It was similar to the feelings I got from watching the end of evangelion, however this was more powerfull, and felt less like a glimpse into anno's mind, and more like a plunge into darkness"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Seems","review":"I enjoy learning about history and thought this book would be a good way to test the things I've learned and maybe learn some new stuff. However, this book is a very bad example of a history test. All the questions are multiple choice with almost no explanations for the answers. So forget about learning any new stuff with this book. Also I noticed a typo (or maybe just an incorrect answer to a question). The question was to put Henry VIII's wifes in order from the 1st one he married to the last. This book has Henry marrying Anne of Cleves before Jane Seymore, which obviously is incorrect. This error made me wonder whether there were other incorrect answers in this book.

No one ever returned my call. I had to go and buy a new mask for the costume. I had to safety pin the cape. I did receive an email from CostumeHub wanting me to give them a good review on Amazon. I told them that I was not happy with my CostumeHub experience. They wanted to know what my issues were. I sent them an email detailing my problems and I have yet to hear back..that was 2 weeks ago.

Yeah it's sturdy, and when it works it is cool, but I am disappointed with how inconsistent it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improvement","review":"First off let me say that this products picture shows an optional swing bracket for the unit. A hard black piece is included so that you can mount it flat. Second, if you have a cord that is thicker like a 12/3 then you will have problems. Me and my buddy spent some time trying to get the wheel to grab the cord effectively. I had the cord straight out and clean and still the wheel did not grab. We had to hold the cable down on the wheel at the top to help wind the cable into the basket. If I hadn't taken so long to finally put this item up then I would be sending this back.

It was just a basic craft colored cardboard box - not somehting you would pick up at the store to give as a gift. The first time the gift recipient looked at it he thought it was one of those small basketball hoops.

But after I went out and bought a 100' #12 cord, the cost became considerable. While working - wrestling - with the cord to try to get it fed into the winder, it became apparent the two were not compatible. Maybe someone, somewhere, has been successful in creating the combination but, after quite a while, I put my brand-new cord on a reel and installed an old #16 cord on the winder. The installation of a cord onto the winder requires carefully twisting and straightening the cord prior to cranking it in. Hence, no time saved at all. The unit does not grip the cord if there is the slightest resistance and if you happen to be in a damp environment it is necessary to completely wipe the cord dry before you have any chance of reeling it in. Good idea - needs design work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father's Day Gift","review":"I bought this for my dad for Father's Day. He loves it.

Do NOT cut the pizza on the sheet because you'll gouge and dent the surface -- but seriously you won't need to because the finished pizza will slide right off onto a proper cutting board or platter. Use non-scratch scrubber sponges to clean. Do all these, and I've a feeling this sheet will last for years.One other minor suggestion is to let it dry vertically, so that any wash-water that may have gotten between the two layers can fully drain out.I'd say the only negative about the Airbake Ultra is it is HUGE, and there's a chance it won't fit in smaller ovens.

I first listened to it when my roomate in the Netherlands, Arnaud, a Frenchman who did well with the ladies, introduced it to me. He had a ton of CD's I had never heard before but this one stuck out. I dont know where they are from but the beats are solid. Good music for those of you that dabble in rap and techno... but are still heavily grounded in good rock. Perfect driving music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never buy another one.","review":"Bought several of these light a couple years ago and they STILL WORK!!! Unlike regular tripods which break and need constant bulb replacement, these things last. The one time cost will more than pay for the 10 tripod lights you would need to replace over the length of any project. Not only the replacement cost but the cost to replace the bulbs or fix regular tripods make this light a great deal. I highly recommend trying one and am sure you will want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the cost","review":"This light is very durable. It seems to have been designed around protection for the bulb. On construction sites it is common for things to get banged up. This light won't fall through the floor joists in an open attic and throws light in all directions. It really doesn't get hot to the touch so there is no need to let it cool off before putting it away. The receptacle on the base is a nice added feature. I don't know what a replacement bulb costs and I don't know how long it is expected to last but mine has gotten smacked a few times and works fine. The only thing I don't think will hold up is the handle. It is plastic and seems a little flimsy. Mine has not cracked or broken but seems like the weakest part of the light. I would buy another one if I needed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I purchased this item fo my Nephew, he loves it!

Beard takes famous poems and changes them to fit the cat perspective, making a poem that is often and well done as the original famous piece. Not only is this a gem for poetry lovers and fans of satire, but it is also great for cat-lovers: this book speaks well and truly about these wonderful animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have seen the best cats of my generation...","review":"Fantastic, one of my favorite cat books. Every time I pick it up, I change my mind about what the best poem is.I actually remember lines from these poems sometimes, in circumstances where less happily placed people would recall lines from the originalpoems !By the way, 'Beowulf' is about the least wonderful, perhaps because the original was of no interest to me; too bad that that is the one Amazon used as the excerpt.I've read some of these as \\"friendly email\\" forwards, with no attribution. Folks, always use accurate attributions; People like Henry Barber (the 'editor' of these works) deserve to make a living out of what they produce. :-)Also by the way, 'French for Cats' by Henri B. The little furfaces gather when I practice the French phases in it. Tell me French is not the natural language of cats! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite poetry book","review":"I love poetry and I love cats. This book gives me the opportunity to enjoy both.

I just can't describe it on words. Trust me, this is an amazing album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD EVER","review":"30 Seconds to Mars' debut self-titled album is truly one of a kind. The alternative rock band gets their point across in every song through Jared Leto's rock-star voice and almost even poetic lyrics. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes alternative music - the musicianship on this album is awesome. If I could, I would give it a million stars... :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your hands are simply useless, unless this cd is in them!!!","review":"Ahh 30 Seconds To Mars. I first heard about these guys at an Incubus show, because they opened up for them. I only got to hear 2 songs, due to me and my friends' lack of punctuality. The 2 songs I did hear though, were great, and that spurred me to check them out online whenever I got back to a computer.What I discovered was amazing. Not only did I discover a lot of cool things, I also discovered that actor Jared Leto, was their lead singer. Now you and I both know, that the norm for bands with actors in them, is to suck trememdously. Well not here my friend, no sir. I was blown away by how good Jared's voice is. He is by far at the top of the heap of bad actor's who crossed over to music.This cd is a sort of space rock show, that will keep you on the edge of your seat, with interesting lyrics and musical depth. I would highly suggest getting this cd. In fact, your hands are simply useless, unless this cd is in them!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Much props to Jared and Shannon Leto for putting together a great album. 30STM is original, innovative, and talented. Even if you are not a fan of the genre, you will still enjoy this music. My picks from the album: Capricorn, Fallen, Oblivion, Welcome to the Universe, and The Mission. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cds i've ever heard","review":"All in all, the debut cd to the band 30 seconds to mars is one of the best cds that have come out in recent past. With driving beats, insightful lyrics, its a fresh new sound in the pop sound that much of rock has taken on. This is truly the one cd you should get if you buy just one this year (but who would do that??). The songs Buddah for Mary, The Mission, Welcome to the Universe and Capricorn (the first single off the cd) truly stand out, but the whole cd is a true musical success. 30 seconds to mars is a must have cd for anyone who likes music."},{"rating":"1","title":"$ Millions into recording, NOTHING INTO TALENT","review":"These guys are amazing on recording. Songs like 93 Million Miles, Echelon, and Capricorn are amazing, but if you saw there last tour, your wouldn't be buying this album: You'd be buying recording time with their producer because he can work MIRACLES!

When I heard the guy had his own band I figured I'd check it out. Overall I was very dissapointed, not being able to find even one song I really liked on this cd. While it's not flat out horrible, it's pretty much a waste of money if you consider yourself a rock fan. Its kind of an Alt. Rock Industrial who knows what...which wouldn't be so bad if the songs had some hooks or the slightest hint of being catchy; but these songs are mostly all boring filler at best. If you like the samples then more power to ya but I definitely reccomend giving it a listen before you buy or you might be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Damn Good...","review":"Just got this a few days ago after hearing the Capricorn single and have to say I am more than happy with the results of the rest of the album. The sound of this band is fresh and interesting and provides a nice counterpoint to all the lackluster Neo-garage rock that has surfaced lately. At least this band is concerned with(and it is an important concern)creating, new and interesting music that will continue to evolve the art form. This is a nice hybrid of heavy rock, electronic atmospherics and emotive song writing. A damn good start, this band certainly shows promise. Who knew Jared Leto was so damn talented?? I took a chance buying this, because so often these days you buy an album based on the strength of a single and you wind up getting burned, but thankfully this album is satisfying and worth a spin. Check it out, also would recommend the new Queen of the Stone Age Cd too, it rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal...","review":"Once you begin to listen to this CD, you immediately get sucked right into it. Something about it just draws you deep into the core of the melodies, the lyrics, everything. It literally sent shivers down my spine and made my mouth drop in fascination. Each song is unique and leaves you with a different feeling. It's ethereal, yet driving at the same time. One of the most fascinating songs on the album is \\"Echelon\\", a five-minute long composition (it's too involved to just call a 'song') that mezmerizes you. This band is phenomenal! It's great to hear something original and so in-depth as this album. If you like music that you can delve into and really LISTEN to, this album will keep your attention for months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I've fallen in love with this band. For those hesitating to buy it, you won't be disappointed. The band is great, the lyrics are great, everything is great.My favs on the album are Edge of the Earth, Fallen, Buddha for Mary, The Mission and Echelon. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If an album could be a god, this is it","review":"Well. I bought the 30 Seconds To Mars album thinking it would be cool. What i got was a storming 11 track master piece. This is something a bit more inteligent, a bit more rock, a bit above the rest. There is nothing bad about this album. It features great rock tracks like 'Capricorn' to tracks like 'The Mission' which just make u wana jump about, to great, more chilled tracks like 'Echelon' A fantastic album that will no dout grab u and keep u lock in it's power for a long, long, long time. A very highly recomended album for anyone who likes music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I would have missed this one if it had not been for Win MX! I found this CD in a search and tried it. Wow is all I can say. This CD has not left my machine. I have been listening to it over and over. Even more, I had no idea that it was headed by an actor, Jared Leto. (Not even familar with his work as an actor.) I think he found a new job here.Spacey rock is what 30 Secs. To Mars is about. It seems like a trippy, spaced out concept album about the furture and living on Mars. The songs are brilliant lyrically and musically. The music goes right through your body and sends shivers through you. All I can say is that this is one of the most impressive CD's I have heard this year.I bought this gem and reccomend you do too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool revisited","review":"At first glance, one would think '30 Seconds To Mars' is just another Hollywood actors flamboyant dream of being a rock star. Russell Crowe has tried it before, as has Keanu Reeves. Both failed. Yet Jared Leto obviously has had the right inspiration and perception, along with his cohorts, to make a quite elegant and soaring rock LP. With clear linkage to futuristic themes, '30 Seconds...' has infused long drawn guitar riffs with blinding 'Tool'esque vocals, creating almost epic climaxes. Not bad for a first effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I'll be the first to admit, when I heard the beginning of Capricorn on my tv one day I was like \\"what the heck is this?!\\" and continued to scowl and whathaveyou. After the song finished, however, I almost immediately went to download it. Can't. Get. Enough. Of. This. Band. Jared Leto, I have to say, has an incredible voice; something you really don't expect from actor-turned-musicians nowadays. It's shocking.This is a cd you have to sit down and listen to though, at least the first time. I was completely entranced and could do nothing else but listen. The combination of Leto's vocals and that beautiful spacy guitar sound is hypnotic... in a good way. Once this band has got you, you're gone for good. A+++++++++++."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martian Bliss","review":"From the chart-climbing \\"Capricorn\\" to the sizzling \\"Buddha for Mary\\", from the heart-pounding \\"Oblivion\\" to the crowd-thrilling \\"End of the Beginning\\", this CD is a non-stop mix of everything you could possibly look for in an incredible debut CD. Turn the bass up high. Turn the lights down low. Now sit back and immerse yourself in the experience that is 30 Seconds to Mars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great new band!!","review":"This has got to be the best album I have listened to in a long time. 30 Seconds to Mars has an extremely unique sound.

I highly recommend picking up a copy if you're sick of all the disposable ... music out there...come on, you know you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD","review":"i bought this CD after hearing 30 Seconds to Mars in concert 6 months ago, and they don't disappoint. The band puts on an excellent live show, and captures their energy very well. The songs are well written, the music was artfully crafted, and the finished product will have you humming the songs after your first listen, and you'll want to listen to the CD as much as you can so you can learn the lyrics, and learn more about the band. All in all, and amazing CD, and a very good buy. Well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things are changing.. can you feel it?","review":"In a clear display of originality and incredible artistry, this new band forges ahead and creates one of the most beautiful and unique albums yet recorded. Standing out in sharp contrast to the monotony of contemporary rock music, this CD features not one but eleven astounding songs with an encompassing, out-of-this world sound. You may have heard their single, \\"Capricorn,\\" which gives you a bit of a taste as to just what this band is all about. 30 Seconds to Mars created a stir among critics months before this album was even released, and they have already acquired an extremely dedicated fan base. Both of these are for good reason, for rarely do I find a band with such a capacity to create amazing, intelligent music. The face of music itself is changing, so be a part of it. This band will no doubt have tremendous impact on rock music.

Jared Leto (the dude with Corn Rows in 'Panic Room') and co. mix a beautiful sound of synthesisers and metal. Then they add the twist of space metaphores (which probably sounds odd, but it's great). Although the term \\"Welcome to the Universe\\" is a bit over used, 30 seconds to mars is my new favorite band and have the best album of 2002 (along with Breaking Benjamin's 'Saturate'). ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too shabby","review":"usually I don't go for the whole, I'm an actor I an sing too, deal. but Leto pulls it off rather well. I enjoy 30 secs. because unlike Deadsy (a totally \\"bad\\" band) these guys aren't trying to shock and devour others. Deadsy is just a band for the Korn people. I like Korn, but i am annoyed by deadsy.Give 30 secs a chance. You won't be disapponited."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLAWLESS","review":"The only word i can use to describe this album is AMAZING. I have never seen or heard a band with such talent, intellegence, and melody. If you do not have this C.D. you must pick it up a.s.a.p. This C.D. seems to Capture your emotions and open your mind as well as deliver pulsating guitar riffs, perfect vocals, melody, and UNDESCRIBEABLE drum playing. This album makes every individual who listens to it become part of something special, and that should always be known and remembered as a Flawless album filled with AMAZING talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Seconds To Mars - New Heights","review":"It's not very often that an album comes by that grabs your attention like 30 SECONDS TO MARS does. From the soaring riffs of their first hit \\"Capricorn,\\" and into the depths of \\"Oblivion,\\" 30 SECONDS TO MARS is an achievement of sonic complexity.Blending their own futuristic brand of techno with searing guitars and soaring vocals, Jared Leto and brother Shannon have offered a break to the monotony of standard pop-punk and aggro-rock.This album is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it.","review":"I'm listening to this album right now as I am typing this review.

It was just the type of music I wanted to listen to, and the songs all fit together great. It just works. I actually found a sampler CD from about 3 years ago with them on it that I had liked, but forgotten about.There were some comments about the band's live show. I missed many earlier shows, but when I did see them, I thought they were fine. The sound was a little off, but more to technical problems than anything that the band was doing wrong. Maybe they had some bad nights, maybe this was a better night, or maybe they have just improved with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"For the amount of songs included, the book lacks recent quality songs.

I was actualy so shocked by the lousiness of this album that I threw it away. Seriously.

Although this album was released in 1997 when DTS was fairly new, it still manages to have captured all of the qualities that DTS is famous for. Most of the songs have some kind of DTS 'trick', such as a fighter plane flying through the speakers or the sounds of a forest 'clicking and chirping' away before and during an acoustic song (\\"Blue Blue Sky\\"). The bass is not overpowering on this set, but the range and dynamics of the sound separation are wonderful and the mood is serene throughout. This album was made intentionally for DTS, unlike the newer albums that are recoded, which makes for a fantastic experience. If you have the DTS system, there are not too many choices (yet) of famous albums, but ones I can recommend are, \\"Moody Blues; Days of Future Passes\\", \\"Eric Clapton; 461 Ocean Blvd\\" and any film or rock concert after 2000 that was recording in DTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Air","review":"On Air is a wonderful CD.

Its a pretty good book, but if you are looking for a really, really good book from Christopher Hyde, you should read \\"The House of Special Purpose\\". It has the same main character (Jane) and a better main male character then the Second Assassin. Overall, this is a good book and a good read, with pretty good characters and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally....","review":"....Finally there is the remastered version of this great album!For all the fans of Kraftwerk and electronic music in general a MUST HAVE Album!!!If you are interested in electronic music from Germany in general, check outDolomiti Super Chill: Late Summer 2009. It is a chillout compilation series with great chill potential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabby!!!!","review":"I began listening because my older brother had the album. I weas completely amazed at the complexity of the album. Now I no longer find my musical tastes from my brother and this specific album is an earthshaker. It is complex with visions of synth harmony that go beyond its' own time and really leaves the rotten time it was recorded in far behind in the dust.. This is a must have for anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic Puberty","review":"On Man Machine, Kraftwerk evolved, which is sad, necessary, and in a way, exhilirating. They became self-aware (compare this disc with the purist dweeb charm of Radioactivity), but they seemed to handle it allright. MM has punch in its' bottom and ranges from quite chunky to almost chill. Never too much, never too little. Very Satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"It went with me thrue a lot ...","review":"I use to be a professional break dancer , this was my favorite disk for background ( I was working in \\" life robot \\" technique).Than in early 90th , I had to drive all over the country : LA - Interstate 40 - loud Kraftwerk and huge jar of coffee - a little over 2 days - Hello , DC ! This was fun ! I love this album !"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The One.","review":"Trans-Europe Expree might be the most 'influential' 70s Kraftwerk album(mostly because of 'Planet Rock' using samples from the title track) but Man Machine is their best one. It's got the strongest melodies of any of their albums and these, allied to the wonderful electronic sounds make it an absolute classic. 'Robots' and 'The Model' get the most attention but for me the best track is 'Spacelab', it's got an eerie atmosphere and like Giorgio Moroder's 'I Feel Love' is a prototype for modern day Trance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"A great album. It's so good that you'll find that it ends too soon. Kraftwerk at it's best (along with Trans Europe Express). Don't hesitate to buy it. It won't dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Techno","review":"I believe that Kraftwerk were and are the best techno group. They were one of the first and you can tell by the lack of hip-hop influence in their music.This album is excellent. You must hear the song \\"Spacelab\\". A must buy for Kraftwerk and techno fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aw, I really hoped I'd like this one.","review":"I'm afraid that any Kraftwerk record I hear after Radio-Activity is going to be a disappointment. This basically sounds like Computer World and Trans Europe Express; it has that cold, angular sound the group is known for. As is made obvious by the album and song titles, that's the entire point... they aimed well and hit the mark. But if you're looking for some classic electronic music that actually has warmth and soul, Kraftwerk's 1975 album Radio-Activity is the one you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"People's New Testament Commentary","review":"This book is so comprehensive, that it boggles the mind. So many of my reference books have short snippets of information, but this one is overflowing with all matters of source material along with clear understanding of their interpretation.Fred Craddock and M Eugene Boring have knocked this one out of the park."},{"rating":"2","title":"The People's New Testament Commentary","review":"This book is very interesting. The writers have obviously done a lot of research to translate scripture to their understanding. Some of their opinions differ from other commentaries that I have. This would be expected. If everyone interpreted the Bible the same we wouldn't need so many different denominations. As I study with my group, we'll include discussion of the opinions in this book, we'll see how well I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water Stops Coming Out","review":"I brought my 2 mice home today and when they started using the sipper bottle, I noticed them struggling with it a bit. So I tapped on the sipper tip a few times with my finger and no water was coming out. I kept doing it, and still no water came out. I noticed that a bubble had formed inside just above the tube and was not floating to the top, not allowing any water to go down the tube. I had to flick it a bit to get the bubble out, but as soon as they started using it again another bubble would form no water would come out.I've now had to place a small dish of water inside their cage to keep them hydrated. This is very frustrating and its starting to look like I'll have to buy another sipper bottle, hopefully one that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Doesn't hold much water... but you can tell that by the description.

I enjoyed the three I have read so far. I will read more titles from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Plotted and Enjoyable","review":"I used to read Peter Robinson novels years ago, then for some reason stopped. I read this one when it came out, and I enjoyed it very much. Everything in the novel is well-paced and well-plotted, the characters are interesting, and there's a certain feeling of descending doom that I enjoyed, mainly because the characters were not stupid, as doomed characters often are. I'll definitely continue to read books by Peter Robinson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Book","review":"Strange Affair by Peter Robinson is the first Inspector Banks novel I've read, and I'm glad to find another mystery series I can follow. In this book, Inspector Banks is searching for his brother who, after leaving a strange message on Banks' answering machine, disappears. Banks initiates a search for his brother, while at the same time, is embroiled in an investigation of the strange murder of a young woman, who is found dead in her car by the side of the road.Banks is single-minded in his pursuit of the truth about what happened to his brother, and Robinson paints him as a somewhat solitary figure who really doesn't understand how his dedication to solving crimes alienates him from other people.I think people who enjoy Elizabeth George's novels would probably like this book. It did leave me with a vaguely unsettled feeling- perhaps because all the personal issues were not neatly wrapped up and tied with a nice little bow, but it was a page turner none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have seen film and pictures of this Creature but this D.V.D is trying to make the Chupacabra into something from another world which it is not.The time given to it is only 23 minutes and is very badly presented.Do yourself a favor and buy the Lost Tapes it is much cheaper and deals in fact, this film does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets be honest:","review":"The authors of this book lived in a white world and write that way. There appears to be much information about how the US government felt and acted in the relation to the Sioux but little on how those acts were precieved by the Sioux. According to this book every act by the US was done to help the Sioux. Stealing their land and stealing their food is glossed over. Depriving them of their culture is presented as a way to help them. I noted that only three of four paragraphs were devoted to Crazy Horse while pages and pages were devoted to the works of various white missionaries. This book was written by white racists but it is a great look into the minds of such people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"The Dead Won't Hurt You was the best book I've read in long time, a real page turner. I rarely find a book that can keep my interest, but this book I couldn't put down, I even took it with me in my car and read while sitting at red lights. I highly recommend this book to everyone who believes or doesn't believe in ghosts, you may become a believer if you aren't one already!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, you have been dooped","review":"I live in the same area where this event was to have taken place.

Finally one of the very best and overlooked albums of 80's got re released.What can I say about this album? Everything I needed is here. The melody, heavenly guitars and strong vocals, the oxygen we used to breathe in 80's etc... It's all here.

These filters are announced here as 46mm. They're not. They're 52mm filters that require an adapter in order to be used with 46mm lenses. I already owned more expensive 52mm filters.

Although it appears well constructed, it is very rigid, wide in the area right at the neck and the inside surface isn't smooth - kind of wrinkled. Seems like it will be uncomfortable. Not well enough padded for the weight of DSLRs. Not worth the risk of not liking it after use for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Just Wow!","review":"I will say the bad thing first. Another reviewer pointed this out, that two of the characters had names that were a little too similar and made it difficult to keep them straight.OK, that wasn't so bad was it?I love that the characters were so well developed, and that no one is all good, or all bad, just very human. This is just the kind of book I like, it isn't a love story, but it has love, it isn't paranormal but has mystery.This writer has totally avoided formulaic writing and tells a great story with an ending that can't be predicted by the end of the first chapter.This is the type of writing I would like to see more of when I am reading books for review.The name of the book is Cirkus, but that is merely the setting for a collection of humans with their own hurts. I do think the character of Jakob could have been fleshed out just a touch since he was pivotal to the climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted, hard to put down","review":"I've always really enjoyed stories about Circus life at the turn of the century and this one does not disappoint. Very well written and researched, great story lines, compelling characters.Felt the ending was a bit rushed--a \\"con\\" I often feel about newer authors who seem to run out of gas in wrapping things up.

The prose is just shy of poetry, never veering from the dreamlike quality of the writing. The character interactions are smooth. The twists are startling.People looking for turn of the century cirus lore may be disappointed. This is the story of talented immigrants in a Czech circus, trying to make their way in America.This book should be required reading in college lit courses. It should be held up as a goal for aspiring novelists to reach for. The literate reader, as opposed to the \\"story\\" reader, will find this book worthy of attention.The Kindle version did have a problem. Every time there was a \\"tl\\" those letters transferred as \\"d\\".

The author has a wonderful flair for language, and the story is poignant and engaging. If you enjoy this, I'd recommend checking out the other books in this series... they don't share characters or story, but they do share certain thematic elements, as well as the author's unique style. My personal ranking for the series (from most favorite to least favorite): 1) Dance on My Grave, 2) Postcards from No Man's Land, 3) Now I Know, 4) The Toll Booth, 5) Breaktime... I have to admit that I haven't yet tackled This Is All."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent miter clamp","review":"This is one of the best clamps Ive ever used. The picture you see doesn't adequately describe what the clamp is designed to do. This clamp is designed to join two pieces of wood together, typically at a 90 degree angle. The power of the clamp is that it holds both pieces in place firmly and also squeezes that joint together rather than merely holding them together as typical angle clamps do. Again, this picture you see is an unfortunate marketing flaw, as it misrepresents the true value of this superb clamp. Anyone who makes any kind of frame with wood up to 4 inches thick will love this clamp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product cannot be played on US sold DVD players","review":"While the opera and the performance may be wonderful, I cannot tell because the set of disks I received twice are not playable on US-sold DVD players.

I've always looked for devotionals that would really hold my childrens' interests and this is it! Each day there is a new \\"sticky situation\\" that a child is in, and it gives multiple choice answers to figure out. Then it tells you where you can find help in the Bible (give a verse) and how to discuss this. The cover itself is hilarious and gets the kids to look inside. I have a 7yr old girl and 10.5 yr old boy and this book is great for both. It will be good for my son until he's at least 12. I also got the first version of this book which is just as good :) These are perfect to do either during breakfast in the morning or during dinner in the evening as a family. We keep them on our kitchen counter along with a Bible. You'll love it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great level of seriousness and fun","review":"We read this book to help guide dinner conversations.

It peaked at number 12, but deserved top ten status. \\"St. Charles\\" is a song in the vein of \\"Miracles\\" and was the only other single from the album. It only managed to get to number 64. The album contains a couple of Paul Kanter songs, \\"Dance With The Dragon\\" and \\"Song To The Sun\\" that have a political bent similar to their Airplane days, but most of the album is made up of love songs like \\"Cruisin'\\", \\"Switchblade\\" and \\"Love Lovely Love\\".

Aside from the two aforementioned songs, the only other real rocker here is the John Barbata-written-and-sung \\"Big City.\\" The fact that several band members, past and present, believe that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes SPITFIRE an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Amazing amazing amazing simply.

It also goes into the history behind 'couture', which is very fascinating for the layperson.It covers basic clothes selection for your body type, since what looks good on full-figured but beautiful Queen Latifah would look odd on thin Paris Hilton, even in a size 2. It also describes how most fashions need to be adjusted for variations in the more average figures in order to hang right, but if done right, can hide your figure flaws and make a person look as glamourous as the Movie Stars on Awards night.With all the specialized fitting and sewing techiniques it descibes, the book will at least sure help my $40 clothes items I make look more like professionally sewn $400+ items instead of something made in High School Home-Ec class."},{"rating":"1","title":"shorthand pocket dictionary Isaac Pitman eight thousand words phrases","review":"This is a very very VERY disappointing book.

It is also very deceiving because this book says Isaac Pitman Shorthand and inside is just RUBBISH a total waste of my money. I wanted to return it to you but it would have cost me $17 australian dollars and wasnt worth the time and expense. I am sure that many other people who are interested in writing Pitman Shorthand will feel the same way as I do as this book is a SHAM and only fit for the RUBBISH BIN. It is the first book received from you that I have been disappointed with and I have a feeling that this is only the FIRST bad review you will receive from people about this Pitman ShorthandDictionary It needs to be checked by a professional Pitman shorthand at your end and I would be very interested to hear their comments, So no stars here from me.Thank youWin Traub"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor for having been made in 1984","review":"For being a Metzger movie I expected a lot more!

It collects the vast majority of the dust generated by drywall sanding. Plastic parts are too breakable. That said, for under $50, this is worth every penny and then some.

For the \\"sweat equity\\" laborer, it's a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This unit is a classic example of a good idea with poor execution. The hand unit on this over-priced system has a tendency to vacuum itself onto the wall surface, making smooth sanding impossible and laborious. The water filter is a nifty idea, but cumbersome. A better solution is a standard shop-vac with a drywall filter bag installed and skip the water bucket. This unit also has a tendency to produce a shrill whistle from the rushing air. Bottom line, if you can't afford the Porter Cable unit (I completely understand if you can't), then rent one until some manufacturer comes out with a decent power sander for the DIY market. You'll never be happy about the money spent on the MT800. Might be worth the effort for [$$$]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"Great idea but the flex hose provided with the unit creates a whistle that requires double hearing protection just to use it.

I immediately called the number on the product sheet and was assured that the part would be FedExed that day. One week later, after not recieving the part, I called again. The vendor once again assured me that it would be FedExed for next day delivery. That was the day before yesterday.I now dread going to the job.

The only real issue was the absolutely ear piercing, ultra sonic noise this thing made. I had not expected to be wearing ear plugs and ear phones to work. The instructions address the issue but recommendations on how to control the noise were less that adequate. I believe if a smooth sided hose vice the corrugated hose were used it may lessen the noise. The hand held sanding head was awkward to use as well. On the good side it did collect the dust in the water well enough, but after 15 or 20 min. of use the noise was just too overwhelming. Swapping shop vacuums was of no help. I am accustom to nosy enviroments being in aerospace by trade and a woodworker by hobby, but this was LOUD on a ultrasonic level and it grated on the nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screams Like A Banshee","review":"I should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers regarding the noise level of this device.

Unit was not assembled, had to figure out / attach hoses to lid. God-awful whistling as others mention. Unbelievable junk for $50. The idea is sound but was probably engineered by the salespeople who hold a patent on similar vacuum cleaner (rexair? rainbow?), effectively creating a monopoly, preventing competition, charging rich customers $3000. Just get yourself a good shop vac (which you can use for other things) and spend $5-$10 for a fine dust bag insert (my Ridgid 16-gal works fine). Also read instructions on your mud: it can often be done with a sponge to avoid dust. Amazon could drop this product imo. I may buy a decent hose and reengineer the lid in future if need arises again.

By using a boring middle-aged bank manager as the first person Graham greene successfully reduces travels across two continents to mere tedium. The obvious objective is to present extravagant and improbable adventures through the eyes of an innocent surburbanite and thus make them funny. It doesn't work - the bank manager is immediately accepting of his aunt's eccentricities, the humour is obvious and prohibitively antiquated (I admit it was written some time ago) and the description of the wonderful places they visit terribly superficial. The aunt may have been shocking 50 years ago - but no longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"the dark side","review":"Underneath the facade of a frothy farce about a Caspar Milquetoast banker and his eccentric and adventurous aunt lies a dark tale of a totally selfish adventuress and the illegitimate son whom she corrupts. The so-called aunt is actually part of the demi monde , smuggler and prostitute, abettor of a Nazi collaborator and a con man, possibly an adjunct to a murder. The British Empire-type characters might have been fashioned by Agatha Christie in the 20's and 30's. The only hint that the book was written in the '60's is the young American hippie girl the banker meets on the Orient Express to Istanbul. The existential parts have to do with middle age and mortality. It was a quick and interesting read, not typical of earlier books by Graham Greene, such as The Power and the Glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird - the movie is actually better than the book","review":"The movie creates a reason for the relationship, and adds some elements of drama.

Shortly after he meets his eccentric aunt, who he has not seen since he was a young child, he ends up on whirlwind travels that are best left for the reader to discover for his or herself.

The sound is great, the operation is easy, and I love that it can play MP3 CD's! One of my favorite things about it is that it shows you the names of songs on any CD burned in a computer, not just MP3 CD's. I also like the remote you can attach to the head phone cord. My only problem was that my first one was faulty so a called SonicBlue and they sent me a replacement in 4 days. My only other complaint is about the case. It seems to be the worst case design in the world.Pros:-Great sound-Great design-Easy to use-Has a remote-No software to install on your computerCons:-Terrible case-Uncomfortable earbudsAs you can see, the pros heavily outweigh the cons.

The volume: I use this player at night when i sleep (in a crappy two person dorm). i can hear the music quite well with the headphones out of my ears laying on my bed. so, i have to wonder if some people's hearing is a little... um....bad? i do know that some mp3s (the way they are recorded i guess) are quieter than others. so maybe that is the case. Skips: something you should know is that this player does have a bitrate cap of 256 (somewhere around that number) so anything higher than that and it is going to skip.i hope this helps alleviate some fears"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rio Volt seems good, so far...","review":"I just got this yesterday, but i really like it so far.

Therefore, there is little skip protection at the beginning of the song. And yes, this is not a joggable cd player. 40 sec or 10 sec (switchable) for regular cds.And hello people! FIRMWARE! YAAAY!

I did find that it is a little slow to rev up with MP3s, and so gave it only 4 of 5 stars. My TDK Mojo gave up the ghost after a couple years, and I chose this RioVolt as a replacement.

Now we're talking maybe 15 inches and a soft landing on carpet. I never would have thought it was so sensitive, but now it spins the disc and says NO DISC. Not very durable to say the least.I actually already bought the new SP250, which is why I wish I would've researched the SP100 prior. I had a feeling a new unit with an FM tuner would be in stores soon. I would suggest getting the SP250.

After many hours of testing all conceivable settings and brand media wasted, (both CD-R and CD-RW) I contacted Tech support to get an answer that my unit was fine (how can they tell ?) and the problem was with the burner.

BUT it would not reliably play any MP3 CD-R I put in the unit (CD-Rs that worked just fine in multiple PCs / multiple CD-ROM drives).If there are more than 255 tracks it gets totally confused. I wasted several CD-Rs - burning them with 1, 10, 100 tracks - no luck. The unit would crash and reset continually.Had to return the unit - first return to eBay. Recommendation - try in a store before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well ... if you are experiencing rigor mortis","review":"I was initally pleased with this product after I unpacked it and tried it out. Unfortunately, like others that have written reviews, that all changed after I tried to take it for a walk.The skip protection on this unit is totally useless. Unless you are standing almost completely still, it skips like crazy. I don't know how this company can claim it has 120 seconds of anti-skip memory. I can make it skip in a much shorter period even after being completely still for minutes before. Maybe you get 120 seconds if you encode at 8 kbps?I can't recommend this product for mobile usage. Isn't that what a portable is for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Music Fans!","review":"I just purchased this player last night and was impressed how easy it was to use. The software included was a blessing especially the online manual as the included hardcopy is not useful. I ripped several of my own CDs so that I have one CD-RW and got about 150 songs and was very pleased how easy it was. The sound quality is perfect. The headphones are not comfortable and the unit itself is not that pretty(I like the look and feel of the Sony Sports portable CD) but overall I am very happy I purchased it. The slip cover as mentioned in other reviews has got to go, but I use to protect the unit(until I find one better). This is great for anyone who travels alot business or pleasure because all you will need is one or two CD-RWs=300 songs and your ready to go. Also saves space in your carry on. If you love music and have a CD Burner-Buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Player - Terrible Support","review":"I was loving my new Rio Volt player for about a month. The new version 2.0 firmware upgrade was great. I would have given it 5 stars about 3 weeks ago. It even plays those 16kbs audio books that other players wont - even though the volume is a bit low. But if it breaks, you are out of luck. I sent an email to their customer support over 2 weeks ago, and 2 more emails since then, and have still gotten no reply (except the automatic \\"We received your email and will get back to you within several business days\\" message). It would be very easy to fix if I could just get a replacement part. So, if you get one, be gentle with it. It's the best player available but has 0 customer support behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darned close to perfect","review":"I bought the Rio Volt for a road trip, and as an inexpensive .mp3 addon to my home stereo system.If you buy one, go get the firmware update from ...as soon as you open the box.

Overall a good value for dollars spent.Negatives: Cheap feeling, battery door flies open, sub-optimal navigation between folders.Oh, and I HATE the little dancing people on the bottom of the display. If they could not save us some screen real estate for better title listings, why not include an option to turn the goofy little people off?In short, I did my research before buying the Volt, and it looks liek the best game in town right now. If they enhance the build quality, the Volt will be a show-stopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good, depending on how you use it","review":"I bought this product a while ago because im the type of person who doesnt like to carry a lot of cds with me and I thought this was a great idea. At first it was great, the idea of having 150+ songs on was cd was great. Altough there are people who say the anti-skip works, it really doesnt. I used it when I walked or when i rode my bike, but it skipped a lot. I know about the buffer thing, your suppose to wait a while so that the songs starts playing again, but it doesnt solve the problem, it still skips. In my opinion, get this produclt ONLY if you are the type of person who is gonna have it somewhere where its still, if you walk or jog, look for a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"no disc\\" = very disappointing","review":"Like other reviewers, I saw the raves on the internet and bought the Riovolt. I kept it in my room on a desk playing only audio CD's and it worked great for awhile- maybe 20 hours of disc time. Then I tried my first MP3 and got a \\"no disc\\" error. I thought I had recorded the files wrong or something, until I finally tried another audio CD and still got the \\"no disc\\" error. Their website says to clean the laser but that didn't do anything for it. They also said to upload the new software on it but it wouldn't read that disc either.I don't like having to write a poor review but if I can save someone else the time and trouble of buying this item I will. Unfortunately, I am out of the country and can't return or replace this item. If you want to enjoy your music buy another player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best. Dont screw with the others.","review":"This MP3 player works great. I bought it specifically for my car; to replace a 6 year old sony cd walkman. This player never once skipped on me after a full week of use (10 hrs). Oh.. and I drive a 4x4 with a fairly stiff ride. Here's what i used for the CD: TDK 700MB CD-R (rated for 16x) Memorex 2x2x6 CDRW (written at 2x speed <-- key) Adaptec Easy CD Creator I got 164 songs on this CD in 12 Directories. The great thing about this player, is that it can shuffle inside a directory or it can shuffle the whole CD. Also, it has upgradeable firmware, so when new features come out, you get to use them.There is one thing that is bad about it... They can't tell me what cigarette power adapter to use. I am sure there is one out there somewhere, but don't expect them to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features, but its not durable","review":"The SP100 has good features, and works pretty well but it not built very sturdy. While inside my padded case logic cd-carrier it fell down and broke. I have read other reviews where the same experience has happened to many other people. I just bought the Sony CD-MP3 player and it is a lot better, much more durable, and much better skip protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player, could be sturdier","review":"It's nice to be able to squeeze about 160 MP3s at 128 rate onto a data CD, and then play them on this player. LCD functions are fine, the variety of EQ presets are okay to good. Battery time is better than I expected, but not miraculous. Buttons are laid out so that I could quickly memorize how to hit most simple functions without looking.On the less than great side, the CD door and battery doors aren't too sturdy. I frequently accidentally flip open the player while it's in my jacket pocket while reaching for the skip button. And the battery door slides off all too easily, plus the compartment contains the usual annoying ribbon that supposedly holds the batteries in, but really just serves to make the door harder to close. I already cut mine off...Overall, great idea, very smartly served, with only those 2 minor complaints. This level Rio player (to me) is a good buy, for now...who knows how soon they'll revamp the product line, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good mp3-cd player","review":"This cd player is great for playing mp3s. It stores well over one hundred mp3s on a single cd to play anywhere. At the beginning and middle of each song it copies 2 minutes of the song to it's internal memory; the cd actually doesn't spin while it plays that part. This makes skipping virtually impossible. The sound is very good and there are several different equalizers to choose from. The only downsides to the product is the software doesn't have instructions with it (Adaptec CD Creator 4.0). Plus, when the cd is started, it takes about a minute for the first song to play, while the software loads. After that though, the music is continuous because it only has to load one time. Overall, in excellent solution to having a great variety of music to take anywhere and play anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT","review":"After reading a review for the new RioVolt player, and finding a great deal (...), I hesitantly took the plunge and bought it. What a great decision! The quality and flexibility of this player is light-years ahead of those first slapped-together units. The sound is smooth and very CD-like at just about any bitrate (I have recorded and played CDs at bitrates from 128-320, as well as Variable Bit Rate recordings), and the ability to read ID2/3 tags makes navigating through several hundred tracks much easier, and dare I say - fun? I currently am using it as a substitute for a CD changer in my home system, so it's portability and shock resistance have yet to be tested. An upcoming trip to the Northeast will tell the tale. But if it works as well in the car as it does in my home system, I will consider this to be one of the best buys in portable music. And with prices continuing to fall, I may just go ahead and purchase a spare!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too big","review":"Bought this thinking it would be small enough for my little dogs - looked small - did not say actual size.

It is a promo though, so availability may be limited.The main reason I'm writing this review is to point out that the version of 60 MPH is the Paul Dekahne Mix and is in fact unique to this CD. The arrangement is not too different than the album version, but different enough to make it interesting for die hard fans. Personally, I prefer the version of 60 MPH on this release to the album version.The other tracks on this compilation are all available on other releases. If you are looking for an introduction to the band with a couple of Joy Division tracks thrown in, and you can get this for a reasonable price, you could do worse than starting here.That said, if you want my honest opinion, you're better off getting every album.

Nope, it was the same slow moving story line the Witches twosome suffered from.

The story was intense at times and I enjoy a story that keeps me interested as this one did!!I really enjoyed taking advantage of the Prime Lenders Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite of the Potter books","review":"The thing is that the worst Potter is better than anything else anybody else is writing. I think what hurts this one is the dark story of the chamber of secrets clashes with her need to keep this one kiddy. Still characters and setting are so good it overcomes any shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book but might be a little intense for some kids","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book but I remember liking it pretty well. Lots of very interesting detail but be warned, there are some sections that might be very scary for the younger readers, especially the Chamber of Secrets section. I don't have any children but I think I'd be careful about letting the more nervous types of kids read this book by themselves. I didn't have problems with any of it and maybe most kids these days wouldn't but still, use caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This book is just as good as the first in the series. Highly recommended for Harry Potter fans who want to learn about his second year in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best book I have read in years.","review":"Harry is back at hogwarts and disaster strikes. Hogwarts has a series of attacks in which also happened 50 years ago and harry is determined to find out who opened the chamber of secrets and he finally finds out. Meanwhile him and two friends Ron and Hermione try a potion called Polyjuice Potion and hermione accedentally turns herself into a cat. The book Is Great an I recemend it to anyone who reads this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was okay","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a very good book. Hary Potter and all his friends come back for the sequeal, while new and interesting faces are introduced. Though it is somewhat like the first one, it's still arriginal. I couldn't put it down. I recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and enjoyed the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback, get the other 2 in hardcover","review":"The first book (Sorcerer's Stone) was absolutely phenomenal, and the third book (Prisoner of Azkaban) was terrific. This one is more like an overpriced Goosebumps book published in hardcover, and is considerably darker than the other two. All of the adults that I've gotten hooked on this series liked the first and third as well, and thought Chamber of Secrets was too dark and not as enjoyable. I've found that more children than adults are reading this series, as the 200+ pages may be an intimidating length for many children. I *HIGHLY* recommend the other two books, and suggest picking up the paperback for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 4th graders, but no more.","review":"This book, along with all the other harry potter books, sucks for anyone over the age of 10. And as for that 30 year-old guy from cold springs, NY, he needs to read more complicated, and mature books. Redwall is much better, so is any book by j.r.r tolkien. If your under 10 you should be reading this book, if your over 10, you should be ashamed, and of given this book to your little sisiter or brother by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't that great.","review":"I do not understand the hype about this book! It is not half as good as the Deryni Chronicles by Katherine Kurtz! Is this just because it is new or something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than the First!","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was good, but Harry Potter and the chamber of Secrets is even better! I picked it up, but couldn't put it down! I suspected that someone was the villain but it turned out being someone different! The Harry Potter books are the best! If you like Mysteries and science fiction, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Thumbs Up for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you're looking for a good book to read, your searches are over. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the book you have been looking for. J.K. Rowling (the author) has an amazing way of combining fiction, fantasy, science fiction, and mystery in one suspensful tale. Now, I, myself, am not a big mystery, fantasy, or science fiction fan, but in this book, I really didn't mind it at all! So go now and BUY THAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...that's all...wow","review":"I wasn't even going to read these books- I laughed at my friend when she told me she stayed up until 5 in the morning reading them. After all, they're kid's books. Later, I got a chance to laugh at myself for staying up until an unreasonable hour reading the first book. I'm totally hooked. The second book was just as good as the first, without overshadowing it at all. I can't wait until the other 4 books and the movie come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"This book was the best one I ever read! I totally recommend this book for people of all ages! If I could rate it with more than 5 stars, I would.

Just make sure you read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book,So Far!","review":"I didn't think anything could possibly be as good as the first book,and in my opinion,I was correct.This book is even better than the first! Harry is back with Hermione,Ron,and a new student,Ginny,Ron's younger sister,for another exciting year at Hogwarts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets(wich is the best!)","review":"The second book is so far my faviorite. Hermionie is my faviorite character in this book. I just could not put the book down untill i found out who opened the chamber of secrets. J.K. Rowling is an excellent author. The books are exciting but still very funny. My seven year old sister also loves the books. I really like the part where Ron and Harry fly to school in Rons ,dads car."},{"rating":"2","title":"read harry potter","review":"I gave this book five stars because it gave alot of detail. Like when Harry saw Chamber of Secrets they told every thing about the Chamber of Secrets and what the people teach or do. The most interesting thing about the book is the magic words because they all meant something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most amazing book","review":"For those who group up in the wonderful worlds of Dahl and Lewis' Narnia--these books are a wonderful continuation of that same tradition of intelligent \\"childrens' books.\\" The trials and successes of Harry and his friends are at once touching, hilarious, and most of all engrossing. Something everyone, no matter what age, should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was overly suprised!","review":"I read this book, expecting to be dissapointed. You see, sequel are hardly ever better than the original book. I actually liked this one alot better than the first. It had a little more plot depth and seemed to fit better.Anyone who reads decent literature needs to at least read this book. It is an outstanding book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1 MAGICAL FANTASY","review":"This book tells the story of the one and only,lightning skard Harry Potter.This magical story tells of a chamber of secrets being opened.But by who? The answer may come as a shock! Especially if you read the first book.I would give it 9,0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 if I could. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller with a Rowling twist.","review":"It was brilliant! I couldn't put it down. I've read it many times and I think it's the best! The complex plot has the same beauty as its predescessor, the twists and turns that all fall into place at the end. The Dursleys are as obnoxious as ever, this time including their latest clients, the Masons. Dobby is the pessimist of the story, while Harry, the hero, solves the mystery, in spite of boastful teachers and supercilious classmates. Neurotic Ron and \\"teacher's pet\\" Hermione stand by Harry all the way until they eventually find discover the deadly truth. That perfect balance between horror and humour, emotions and action is true Rowling magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"an edge-of -your- seat mystery, well written for kids","review":"THIS IS A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE ON SCHOOL REQUIRED READING LISTS. IT MAKES YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION AND TAKES YOU TO A WONDERFUL, MYSTERIOUS WORLD.

A very good book with suspence, mystery and amazing magic. you can't put it down! buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly better than the original?","review":"Although best described as one of those adults for whom the cover was changed to make life less embarrassing(!), I must say that both Harry Potter books (and, no doubt, the remaining 4 or so still to come) will remain timeless childrens' classics, enjoyed by 'children' of all ages. J Rowling has created memorable characters and a stalwart hero in Harry, and more power to her pen, I say.I hope that when they do (inevitably) get round to making a film of the first book, that they do not oversweeten either the flavour of the book, or the characters themselves. Leave the sugar bowl alone please!Read, enjoy and follow the adventures of Harry et al."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"What can I say! J.K. Rowling has an extrodenary(excuse the spelling :-D) mind. After my sister finally talked me into reading te first book( I ended up stayin' up half the night to read it!) I was hooked. I have now read all three that are published right now and can't wait for the fourth one to come out in July (the 8th to be presice). I know without a doubt that it will be as good as the last three were.

Harry Potter himself?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"J.K Rowling has written a series of books reminiscent of works by J.R.R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, and R.A. Salvatore. I am 25 years old and I was surprised to find Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets such an enjoyable read! Rowling's use of words conjures up a highly enjoyable world, where you become quickly attached to the heroes therein. The story is masterfully woven and leaves even the most astute reader looking back several pages to find the clues that they initially paid no attention to. One of the best books I have read in many a year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter and the sorcerers stone was great!!!!!","review":"I think harry potter and the sorcerers stone was the best story I have ever read. It was so exciting and very magical. My teacher is reading it to the class and I went to Canada and bought a copy. Instead of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, it was called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone! I really liked the book and I can't wait until the next one comes out. P.S.

If you have not read this book I suggest reading it Right NOW!I hope JK Rowling finishes her 3rd book soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequal!","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, though not my favorite Harry Potter book, was excellent! You can tell that JK Rowling struggled with this book, since she seemed determined to put a lot of plot elements into one excellent story. She was very tedious with laying her clues, and hinting about certain things, but there was always irony around every corner. The words used can build a child's vocabulary well, but isn't too hard to understand. The book has a dark and creepy feel to it, while also making you think, and piece the puzzle together. Recommended to anyone who likes an intriguing, understandable book, and to anyone who is looking for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first!","review":"This book is better than the first and J.K.

My favorit part in the storie is when Harry stabse the Baselik tooth through the diary of Voldomort.I read this book because I liked the first one.CR and JB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I would recomend this book to evrryone.It's called Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It's about a kid named Harry Potter and he is having a real bad time and then he goes back to the place he likes.I like when Harry has to fight a giant snake called a basilisk to defeat a pearson named Tom Riddle.The place where the action is at is called the Chamber of Secrets.I liked the book because it is great and thrilling with suspence and action.The thing I don't like about the book is that many people wre getting attacked a lot. This book is great I would say that it was full of everything.It's a very good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this book!","review":"Harry Potter better than ever. I love all of these books. Mrs. Rowling is a wonderfully talented writer and I can't wait until the next books come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book","review":"All the books I have ever read don't compare to the harry potter books. So far i read 3 out of 4 and they were the best books i have ever read. The second book was really good. And i would highly reconmend it to anybody who can read. I was the first in my family that read these books and i told my aunt ( who is now waiting for j.k rowling to finish the fifth book) that they were the best books i have ever read and now she my other aunt and 4 of myt cousins are all reading these books. My aunt Laurie has the fourth book and there is a line on all the people who want to read it. I am nexted thank godness i was waiting so so long for it to come out.

He drives the roads of the United States and these cd's keep him company.The condition was very good and they were on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This is such an AWESOME book!","review":"Harry Potter books are great. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best. This book takes place during Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This book is sort of a mystery, and it is very interesting to read. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is even better then Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which means it is Really, REALLY good. Harry Potter books are for all ages, not just kids. I totally highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better for each book!","review":"This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read! Harry has a rough start (as usual) to his going to the school, and from the first words you are hooked! How can I put it..: If you liked Harry in the last book, you'll love him now! I won't tell you anything more, but: the ending is VERY exciting and thrilling and scary and great...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Harry Potter","review":"So far this is a great book. I haven't finished this book, but it is great. So far Harry has gone to Hogwarts school for Witchcraft and Wizardy, now for his second yeear. This time it's just a little different. Now the Chamber of Secrets has been opened somewhere in the school. The question is by who? What is attacking the kids? How do you stop the attacks? The only way to find out is to read the book. This is the kind of book that is so suspenseful that you can't put the book down. I know I can't. This is also a book that cheers you up. That is why I recommend you to read this great book: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good book and has a very good ending.Altough the beginning it is not that exciting and \\"dry\\". You have to be patient to read this book because you would never make it because you have to go through the boring part first. Other than the beginning it is really exciting. The ending is VERY good. It is definitly worth reading for the ending.I recommend this book to people who are patient and like mystery and adventure. J.K. Rowlings gives another great book with descriptive words so you feel like your living it.You have to read the first one, but I recommend that you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical sequel","review":"If you enjoyed the first book in the Harry Potter series, you definitely won't be disappointed with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second in the series. Harry Potter #2 is packed with adventure, magic, humor, and mystery, just like the first book, plus it also brings in some new characters and another mysterious plot that won't let you stop reading. Rowling does an excellent job of character developement and describing scenery with her broad vocabulary. You may find, that in many parts of the book, you don't realize you are even reading a book. You feel as if you are really at Hogwarts School. If you haven't read the first book, there are enough references that will still allow you to understand the storyline. When reading the book, you think that it is almost impossible for someone to have such a large imagination and to have written such a truly magical book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When I read Harry Potter I liked it so much! I've read it four times and now I'm getting my dad to read it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book- even for older readers","review":"I am sixteen, and even I loved this book when my mother (a children's librarian) brought it home. This is one of those few instances where the second book in a series is as good as the first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I rate Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets four stars. The reason I didn't rate this book five stars is because I liked the first Harry Potter better. This book was written by J.K. Rowling. The book was about a boy named Harry Potter and his friends in their second year at Hogwarts. Doby (a house elf) tried to warn Harry not to go to Hogwarts, because Harry might have been in danger. Harry went to Hogwarts anyway, because he could not spend another day at the Dursleys (his aunt and uncle's house). At Hogwarts students were being petrified from a monster. Harry found out that he could speak parseltoungue, which means he could speak to snakes. When Hermione got petrified and Ron's sister got taken away by the monster, Harry is destined to find out where and what it is. To find out what happens next, read \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will become a clasic!","review":"Even though the review says that this book is for 9-12 year olds, I think that this book is for everyone. Think about this: It's been on the New York Times Adult best seller list for 15 weeks! I am a heavy fantasy reader and even I liked it. READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is already one of my favorite books,though I am only 12!!","review":"My dad gave it to me for Holiday,I read it in two days, then I had my dad read it, who afterward gave it to my mom, who inspite her hectic teaching job, read it within a week. In about March, my mom picked up my friend from her school out of town, as I rode my bike home from the local Junior High. Supposedly she loaned it to my friend, who was halfway through by the time we were finished with dinner that night. I haven't seen it since, because she took it home to finish, and gave it to her dad to read. It is such a great book, who knows who's brain Harry, Hermoine, Ron, and the rest of them at Hogwarts are going through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just like the other book but better.","review":"This book is the best to me. I think this is the best book in the world, but that's my opinion. It is about Harry Potter. Mostly, I like chapter two. It is about this little creature that keeps on saying 'sir' at the end of sentences. The little creature is very wierd too. I think that he is an alien to me, and he is so wierd. There are other creatures too, and they have wierd names also."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"This and all the Harry Potter books are much overrated both as to their force for \\"evil\\" and their status as \\"great literature\\". They are comparable to the \\"Hardy Boys\\" with some supernatural stuff thrown in. If this book gets your children reading that's great but don't believe they are learning any great moral lessons. There are none. The characters are one dimensional. Harry's foster family is disgusting mean and ugly. Harry himself has more magic tricks than brains. When your children have read these books the next step is not the works of C.S. Lewis. Start them on Grimm's fairy tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I did not think Rowling could write a worse book than the first Harry Potter. I was wrong. This book, written as though Rowling did not care whether every word was spelled wrong had very bad grammar and word usage worthy of a four year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets","review":"I wish they wouldn't put an arbitrary reading level on the books. I'm 53 years young and I'm on the third Harry Potter Book. I don't like science Fiction per se, but these Harry Potter books are very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"words cannot express my feelings for this book....","review":"I think that this book could have been much better...although I do not care for the Harry Potter series at all. They are really unimaginative and uncreative, and at times, rather silly and dumb. (with all due respect) I think that JK Rowling kinda copied it from the Lord of the Rings series, except she made it for younger kids. The movies are not as exciting as I thought they should be. I would highly recommend reading the Lord of the RIngs series instead. The Harry series is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"FUN Read, but only that.","review":"I admit, the Harry Potter books are a fun read, but I found that they got boring halfway into this book. It lacked depth! The formula plot is as always: amazing boy escapes evil, tries to figure out evil, evil isn't what he thinks it is, always finds a way to beat it. You could always tell what was going to happen. There was something definetly lacking. There's many better fantasy books and authors out there, among them DAVID EDDINGS, C.S. LEWIS, BRIAN JACQUES, TERRY BROOKS.DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I find this book to be disturbing","review":"The book is well written,but I do have a problem with the content, first there is alot of implied violence from the adult toward Harry,and a system of everybody for himself. The worst is the portrayal of there being good and bad witches,witches are witches regardless of thier intent. I know alot of people will wonder what the point is. If you convince childern at a young age something is o.k. they will beleive it.this book is dangerous in its content.I will not let my kids read it! also the book would be very confusing to the youngest readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a coherent reader, to you","review":"When I read J.K. Rowlings first book, the Sorceror's Stone, Iwas very excited about the Chamber of Secrets. First, I want to tellyou that this is an excellent book, and a good sequel to the Sorceror's Stone. Mind you, a sequel is never as good as the first book, yet Rowling still creates a air of mystery. I only gave it one star because I wanted to get your attention, yet really it deserves four or five."},{"rating":"2","title":"A penny + shipping. I can't complain.","review":"A penny + shipping.

For the price used copies are going for, I have no qualms about buying them for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued excellence","review":"It is so great how the books expand and mature with the young reader in difficulty of reading level as well as content.

One of the great thing about this series I think is that each book gets better and better. Again GREAT series and I highly recommend it for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Starting Point","review":"A wonderful book. You'd think the book is just for kids but there is enough intrigue and fantasy and complexity to keep adults interested as well. Once you get into it you'll have a hard time putting it down. If you have kids, it makes a great bedtime story, and will surely give them dreams to remember, that is, if you can get them to go to bed and let you save some for the next night. It's probably the best book of the series to start reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the First","review":"The first was better.For one thing,in the original book,there were more Quidditch Matches.One thing I like,is when Harry entered the Chamber of Secrets.You should buy it,but you'll like the first more."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD AND LONG BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK IS AWESOME IT TELLS ABOUT HARRY POTTER'S 2ND ADVENTURE AT HOGWARTS.

I was entranced by all three books because of the wild characters, dialogue, and plots. I went through all three books currently in print in under a week, and I don't usually read more than two books a year. So, anybody who wants to read a few good books and who wants to give their imagination a treat, I would say the Harry Potter books are for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!","review":"The Chamber of Secrets was better than the first. And it DOESN'T promote witchcraft. And for all those kids out there who can't read it beacause their parents won't let you, I feel awfuly sorry for you. As for the parents, you need to lighten up a little. I'm eleven years old and belive me, I did not at all feel that the book was promting anything. IT'S JUST A BOOK! Kids aren't going to go out and learn about witchcraft beacause of something they read in a book! And I do not feel like they were going too over the edge with the murdering. What about all that violence and horrorwe see on televistion everyday. That doesn't even compare to the 'violence' and 'horror' in these three books ment for children aged 8-13. I hope you see the light and let your children read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"it is the best book ever. i think adults and children should read it. it is certainly a good book for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter the mysterious boy","review":"This is a story of a baby named Harry Potter that defetes the dark lord, Voldemort and gets a scar on his forehead as his parents die.

He soon learns that he is a young wizard and meets some lifelong friends along the way to school and his new life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape to Fantasy","review":"If you are one of those readers who is enchanted by books where the universe portrayed has endless possibilities and fantasy is the rule rather than a distant dream, this book will not dissapoint you. \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" has the same charm and wit as its predecesor, more suspense and a slighty more intricate plot. The Book has the same magic as the first one, this is both a relief and an invitation to continue reading the series with the same enjoyment and infatuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muggles just don't understand","review":"In the 2nd installment of Rowling's popular series, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts, despite a houseelf named Dobby and his uncle, who forbids him to visit the school again. Harry thrives again in the familiar walls of Hogwarts, but a mysterious person/thing is attacking the \\"mudbloods\\" at Hogwarts! When it comes to the possibility of Harry's haven being closed down, he takes action--especially when Hermoine Granger is attacked.I recently reread all the books in the series (well, I'm on the 4th one) and this was the first time I had read the 2nd one in probably 3 or more years, since I lost my first copy. I found it, at times, incredibly boring and it was hard to read every word. Maybe it was because I've seen the movie so many times (although that didn't happen when I read the 1st one), or maybe it was just my preference. Whatever it was, I think that the 1st, 3rd and 4th ones are better.One thing positive..it was hella better than the 5th one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"goldenford.com","review":"Harry Potter book #2, was wriiten with a darker plot than the first book of the Harry Potter series.In the 2nd book you are able lern more about the charaters and thier personallaty's, you also lern more about the diffrerent culters and background'sof the magical world.I give Harry Potter #2 by J.K.

I love it SO MUCH it is really cool. Neat-o.I thinkit is soo enchanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the series, but they sent cassette tapes","review":"I ordered this several months ago and had it sent to my daughter who lives six hours from me. Her children were reading and listing to the series, and the talents of Jim Dahl as narrator are superb. I have all the books on audio, but the first four are on cassette and I thought it a good time to upgrade to CD since cassette players have become obsolete. I ordered this on CD and it arrived as cassette tapes - she had no way to play them for her family and ended up buying an adaptor for her car because they were ready to listen to that book. I received permission to return, but since I didn't have them in my possession until last month, and very busy schedules for both of us, the time to return them expired. She gave the tapes recently to me but I have no way to use them now, disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets","review":"Probably the last person in the world to start reading Harry Potter.

He solves the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Book","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in an outstanding sequel. The first book was great and you couldn't think it could get better than the Chamber of Secrets came out and astonished each person to read the Harry Potter book. The character description is so meticulous that you know exactly what the characters look like. I didn't even like reading much until I read this book. I heard about the Harry Potter books and I decided to read the first chapter and I got trapped I couldn't set the book down. The detail, suspense, and fake foreshadows you don't know what's going to happen next. I would prefer this book that is into wizardry and magic books and even if you weren't you'd still like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Fun !","review":"I waited about six months before I chose to plunge into the second book in the Harry Potter series. I just had too many other books to read on my list. Anyway, I'm glad I decided to read this one. The one thing about Harry Potter is that you (the reader) escape to a fantasy world filled with magical fun. I love how the books end with key morals to the story, too. There are definite messages that we must live by. The last 4 or 5 chapters in this sequel really keep one on edge for 'what happens next'! I understand HP & The Sorcerers' Stone (Philosophers' Stone), the movie, is released on Nov. 19, 2001 here in the U.S. Warner Brothers quickly starts filming the sequel (Chamber of Secrets) in Nov. 2001 for fear of the stars getting older--haha. I can't wait to see the movie...from the character still photos I saw in the Vanity Fair Oct. 2001 issue it will be Magical Fun...and relatively close to the book storyline so we (Potter Reading Fans) shouldn't be too disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Books for all ages","review":"I bought this book because we did not have a copy.And i am very happy that i did"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was GR8!!","review":"I read Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets for an English project and it was awesome.This book starts out with Harry living with his Aunt and Uncle untiol Hogwarts is in session. A house-elf named Dobby comes to tell Harry that he shouldnt go back to Hogwarts this year. But Harry has to because he feels that it is his home. Dobby does everything he can to stop Harry from going back he even ruins Harry's aunt and uncles dinner party. Uncle Vernon gets very angry and tells Harry he's forbidden to go back to Hogwarts and locks Harry into his room.

This book hadgood continuity with the first book. I felt that thisbook lacked the creative imagination that the Sorcerer'sStone displayed, and had difficulty completing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Henry?

I had taken my children to see the movie \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" and the movie totally hooked me. I just had to find out what happened next. I find the author's ability to come up with creative new ideas enthralling. The characters are quite engaging and there always seems to be a moral to the story. The moral to this story is a fate vs. choices type. I am also reading this book to my 6-year-old. His older brothers have read this book in school already. If you are looking for good clean fun, adventure and plenty of creativity, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK","review":"I loved Harry Potter and the Sorcerors stone, I cant wait to read this one.

Filled with excitement and adventure, I couldn't put the book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even 44 year olds can't stop reading this book!","review":"It is just plain embarrassing. Although the UK publishers changed the cover of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers'/Philosophers' Stone so that adults could read it without it being Too Obvious that we were reading a book in the 9-12 age group, the Chamber of Secrets still has the cover for children. Yet I couldn't put it down and it made me laugh numerous times - it is so inventive! Comparing the two books, I would say that this 'sequel' is, fortunately, that rare form of sequel - as good or perhaps even very slightly better than the original. The moment I returned from the UK, it was nigh on snatched from my hands, and no more was seen of my 12 year old daughter for the day or so that it took her to finish it. Had it been a weekend, she would probably have read it even more quickly. Joanne Rowling has created a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reader from Long Beach Long Island","review":"I am 34 years old I have read the first two books and can't wait to read the next one.

In spite of the seemingly mystical nature of the stories, they actually have a very different theme than one would expect. Harry almost never relies on magic, but rather he thinks, works, and judges for himself. That is the real draw of these books! Children can recognize a hero when they see one, and are naturally drawn to characters who take matters into their own hands and act on their own judgement.Harry gets into so many situations where it would be easy to run for help or rely on someone else, but he doesn't! He is a true individual.I highly recommend this book for children and also for adults who enjoy a good hero story.I can't wait for book 5!:o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel to 'Philosphers Stone'","review":"Forget the hype. Forget the Hollywood-busting film. The Harry Potter books, especially the second book 'Chamber of Secrets', are truly enjoyable reads. Whereas the first one served as a perfect introduction into the Potter world of Wizards, Muggles and everything in between, 'Chamber of Secrets' does what all sequels should; continue the story, elaborating what was said before without treading upon the original text. This book does just that. It introduces new characters and mythology while expanding upon the original ones. Not forgetting anything laid out in 'The Philosophers Stone', the sequel also hints at things to be seen in it's following novels. Great stuff! Can't wait to see the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down, it was so good!","review":"J.K. Rowling did an excellent job of writing this book.

Some of the mysteries in Book 1, such as why Hagrid was expel is discussed here.In summary, Harry returned to Hogwarts, the School of Wizardy with his best friends, Ron and Hermoine and Harry discover a diary, which is able to transform him back to the owner of the diary's memory. At the same time, there is a monster out to kill muggles and Harry was the main suspect! He was also believe to be the Heir of Slytherin!

After surreptitiously devouring #1, I got into the swing of the storyline and decided to read the entire set. Don't get your hopes up -- this isn't \\"deep\\" reading -- but it IS fun reading. You'll find yourself trying to outguess the mysteries -- and you can probably DO it -- but the point is that the author brings you along and makes you enjoy the story as you pretend that it is too \\"simple\\" for adults to read. But, give in -- even if you have to pull off the dustjacket and pretend you're reading something from the \\"nonfiction\\" shelf. You'll find yourself smiling and then looking for the 3rd volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids","review":"Great book, fun reading and not only for kids, that's why I read it. The author has hooked me with the first book, and I inmediately bougth the rest of them. I enjoyed reading the book, but honestly, the first one was better, I think it was a matter of discovering a \\"new world\\". The second book shows again that same world, with a few additional things going on, but not the \\"magic\\" discoveries I had expected to find. I trust the third one will be better, no doubt.

It took me so long to actually get there, by the time i reached it i didnt even care any more. Im not bad mouthing the book or anything, go ahead and buy it, im not stopping you, most people like it.

The reason I did not enjoy the book is because I am not interested in magic and fantasies. It was hard to understand and hard to read. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy other books that I have read. The opinion I have may be very different from yours but I don't think that I would like to read any other Harry Potter books ever again. If you don't like fantasies or imaginative books this is one of those books you won't enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"hi","review":"I feel very sorry for anyone, no matter what age, who thought that this book was hard to read. I was very disappointed in this book, and yeah, maybe it's a kid's book so I shouldn't have gotten it, but with all the hoop and holler about it I thought it must be something special. Not so. This book is just like any old Hardy Boys or Sweet Valley Twins or Lloyd Alexander book I ever read in elementary school to pass the time. There's the little hero who can do no wrong and the loser bad guy who hates him for no reason and is, of course, the latest spawn in a long line of bad guys who were bad for no reason. Even Star Wars is better than this. Okay, so maybe if you are in elementary school it would be an alright read, but even then I can't understand getting THIS excited about it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful~!","review":"Harry Potter is wonderful and I'm so glad they made a braille edition.

After reading the first book I took this one and could not put it down, I had to take it to work, I had to stop eating, and my loved ones forgot how I looked like, at least for the couple of days it took me to read it. The author really knows how to handle this amazing world full of imagination, you\`ll end up loving the characters and wishing for your own magic wand or Nimbus 2000. But also the book has a great plotline, complicated (at least for a grown up like me, probably the kids get it from the beggining) but interesting, with a surprise ending that will slap you in the face.

I'm absolutely amazed that she can write with such an uncanny ability to say exactly the types of things kids want to hear -- Ron and the slugs was a masterful touch! As a teacher, anything that keeps my students enthralled with books is a winner with me, and the Harry Potter books are a phenomenal success; I even did a bulk order through Amazon for half my class after they begged me to order the books for them!

In all three books of the series, he defeats his enemy through luck or the help of some other character. He recieves presents anually, but NEVER GIVES ANYONE ANYTHING BACK! He is rich, yet won't spend a cent on his 'friends'. I say, keep up the good storytelling, great plots, and fantastic use of imagination, BUT GET A NEW CHARACTER! Sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't see what the fuss is about.","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is certainly a quite a good book, but it isn't the best. Everyone is saying how wonderful Harry Potter is, but personally I've read better books. The plot is rather weak, and I think it's just a bad novel that happened to atract an audience.

I enjoyed the intricate puzzles in the chamber, and as always, the interaction between Harry, Herimone and Ron. I've been unable to put any of these books down, and have ended up scheduling to start them on a Saturday morning, so I won't be disturbed by the little things that get in the way of my reading (like, food, work, my dog, etc...). All of the Harry Potter books will be kept on my \\"To Keep\\" bookshelf, where only my really favorite ones reside, but when I'm in the mood to re-read my old favorites, the Chamber of Secrets will be the first one I choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I must confess that as an adult I too have become addicted to the series.

He is in for a big adventure this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived up to expectations!","review":"Yes it's true; after all these years, I'm finally reading the Harry Potter books, although we've seen the movies out thus far. Usually I prefer to read a book before seeing the movie based on it, but this way is great fun too, because the casting, costuming, and scenery of the movies seem so close to what Ms Rowling wrote that I can picture scenes from the movies as I read. Anyway, as with the first book, this one just sails along, with writing clearly geared toward children, yet still entertaining for us oldsters. I've got the next two out of the library and it's just about all I can do to keep going on the other book I've started in between and not throw it over so I can dig in to Prisoner of Azkaban! If you don't think you like to read, read these books, and you'll change your mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic's back!","review":"I read the first Harry Potter book voraciously,hoping the next ones would be as enchanting. Ms. Rowling delivers in this sequel. I haven't experienced such a child-like sense of wonder and joy from reading a book in years! This one is meant for all ages,not just children. Harry's a wizard,but has everyday problems just like us \\"Muggles\\". The Harry Potter series is fun and unique. Most 300 pg books aren't interesting enough to make you want to finish them in a day. And the Harry stories aren't Satanic,as some people say. I'm from a Christian family that's hopelessly devoted to them. No Harry fans have been reported practicing occult rituals. Parents don't have to censor these novels. They actually teach moral messages,but in a non-preachy way. If you want a book series that's guaranteed to be good,that you won't feel you've wasted days of your life on,try Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Harry Potter, then pick up the deadly entertaining sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets...","review":"I injoyed this book HIGHLY, and thought that Jk Rowling took a big step to show everyone who impressive she is at writing on with her 7 book series. You get to learn more about Lord Voldemort(his rival) and more duels, humor, sneaking around, and suspense. It is nail-bitting deadly, with good Quidditch matches and Baslisk fighting. I found it one of greatest one's in the series. It is impossible for me to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what if...","review":"The title itself hints at something far darker than the first book in this series. I loved it even more for that. It is through some kind of magic the Rowling transports us into this mythical world, making us believe in giant spiders, terrible monsters and ghosts. After reading the first two books i found myself reaching for a 'wand' trying to zap annoying characters around me. It is difficult, sometimes, to not believe that there are two types of humans after reading this book and it is the the way that Rowling brings us so close to Hogwarts and this world that doesn't really exist that makes Harry Potter books an adventure in a nutshell.Just what if, all this -was- real?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry's Return","review":"Harry PotterHarry Potter mixes magic with every day life. I think this book should not be banned because it has good story lines. In book two, Harry's enemy comes back, but is preserved in a diary. A girl finds it and the diary's power makes the girl do bad things.J.K. Rowling expresses good thoughts and ideas, many of which can be connected to every day kid life such as school, bullies, and parents. If you don't want you or your kids to read it then don't buy it. You should read this book because it is fun, interesting, and a good book.Rating: *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chamber of Secrets revealed!!!!!!!","review":"Have you read the book \\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets?\\" If you haven't you will love it.

NOT.Here are the three things that annoy me about his reading: 1) Was this guy reading from a text with ITALICS? He totally doesn't stress the right words in many a sentence and so much meaning and cleverness is lost. 2) As other reviewers have said, he has one voice -- slow, low and raspy -- for 1/2 the characters, even those whose voices are described as \\"oily,\\" etc. It's annoying. Big time. 3) This guy switches in and out of accents (does McGonagall have an accent or not?)I just finished listening to Chapter 9 and I'm ready to strangle the narrator. Read it aloud or get another reading before you get this. My kids are too young to realize how bad this guy is botching it so they are OK with it.I wonder if he did any other readings or if J.K. Rowling has ever heard this. I can only imagine that she'd be appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This says library binding, but it is not. Library binding is when the book is actually sewn together for durability. This is a paperback in size and quality with a hard cover that has a bad version of the cover art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this book","review":"I was reading some of the reviews when I noticed one that said that, people over ten that read this book should be ashamed. You need to learn that just because a book is meant for a younger audience doesn't mean that no one else will enjoy it. I happen to be 14 and I love this book. I enjoy the fantasy, that Rowling so carefully weaves into our imagination. I like the idea of a school like Hogwarts, especially compared to the school that I attend now. I do like the Redwall books and Tolkiien's books are right up there but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy the Harry Potter books. I honestly think that the Harry Potter books are good for any age, and no one should be ashamed of reading these great books. I think this book deserves a 5 star but I put a one star to get your attention, since no one including me reads the 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear, Lord...","review":"All right, the first Harry Potter book was Ok; the whole deal with Diagon Alley; the unpredictable ending, etc. But this one...lacked even the qualities that made the first one barely readable.TCoS is even skimpier than TSS, and again, there is little storyline. The ending was obvious, pointless, and did nothing to advance the tale of Harry (which I've now lost complete interest in). By now you've probably read the excerpts of the story tons of times, so you know what this is about. Nothing. Harry is a character I can't care for no more than his... little goody friends.The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of the new teacher that replaced Quirrel, he was about all the comic relief in this book (and there wasn't very much).Please, save yourselves from these two hundred pages of complete and utter drivel and get something readable. Kids may not be able to tell the difference between good literature and bad, so get this for them if you're stuck for a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS","review":"I THOUGHT THAT HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS WAS A FAIR BOOK I MEAN IT WAS GREAT BUT IT WASN'T THE BEST .

THE BEGINNING WAS OKAY AND I WOULD GIVE IT ABOUT A 1 BUT THE END WAS REALLY INTERESTING AND LIKE THE OTHER BOOK IT ALL TIED TOGETHER REAL WELL SO EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK REALLY MATTERED SO SHE REALLY DIDN'T GIVEANY USELESS INFO.

Rowling wrote a great book about a kid with a mysterious past. With a mysterious scar Harry gets into new troubles in every chapter. He again has trouble with his muggle family and barely makes it to school. When he finally gets to school he seems to develop dangerous situations. Kids from the school start getting hurt, and rumors are going around that certain students are doing it. With a few new characters, and most of the old ones, this is a great book to follow the first one. If you liked the first year of Hogwarts, this year is even better than before.Although I think most of the Harry Potter books are great they have a lot of fictional characters and ideas with magical thoughts. This is what I think makes it good. I would recommend this book to a 10 year old but the book is good for anyone with a wonder of the world of magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too old? Ha! Not me....","review":"You might expect a highschooler to be less than enthusiastic about a book written about...and for, really, a bunch of fourth graders. But, obviuosly, you havn't met me! I was hooked within the first three chapters of the first book, and went crazy until I could read this one! I read it while on vaction at a lake cabin...and barely put it down long enough to take a short swim. I ended up reading most of the book out loud to my best friend, who was having a hard time dealing with my numerous cries, yelps, fits of laughter and loud \\"conversations\\" with the characters. We were both very taken with the book, characters and adventures. When we finished the last few chapters, we were left sitting on the dock and looking pathetically lost. We wanted more! So, we picked it up and reread our favorite parts, laughing and talking. We both agree- everyone should read all the Harry Potter books! Everyone, of all ages!

As we were riding in our rental car through Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York, my husband kept pointing out cities and points of interest. All my three kids wanted to do was for me to keep reading! A very fun book to read because there are many diversified characters that you can assign different voices to while reading aloud! Our family's absolute favorite!!! (Except for Dad...he was a little frustrated that no one was paying any attention to him!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first!","review":"How could a reader not fall in love with Harry Potter?

There are imaginative new creatures to meet and a compelling mystery to solve. Elves, goblins, phoenixes and assorted monsters join the fray as Harry and his buddies struggle to unlock a fifty year-old mystery that threatens the very existence of Hogwarts. A great read for children and adults alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest link in the series.","review":"Though it has been 5 years since i have read it, the 2 installment is by far the weakest and least interesting book in the series. As rich and colorful the first was, the second seemed grey and boring. The series was given life by the 3rd, Prisoner of Azkaban, again...and there after with the rest. Just be ready is all. I even fell asleep in the movie, amusingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. The Hardy Boys meet Goosebumps.","review":"OK, so I'm the only one who had not heard the hype of Harry Potter before I picked up this book. Yet once I told folks that I was about to read it, their enthusiasm overwhelmed me. Frankly, I just don't get it. Maybe it's because I'm uncomfortable reading made-up words and names that can't be easily pronounced. Or because characters such as Moaning Myrtle in the bathroom could have been dreamed up by the writers of Saturday Night Live. Or that magic is used by the author to provide simple endings to complex situations. If only I could believe that the Quidditch game rules were designed to actually work (try drawing the game field, players, etc. to see what I mean). Sorry, Harry, I think you're going down in history as a fad, not a legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnetizing, but too dark for kids.","review":"A friend bought my children the first three books in the series, so I previewed them.

Harry Potter is a fantastic character whom you cannot help but relate to, and the overall story is one that weaves a tale of enchanted mystery and strange characters. I cannot thank J. K. Rowling enough! Don't worry, I won't give away the ending for those of you who haven't read this book yet, though I can't imagine anyone not reading it!

If you like to read to your younger children, you will love this book. There is intrigue, suspense, drama, comedy and best of all, magic. It is one of several stories about Harry Potter, a young boy who thought he was quite normal until he found out he was a wizard. The three books published so far are about Harry and his time at Hogwart's School of Wizardry and Witchcraft. Each book covers a full year at the school. This book is his second year and his search for the secrets within the castle of Hogwarts. If you like Roald Dahl or C.S. Lewis, you will love Harry Potter and his adventures. This book is one of many excellent stories. A must for any parent who loves fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!","review":"All 3 of the Harry Potter books are great. They are so enjoyable to read with the family. If you think these books are bad in a way that they show violence then you are wrong. I would recommend these books to all ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Chamber of Secrets reads like a charicature. All the characters are in place. The bad ones act their role and do bad things, while the good ones try to keep out of trouble. There is no character development, no new information, no additional dimension to the story. It's like watching string puppets going through the motions. The first Harry Potter was good, though, and the third one seems better than the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Service","review":"Book arrived quickly and in excellent condition.

Along the way Harry is confronted several times with his ultimate enemy, Draco Malfoy, who will stop at nothing to get the best of the, \\"so called,\\" famous Harry Potter.

Rowling's Harry Potter series, delivering chills, scares,delight, and surprises! We find Harry in his second year at Hogwarts, and he's surrounded by the same friends and enemies, but that's where the sameness ends and the differentness begins! New characters show up, new adventures are introduced, new horrors await.Danger is on the loose at Hogwarts, and many people believe that Harry's to blame. Harry's got a new fame-hungry professor to dodge, Quidditch matches to win, friends to protect, and mysteries to solve. The story unfolds at a rapid pace, and the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets is intriguing.In the Harry Potter books, Rowling has created a fantastic world of magic in the vein of C.S. Lewis' NARNIA, Madeleine L'Engle's A WRINKLE IN TIME, or Roald Dahl's MATILDA. Any fans of fantasy should be sure to read the Harry Potter books, as they hold their own alongside these classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful narration","review":"This is a great book and the Narrator is fantastic.

Harry in this book changed a bit more. Harry started to noticed girls. He also started to become more responsible of his actions. Harry grows and grows as the story or the series keeps going. In this book Harry didn't change a whole lot, Harry is becoming a teenager just like any other high school student. The second book was great because nobody knew who was realy petrefying everyone at Hogwarts. And then at the end you find out that Riddle was the one who send the creature lose at Hogwarts. So that's pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronald Castillo's Review","review":"I think that this book was a very good because there was a lot more action than there was in the first book. In this book Harry left the Dursleys a lot earlier and he went to Hogwarts a lot faster because in the first book it took at least one hundred pages until he got to Hogwarts. The bad thing was that in the movie a lot of parts were taken out. The chapter \\"The Death Party\\" was taken out. The movie was a lot better than the first one though.The movie was a lot better than the first one only because there was more action. The first movie had less things taken out of it. I think that the death party should of been in the movie because that is how you can find out what nick is saying about the headless hunt. They should of also put in the thing that Harry found out that Filch was a squibble. This is how the people who saw the movie know why Filch hates the wizards and witches that come to hogwarts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicks Review on Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was a great book. It is one of my all time favorites. The book starts when Harry is at his aunt and uncles house for the summer. His aunt and uncle are having company over, so Harry had to go wait in his room quietly until they left. Then out of know were an elf comes and tells Harry that he can't go to school this year. But Harry would let nothing stand in the way of him and his school/home (Hogwarts).That year at Hogwarts a bunch of people get petrified, which means they can do nothing, but they are still alive. Do these strange events have anything to do with the elf that came to Harry's house? Was the elf right, should Harry have not gone to school? Will anything happen to Harry?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pagan indoctrination","review":"My 9yo son is now fully prepared for life in our coven...I hope nobody took that seriously.A bit formulaic (hence only 4 stars) but otherwise fabulous.

Here he just almost gets killed.<end spoiler>I agree with most of the other superlatives tossed about here, and I would like to add a thought directed at the people who think this book is evil: while childrens' thoughts are influenced by what they read and by what they see, the primary influence is how _you_ act. You should only fear this book if you fear the example you are setting for your own children.

The story line is not complicated and it is very easy to build a mental picture. Now, for those adults that don't understand what all the \\"hype\\" is all about: HARRY POTTER IS A CHILDRENS BOOK!

I found it an enjoyable fantasty read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know Why I like It; I Don't Know Why the Rest of You Do","review":"The Harry Potter Books are all quite good, if not quite as good as their press. Harry Potter himself is an engaging, if not particularly complex, young man, and his collection of friends and enemies at school are, if a bit overly broadly drawn, eminently enjoyable.On the other hand, collectively the books aren't a patch on Diane Duane's Wizard books. (Start with http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0152012397.) Why the Harry Potter books have become modern classics, and the Duane books haven't will remain a mystery.At least to me. Everything that the Harry Potter books do, much juvenile science fiction and fantasy does better, and has done better for a long time. The Heinlein juveniles are simply, in every respect, better books, as are the Duane books.So: read the Harry Potter books; they're good. But don't stop there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever!","review":"I like this book because it was such an adventure to explorer Harry Potter. It was very interesting.

I absolutely love this book, I want to read the next one! I rate this book 5 stars because it was excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Critics Don't Lie...","review":"...Well, perhaps they CAN be wrong sometimes, but not in this case. I'd never even *heard* of Harry Potter, but was passing a favorite bookstore and saw it in the window. Having grown up on C.S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, and such novelists, I saw the cover and was instantly drawn in.I was certainly NOT disappointed! Rowling has a way of transcending the barrier between children's fiction and adult fiction. I'm 39 years of age, and an engineer, and I read The Wall Street Journal, but I also highly recommend the Harry Potter series. Even if you don't read them in order, which is how I've done it, you won't be disappointed. Rowling's imagination and wit have no bounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Yes, another winner Harry Potter book! JK Rowling has done it again. I liked the first book a bit better, really only because I liked the story better... but this was another \\"can't put it down\\" book. JK Rowling has an incredible knack for being able to plot her stories so well you can never guess the outcome... you may think you have... but then it goes another direction... one you hadn't even considered! The plots are very well thought out and come together flawlessly at the end. After each book, I can't wait for the next! Read book 3 too, you'll LOVE IT! I can't wait for #4.

The book is appropriate for any child who can sit and listen. My son learns something now, at the age of six, and will love it when he is 12, from a different prospective. The book also offers me, as a parent, an opportunity to remember how it felt to be a child, and to better relate to my own children. I dread the thought that one day we will finish all three parts (now we are in the middle of the chamber of secrets, and already looking forward the prisoner of Azbakan). enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowlings is a hit with my middle school students!","review":"Anyone who works with children should read this book.

The story doesn't really get to the guts of the book until the second half. Then it starts to pick up. I like the very end the most. Overall I still enjoy reading it (compared to Book 1) and do admire the very innovative imagination of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Harry Potter.","review":"I\`m sure anyone would like this book. It\`s like you\`re in the story as you\`re reading it. I would suggest this book to anyone. Harry couldn\`t stand living with the Dursleys. (I\`m sure it would be a pain for you too). You'll have to read it to find out what the Weasley's are driving around town these days. Strange things are happening at Hogwart's and not a soul knows who did it. Someone is stopping Harry\`s birthday letters and Harry thinks his friends don\`t care about him. If I would say, It\`s a great sequal to Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone. When you\`re done with this review go ask your mom or dad or gaurdian to go to the book store and get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Novel","review":"I really enjoyed reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I liked it because it was one of thoes books where it's good from the first page all the way to the last word. Some books I read and it doesn't really get into the plot until half ways through the book. Another thing I enjoyed about this book was that after reading it I went back and looked at the front cover and the pictures that are on the page when you start a new chapter, and it looks just like how I read it. This book really got exciting in the last fifty pages or so, because Harry was finally going to do what he has been planning in his summer at Hogwarts. I wouldn't suggest reading this book until you have read Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrated","review":"I had to send this item back because it was cassette not CD as the other set that I bought and there was not a cassette player in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are peple raving?","review":"When I first read this book I was \\"in love\\".

It is the 2nd book in the 7 book series, Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard who's invited to attend Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. Hogwarts is in a valley by a lake and is enchanted so if a human (wizards call them \`Muggles') sees it, it appears as old ruins. Strange attacks are happening at the school and people are becoming petrified. Harry's friend Hermione becomes petrified by a beast called a basilisk. Harry enters the chamber with his friend Ron and professor Lockhart to try and stop the attacks. Will he make it out of the chamber in one piece? This is thrilling all the way through it.

Then I thought maybe I was mistaken and read the second and this is even less of a big deal. OK, I suppose kids with a short attention spann like all those things going on and it's probably great fun for them but as an adult (and after all, all these reviews seem to be from adults)I find it extremely shallow. I think the difference is this: Potters magic relates simply to changing things: this turnesinto that, cars can fly, and so on. But as I said, HP probably greatfor kids, obviously, they love it and I don't want to spoil their fun. But I would advise adults to look futher, deeper: magic isn't just hocus-pocus, abracadabra!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this was not that great","review":"this book put me to sleep by the 2nd chapter i know people think this book was gonna be the greatest thing but I think it was the opposite of that.All these other reviews say how great it was well this one says its not. if u expect it to be as good as the first..you will be dissapointed. its like a long bedtime story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorcer's Stone 2?","review":"I really have enjoyed the Harry Potter series, but found the second in the series to be rather uninspired.

I find the Quidditch area of the book exciting. Oh whenever I read the book how I wish Hogwarts were real and I could be a student there. Never a dull momment (unlike math class) makes it enjoyable. There is one thing I reccomend, though. Have a piece of paper handy to write down any little detail. It just might come in handy. Take the little brown package, or Quirrel's turban, for instance. I kept track of how he never took it off and how the little package contained the heart of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"I just finished reading the book. It is the second one I read of the series. I totally enjoyed it. Even though it is a children's book, but adults can enjoy it and learn lessons from it too.It is MAGICAL, keeps you entertained waiting to see what is going to happen and it never fails to surprise you! I think it contains a lot of messages for kids to see through themselves and figure out good and bad, right and wrong. Even for me (a grown up) it opened my eyes to simple truths that we tend to forget sometimes and try to act \\"wisely\\"!Harry, Ron and Hermione face a problem and try to solve it.

Even though I am at this age I still love reading these books. I plan on reading the rest of her books. I think Ms. Rowling is a great writter she describes the characters in a great way. I can almost imagine what the characters look like and the expressions on there faces. When I read Harry Potters first book, I couldn't put it down. I think Harry is a great character with his friends. The second book was the best because I really didn't think that, Who's Name Must Not Be Said could have appeared back into the story. In the first book I thought that Snape was the one who was trying to kill Harry.

The book's author is J.K. Rowling. What a wonderful talent she has for writing.The setting of this book takes place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. In the beginning of the book a house elf magically appears in Harry Potter's room. In the middle of the book Harry & his two friends find out about the chamber of secrets. At the end of the book, does a mudblood die or does she live?This is definitely a five-star book. This is a five-star book because it is a mystery & has a great deal of action in it. The mystery is about the chamber & what is in it. There was constant fighting in the book. This book is only one more star than Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone.This book has three awards.

Then, my kids got interested in him while visiting their father. At his house, Harry was all that! So, being the mom meant checking Harry out. Now, I wish all the Christian world would embrace the world of Harry Potter! There is much to instruct, uplift, and challenge us. We loved \\"Chamber of secrets\\"! The imagery is vivid, and the characters real in their response to the circumstances in which they find themselves. We learned from their mistakes and triumphs.

He does great voices and adds lots of excitement to the story. And amazingly the voices he uses are very similar to the voices used in the movies. I was afraid that after reading the books and seeing the movies that listning to Harry Potter on tape would just be too much and I would start to get sick of it, but I was so wrong. I plan to listen to these books on tape over and over again.

It's so hard to put down. Rowling did a great job, she's so creative! I didn't read the first Harry Book of the series, but I could figure out what was going on, and what had pretty much happened in the first book. Harry and his two best friends do a great job of finding out who is responsible for TRICKING someone into opening the secret chamber. Harry, what a brave wizard!

Also an old student comes back to haunt their memories. I would recommend this book because every chapter is a mystery. It is a very,very,very awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Entertaining","review":"Exceedingly better than the first book which I enjoyed tremendously. This book has the advantage of not requiring lengthy character introductions. However in the book's beginning chapters the author has intermittently provided brief overviews about the first books events. Although helpful to novice Harry Potter reader begining with book two, the overviews can be somewhat distracting to the veteran reader who is anxiously anticipating future happenings. Thankfully most of the first book's information is successfully regurgitated early on and both novice and veteran reader alike are quickly boarded on the Hogwart's Express. This book's plot tends to be more suspenseful and intricate. With each successive chapter the reader is involved more deeply in this magical mystery. In summary I can only comment on the fact that I have begun book three without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but read book#1 first if you have not.","review":"I bought the first four harry potter books about a year ago and did not have the time to read them until last week. I was wondering why the series was such a big hit and I found out. The books put you in a made up world you do not want to stop reading about.After reading the first book, I had to go read the second one right away. That is how engrossing the books are. I could not put this book down either. I do not want to talk about the actual plot of the story for fear of giving something away. All I can say is that, after reading the second book in the series, I want to tread the thir. A very enjoyable read. This series is fun. If that is what you are looking for get this book. You wouldn't want to skip it because each book represents a year of Harry Potter's life at the Hogwarts school. I read in a biography magazine article that Rowlings plans to do 7 books total, one for each year of schooling. GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Review by Kelly BondCaption: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rating: 4 starsI thought that the characters were interesting. I thought that Harry was the best because he played tricks. Harry kept getting away with everything even though his uncle treated him bad. The dwarf kept coming up in strange places and no one else saw him except for Harry. There was one part when Harry was at school. Harry and his friends were trying to get something upstairs. He was not allowed to go upstairs but he did it anyway by waiting until everyone else was asleep. He got caught but again got out of trouble. He is a good person to play sneaky tricks. Harry could also use his magic cape to get anywhere he wanted to go.

However, word of warning to parents of younger children, this book is much more intense, and much scarier than the first Harry Potter book. This book may not be suitable for younger children (9 or under). Towards the end of the book, Harry encounters hordes of spiders...one of the size of an elephant! Yikes! Then, the battle between Harry and the 20-foot serpent occurs. It is extremely well written, but may frighten younger children. With that said, it is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it (for anyone over the age of 10)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets WOW!","review":"This is a great book for ages 6 and up.

Rowling is a well-written and imaginative book. One might think that Rowling herself has been to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with as much detail that she manages to incorporate in her book about the school and the three main characters: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasly.This book is for anyone who enjoys adventure and mysteries or has a vivid imagination, and wants to explore the possibilities of a magical world where people can cook, clean, and get to the store all with a wave of their wand holding hands.

Harry Potter is charming, endearing, and loveable. J.K. Rowling spins such a wonderful tale of suspense, humor, and imagination. I wish I could go to Hogwarts to meet all these characters with wonderful names, to fly around on brooms, to play Quidditch, and to wander around the castle. I'm 32 and these are two of the best books I've read all year. Join the adventure. Let your imagination run wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant prose and engaging story structure","review":"I have never so thoroughly enjoyed a children's book as I have the first two books on Harry Potter (and only because I have yet to find and buy the Prisoner of Azkaban).

He finds friends ( although he had none before)named Hermoine and Ron who are nice people.He finds something is wrong and explores. I'm not telling you the rest because it's so neat.If you like to read books read this! I swear, it is so good I could not put it down! There's always new things popping up, even a boa constrictor that goes on top of Harry's cousin (he hates his cousin)! Although it's 308.5 pages long it's very, very, very hard to put down! GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little darker than the first book","review":"This has some very funny moments, esp in the girls bathroom but overall a darker tale, that further chronicles Harry's complex past.

It also makes you wonder if there really is a witch world and we are just Muggles, or if there really is a kid somewhere like the heroic Harry Potter. I think this book had more suspense than the first one Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I loved that one also. They say that these books are Children's Books, but I do not believe that to be true. Everyone no matter what age will come to love these great stories about the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and even to come to dislike Malfoy. The characters in this book are beautifully described so that you can think of people who are exactly like them. I consider Hermoine like myself. J.K. Rowling is a great author and one day I wish to write books as great as her soon-to-be classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"It's a really great book if you like magic and wizards.

The reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, was because it was slow in the beginning, and there was some violence. It was adventourous and kept me interested throughout it. It leaves you guessing what happens next and there are magical animals in it that you will wish that are real. Someone that will like this book is someone that likes adventures, science fiction and fantasy. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I was first intruduced to Harry Potter books I gotreally into Harry POtter.I was so amazed when I read the first couple of chapters in the first Harry Potter books. Harry Potter and his friends were so amazing and adventures. After that book I wanted to read more of his books so I read The second and third book. I thought that J.K. Rowling was a very talented Authur and very talented at thinking of adventurouse things to put in the book. So here I am, I already read all three of the books and I am waiting for the fourth to come out and I am anxious to read the fourth.

There was nothing realistic about this book. It was boring and not any fun to read. I don't believe in things like Muggles or flying cars and I am not interested in things like that either!

I finally got to the chapter, \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\", and STOPPED READING! i couldn't stand the book any longer. It was taking so long to get to that chapter, that i didn't even CARE ANYMORE! I suggest seeing the movie, instead of wasting your life reading. I wish the books never came out, but the movies did. My brother loves all the harry potter books, but i hate them. Each time one comes out, he buys it, and spend more than a week in his room JUST READING IT! HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE! Just watch the movie. I don't plan on finishing this book, or for that matter, ever reading a whole harry potter book the rest of my life. Don't waste your money, save it for the movie.-Rita"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I will not let my children read this book. There certainly is a big 'rave' about this series of books, but the influence and ideas it will give children is quite distrubing. There are many books out there that captivate children's minds without witches and the such. Children are what they think, they think based upon what they read.The book itself was very captivating, which is awesome for children, but the content which captivated them is scary.Potter's imagination is awesome, I hope the author will write more books, just on another caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for children.","review":"We have read this book and feel it has no place in the hands of children. This book is at best an introduction into witchcraft.It reaches out to children with tales of sorcery and spells. It glorifies revenge.It puts down family values and their concept. The main character's parents are blown up and murdered. The book states that \\"Death is the next Great Adventure\\". This book is close to being banned in 5 states and rightfully so.Our children in this day in age need to embrace family values and be taught to treasure life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacriligious Heretical Garbage","review":"I got two words for you: Terrible book.Need I say more. Harry Potter is an infidel and terrible role model for today's youth. This book is a pure waste of time and further more, it should not be allowed to be read by children - or anybody for that matter - due to its magic, witchcraft, atheist propaganda as well as for its sheer lack of literary value.Read something of real value - like Shakespeare - my mistake - that's probably a little too cultivated for Harry Potter readers.Don't waste your time with this - pure torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter book #2","review":"Audio books are my preferred way of enjoying a book.

The springs have nail-sharp points on them that, when clamped with the lightest pressure I could and still hold the mitre, punched varying holes and gouges in the wood. I even tried one on the nice wooden box they were shipped in and it dug into the side. (Did the return department notice that?)I'm not sure what application one would use where gouging the wood is an acceptable part of clamping.

I've been looking for \\"Awakening,\\" now \\"Cosmic Force,\\" ever since the advent of CDs. Now that it's available on DTS Stereo only, I still can't play it because my regular stereo system won't allow it. How very dissapointing! I can't play these types of CDs on my home stereo system nor in my car. What's a poor guy to do? Can anyone out there help? How about you, Amazon?

BUT if you want great orchestrations in the Parsons vein, great dynamics and a SUPER 6-channel mix, then look no further. This sounds as good (and in some cases BETTER) as most DVD-Audio recordings.

There were clips that were supposed to hold the necklace in place and they had been torqued down way too tightly on the necklace causing major crimps in the \\"ribbon of gold\\"!! Whoever packed it, destroyed it!!Box was cheap and bottom bowed outwards so that it did not sit flat on a table. Blue velvet looked very worn in spots. One cardboard piece inside the box had fallen off the rusty metal interior. Looked like it had been glued years ago with a hot glue gun that didn't hold. I had to throw out the box and come up with something presentable myself.Necklace is wide, but very, very thin and it gets dented very easily! (see above) Yes, it has a nice, shiny yellow color, but it is very fragile!

My only complaint is that at the 20\\" length, it sometimes rides up higher on the back of my neck, but I'll figure out how to remedy that. Maybe better posture will help. The presentation was extraordinary. I wondered about the shipping weight for a necklace that weighs a mere 7.3g, but it was delivered inside a huge white satin lined velvet presentation box within a nice cardboard box, both are dark, dark blue. I do not keep this necklace on at all times because although it's substantial for the style, it is delicate.

It fabricates a deeply emotional affect on the esoteric inner depths of ones soul and engenders a feeling of spirituality unknown to this world of existence.

They were never quite this overpurely blissed-out again -- the Cocteau Twins, I mean, not my ears -- \\"Victorialand\\" represents an apex, more so because its organicness, its sunlight and its masses of airborne pollen were such a contrast to the chilly leaded-glass chamber-rock of \\"Treasure,\\" its predecessor.

It's way different than \\"Heaven Or Las Vegas\\", \\"Treasure\\" or \\"Blue Bell Knoll\\", but has it's own magic. It's hard to describe their appeal. They just take u to their own little land, on the planet Victoria. These sounds are ancient, they form a wave and a sea of emotional sounds from \\"Lazy Calm\\" to the majestic \\"The Thinner The Air\\" ( which made Massive Attack pick Elizabeth Fraser as a vocalist for their \\"Mezannine\\" album ).

Do not be misled by the blurb on the jacket.Bush's writing doesn't have the zing of Evanovich's stories, and the first-person narrative from the heroine is full of long descriptive passages detailing how someone's yard looks or what kind of food is being eaten. The dialogue is fine, but there's simply not enough of it to make up for the long descriptive passages detailing what kind of room the narrator is in and what things are hanging up in it. The long passages made it hard for me to stay interested in the pedestrian plot (sorely lacking in action and dialogue), and I ended up skipping the last 100 pages to get to the ending.I will not read another book in this series, but will read the next Evanocich book.

Reading the account of two foreign cultures trying to communicate through a computer program, and having the participant on their side being rather of a mystic bent, makes for some very interesting stuff, as simple as kid's adventure, and as inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"In creating a 2D world Dewdney expands our 3D vision","review":"This is a great book. By creating a 2D world Dewdney expands our 3D vision.In reading this book I was reminded of not only Abbott's Flatland (which was the original inspiration) I was also reminded of Charles Hinton's Fourth Dimension and Choas Coincidence and All That Math Jazz.In each work, the writers effectively used 2D analogies to give us an idea of what 4D space might be like.What Dewdney did however was to build detail into what has always been a simple model and thereby give greater detail to the potentialities of our vision.While others have said that this book would be great for mathematicians I would offer that this book is great for anyone seeking to expand their horizons.As Henry David Thoreau wrote in concluding his Walden: \\"There is more light to day than dawn.

I am deeply concerned with the dismal state of the foster care system and the impact of it on our community's children. I have also been a foster parent. Ms. McLain's writing is powerful and personal, a beautiful and touching memoir allowing the rest of us to experience the abysmal consequences of parenting taken too lightly (by biological parents or misguided fosters or officials entrusted with responsibility). The reader does not have to have a specific interest in this topic to be moved and gain value and insight. Ms. McLain takes full responsibility as an adult to have her own life work, even with the vestiges of her childhood forever present. No whining here, which makes it all the more powerful. A quick read, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written telling the story of a tough childhood","review":"Paula McLain's book is excellent.

It is filled to bursting with sexual innuendo and crude, cheap jokes.

However, in order to save his village he risks his own life and becomes forever, a part of Chinese traditional folklore. Mary Casanova does a fascinating job of writing a simple folktale in a detailed and interesting manner. She uses descriptive word combinations to convey rich colors and exciting characters. Casanova's text reads like a poem, such as when the Dragon King of the Sea shows Hai Li Bu, \\"sparkling red rubbies, ocean blue sapphires, and shimmering pink pearls.\\" The illustrations further, compliment the story, with their abstract style and earth tone coloration.

Meghan Collins, a young, ambitious reporter, finds herself struggling to keep her job while trying to unlock her father's past. Meghan is recieving phone calls thet sound exactly like her father, Edwin Collins, who supposedly died in the Tappan Zee Bridge disaster. No one found any remains of him or his car so the authorities could not declare his death. In another scene, the police found Edwin's car parked in front of Meghan's apartment. She didn't know what to believe. Throughout the book, Meghan comes to face fears and feelings that she's held inside for years. We would recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense. There are many hardships and tragedies and you'll be on the edge of your seat. You won't put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspenseful Read","review":"This is one of my favorite Clark books. The multi-layered mystery kept me fascinated all throughout the book. Unlike some of Clark's main characters, the protagonist in the book, Meghan, actually gets out there and does something to try and solve the murder instead of moping around the house all day. There were two things I did not like about the book, however. First, I didn't like who the murderer was. I realize Clark gives a twist at the end of her books and I appreciate that, but I just didn't like the way this one ended. Secondly, we do not find out what happens to one of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacroiliac Belt","review":"I've used this belt before for SI problems that put me down for about six weeks. The belt helps so much (paired with home exercise) and I ran the Napa Marathon after four weeks of being on the belt. The only problem: while the belt helps to support the SI and surrounding tendons, the IT (iliotibial band that runs down the sides of your legs) doesn't receive the support of your back because it's being cut off from the belt. After recovering from SI, I began suffering from IT in both legs which put me down another three weeks.

And after the \\"greatest hits\\" album Most Wanted (contract fulfillment, perhaps?), she comes back at us with Dignity.Basically, I can see where Parkin is coming from when s/he suggested that a lot of these songs sound like they didn't make Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor. Many of the songs go by without being too memorable, like \\"No Work, All Play\\", \\"Never Stop\\" and the overrated \\"With Love\\". There are also some songs that could stand a rewrite or two, like \\"Between You and Me\\", \\"Dreamer\\" and especially \\"Gypsy Woman\\".Another flaw is that Hilary still isn't the greatest singer, but on songs like \\"Happy\\" and \\"Burned\\", she doesn't even sound like she's trying.

The things you have to do: Fix up the farm, make friends with the towns people, marry one of the 5 eligible bachelors (Gray, Doctor, Cliff, Kai, and Rick), and raise your farm animals right.One of the things that I like about HM is that it educates you; it really teaches you how hard it is to raise a farm and to have a personal life also.

I like that you don't have to mess with the touch screen when dealing with your animals.This game is only one of an entire franchise of addictive games. It's good for little kids and adults alike, so I recommend it.As for shipping, the item came packaged in a bubble wrap-lined envelope without a box or even a case. It was just the cartridge. Still, I actually prefer that because it generates less waste in the long run (I would have just thrown out the box anyway). Overall, great product.

It's used in a room where a litter box is located so I like the fact I can close-off the openings not being used and keep the dust out.

And you are eating this up the whole time, because it seems that Harris is once again quite the masterful story teller. But then you get to the last few chapters.The best way I can describe it is it seems like he took his time and thought out every little detail like it was the master term paper. But then all of a sudden he realizes he doesn't have the time needed to finish it so he rushes it and throws an ending together. It was almost like to different authors. And of the ending!

Therefore, I try to pick one that stands a chance of capturing my interest and imagination. From the outset, I knew that \\"Hannibal\\" was a major disappointment. It is gore for the sake of gore. None of the characters are believable, and most of the situations described are ludicrous, even for fiction! Word has it that they are filming this one, too. I can't imagine that even the genius of Jody Foster and Anthony Hopkins can save this pointless bloodbath.

Harris didn't have it for long, and he lost it quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was such a disappointment.","review":"After waiting so many years for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, I was greatly disappointed when I read this book. I found it mundane and boring. I was hoping for a more in-depth study of the characters of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lechter and the things that made them such wonderful opponents. I was highly surprised to discover the fact that Harris just wanted to get rid of them. If he writes another book, I'll wait for the paperback or check it out from the library.

So many things were wrong with this story that I cannot go into them. The dinner scene near the end was just gross. I kept waiting for the scary parts, but it was just babble.

Why oh why did I read the whole thing?? The ending was unforgivable. This is required reading for sociopaths-in-training.

I was expecting -- eagerly expecting -- a sequel to the masterful \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", with Clarice Starling, a talented young woman of determination and principle, and Dr. Lector, her brilliant, esoteric, monstrously self-disciplined mentor. But the principal characters in this book resemble their former incarnations in little besides their names. This Starling, while surpassing the former in physical courage, is a moral and spiritual coward; Lector has evolved into an ostentatious moon-calf. Moreover, the atmosphere, so chilling in the original novel, is this time merely sordid -- if not downright sickening. I think Harris should give serious thought to writing \\"Hannibal II, Another Option\\", this time at least keeping his characters in character."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star, Only Because None's Not an Option","review":"Disappointing, beyond belief! I've liked all three of Harris' earlier books, including both with Lechter, and found them thoughtful, thrilling, and gritty. Better than \\"genre fare.\\" But great thrillers need great villians, and the Lechter victim seeking revenge here is lamely underwritten, and foolishly cartoonish -- a hideous, disfigured, crippled meat packing czar who agents are secretly breeding the Terror Pigs of Europe as his instrument of vengeance. This is like something out of Danger Mouse or Inspector Gadget; James Belushi, not James Ellroy. Pathetic. The ending (interesting in principle) is so poorly developed and prepared that it turns preposterous, unconvincing, and arbitrary.

I love suspense, mystery, horror and read them by the dozens. This one was just not engaging, not to mention far below Harris' other work. Even the worst King was far superior to Hannibal.2. As a professional writer and editor with over 20 years in the field, the errors in the book appalled me.

That is to be expected by anyone who has read his previous novels or seen the movies that were made from them. But in \\"Hannibal,\\" unlike the other two novels, there is no heroism, no integrity, no justice. There is simply evil - everywhere, in everyone.

(I'm sure they'll have *lots* of donated copies!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Silence","review":"Unlike its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a horror story straight through. Its intention appears to make the reader recoil in dread rather than to follow the psychological spins and games of Lecter. None of the major characters in the book appear to have a reasonable motivation for their perversities -- rather they seem to be perverse for the sake of perversity and are therefore mostly contemptible. The antihero Lecter also appears to have lost the gamemaster-like quality in Silence, transforming into some Phantomesque alien being capable of superhuman feats without qualification. Some of the descriptions of his actions bear notice, since they are given a precision and refinement simply through the execution of language; however, this in itself is not sufficient to solidify Hannibal. Neither are the lame attempts to create a psychological background from which a monster like Lecter could spring.

Yeah, it's supposed to be a potboiler thriller, but that doesn't mean the writing can't be artful. And if Harris can't achieve that, at least he could come up with some new ideas. Hannibal is just a collection of \\"here's something gross\\" scenery. A few good pages set in Italy paid for an \\"business travel\\" tax deduction, so at least Harris got something for his efforts.

About the characters, Mason Verger..who ate his own face and survived (yeah right) to the cop in Italy, there was not one socially redeeming quality among them.Then at the end, Harrris further insults our intelligence by having Clarice Starling cohabitating with Dr. Lecter.

I understand David Mamet is drafting the screenplay: I hope he keeps the title and chucks the rest.Good points? Well the writing is as sharp as ever, not one word wasted, there's obviously a sharp mind behind it all.

You've been warned"},{"rating":"2","title":"bloody good....","review":"A page and stomach turner...full of dark humour where the author at laughs you: we complain about the ending? Yet how many of us pay good money to read such books and watch similar movies...it's about the morbidity in all our minds. The ending could not have been any other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT TOOK 10+ YEARS TO WRITE THIS?!?!?!?!","review":"Wow. Wow. Wow. I just finished reading HANNIBAL and I'm stunned. Stunned that the same writer of RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS wrote this book. I can't stress how disappointed I am and how awful this book is. If it was any other writer and any other book, I wouldn't even have bothered to finish it. This book is so bad, it feels like something that was rushed to print to capitalize on the success of SILENCE, not something that took 10+ years to write!All I can say is, I wish Amazon let you give \\"0\\" stars as a rating option because that's what this \\"book\\" deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"HANNIBAL'S WINDOW","review":"I read it through, finding many endearing metaphors, I intend to revisit. This book approaches from a stranger perspective. At times, it pushes \\"we\\" away then brings us in, into Hannibal's inner world and a darkerville of Clarice. Where it ends, I'm sorry, what the hell was that? I'm laughing, sick and wonderful. Besides ending, this is a four-star book. Will they movie-it? pass the ham sandwich *grin*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody pass me my anti-arrythmia pills.","review":"I love Silence of The Lambs. I always like the macabre, so despite hearing all about the gruesome brain-eating and quasi-psychosexual scenes, I thought, \\"What the heck, I can stomach anything. This is Thomas Harris, what can go wrong?\\"Plenty, as it happened. When I finish this book, I feel so queasy and sick in my stomach. I'll pass the chicken, give me a salad please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible Endings (In the good sense of the word)","review":"The first time I realized that there was a problem was when the book should have ended, but did not. I got to what I saw as the logical (and cinematic) climax and saw 50 pages ahead of me.I had an inkling as to what was coming. To be sure, I was hoping I was wrong. I was not.When I finished the book, I was uneasy. The ending disturbed me, as I'm sure it did most of you. It was a deamlike descent -- not just for the characters, but for the reader.Harris did not write a screenplay, he wrote a horror novel. My sense of uneasiness did not come from a poor ending, but rather the only ending he could have given the book: good is destroyed, evil remains.In fact, the evil that we were all rooting for (and Hannibal is a hero, no doubt about it) was the victor. Complaining about this is not only hypocritical, but misses the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Forget the Star Wars backlash. Hannibal is the true pop-culture disappointment of the summer. The book was actually in three- to four-star territory for a while. As outlandish and macabre as the new characters and situations are, they're never boring, and the novel zipped along...until the final chapters. Harris' resolution is a four-alarm misfire, a sick joke played upon his readers. He sacrifices characterization and logic for shock value, and the result will leave a bad taste in a lot of mouths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal rocks!","review":"The third installment of the Hannibal trilogy is audacious, appalling, and a complete blast! Granted, the plot is out there--way out there, actually--but Harris' pacing, restraint and the utter authenticity of Lecter and Starling make it cook and keep it real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest book disappointment of my life!","review":"Never would I have believed that this book, that I have anticipated so much, would end up being the worst book I ever read. What Harris obviously wanted to do was put an end to Hannibal and what better way than to give such an unbelievable ending. I feel cheated. I wish I had never read it....."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pressure to write the sequel results in a bad book","review":"Uh Oh! I am sad at having bought into the idea that this book might come close to the genius of Silence of the Lambs. Now that was a book that I couldn't put down! This one I put down a lot! I wanted to love this book, but I couldn't. I agree with the general consensus...the beginning was stupid, the middle very interesting, and the end a complete waste of paper.What a huge disappointment! Please dont make this into a film....at least not with good actors. You might just ruin their careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I could not wait for this book to be published! I wrote the date on my calendar so I could pick it up the day it was released. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The ending was so ridiculous that I just skimmed the last few pages. I would definitely recommend waiting until the paperback comes out or borrowing it from the library. I didn't even offer it to any friends to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I regret the time I wasted reading this book. The plotting is simplistic and the juvenile ending hardly worthy of a teen horror flick. The constant shift of perspective and person (first person plural?) does not help. Dr. Lector as protagonist? I don't think so! Endowing him with a horrible childhood event, Harris wants to justify everything Lector does as somehow acceptable. He attempts to excuse Lector with the same simplistic psychology (\\"Poor Hannibal, he can't help himself!) he satirizes in the novel. I had more sympathy for the professional killers. At least, they had some trace of an ethical system. Finally, there is the poor Clarise. Harris has become the cannibal, feeding her to Lector who devours her psyche and repeatedly \\"rapes\\" her in a doubly incestuous relationship. I hardly think even poor Mishe would approve (she of the tooth in the toilet). This book belongs in the toilet! I recommend it for the remainder stack, the sooner the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be disappointed.","review":"I know you don't want to hear it, but unfortunately it's true. This book is terrible! How can it be that a writer as talented as Harris has produced this? Unbelievably bad. A huge, huge, disappointment and a giant missed opportunity for Harris. If you have fond memories of Starling & Hannibal, do not taint them by reading this rubbish; keep your memories of the characters as they currently stand. Spend your time & money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of sizzle, but no steak","review":"If a writer takes 10 years to create a novel, I would expect a bit more plot. Harris is long on details of Lecter's tastes, and excrutiatingly hammers home Lecter's genuis. Enough already; we get it. The plot was thin, but the ending was so disturbing, confusing and frankly a literary betrayal. It was ridiculously out of character for Starling and difficult to stomach. Rarely have I read something that left me feeling so angry at the end. Harris takes a character we have come to honor and respect and turns her into a monster's whore. What a lame excuse for an ending. I love Harris's earlier work and had been eagerly anticipating this book. What a sad thing it is. Maybe the movie will be a bit less disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bye, Hannibal, and good riddance!","review":"I hated this book and the characters!! I really enjoy mystery/thrillers but this was too much. I read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and loved them. So, I was looking forward to Hannibal. I am so glad that I borrowed a copy and did not spend my cash on it. I felt that the whole intent was to discribe the most despicable characters doing the most despicable things. In that sense, it was a success. If you expect the quality and suspense of the first two books, I think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book vs. the movie","review":"Hannibal the book is by far much better than the movie, as is usually the case. One thing I know for certain, without giving away the plot, is that I will never look at pigs the same way. Hannibal is truly clever and intelligent; and, though, his character makes him out to be cruel and inhumane, you almost admire him because he is above the rest. The ending made my stomach turn. Then, it surprised me. A great read... it goes quick once you're into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Harris Novel","review":"Even though I read this book out of order, I was impressed with Harris and his effort. However, he did get a little long winded at times but he compensated with a great tale of suspence and wonderment of what Hannibal the Cannibel would do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment, mediocre sequel","review":"The novel is certainly exciting and entertaining because it makes your heart pound with sheer adrenaline. The dangerous cat and mouse game that Pazzi and Lecter play--who is the mouse?--is one of the most fun parts of \\"Hannibal\\". We all realize early on that Pazzi will be one of Lecter's victims and suffer a ghastly death, but Pazzi's manner of death, when it does come, is beyond apalling. It is fierce, bloody, and well executed.The main disappointment was the revelation of Lecter's source of madness. I have always maintained that although Lecter is evil by nature, he seems to have a moral reason for killing. He ascribes to some higher understanding that his victims are too stupid to see. Only the select few can come into contact with him and not die. Disclosing his violent and cannabalistic nature as resulting from his sister's young death was a bit disappointing. I would have preferred Lecter's evil to be shrouded in mystery and incomprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"intrigued until the disappointing end","review":"I could not believe such an ingeniously intelligent writer such a Thomas Harris could sell out his integrity like this. Red Dragon gave me nightmares and in my opinion is still one of the best horror stories I have ever read. Selling out at the end is a sacrilege, to the characters, the reader and last of all to Thomas Harris. I will admit that it is a good read until the last 2 chapters. If you just want to read another Thomas Harris book this will do, but if you are an avid fan as I was this book will disapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Only THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY can match HANNIBAL for simmering intensity, chilling psychoterror, and depth of theme. This is a multi-dimensional work, perhaps too subtle for many, and certainly controversial. But it is worht reading, and that should count for a lot indeed. No, it is not perfect, but what is ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, pretentious fairy tale","review":"Sorry. This novel is awful. A dull fairy tale that becomes less and less credible as it goes on, and ends up being just very very silly. Poor Mr Harris. Does he really think evoking all that Dante and cullenary nonsense make Lecter sophisticated? Oh dear. Harris has revealed something about himself in this novel that I'd never suspected of him: utter mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel, but the ending is a stretch","review":"The book overall is quite good. Harris does a good job with the details, something that has been characteristic of his previous books. However, this attention to detail does make the book drag at parts. As the book progressed, I felt that Harris was trying to tie up all loose ends to make this the final book. Without giving anything away, I had trouble with the ending, which seemed to be quite a stretch. I know the prssure had been there for a sequel to \\"Silence\\", but was this book a little forced?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather read about the history of cardboard","review":"As much as thomas harris would like us all to admire, understand, and empathize with Hannibal Lecter, I refuse. Talk about giving Hollywood what it wants--let's create characters more evil and corrupt than Hannibal so we can cheer him on. Let's delve into his soul to understand how he is just a victim of society, then end with acts of heroism and \\"love\\" we can all feel good about. What made the first two books good was believable characterization and events. This one was utterly preposterous. Of course people will love it. It's one giant metaphor for how women are consistently manipulated by, and fall in love with, the most disgusting men on earth. Enjoy ladies. The first 400 pages gets 2.5 stars, the rest should be used to wipe with. If Anthony Hopkins stars in the movie adaptation of this trash I'll get a sex change"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could the same author have possibly written this?","review":"I want my money back. I want my time back. I want the part of my brain back that is storing any memory of this book. Maybe I'll get lucky and Dr. Lecter will dine on that portion of my brain one day.It's quite a disappointment, to say the least, when a sequel is so bad that it ruins for you the memory of its precursor. Unfortunately, this book has done that for me. Not only did much of the story drag seemingly without end, but the parts that could have been interesting or exciting only end up being ridiculous and unbelievable. The ending is not only unbelievable, but unforgivable.My advice is that if you must read this book, borrow it from the library or an unfortunate friend who paid good money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a masterpiece!","review":"This book lacks alot of the elements that made the other books a masterpiece. I would not recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"O.K., so i didn't hate everything about it, just almost everything about it. Terrible ending, full of one dimensional characters and characters who would've been better off as one dimensional (read:Lecter himself). Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ran out of ideas!","review":"I loved Lambs, so I couldn't wait to buy Hannibal. The first 2\\\\3s of the book weren't at all dissappointing, but the ending is so absurd and out of character that it ruined the book. The only way to describe the ending is bad, bad, bad. On the other hand, I read Red Dragon just after Hannibal and loved it. Great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader from Atlanta Sept 28","review":"Wonders why people hated this book. Well, you have only to read the more articulate dissenting opinions. Scroll down, read the one and two star reviews. Ignore the vicious, personal attacks and concentrate on the criticism of the writing, the inconsistancies and anachronisms, the shameful copout at the end. Do these things, then save yourself the price of the book and read it at the library for free. If you come away thinking this was Harris' best effort, if you still think that you like it, go buy it. Support Harris. Here's what he thinks of you: \\"Oh well, at least you people continually buy my book and financially support my self-gratification. Thanks!\\" I think Amazon intentionally seeds these reviews with \\"ringers\\" that balance out the negative comments. After all, if a book gets a well deserved One Star, like Hannabal, they won't sell as many copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sequel filled with a shocking ending.","review":"Hannibal; was a great reading experience. Harris has made a mind bending sequal to \\"silence of the lambs\\". It was a page turner from page one with an ending that will shock all who reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the puzzles?","review":"It took me a while to decide the reasons why this book was disapointing, aside from the uneven, cluttered plot which smacked more of sequelitis, what was missing was the puzzles. Silence of the Lambs was filled with little brain teasing puzzles frequently of the excessively macabre fashion. This time out, there's lots of talk about Classical literature, art & gourmet cooking, but no puzzles. The result feels like when I read Michael Crichton's Lost World; A forced sequel rather than one that improves on the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this made it to print","review":"Hannibal Lecter as a well-funded Narcissus wandering through life admiring beauty? What? The few original ideas that show up in this book are quickly invalidated by rampant absurdity, and the entire thing quickly degenerates into unconnected and awkward confusion. The ending is ridiculous - I was sure I would turn the page and find a 'Just Kidding, here's the real ending' in enormous bold print.Do not read this book. I read a bunch of these reviews while halfway through the book, and was skeptical of everyone that didn't like it. This book is truly bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Over It","review":"All this blah blah blah about how Hannibal is not not as subtle or serious as the first two books. How many serious crime novels do we get every year compared to the number of Grand Guignol masterpieces like Hannibal? And buried beneath it all is sly satire of American blood lust and our fascination with characters like Hannibal. This novel is to modern horror what \\"Unforgiven\\" was to westerns. He gives us exactly what we wanted in the back of our dirty little minds when we bought the book, then stands back and lets us see how silly and weird it all is. Pay close attention to the last line, it more than says it all.P.S. The final entrance into the Opera is a goulish and grand set piece that all but laughs at every word that hack Anne Rice ever put to paper"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"Disappointing, disgusting, worthless, and an addition to an otherwise fine series that this world could have done without. Forget about this book. It isn't worth the paper it's printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't care for the ending at all...I thougt it was a little far-fetched. If this is really being made into a movie I know I won't go see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disappointing...","review":"This was definitely one of the most disappointing books I have read in a very long time. I kept going, waiting to get to the \\"good\\" part, but no such luck. I found both Lechter & Starling to be completely unlikable characters this time around -- I had always found Lechter to be quite entertaining before. Much of the gore in this novel was just there for the shock value. And the ending was the biggest letdown of the whole thing. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, and bought it as soon as it came out. However, I found myself plodding through it, waiting for the ending. Definitely not worth the time or effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"El Stinko!","review":"Of the many books I've read this summer, this is by far the worst-and I've read some bad ones!Harris basically strings together as many gross-out scenes as he can think of, capping it off with the worst, most improbable ending of any \\"best seller\\" that I have ever read. Trapped on a long flight to Thailand with this book was like listening to someone in the seat next to me dragging their fingernails across a chalkboard the entire way.If this were the first book of the trilogy, no one would care about parts two and three. Save your money. Wait for the movie and hope they change the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of reading time that I hope doesn't waste celuloid.","review":"I took this book to the beach with me this summer. Thank goodness I also took another book. The snobbish tone of the writing, coupled with the long-snouted man-eating pigs clashed like a Bordeaux with a Big Mac -- oops -- there I go, sounding like the king of all Cognac snifter sniffers, Thomas Harris. Then the ending. What can I -- or anyone -- say about that? This is a rediculous book that I pray never gets made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Saw the first movie and read the book. Bought this as soon as it came out and read it. It started out well but the ending was ABSOLUTELY unbelievable. Any woman reading this book will probably be very disappointed as it turns out to be written like a man's fantasy. Doubt that Jodie Foster will sign up to do the sequel unless they modify the ending significantly. Too bad - had the potential to be a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing and illogical","review":"After waiting with great anticipation for this book, I found it to be extremely disappointing. These were NOT the real characters created in Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. The most unbelievable part for me was the final outcome of Clarice Starling's character. I really expected a better story Mr. Thomas. Shame on you for this drivel. We all know you are capable of writing a GREAT story, I just wish you would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal was just not worth reading. Too Bad.","review":"After waiting for years for another Thomas Harris, It was an incredible let down to read Hannibal. The charactors were not remotely similar to those in Silence of the Lambs, nor was the plot. Many parts of this book were so disturbing, that I had nightmeres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trees died for this?","review":"Complete garbage. Thomas Harris is the quintessential hack writer who has duped the public into believing he's actually talented. Not one aspect of this novel is believable, nor is it even interesting. Of all the things he could have done with these characters, he used the most inane plot knowing the lemming-like public would buy it anyway. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would be wise to stay far away from this film project. Starling and Lecter have done 360 degree turnarounds from their previous incarnations. It's all too sordid to even go into---don't buy it or read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic slop","review":"Anyone wonder what's wrong with society? That so many can get so excited for so little is pathetic. The book is slop, cheap and exploitative. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. Harris must be laughing at us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elements of intrigue in an otherwise average book.","review":"I've read both Silence and Red Dragon multiple times, and like most everyone else, was very eager for this book to arrive. Luckily it only cost me 21 dollars. The book does have its shining moments...showing us a bit more of Hanibal's character. I am surprised that it took 10 years to write this book, it contains nowhere near the detail or researched information that Silence or Dragon does. If you are a die-hard fan of Lecter's character, you should read the book, but dont expect too much. The ending is not that good, and only opens the door for yet another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited with bated breath... let it out with sigb of regret.","review":"If you ignore Harris's previous works, the ending would probably work for you. However, having not had the pleasure of removing the frontal lobe from my brain... I read the first two books and felt Harris betrayed his characters. Please God Please don't make a movie. Or, at least wait until I get the lobotomy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fun read.

Not since 'The Stand' have I been so engrossed in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucked","review":"Save your money people. A ridiculous story, lame boring characters and possibly the worst ending I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I hope to God they don't waste the time and effort making this crap into a movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the Real Hannibal Lecter Please Stand Up?!","review":"I have never been so disappointed by a book in all my life. Obviously Thomas Harris has been wasting the last eleven years! This book doesn't even belong in the same category with Red Dragon or Silence. Hannibal is pure unadulterated crap written (very poorly) to line Thomas Harris' pockets by perpetuating a fraud on his fans. It reads as though Harris put it down with 100 pages left to go and some poor wannabe author picked up and finished the tale without reading the preceding pages. Don't waste your money or your time, I felt angry and betrayed that I'd wasted mine on this poor excuse for a novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Possible Ending","review":"Of all the ways Harris could have ended this book, the ending he chose is easily the worst. The plot of the book is average, and the book lacks the eerieness and the mystery of the first two books, and in parts of the book, Harris uses Italian prases and then doesn't translate them for you. Early in the book, Dr. Lecter has the same presence as in the first two, but by the end his image is ruined. Harris changes him so much that I wished I had never picked up the book because it has ruined The Silence of the Lambs, and The Red Dragon for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychological thriller nearly at its best.","review":"I believe the book is very good. It is not only very exciting to read (I only had a one hour break from start to finish), but it has more. Harris manages to show, that no person is born good or evil, but the circumstances of our lives makes us the people we are - and more importantly shows that we are able to change. This book is not only thrilling, but gives an exciting glimpse of how human psychology works. Only problem is, that a few minor characters are not believeble."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WORTHLESS BOOK","review":"What happened to Starling? No one in their right mind would give any credence to the plot resolution of this book. I cannot think of a single reason why anyone would read it. Please don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"11 years and still waiting.....","review":"The long awaited sequel seems to be Harris' attempt to live and love vicariously through Hannibal. The narcissistic Hannibal is borish and unbelievable. The few moments of true suspense are few and far between, what should be more rare is the excessive rehashing of Silence Of the Lambs storyline. In the end Harris mearly sets himself up for another book. I will wait for some reviews before shelling out for another example of Harris selling out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We can only learn so much and Live","review":"I personally found Hannibal very interesting. It led you deeper into the subconcious and phyche of Hannibal Lecter. Although the ending was very confusing I found that it made me think more and you must look deeper into the hidden meaning of the book. Overall I was very very happy with the outcome of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Harris took the more difficult road ...","review":"...in creating this book, by dragging us into Hannibal's inner world, his thoughts and sensibilities, rather than just creating some sort of simplistic movie plot. I think he was able to give us a glimpse of a very remarkable kind of human experience.BTW, have you ever read anything autobiographical by Harris? I have, and I think that Lector speaks for Harris in matters of taste - cerebral, that is - well, you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"As an avid reader of this type of fiction, I was incredibly disappointed with the actions of the characters in this book. Harris spends so much time delving into the past of the two lead characters, then ends the book with them acting totally out of the parameters of their past experiences. This made the story that much more fictional instead of scaring you into believing that this could really happen. The ending reads as if a deadline is fast approaching for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted my time!","review":"And my disposable income. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy! Pigs? Harris must be kidding...I can't foresee this being a blockbuster at the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS! LOVED THE ENDING!","review":"This book was impossible to put down. Although a little gory, I truly enjoyed the plot. (I mean, after all, Hannibal IS a cannibal.) I found the end to be delightfully intriguing and the plot was fantastic. Ignore the bad reviews and read it. It blew me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly good enough to warrant the gruesome violence.","review":"I was disappointed with Hannibal. The grisly nature of the book was borderline sickening, and the plot was not involved enough to warrant this extreme violence. I liked the development of the characters in The Silence of the Lambs, but in Hannibal they were bumped off before they could become interesting! The development of the Lecter/Starling relationship and the ending was unexpected and welcome, but at the risk of repeating myself, the modes of dispatch were unnecessarily shocking. Mr. Harris is, therefore, going to have a tough time translating Hannibal into a screenplay the caliber of \\"Lambs\\" without allowing it to degenerate into a B-rated horror flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant-breaks the mold-Monsters-R-us","review":"Finely crafted,deeply moving: with discomfort, some revulsion, longing and bittersweet.Another reader reviewer stated that they found it \\"unbearably moving:-so did I. This book is not to be categorized-it is a dark elegy,a gothic meditation in part, but Harris's brilliance takes us beyond category-it is common ( and defensively easy ) to label the \\"other\\" as Monster..\\"they\\" is us, much to our distress-Dr. Lecter ( it would be rude to call him Hannibal ) and even the thoroughly revolting Mason Verger reside in us and under certain cirsumstances, are born. This is the first book in many, many years that I started to reread the moment I finished it - I wanted to quickly build a new room in my memory palace to place this treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare exploration of evil.","review":"With a deep, almost uncanny understanding of the human potential for evil, Thomas Harris takes the reader on a soul-searing journey. The plot takes many unexpected turns as the story unfolds and the characters evolve in realistic (if not unpredictable) ways. Much more than a sequel, \\"Hannibal\\" deserves recognition as a thought-provoking, deeply disturbing story about people we hope to never meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should offer a zero rating for this book.","review":"This book is a bitter disppointment. The characters are shallow, repulsive and weak. The same can be said of the plot and its outlandish ending. While Mr. Harris' talent can not be disputed, nor his intelligence, I am left to wonder how he, such a brillant man and author, allowed this book to go to print. Bottom line: A tree was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Miggs when you need him?","review":"Run, Jodie!!! Run, Sir Anthony!!! Nay, let not the casting director of \\"Hannibal\\" capture you!!!How sad. I loved Red Dragon. I loved Silence of the Lambs. Both were tight, suspenseful, chilling, thrill rides into the world of sociopathic serial killers. Both were difficult to put down, once I started to read. Both had me starting at sounds in the night. Both had me looking over my shoulder, making sure no monsters were sneaking up on me.Hannibal, on the other hand, had me looking at my watch to see if maybe something more interesting was happening somewhere. Anywhere!Mason Verger is a caricature of evil. Hannibal himself suddenly becomes the cannibal with a heart. Well, maybe not. Well, maybe he is. Well, maybe.... Who knows? Who cares? And Clarice -- why, she's just a woman, after all, to be molded by her man into something better. Or is it worse? Or is it just silly?I know why I pre-ordered this book; what I don't know is why I finished it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely inconsistent with the first two novels","review":"The author decides to shift the tone of this novel to that of a social commentary on evil, and in the process makes the characters behave completely unrealistic. That would have been fine if this were a new book with unknown characters; however, the fact that the first two books attempted to use realism as their focus, this book becomes very disappointing. The ending is probably one of the worst endings in modern fiction if you take the first two books into account."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with this?","review":"Having read both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, I rushed out and made a rare hardcover purchase of Hannibal. Having finished it, I feel...icky. Early on there are some great moments for Clarice and Hannibal but overall this book is a big, gross letdown. No, we really don't want to know about Lecter's childhood trauma. We don't want to see Jack Crawford forced into retirement. And what Thomas Harris has in store for Clarice-one of the greatest female literary heroines of the last 20 years-is criminal. The abrupt change in both hers and Hannibals characters in the last 100 pages is ludicrous. I hear David Mamet is writing the screenplay. I only hope he throws away the whole ending and starts over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype,this book is awful.","review":"It took me three monthes to finally finish this book.I couldn't bare to pick it up after I had passed the half way mark.It had little suspense,the characters had little or no substance and the story dragged on like a root canal.Harris spent so much time building up to what was supposed to be an epic feast that he left me hungrier than the wild pigs he spent too much time describing.I feel sorry for all the people who have waited years for this book,they were robbed.I usually don't feel so angry after reading a bad book,but all I see is rave reviews for a book that is not deserving of them.The author spends a great deal of time speaking of Lector's \\"memory palace\\",I'm going to wipe it from mine.If Jodie Foster is smart she'll avoid signing up for the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stop and go book...","review":"I started off really enjoying the book and couldn't put it down. Then around the middle of the book, the part set in Italy, I stopped for about 2 months. I felt that he was trying to impress me with his description of Italy and it's history rather than tell the story. When I finally started again, I moved through it pretty quickly, partially to finish. I found some of the characters, plot and outcome very unbeliveable. Not trying to give it away, I just found it inplausible. I must admit that I did enjoy some insight into Dr. Lector's mind and his past. This understanding, however, did not clear my confusion of certain things and event which might have resulted from unbelievability. Since Since I've heard the first two books are so good, I don't think that \\"Hannibal\\" will put me off from reading them. I'm not even sure that I'd see the movie- unless Hollywood drastically changes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Monster\\" disappointment","review":"200 pgs into the story I caught myself skimming. The ending felt like a betrayal. Certainly a novel this hyped would fall short of expectations, but please, Mr. Harris, have some respect for your readers, not to mention your characters. I've thrown the book away so as to never, ever lend this one out with my name attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal is typical far-fetched thiller!","review":"This was a page turner all right but it fell way short of my expectations. The plot is way out there and Harris seems to be trying too hard to gross everyone out. He throws in a bunch of deep literary and artistic references trying to gain some respect for an otherwise run-of-the-mill thriller. If you didn't already know and love these characters you wouldn't even give this book a second glance. It reminds me of a recent movie sequel set in space.Speaking of movies all the actors from \\"Silence\\" should run from this script. As-is \\"Hannibal\\" cannot be made into even an average movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal surprises.......why are we surprised?","review":"Like many others, I went into this book expecting a mere sequel to Silence of the Lambs. What a pleasant surprise awaited me! Those who expect more of the same here will be sorely disappointed, but for those who are ready to cover new ground....to explore the depths of human perversity.....this is the book for you. I liked the fact that I couldn't predict where the book was going.......and I LOVED the ending. It doesn't seem at all fantastic or \\"out there\\" as other readers have suggested. In fact, it made sense in a demented sort of way. For me, it showed just how supremely evil and intelligent Hannibal Lecter really is, and enhanced his monstrous qualities. Shed your expectations and step into a world full of more monsters than you ever dared to dream of even in your worst nightmares, and king of them all is Hannibal Lecter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clarice, we hardly knew ye","review":"Being interested in the thriller/horror genre but finding many such titles much too graphic, obvious and/or badly written, I was happy to have stumbled upon Silence of the Lambs (on a remainder table, no less, long before the release of the movie). Mr. Harris' prose is well constructed, and he gave us two memorable characters in the shape of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. Unfortunately, he has ruined both of them in Hannibal. Please--a kinder, gentler Dr. Lecter and Clarice as the Bride of Frankenstein? It's insulting to both, and I particularly dislike the way Clarice's honor is so cheaply bought. I am sure that Mr. Harris is enjoying the remuneration from his latest blockbuster, but I'm sorry to have contributed to it. In the book's favor, I can say that I read it within 24 hours of its purchase and found it enjoyable right up to the time that Clarice and Hannibal revealed themselves to be nothing but a gold-digging ex-cop and a misunderstood sugar daddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starling trades in gun for breast feeding job","review":"The book is just plain bad. There is none of the behavioral science mystery solving we loved in Silence. Our strong Heroine is suduced by Lecter with drugs and volunteers to spend the rest of her days being his Freudian pacifier, literally. She is like the anti-Clarice and it insults young poor women who work hard. The office politcs is stolen from the X-files and Krendler might as well be the cigrette smoking man. Harris must have needed money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Harris is one of the best, but not with this book!","review":"Thomas Harris moved us with Black Sunday. He stunned us with Red Dragon. Then he shocked us all with the Silence of the Lambs. Now that brings us to Hannibal. I have waited for this book to be written and then released. I have dreamed of what Hannibal would do. I had to think how the FBI( C. Sterling, J. Crawford) would do to put Hannibal back to where he belongs. Then I received the book, and I could not put it down for three hours. Suddenly I stopped and put the book down and said \\"What is Thomas Harris thinking?\\" I have never been disappointed with a T. Harris book before, now I wonder if he was finally tried of the Hannible concept. He had a chance to write a book that could have thrilled us for a long time and other writers could have admired for a long time. Now I am going to the other writers to find a better story because Hannible was a total waste to me and a big let down for one Thomas Harris long time fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behavioral science? Let's talk about split personalities.","review":"When I first saw this sequel, I had never thought about whether one was required after Silence of the Lambs. After reading this, I can see why the thought never occurred to me.At first, I was enjoying they story line even if I found it very different from Silence. I must say that suddenly, as the book draws to it's conclusion, I found myself reading about characters I hadn't encounter previously in this novel. Who are those people? Did Mr. Harris suddenly get a new editor? I must say, I had the feeling that Harris had a distinct hatred of these characters, particularly Clarice.I feel as if this was written the way it was to avoid ever having to write about these characters again. Since irreparable damage has been done, please refrain from further descriptions, Mr. Harris. Life is disillusioning enough. I don't need further disappointments in my recreational reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"---- Clarice this ain't ! ----","review":"While the author creates an attention holder as was enjoyed in \\"Silence\\", the story doesn't provide a consistent characterization of Clarice that's believable. As portrayed in this book, Clarice is someone who didn't seem to relate to the character in the previous work. She's someone we don't know. It almost appears that Harris was under some pressure to complete this book, and took what can only be regarded as a cop-out conclusion that leaves the reader wanting more; more of the characterization true to the person of Clarice shown in \\"Silence\\", not of the limp clone that he portrays here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of a talent....","review":"After devouring the Red Dragon and Silence, I could not wait for this book....what a disappointment. No wonder Jodie Foster turned down the role. I respect her even more after that decision. I rarely feel that I wasted my time reading a book, usually no matter how awful it may be, it's better than sitting and watching sitcoms. However, I want my time back after reading this mess. Harris took the sensationalized parts of Silence and made the whole book gore and an Italian advertisement for tourism. He forgot to bring back the psychological, \\"behavioral sciences\\" portion that we all loved from Silence. If a movie gets made from this, it would be like any other teen slasher movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous. Poor dumb ole Starling never sees it coming.","review":"Harris has taken a strong fictional women's character and reduced her to mush. In Silence of the Lambs, Starling was a fighter, a role model. She took her licks but came out alright. In this book she is a helpless little victim who completely sells out. The plot is absurd. The ending is a disaester. Someone needed to throw a book together quickly, and get PAID..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"While there are some pages full of tingling suspense, this book is more than disappointing. I don't cringe at violence and \\"gross moments\\" (and there were plenty in both \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\") when they help tell an enticing story, but in \\"Hannibal,\\" I got the impression Harris was just showing us nastiness for no reason other than the \\"shock and buck\\" factor. I didn't *need* to know why Hannibal is the way he is, but if I were going to be told, I'd like more of an explanation of the causalities than were given. The end: bizarre and cheap. Like so many other fans, I would have preferred to see a \\"new\\" story that perhaps drew on old characters rather than this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money and time.","review":"I have read some of the other readers comments and one of them suggested that the people who gave this book 1 or 2 stars were simply not intelligent enough to understand how wonderful this book is. So let me begin by stating that I am a member of MENSA (the High IQ society). My IQ ranks me in the top 1% of the country. I thought the book was awful! The whole part that took place in Italy was boring and the ending was ludicrous! No I didn't expect it to be just like Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon which were both excellent but I did expect it to be a good book. It wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me Unsatisfied","review":"Again another example of too much hype. Silence of the Lambs was an outstanding book, but sadly Hannibal does not even compare to that creepy masterpiece. The book starts off at a breakneck pace, but the second half of the book just left me confused, and unfufilled. I kept thinking that this was not the Lector that I had enjoyed so much in Harris' previous books. The ending in my opinion is a total cop out, and seems totally implausible, and thats all I'll say about it. In closing read Red Dragon, and Silence, but stay away from this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens when a good author goes bad","review":"While Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs scared and delighted me, Hannibal bored and irritated me. What could Mr. Harris have been thinking? I plodded through the book and felt like someone looking at a bad accident out of morbid curiosity. I should have given up when my instinct told me to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I feel Mr. Harris tried his very best to be outrageously decadent. He succeeded in making his book an outrageously funny black comedy. His other books were very suspenseful and daring with one of his characters being canabalistic. This time that roll was given to the pigs. I feel this story went over the edge and had no redeeming qualities, not even the pretense of an art history major who just returned from his first visit to Italy. Mason Verger and his sister were both totally unbelievable characters. I do think the ending was very weak and was only there to leave the door open for the future little hannibal cannibals. Sorry Tom, I think you got too greedy with this one and just rushed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror to the max with a first class ending.","review":"There is not much I can say regarding the book, other than I coulnd't have done it better. Bravo for harris. I myself would love to portray clarice in theis sequel!!!! A definite must read.Thank you for a great piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-done","review":"As I was reading this book I was reminded of musicians that have lost their magic and try to over-compensate by hiding behind way over-produced recordings. I did enjoy learning a bit more about what drove Dr. Lecter, but was generally unexcited about everything else. I couldn't put his other books down, this one took me two weeks to plod through."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting to the end","review":"Hannibal is mezmorizing, as usual. I feel Starling's character could have been developed better, the ending was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Just awful.","review":"I'm embarrassed for Mr. Harris that he has concocted such a bunch of drivel and called it a novel. While he's laughing all the way to the bank I'm going to toss my half-read copy of HANNIBAL into the lake and invest my time in reading some of the GREAT new novels out this summer, like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and STONES FROM THE RIVER, and MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and BAG OF BONES."},{"rating":"1","title":"The genius of Mr. Harris was obviously his past editors","review":"They might have stopped him from releasing such a completely dumb book. Where 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence' were so beautifully crafted, this time out Mr. Harris seemed to be just racing a deadline. But he does have our money now, doesn't he? And he's set up for another lame sequel. And the ending? Are you kidding? Just think of 'Melrose Place' if it were on cable.Yuk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and save your money.","review":"Save your time and save your money.This book is a total waste. It has no real purpose and no real ending. There is the obligate sceens of sadism and canabilism. They serve no real purpose. Shame on the author. At the end of the day, I really felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris needs an editor","review":"What exactly made Carlos' head so \\"malodorous\\"? This phrase was used at least 5 times. Verger actually said \\"She can't prove she didn't do it\\" two or three times. It reminded me an assignment in creative writing where you had to use as many cliches as possible. The story was all right, but could have been much better if Harris would have deigned to allow his precious work to be edited. It is inventive and fresh to create new metaphors that really bring the reader in to the story. It is annoying though when one thinks so highly of their newly coined phrases to keep using them over and over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An elegantly-written dud","review":"Harris has crafted another monster in Mason Verger; genuinely evil with no redeeming qualities. Although his sister Margot's role is predictable, her character is complex and tinted with moral shades of gray. The author guides the reader through several tours of Dr. Lecter's \\"memory palace\\", where elegance and culture disguise the septic tank beneath. Harris gives Hannibal a motive; but vacillates between maintaining Lecter's evil status or humanizing him. Harris doesn't seem to know quite what to do with the character of Barney; initially making him a player in the plot, then abruptly erasing Barney until the end. Starling continues her role as the driven FBI agent battling her own personal demons, until the author unravels her moral fiber in the disappointing, implausible ending to this book. The final few pages have the effect of an author trying for shock value while meeting a publication deadline. A disappointing work from a talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've enjoyed previous books written by Thomas Harris, but this one was truly disappointing. I loved the \\"chase\\" of Hannibal across the continents, but I was stunned by the ending. I kept reading thinking, \\"this must be a dream sequence.\\" Did someone else write the ending to this book? The author can't possibly claim to know his characters as their actions, particularly Clarice Starling's, in the last few chapters are completely unlike them. Please don't even suggest another sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"After having read \\"The Red Dragon\\" and \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", I was looking forward to \\"Hannibal\\".I enjoyed most of the book, mainly because I liked the detail Mr. Harris goes into describing the characters and the situations. I was very disappointed in the conclusion of the book, it was just too hokey of an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Despite the gore the book is actually quite boring. The ending is implausible in the extreme. I know of no combination of drugs/dreams/psychotic breaks that the characters could have that could make this ending seem real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really written by Thomas Harris?","review":"This book was nowhere near as good as his other books -- in fact, it's hard to believe it's the same author. And the ending is insulting to his readers who have waited ten years for the sequel. I hope they don't bother making a movie out of this one. I can't imagine Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins starring in it, as the quality is substandard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"The media having leaked the news that Jodie Foster had declined the offer to revisit her Clarice Starling role, I was a bit wary of reading the book. I don't feel this was written as well as \\"Silence...\\"; I found myself just skimming entire paragraphs because I was bored. I agree that Verger is almost more of a demon than Lecter, and his behavior with the visiting child drew loathing...at least Lecter didn't mess w/children's minds. I was terribly disappointed with the ending - I don't blame the classy and intelligent Ms. Foster for saying \\"No thanks!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Is it really that bad?","review":"Thomas Harris has done the most amazing thing. He has writtenthe best suspense novel of the 20th Century (Silence of the Lambs) andthe worst (Hannibal). Silence of the Lambs will never be forgotten. Hannibal already has been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending negates an average narrative","review":"I read this story and kept thinking these characters are really bizarre. However the pace and story line were good enough to keep my interest.The author used a strange writing style. At times it was a straight forward narrative and then would change to a voyuer type of writing. As if the reader and author were peeping in on the life of actual people rather than characters in a book.I kept on with it and read the final two chapters of the book. I HATED THE ENDING. I thought Mr. Harris showed contempt for the characters he created in his two previous works. I can't say enough bad things about the ending. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read the book and reveal the ending. I will say that if the movie follows this book, especially the ending, I won't be seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited how long for this trash?","review":"As a huge fan of Thomas Harris, I had waited forever for his next book following the Silence of the Lamb. What a heart wrenching disappointment! The book moves very slowly and reads more like a tour guide or an arts history textbook on Italy than a psycho thriller.In my opinion, it seemed that Harris got tired of writing about 2/3 through and just threw some ending together. I wish that he would have called me to write the ending, because I certainly could have done better. I can't imagine what happened to Harris's creativity when it came to the ending, perhaps he let Clive Barker finish it, or maybe his grandson.This book in no way resembles his previous masterpieces. Save your time and choose another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agent Starling has left the biulding!","review":"I hated this book. Harris bored me with his endless descriptions of Italian architecture, saddened me by shoveling Jack Crawford into an early grave, then disgusted me by making Clarice Bonnie to Lecter's Clyde. The only character that acted normal was Ardelia. I know Clarice needed a boyfriend but the demented Doc wasn't the one I had in mind. I kept expecting her to regain her faculties during the dinner scene and bash him on the head with a saute pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie, the book was not worth the wait!","review":"The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Italian section, and the first few chapters. Two good sections, two stars. The ending was just plain silly, and there were too many two page chapters that didn't give us any new information only reinforced what we all ready knew. If you want to read a good Lector story re-read RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR Disappointment","review":"Never have I anticipated a book so much...and never have I been so disappointed. The plot never really got off the ground. I had this sense of waiting for the story to really get going and it never did. That's not the worst part though. What Harris did to the main characters was utterly ridiculous. With Lecter he had developed one of the most menacing villians in current literature. He took a monster and made him a victim. With Starling he had an excellent protagonist. He took a woman who was strong and smart and made her weak and stupid. It's hard to believe he took 10 years to write this. It reads like he took 10 weeks. Read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Leave this one on the shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Version - Hated the Movie","review":"There was a lot of discussion and general hub-bub about this book when it came out. Did you like the ending, how could he write that, Clarise would never do that blah blah blah. I think this book ended honestly!Clarise finds herself in an awful, career ending mess. there are forces that surround her, pushing her in many directions, but SHE choses which one to follow. Hannibal is where her obsession lies, and she follows that path to the very end.Yes this is a twisted book with a bizarre ending but to me, it was what made this book interesting and special. Really I couldn't put it down. I think I read the last 200 pages all in one sitting. I recomend this book to anyone who loves Silence of the Lambs (book or movie) and even if you've seen the movie and it's changed ending, read the book so you can decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like to get my brain washed out","review":"Do you ever feel like that? I know that we humans are said to use only ten percent of our brains or something, but even with all that excess capacity I dislike using any of it to store the details of this book.Devoid of suspense, consisting of moving from one grotesque Hannibal Lector Moment to another, and concluding with what has to be the least satisfying conclusion to a novel ever to see print, this book was an utter waste of time. I only read it because I loved \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"Understand, I can't blame Harris for cranking out this dopey sequel. He probably did all right financially with the previous two, but with Hannibal Lector now nearly an institution, there's big, big money for him in the sequels. A man has to take care of himself and his family, so more power to him.For me, I think I'm done with the good doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bromo please","review":"RE: ABRIDGED AUDIO TAPE READ BY AUTHOR. There is no doubt that Hannibal Lecter is an intriguing character but like an oh-so-rich dessert, is better enjoyed in modest portions. I liked Harris' previous 2 efforts where the doctor dominated quite effectively from a supporting position. Here he is served up as the main course on a heaping platter that ultimately proves indigestable.At first listen, the author's southern drawl is distracting but as the story develops, I came to appreciate his informed interpretation of the work, if not the work itself"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential........","review":"In what could be described as one of the biggest disappointments in literary history, Thomas Harris' Hannibal failed to meet expectations. Meeting these huge expectations could be difficult enough but Harris looked more than up to the task in the first two thirds of the book. There was excitement and intrigue, I could hardly wait to finish. However, the remaining 50-70 pages could only be described as \\"hurried\\". The ending appeared as though it were written by a high school sophomore attempting to finish their homework early so they can go to a movie. Besides being hurried, the ending was also, in my humble opinion, ridiculous. I won't go into details, but trust me, opt to read another book"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"Who would have guessed that such an expertly rendered series would degenerate into harlequin romance so suddenly and compeletely? To be fair, I was enthralled for the first 98% of this novel. It was the last 2% that I found so utterly disappointing. My advice to a prospective reader is to buy the cheapest paperback copy of this book that you can find and rip out the last chapter. If I had omitted the final chapter from my reading, I would have given Hannibal a 4-star rating instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe i wasted money on this toilet paper","review":"If you liked Silence of the Lambs, let it end there. You will thank me later. This story has none of the horror, none of the compelling drama. The only it had in common with its predecessor was that it used the same names. Apparently if you use the same names from book to book you dont have to use their same personalities. I was severly disappointed with Thomas Harris' fourth attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Hannibal reaffirms my long held personal theory that most contemporary authors have only 1-3 (maybe 4) good books in their careers. ie: Mario Puzo & The Godfather-Stephen King had maybe 4. While I thoroughly enjoyed Black Sunday, Red Dragon and even managed to find some literary salvation in Silence of The Lambs, it is clear (at least to me) that with Hannibal, Mr Harris has, like his aforementiond contemporaries, finally touched the bottom of the barrell. It will be interesting to see if he tries to redeem himself with a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ...

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Book, Implausible Ending, Poor Editing","review":"I waited for the sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" for 10 years, and I suppose nothing could live up to my expectations. However, I did NOT expect Clarice Starling's bizarre behavior at the end of Harris's work; in fact, there was no motivation for it that I could find in the book to justify it. Unless, perhaps, Dr. Lecter performed a lobotomy on her, without our knowing it? What a major disappointment... The reader is provided with a complex villain in Mason Verger, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this happen after Silence of the Lambs?","review":"What a disappointment! I had been eagerly awaiting the continuation of the Hannibal Lecter story. What a let down! The plot was completely unbelieveable and the character development was nothing like this book's predecessor. I wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to get this book as soon as it was released. My only hope is we DON'T see this weak story on the silver screen. Silence of the Lambs was one of the BEST adaptations I have ever seen from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted all the characters to die much more quickly.","review":"Having read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I eagerly anticipated this book.

I just didn't want to stop reading this, and I was sad when it ended, I wanted the bizarre journey to continue! The others who have trashed this great work have obviously missed something, and attacking Mr. Harris is unjustified, his work was creative, taking the saga of Lecter in a totally different direction. The ending was so wild, I couldn't believe it, and I loved it, all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"This book was nasty.

Was expecting SO much more - Silence of the Lambs was excellent! The story dragged, there was very little 'suspense'. The ending absolutely destroyed the whole 'Hannibal' reading experience. I probably will not purchase another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"Where \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" explored the psychology of the serial killer and provided thrilling plots to boot, \\"Hannibal\\" takes a different tack. It goes for the gross-out. Calling this a disappointment is an understatement. Believability doesn't even seem to have been a consideration here, and Harris betrays (or causes outright reversals) in the nature of characters he developed solidly in earlier books. I have to wonder what Harris was doing for eleven years. It certainly can't have been working on \\"Hannibal.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic work of art!","review":"Dr. Hannibal Lecter returns with a method behind his madness. In this book we find that as twisted as the good doctor may be there is always someone who can take it to another level.

I tip my hat to Thomas Harris, it was worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressingly boring, gruesome without substance. DON'T BUY!","review":"This follow up is without the riveting desciption of forensic science and investigation that drive the first two books. Unlike Red Dragon and Silence, Harris includes description after description of gruesome acts without any relevant context and these scenes lack a great deal of tension. The thin psychological forays into Lecter and Starling are without significant revelations and are fairly boring. Harris has obviously been paid well for this effort, but it feels like he wasn't engaged in even a remote way for the story development.My recomendation: Don't buy, don't read and don't bother. After spending the time reading this poorly written book, I felt like re-reading Silence of the Lambs to regain my appreciation of riveting writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"Nevermind the fact that I really hate books with foreign language phrases inserted all over the place. It's like going into a room and then asking to leave and then coming back in. I too was very disappointed in the ending to this book.

Please give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of good characters","review":"Having read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I am terribly disappointed to see Lector and Starling come to such a mediocre end.

I read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and thought they were great. This was simply \\"let's have fun with canibalism\\". Until the last 100 pages or so, it was boring. Those pages were more gripping, but the ending was horrible. Until I got to it, I thought there was a chance that the majority of the book was going to be redeemed by the ending. Not so. I can't say enough how much I hated this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monsterous Disappointment","review":"I can't believe that I wasted 500 pages worth of time on this atrocity of fiction. The characters are loathesome and uninteresting, not to mention laughable and absurd. I kept on reading only to the belief that it has to get better. I never read the Silence of the Lambs, but if it was anything like this, they must have done a lot of rewrites pre-production for the film version. News that Jodi Foster doesn't want to be a part of this film adaptation is no surprise, in fact I hope they scrap the whole idea. This book, with no other better way to say it, is so stupid. The only reason that a book of this caliber could ever make the NY Times best-seller list has got to be the herd instinct of readers. I am only sorry that I went along with them. Don't be a part of the herd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"This is truly a case of living in a society that has been numbed by violence and morbit thought alike. The book \\"Hannibal\\" is the worst kind of deforestation. It would be easier to digest the let-down of this work if there had not been moments of great promise along the way.With out destroying the integrity of the suspense A would be reader should be forewarned that in this book Starling's most treasured qualities, the very ones that drew us to her are replaced by sheer lunacy and immature fiction.First and formost it is a novel. But anyone who reads this book can see why an actress the caliber of Jodie Fosterwould dismisses this storyline. An in fact, with out a major overhaul of the ending the film version will not play in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad read that led to a ridiculous, unbelievable ending","review":"I'm so dissappointed. I eagerly read this book only to find narry a character that I cared about, was interested in, reviled, or even pitied. Definitely a sorrowful sequel to Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"It almost seems as if Harris rushed through the book, when he had years to write it. It is very disjointed and constantly told from the same banal perspective and therefore reads like a screenplay and not like a novel. The ending is completely out of character and the events that transpire leading up to it are so odd, that they are just wrong; they do not fit into context at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying sequel to The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In this satisfying sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris avoids ripping himself off-the blight of most sequels. Like in his earlier work, the story is riveting and the characters are mesmerizing. The only problem is the ending, which, though intriguing, is not quite believable"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS HERE, OR A MOVIE","review":"Don't waste eye movement on this book. If there were no stars possible, that it what this should receive. Inconceivably disappointing, incredibly weird and illogical, too many holes in the plot to plug with an octopus. Ridiculous premises and implausible actions. Limp effort at horrifying the reader presumably to mask the absence of a plot leading to a laughable ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor!","review":"An author of genius has succumbed to pressure; the book feels as awkward as a seven month fetus. Perhaps the wait was too long, and the expectation too high, but I know I gasped out loud when I saw that the book was being published, and I gasped with horror when I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful, abnormal personalities; each with their own agenda","review":"show that Harris continues to create characters who are uniquely his own. If you expected a cookie cutter sequel to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, you may be disappointed. I wasn't, and thoroughly enjoyed the outlandishly psychotic behavior of each personality. Afterall, this is the story of Lecter and Starling who are, oddly enough, attracted to each other from the outset. Add to this strange fascination of Starling's moth to Lecter's dangerous flame; a former child molester who had been a client of Dr. Lecter's and had made the mistake of offending Hannibal's sense of decency, paying for it with a loss of face, literally; now out to seek revenge...well, what can we expect? Crazy people don't behave sanely. I liked the twists and shuddered at all the right places. Harris writes to please himself and those of us willing to accept the bizarre antics of his characters, aren't offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for those who like Harris, not Demme.","review":"Harris has an increadible gift for bringing life's less pleasant aspects to a stunning, if not brutal light. While not for the squeemish, Harris is true to form and true to his charectors. If, after seeing the movie, you expect Anthony Hopkin's \\"Lecter,\\" think again. As a charector, Lecter is written evil, without apology, and he makes no bones (forgive the pun) about it. If you search for safe summer reading, pick up Danniel Steel, but if you want to be scared and intruiged, this book is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, if not disappointing ending, A page turner.","review":"I have only seen the movie \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" before reading Hannibal so I wasn't sure if I was going to like the book or not but decided to give it a try.

I thought it was acceptable...until the last chapters! Overblown, unbelievable, over the top...it reminds me of My Fair Lady set in hell - ridiculous! It read like bad Anne Rice! One of the things I liked about Red Dragon and Silence was the realism and the gravity with which Harris treated the subject matter. Now Lechter only eats \\"free range rude\\" people and Starling is won over with cashmere and emeralds? Ugh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money or time on this book","review":"as Jed Clampet would say.. Pitty-full. Terrible compared to his prior masterworks. Inconsistancies.. Are we to believe that Lecter left a victim alive years ago.. who did not turn him in? (remember that Lecter was caught by the character in Red Dragon. But this book has a character who could have Identified him as the man who tore his face of..but did not? The Ending was so bad.. I gave the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly gross, implausable, very disappointing.","review":"After waiting 7 years for the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, I was very disappointed in Hannibal. This story was mostly implausible to me especially the ending. Much of the time I felt that Mr. Harris was gratuitously gross. In my opinion, this book contained none of the subtilty of the first; everything was overdone. I also felt lost in much of the references to Italian culture; one would have to be a student of the classics to comprehend many of the references."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a gripping tale","review":"Compared to silence of the lambs, this book is awful. It reads like a movie script and unlike the last Hannibal book, I had no trouble putting it down. In fact many passages were boring. I would not sped the money. There is too much else out there worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, absurdist ending","review":"I must admit despite some inconsistancies (ex. when did Clarice become a world class marksman? Certainly not in \\"Silence of the Lambs!\\") I liked the first 450 pages of this book. Though I felt the descriptions in the Florence portion of the novel many times uninteresting and pedantic. Most readers would probably agree with me in that the Barney/Margot relationship was superfluous except as a plot device in the end. My problem, like many others, was with the ending. To describe it as Nihlistic would be kind. It is Absurdist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but gruesome","review":"I really enjoyed this book overall; however, be forewarned of the gruesome nature. Some of the descriptions of people/victims and activities is grotesque. It is a pretty fast read. I just don't \\"buy\\" the ending. I'm eager to \\"hear\\" what other people think, and even MORE eager to see how this book translates to the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite as good as \\"Silence\\"","review":"While I wasn't quite as intrigued as I was reading \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" what with the moth in the throat and the entomologists explanation, I have to say that this was one exciting, however, gory read. The whole swine thing really made me cringe in horror. But, you know, I really liked the ending. And, of course, throughout the whole read, I was able to picture Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in the lead roles. That made it so much better. Clarice, what's next? (Can't you always just hear how he says \\"Clarice\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment after \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"","review":"I've looked forward to the \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" sequel for years, and boy was I disappointed w/Hannibal! I forced myself to finish it, thinking it was bound to get better. Sadly, it didn't! Wish I could get a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the end","review":"Why the author spent so much time detailing Italian history and over looked the successful qualities included in his prior novels, was a mystery to me regarding this book. Where were the overviews of the technologies available for crime fighting as in the Red Dragon? Where was our protagonist? The author spent too much time trying to disgust me instead of working on an engaging story. Yes, the book kept me absorbed, but only to make me feel I had wasted my time reading it in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"gruesome","review":"An incredibly long, wordy, disgusting story with no real plot. All the characters, except Clarice, were horrible people who committed unbelievably revolting acts that could only have been included for the shock value (and \\"make me want to vomit\\" value). In the end, even Clarice dissapoints. I found it hard, despite (or perhaps because of) the detail, to actually follow some of the actions. It was somewhat interesting to learn more about Hannibal's motivations, but I would have preferred hearing those parts from someone who had read the book rather than subjecting myself to the entire story."},{"rating":"1","title":"love thomas harris, this was a BIG let down","review":"thomas harris must have gotten tired while writing Hanibal. Well written but poor imagination throughout and especially toward the end. let us hope that he can redeme himself with his next book ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to the max!!!!","review":"I waited for this book with more anticipation than probably any other book I have ever read. The need for Harris to provide details that got more graphic as the story progressed is nothing but a shock ploy. While I loved his other books this offering has poor character development and worse plot flow. If this is what takes him all these years to produce I for one will not be anxiously awaiting another."},{"rating":"2","title":"This sure isn't Silence of the Lambs","review":"So this isn't as creepy as Silence of the Lambs, but I just loved the exhilarating feeling I had while reading this. GO FOR IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hannibal's cannibalized","review":"When I finished this book i had to ask myself what i really thought of the ending. Compared to the rest of the novel (which is wonderful) the ending leaves one in a state of utter disbelief. But whether that stems from the fact that it is a bad ending in the literary sense or in the theatrical sense is hard to say. I don't see how this novel could be made into a movie but on the other hand Harris does seem to have let Lector be Lector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, very bad.","review":"After just finishing Thomas Harris' new addition to the Dr. Lecter saga, I am completely at a loss. I wish that I could bill the publishing company not only for the cost of the book, but for the time invested in the reading of it. At least in true Harris style it is a quick read. In my humble opinion Hannibal does not live up to the task of continuing the compelling saga created by Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. What a pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner from the start.","review":"I just finished the third installment of the Lecter books this afternoon and I must admit the ending was disappointing but what a good story. Granted I don't think it held the same gut renching realism that kept you up in he middle of the night and affraid to go downstairs in the dark. But, Hannibal definately was a good story with a delightful return of our favorite characters that Harris has held from us for so long. I hope he rights another. As much as I like Lecter he needs to die."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!","review":"This book, while on its own, is an ok read, does not compare with the previous two Hannibal Lecter books. There is no tension; weak plot; very little new about the good doctor. And the ending--what a crock!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trilogy ends (I hope) with a whimper.","review":"Harris has gone off the deep end with this book. As others have said the ending is the worst I have EVER read in any book. If you like his previous books do NOT read this one and preserve your memories of the characters. Most of the book is exactly what you would expect in a sequel and seems a little simplistic at times. Then he writes a very non-normal ending but a worse ending then a formulaic one could ever be. Horrible! When winter rolls around this book will go straight into the fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book proves the adage, \\"leave well enough alone.\\"","review":"It was a HUGE disappointment. If you liked the characters Jack Crawford and Clarice Starling from Silence of the Lambs, don't read this book. Any fond memories you had of the characters will be ruined. The plot is improbable from start to finish, and downright sick at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous, but interesting","review":"The official Thomas Harris website allows us to hear in the authors own words, the fact that Hannibal took 3000 days to write. During those 3000 days, Mr. Harris did wrestle with the preposterous, yet even when he has ventured beyond the point where we may suspend our disbelief, he remains interesting to read. The manuscript, poorly edited as it may be, is a tweak away from a screenplay, and what may seem preposterous to the reader, is mere fluff when compared with modern movie horror. I enjoyed the attempt, but disliked the final product. Pigs eating people? Enormous eels shoved down one's throat? Perhaps the movie shall be called... \\"Hannibal...I still know what you did last summer...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't say this was a disappointment because I had no great expectations but I did expect a decent read. I found myself skimming the book when Starling was not around. Her character is the most interesting in the series. Hannibal is just unreal. I was bored in Florence and with the details of Lechter's \\"superb taste\\" It was still salvageable until the end when Harris underwent his full frontal lobotomy which is the only explanation for his ridiculous conclusion. I suspect that he may have done this to ensure that there will not be a movie sequel. The audience would laugh thenselves sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad dissappointment","review":"How sad to read Hannibal the day of its release and discover that only evil exists in all characters- with no sense of available redemption. Previous Harris books offered this hope. Hannibal does not. Although many characters are sicker than Lecter himself, their sickness is unrealistic. Turning Lecter into a sick saviour of sorts is also hardly satisfying. I will be looking elsewhere for my summer reading thrill. Sally Anne Leger"},{"rating":"2","title":"ChristI'mthrilled!","review":"I just finished the book, having been a fan for years (my cat's name is Thomas Harris, and Not just Tom!).... but this book rocks! At first, I wasn't sure, but the more I read the more I SAVORED-- I had to re-read parts to prolong the ride! Horrific and awesome! If they do make it into a movie, they Must use the same actors... but they'll never portray it like it was written... Great Book--- now I'll be in suspense for years to come waiting for the next... Clarisse will snap out of it. won't she??!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting book expanding the characters of previous novels...","review":"Harris continues to excite readers with his journey into the mind of a psychopath. The characters Hannibal and Clarice flow from the page into the imagination. Thomas Harris finds new and original ways to detail the actions of my favorite fictional (?) characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debunks the Lecter Myth","review":"This was a really funny book. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't howl through this. It starts off as vintage Harris (although having an opening shootout was a hackneyed idea--I think really good stories open quietly and then build), becomes an Elmore Leonard caper, and ends up ludicrous and unbelievable, like Brett Easton Ellis. The plot, like Silence and Red Dragon, is magnificently crafted but I think that with Hannibal, Harris has properly debunked the Lecter myth. It is, like its predecessors, just a story, you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was horrified... but for all the wrong reasons","review":"Why it took Harris so long to complete this crappy book, I have no idea. All he did was throw a rough plot outline and a treatise on abnormal psychology to a ghost writer with the command: \\"Fill in the blanks. And make sure it can be adapted to film, cuz that's where the big bucks are.\\" I was horrified by the result. Other than than the typically overblown narrative, it didn't even read like a Thomas Harris novel. Maybe he and Caleb Carr could get together and produce something worth reading that comes close to their initial successes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamelessly Bad","review":"It is hard to believe this book was written by the same man who wrote the masterful \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" Unlike its predecessor, \\"Hannibal\\" is shallow, poorly paced, and is full of phony-feeling characters. When Harris tries to shock, it feels gratuitous; when he tries to surprise, it feels contrived. The ending is so shockingly stupid that you want to bill Harris for thetime spent reading this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate this book as less than one star I would.","review":"No way could this book ever get an average of three stars. Don't do it Anthony Hopkins or Jodie. Unless you need the money as Thomas Harris obviously did. Thank God I discouraged as many people as I could from buyong it Loved SOTL but after this ?book? don't think I'll ever watch the movie again. So let\\"s see if this gets printed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpredictable to the last.","review":"Hannibal was definitely unpredictable to the last. And having just finished it, I wonder if that's such a good thing. It feels like a book written in fits and spurts. Harris pulls a few disconcerting writing tricks in this book, worst of all speaking to us (the reader) directly, breaking the imaginary 'fourth wall'. I didn't find it particularly gruesome or distasteful, only boring. I only finished Hannibal because I had to know what he (Harris) would do to end this mess. Too bad. I should have just stopped. I loved his other books and the highest hopes for Hannibal, buying it the day it came out. I read Silence of the Lambs in one sitting. Hannibal was far too slow to start for that. It is a tragic waste of two of the best literary characters of the late 20th century. I see why Jonathan Demme passed and will bet that both Hopkins and Foster will, too. In fact, I don't see how this will get made into a movie at all. Note to Ridley Scott: RUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Having read all of this author's previous books, I eagerly awaited Hannibal. In my opinion this book is a total waste of time. It is neither well written nor entertaining. The story line is nonexistent, the violence is nauseating and the ending is ludicrous. This truly has to be the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty calories","review":"I nearly gave this book three stars, but the rather pat explanation for Hannibal's madness and the ridiculous ending really hurt what would otherwise have been an enjoyable read. Mason's character was over the top, but there were some real thrills. I would say the most disappointing aspect of this book, however, is in the way Harris chose to end it. I felt like I was wandering into Anne Rice territory..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust me -- it stinks","review":"Am I the only one who noticed Harris' completely arbitrary-seeming (accidental?) switching from one tense to another, sometimes in a single paragraph? Is Hannibal horrifying? Yes, if you're a grammarian. Otherwise the book is just plain lazy. Lecter presents \\"insights\\" on Dante that are supposed to dazzle a bunch of professors -- but they're like stuff out of a freshman lit paper. The main thing I learned was that it's bad when dumb people kill deer but it's cool when smart people kill dumb people. I realize that Starling and Lecter belong to Harris and he can do whatever he wishes with them... but the ending is nuts! I hope Mr. Harris enjoys rolling in his enormous stacks of money. I certainly felt like a sucker for contributing. Please note that the glowing NY Times review above was written by Stephen King. He's where I go for literary insight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop excitement!!! Couldn't put it down!!!!","review":"An excellent sequel to the first two. I read the first two novels and saw the movies. This book is just as good. I hope the movie does it justice. Since both Starling and Lecter have survived, I hope the next sequel is already in the works!!!! I can't wait!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny ending unbelievable!","review":"I saw \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", then read the book. I was looking forward to the return of Hannibal the Cannibal. However, the ending to Harris's novel 'Hannibal' is so utterly and completely moronic that it ruined the entire reading experience. I don't believe for a moment that the Starling character would act in the way she did in the last part of the novel. Mason Verger and his sister Margot were interesting and creepy, but the entire 'A Long Spoon' section is too stupid to believe. Shame on you Thomas Harris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"This book was a sad excuse for a follow up novel. The characters were changed, overdramatic, and lacked any integrity! I so looked forward to reading this book; it turned out to be the biggest disappointment I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal by Thomas Harris","review":"Just finished reading \\"Hannibal\\"--Cannot believe the ending. There is only one person to play Hannibal in the movie version. I'm only hoping Mr. Hopkins decides to take the part again. Here's hoping Jodie Foster will join him. But who will play \\"Mason Verger?\\"! What a character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick !!","review":"I very much enjoyed this book and I'm sure the movie will not do it justice. It was however, quite disturbing to consider the possibility that human beings could behave in the manner described throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the sickest books ever written","review":"If it were possible to give minus stars to a review, I would give this book -100. When I finished this piece of TRASH, I wanted to grab Thomas Harris, shake him and ask what the hell he was trying to do. There is NOT ONE likable character in this awful book. Even Clarise Starling turns evil, wicked, mean, bad and nasty. It is full of evil lesbians, horrible mutations of humans, a character who loves to make children cry so he can collect their tears, and unrepetant monsters.It is no wonder that the screenplay will have major revisions in the plot and characters. Jody Foster was absolutely right in refusing to participate in it.The only reason I finished this thing was because I could not believe that it could get any more depraved as it progressed. I was wrong. The ending will make you sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure gore","review":"From the sublime terror of Silence of the Lambs Hannibal sinks to the level of simply pandering to those fans of the gory \\"B\\" flic horror genre such as Jason and Freddie. The gloss of sophistication is belied by the stereotypical characters that are all too predictable. Sorry, but for me this sequel is a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one!","review":"Disregard the reviews of this book being a must read. It is more of a must pass. The book began well, but then it seemed like Harris just lost his train of thought and started to make things up. The plot was poorly developed and the descriptions of the gory murders, wasn't even disgusting at all.This book was too long and dull. The ending was absolutely horrible. No wonder Jodi Foster refused the part. The characters were lost from the original series to become lovers! This cannot be! It ruins the entire mystique of the relationship between Starling and Lecter! C'mon! Harris, you must've been offered a HUGE advancement to write this shoddy novel. I can't believe you rushed to write this awful book. Warning to others, do not buy unless you want to waste money and time and energy in a dull, predictable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Hannibal","review":"This was a really good book, I read it two or three times. I don't think that little kids should read this but it is a good book for the older people. It is very well written. The athor of Hannibal has a good taste in words, he has also has written many other good books so get out there and get a good taste of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"It took him 10 years to write this?","review":"I was extremely disappointed. I found this book boring and self indulgent with not a single character worth caring about. The ending was laughable. For a book to be truly griping or scary there needs to be an element of truth. This book is so far out that I found myself saying aloud \\"yeah, right\\". I hope this is never made into a movie. As written, it is far beneath the talents of Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster. It reads more like \\"Scream\\" or \\"I know what you did last summer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hannibal\\" is a major disappointment","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" is a major disappointment. Where \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\" was about suspense and subtlety, Harris' new book is about pushing the boundaries of tastelessness and trying to incorporate as much sadism and cruelty into the plot as he could muster, as though daring the reader to be sickened or not. The credibility of his two main characters gets marred by an ending that is as preposterous as anything I have recently read. And the short, choppy chapters and even choppier language, suggest this was a project exercised exclusively with an eye towards making money and a movie sale. Except the details are so grotesque I would not want to see them enacted, and Harris' ruination of both Lecter and Starling is so appalling, I would not blame Anthony Hopkins or Jodie Foster for turning the film down. To keep afresh the memory of Harris at his most powerful, revisit 'Silence', or, even better,\\"Red Dragon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal: A Love Story?","review":"Hannibal should have been called, Hannibal: A Love Story. In the end, all of the protagonists - Hannibal, Barney, and Margot end up happily ever after in loving romances. Hannibal with Clarice, another protagonist and most unpredictable character. Hannibal, Barney and Margot are all the masculine aggressors. This is most important with Hannibal, who somewhat nakedly \\"saves\\" Clarice. I remember the first two books to be better, though this was entertaining and compelling. This one was a bit too cartoonish. It was a bit to much of an adolescent fantasy. One gets the impression that Thomas Harris is hoping for a movie version in order to see Jodi Foster naked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper!","review":"I was very excited about the sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". However, when I received the book and started to read it I became more and more disenchanted. I feel Mr. Harris did a great injustice to the characters of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. The ending cheapened the entire book for me.I had the feeling Mr. Harris wrote himself into a corner and didn't know where to go from there. I was truly disappointed.By pass this one, and reread \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't anybody get satire anymore?","review":"C'mon, this is FICTION, I found Hannibal absorbing and amusing. Not to mention having the best revenge scene I've EVER seen in a book. Yes, it does require both a willing suspension of disbelief and a reasonable appreciation of satire, something it seems that many readers just don't get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific morality overlaid on banal plotting","review":"Harris draws the reader into a morality trap: who deserves the reader's empathy? The answer is no one. Readers are treated to morality lessons from Hannibal Lector and forced to choose between his brand of evil and that of his sixth victim, Mason Verger. Clarice Starling, in the end, also fails as an empathetic character, and the reader is forced to wash the distaste from his or her mouth. In addition, the plotting is predictable except for the ending which lacks verisimilitude. Harris creates one character in Starling and then bends her without foreshadowing into something else just to end this screenplay treatment. It is not worth wasting your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ENDING","review":"Great opening scene, gritty and intense.

I am saddened to think that a writer of Harris's abilities would sell out to the current rage of violence and gore for its' own sake, instead of to further the plot line, which he accomplished so brilliantly in the other two books.

Then i saw the movie to confirm that it was terrible. It consists of what Thomas must consider creative violence, but it isn't any more valuable than a Freddy or Jason sequel. This story offeres nothing above a very low gross out level. Its not a psychological thriller. Its simply cat and mouse, and playing violent tricks. SOTL is better paced, seemingly unconcerned with cramming in shockers, and filled with what seems to be psychological insight. This book has little to none of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read.

Hannibal, who was such a fasniating character before was made soft and good guyish with a sad past, they ruined him. Then there was that 100 some-odd page Italian section with the psycho inspector who seemed obsessed with his own name that was nothing short of maddening. It took me almost three weeks just to get through that part, and that was only because I forced myself on. Clarice I had no quirl with until the end. THAT would not have happened. No way no how. Do your eyes and mind a favor and avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Swallow","review":"I consider myself well-educated, experienced and cognizent of the finer things life has to offer, but this novel over-indulges itself, just as its \\"hero\\", Lecter, does, in tedious descriptions of gourmet food,(yeah, that type of \\"food\\" too.., medieval literature and art, expensive cars, and other ephemera of the ultra-rich.) Basically, I got bored with it all. Still, I finished reading \\"Hannibal\\", mainly to see what happens to \\"Starling\\". Even so, the ending will likely gross out the reader(not \\"amuse in a certain contex\\", to paraphrase Lecter, who seems to speak for the author here) and Starling's actions were unquestionably out of character and hard to believe. No wonder Jody Foster refused the sequel's role..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Dr. Lecter... Again!","review":"In this sequel to the famous and historical Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris presents us another exquisitely written novel. With his upscale writing style he brings us back our long time friends Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. The novel itself is fast pacing, interesting and worth reading. Those pages will keep on turning, I guarantee you. I thing (and its very personal) that the downside to this novel, is the fact that Hannibal Lecter himself is now the main character of the book, loosing some of the mystery upon which his style was built in past novels. Looking from the bright side, this is the chance to step into one of the most intriguing and complex minds I am familiar with."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"The Mason Verger character was despicable and heinous. That was the first turn off. When we go to Florence, all I could say was so what who cares."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't put it down!!","review":"This has to be the best book I have read this summer! It is so well written that you can almost experience each page happening. You learn the reason for Dr. Lecter's \\"tastes\\", and the true depth of his psyche. Thomas Harris continues to tell a horrifying tale with class, and I can only hope that there will be more in the life of Hannibal Lecter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down!","review":"The only thing positive I can say is that I'm glad I resisted the urge to buy it in hardcover when it first came out. The style seemed to jump all over the place. The characters were a disappointment. I felt very odd indeed to be pulling for Hanibal to get away and disappointed to read that Clarice turned out not to be a strong woman afterall."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what i expected","review":"when i picked this book up i wasn't sure what to expect. i had seen the bad movie years ago but didn't remember any of it. I just read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs back to back and was ready for more. In a nutshell I was hooked right away and I unlike other and like some others loved this book. Well written, entertaining and thoroughly engrossing and I think it had to do with reading the others first. I have grown to actually like Dr. Lector because of this book and appreciate him for whatever he is. He became a fascination for me and I wanted to learn more. This book is what it is, it is not a 'Silence' sequel but frankly its is better then both those books combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like having to look at a car wreck....","review":"I just couldn't help myself. After getting about half-way through, I found myself compelled to read on to the silly end. The plot loses its way and gets messy. Giving Lecter's character a reason for his behavior served no purpose other than pandering to the human need to give motives to horrific acts. Lecter was better as a personality mutation making an artistic statement than a victim who's damaged childhood drives him to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"I anxiously await the follow-up to this mystery ...","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it to be scary and suspenseful. The story ends on a perfect note, leaving the reader wondering if Clarice will ever escape ... and into what the offspring of Margot Verger (via Mason Verger) develops. I hope that Mr. Harris will write again ... and not make us wait for 7 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited ten years for this?!","review":"Never before has the ending of a book totally ruined my reading experience before Hannibal. I got to the point where I couldn't wait for it to end. It just seemed to get more and more ridiculous as it went along.The best thing I can say about the book is that Harris certainly has a way with character development. Whether you like them or not, the characters in Hannibal are well developed, interesting and memorable, even if the story wasn't.Where have you gone Thomas Harris?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel, but a cop-out ending!","review":"This book had me turning pages so fast, my fingers felt hot; I wondered if the pages would burst into flame. All the way until the end, when I felt betrayed! After almost two complete books covering not just Hannibal Lecter, but Clarice Starling, Thomas Harris wrote an ending which went completely counter to the person - personality, morals, ethics, and integrity - with which he built our favorite FBI agent. It just felt wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst book ever written.","review":"Superficial motives, unbelievable scenes, a prodding plot and weak grammar combine to make one of the worst reading experiences I have ever had. The appeal of Harris' earlier books, a quick peek into distorted minds, is lost here. We see to far in, and discover characters without a drop of subtelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book That was the biggest disappointment I've ever read","review":"How could Thomas Harris have done this? For once in my life, I can actually understand what the main character in 'Misery' felt like when her favorite author killed off her favorite character. This book was a good read, until the end, which was an utter and complete let down. Yes, Thomas Harris has found new and interesting ways to scare, gross-out and disgust, and so if you are curious, then this book will satisfy some of that curiosity. Read this book only if you have nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to sell out Clarice Starling, Mr. Harris :(","review":"Why does Harris use present tense in the front of each chapter and switch to past tense once the action gets going? Why does the book end without Clarice overcoming the political backstabbing at the FBI? She was such a strong character in Silence of the Lambs, but now she's as spineless as a jellyfish. There's more to a good book than disgusting imagery and hooks. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Silence of the Lambs","review":"Hannibal is an intriguing character and his adventures are entertaining, however, this book is not as exciting as the lambs was. If this is your first exposure to Thos. Harris, I recommend stepping away from this book and reading Silence of the Lambs first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Smart (Harris) You (reader) Are STUPID","review":"One thing not touched upon in these reviews is the way Harris (through Lecter) constantly reminds the reader how dumb they are compared to great minds like Lecter. The book is pretentious in the extreme, more of a class in antiquities and cooking than anything suspenseful. So, dear reader, you can't cook with white truffles? Too bad for you. The tone of the book is snotty and lets the reader feel his/her inferior education at every turn. And how does the incredibly superior Lecter fall afoul of his enemies? When Interpol and the FBI can't find him for seven years, he gets grabbed in a Safeway parking lot by a carful of goons. Does this make any sense? No, but it needed to happen for the sake of the alleged plot.One has a feeling this was written in just a few months. It is unedited and has a first draft quality. Mistakes that wouldn't get by in a freshman English class are on every page.Overall, Hannibal insults the reader. Save your $$. Pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to reach the end of the book- but regretted it","review":"I thought this was one of the worst books that I have read in a long time. It seemed contrived and pretentious. It took short cuts that took out all the tension, and ended on a truly simple and trivial manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris took the money and ran","review":"Thomas Harris obviously got tired of the publishers and public asking when the next Hannibal Lecter novel would appear, so he produced this load of garbage. Hopefully this will be the last one. Readers who enjoyed the first 2 books would be better off if they read MESSIAH by BORIS STARLING or THE PSALM KILLER by CHRIS PETIT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this and why?","review":"After considering Thomas Harris' earlier works as exceptional entertainment, I found I had an exceptionally difficult time even getting through this book. One wonders if the same person wrote it as the writing styles seemed to change throughout -- sometime in the normal third person and sometimes as the all-knowing narrator -- making the book extremely difficult to read. Probably the biggest disappointment was in how the author chose to end this novel. After giving us exceptionally strong characters in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", these same characters rolled over and died without a fight(sometimes literally) in the sequel. If Thomas Harris was seeking contraversy, he hit the mark. If he was seeking a quality novel, he went off course about a third of the way through. Bottom line: don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Sequel - Hard to believe ending","review":"I didn't find this book nearly as good as Silence of the Lambsor Red Dragon but it is an exciting story with now familiar characters... The finale is grotesque but so hard to believe that it detracted from the many wonderful pages of mystery and suspense that preceded it. But if you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, I suspect you won't regret reading Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your energy","review":"After the thrill of Red Dragon and the suspense of Silence of th Lambs, one cannot blame Thomas Harris for a last attempt at cashing in on the craze. This book is poorly written, untrue to the characters, and uneventful. If you haven't read it, I suggest you don't, and just simply reread Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. It will be time well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"With Harris's talent at description and pace, I was looking forward to this sequel. \\"Hannibal\\" starts out well, with Starling well rounded out and changed in the seven years that have passed. Somewhere around the middle, the plot starts to falter, and the characters begin to act as if they were in a cartoon rather than a novel. By the end, readers have landed squarely in the Land of the Prepostorous. I could almost sense Harris losing interest in his book as it continued, and the nice, neat ending tied up in a pink bow is almost insulting. It's a shame that two such interesting and stimulating characters as Starling and Lector have been reduced to intellectualized romantic trash novel characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I really wanted to like this book in the worst way, but it just was not happening. All the realism that Silence had is thrown out the window in this one. Lecter has become almost like one of the bad guys from the Firday the 13th/Halloween movies. It would be easy to pick the book apart by going in depth about the story line, but don't want to spoil the book for anyone. Face it, no matter how many bad reviews are written, you will still want to read it. If this ever gets made into a movie, count on it being vastly different from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This story is fast-paced, interesting, and scary. It takes you on a trip, where you find Hannibal living the finer life, solidifying his brilliance as both a killer and an intellectual. It takes you back to the character that is Clarice Starling -- forever righteous and dedicated federal servant. It introduces Hannibal's enemies, all avaricious characters lacking in dignity and loyalty, who ultimately deserve his wrath. Hannibal is the hero of this story. You'll find yourself cheering for the darkside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Wins Out or How Hannibal Became the Victim","review":"I love Harris' work -- all of it. But do him a favor DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. \\"Red Dragon/Manhunter\\", \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" were classics -- both book and movie. The 1st 1/2 of Hannibal was looking good with plot twists and characters galore. At some point, I think Harris either sold out or got bored.In his effort to explain the tragedy of Hannibal Lector, Harris tried to make him a hero whilst still carrying fatal and unredeemable flaws. It doesn't work. I wanted to throw the book across the room when I finished.Please Thom, explain to us what you did here.-Mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"demystifying hannibal the cannibal","review":"I must admit that I couldn't wait to be hypnotized and surprised by Dr. Lectors antics. I was fascinated to read more about Dr. Lector. On the other hand,I felt that the author in giving the reason for his cannibalistic actions left me less reason to be terrified and amazed by this evil creature. I don't think a part of me wanted to really side with him as much as I did. The finale annoyed me. It didn't seem true to the Clarice Starling character. I loved her strength and belief in justice and right in the Silence of the Lambs. She loses some of her illusions and her icons fall here. I couldn't believe that she would change so much in the face of the events that she would become a pretty 'dollface'. I couldn't put this book down even though I was occasionally annoyed and can't wait to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal is not up to snuf","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book after having considered The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs as two of my favorites. This book was poorly written, including many things more for shock value than for plot value. The characters were poorly developed, with Clarise and Hannibal going in directions that their basic character make-up would never allow. The work changed tenses and styles. One wonders if this wasn't taken out of Mr. Harris's hands and put together by an editorial commitee...that lacked talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Patchwork Plot Goes for the Grossout","review":"The story itself felt like a poorly-stitched quilt. Every story segment seemed to be a setup for a set piece grossout scene. This was a story virtually devoid of the psychological tension done so well in Silence of the Lambs, that went, unerringly, for the easiest of targets: the Grossout, as Stephen King calls it.Starling has turned out to be a big, whining crybaby, and the outcome of her and Lector's relationship has got to be the hands-down award winner for Biggest Waste of Good Characters.I finished it because I always like to finish what I started, unlike Harris. I have no way of knowing, but this book felt to me like someone with a bad case of writer's block just blowing out words onto the page and then selling them for zillions of dollars.If I were you, I'd avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"I am not sure what happened to Thomas Harris in this one. The man has proven his writing talent in the past with 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Red Dragon'. He stripped Clarice of all we loved about this character. If you want to read the book, borrow one."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointing","review":"Those who loved Clairce Starling will be disappointed that she has the same types (nothing new) of flashbacks and thought patterns. Those who were breathless at the back and forth slickness of Hannibal and Starling may become angered that Hannibal now triumphs with the greatest of ease, to become the ultimate winner. The book was written as though the author simply became tired of his heroes, so created even greater monsters but tied their stories to the more clever characters, and then threw in a plot which is wholly unbelievable. It's more like \\"horror surfing\\" and far less sublime than any of his previous writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lead Up - to a Big Dissapointment","review":"This book was great -- up until the last 15 pages.I just finished reading Hannibal yesterday. 90% of the book was great - very exciting, and very well written. Unfortunately, the ending left much to be desired. After reading the book, I definately plan to skip the movie when it comes out, if it ever comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think not.","review":"How I wanted to like this book. As a Harris fan from Red Dragon days, I hoped for a thrilling, thoughtful, tightly written narrative, starring the fascinating and pitiless Dr. Lecter. Sadly, we have a rather dull exploration of \\"taste\\" and madness. The ending, moreover, is simply an outrage. It subverts the stern morality which pervaded Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs; this consciousness of right and wrong allowed the reader to accept the horrific violence of Harris' novels. Without this moral center, Hannibal made this reader feel like an accomplice in pointless gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth waiting for!","review":"Delicious page turner! I found this book hard to put down. Dr. Lector is still a charming, intelligent, evil psychopath and he's been missed. It's nice to see the continuity from 'Silence' to 'Hannibal' flow so cleanly. Anyone who is looking for another 'Silence' should not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an eagerly-awaited and disappointing sequel.","review":"Hannibal is the disappointing sequel to its chilling predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs. Clarice Starling, who was charming and vulnerable in the first book, has evolved into a pistol-packin' FBI agent. Dr. Hannibal Lecter, whose psychological acumen seemed able to pierce anyone's armor, has become a globe-trotting cannibal on the loose. The story line is improbable, minor characters are flat, and the book lacks the intrigue and horror of the previous volume. Further, the quality of Harris' writing seems forced. Present tense and sentence fragments are liberally employed to create suspense and an aura of impending doom. This is a difficult technique to maintain, however, and it falls short of the mark in this case. Being an impatient type, this reviewer purchased the book in hardcover. Don't. Hold out for the paperback or simply wait for the inevitable movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first 434 pages can't be beat!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading most of the book. I liked learning more about Lecter's early life and what made him the monster he is today. The ending was a disappointment. I do feel like I was jerked around by the book after reading how it ends. I almost felt like Barney: sold-out when things were going great but when things got difficult, decided he didn't want to see anymore or know anymore. That's how the ending made me feel. I regret reading the book and I nearly threw it out after I finished. The four stars I gave it are for the first 434 of it's 484 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris took the money and ran","review":"This is one of the most over-rated books I have ever read. Thomas Harris now seems to think himself far superior to his readers and produces this load of rubbish. If readers want a good serial killer book, then try THE PSALM KILLER BY CHRIS PETIT or MESSIAH by BORIS STARLING"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I would rather be watchin the Jerry Springer Show than read this crap. What happened to theme consistency, deep characterization, and logical resolution. Mr Harris, get another job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I'd say not to waste your time, however, the ending is soooo bizarre, you should read it to know what I mean. Harris did an incredible job in creating a monster so equally as terrifying as Hannibal, you honestly can't decide which villian is more deserving of death. 3/4 of the book was gripping, but, the Hannibal/Clarice Starling conclusion left me...well, feeling cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Kidding!!","review":"I'm shocked! Coming from one of the best books I have ever read (Silence of the Lambs) to one of the worst. This story was totally disjointed, with no real excitement or intensity. That ending fell apart completely. I will hope that I dont have to revisit this farce being advertised as the sequel on the big screen. You failed us Mr. Harris!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT!","review":"It was with great anticipation that I read the newest Hannibal Lector book. I've been a fan of the series since Red Dragon...I swear to you that I thought I was reading an Executioner book towards the end. I half expected Agent Starling to come racing into the scene with a Harley Davidson and an M-16. I can't even explain some of the premises of this dime store pulp. Awful. An insulting joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal really bites!","review":"While the first two books in this series were absorbing crime dramas with elements that were horrific. \\"Hannibal\\" is a contirved attempt to write a horror story that just didn't work. The whole section in Forlence was cliche. Character treatment was lame. Lecter wouldn't have noticed the big grey van in the parking lot? Starling was so weak willed as to sucumb to Lecter's mind games? Jack Crawford would just wither up because of his wife's death? I think NOT! I suppose if you hadn't read the previous two books it would have helped, but really \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" are far better novels on many levels. After much anticipation \\"Hannibal\\" is a real let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tad disappointing ...","review":"Not only did I read and love Silence of the Lambs but after Isaw the movie I vowed never to see it again because it frightened meso. Needless to say, I too, waited in anticipation for the sequel and was more than disappointed. The book started out catchy and kept my interest for a while. Then it was a little hard to follow when the plot switched to Italy, but that turned out to be okay. Even the \\"brain-eating\\" storyline in the ending lived up to my Lecter expectations. But about the very end with Hannabal and Clarrice \\"hooking up\\"....all I can say is, \\"Mr. Harris, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?\\". Therefore, my recommendation is~ do not waste your money on this like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE BRILLIANCE","review":"This is a modern-day masterpiece which can only deserve a treasured place on the shelf amongst the great authors, Dante and Shakespeare. After reading both Red Dragon and the Silence of the Lambs (Harris' previous novels that focussed around Dr Hannibal Lecter) I waited with great anticipation for this seqeul and was not at all dissapointed. The novel rotates around the infamous doctor and I think is an improvevment on the other two previous novels as more attention is paid to Lecter. I could not put this book down once I had begun to read it and I'm sure you will be the same. Dispite the controvesy caused by the ending, it was a marvellous suprise and Hannibal will hold a place in my life forever. A true psychological work of genius that you will never forget. Greatly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HANNIBAL","review":"I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs tremendously and eagerly dove into Hannibal. I was very disappointed! I actually found the book offensive. Harris seemed determined to cram every variety of evil into this book. It felt as if the book was written to titillate a very perverse segment of the population. This seemed most evident in his depiction of the former child molestor turned child tormentor. I found this so distasteful that I refused to lend or donate the book and threw it away - a first for me! If you felt any connection or admiration for Starling you will be further insulted. I can not in any way recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sorry you were in need of money Tom","review":"What a monumental let down. After the brilliant Silence of the Lambs, and Red Dragon, you give us this? Thanks. I think I'll pass on your next one. I bought this because I figured that it would be even better than those 2. I thought wrong. If I could give it no stars I would"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silence is Ended","review":"If you have not read this novel, I would suggest not reading all the reviews. I did that, and lost out on quite a few surprises that make this such a fun read! Okay, it's basically a book about strange people (and not who you think -- Hannibal, the titular cannibal, is a strange bird but everyone here is bizarre to say the least). What was missing? Any connection to RED DRAGON is not in here...Will Graham? He caught Lechter the first time...why no mention in here? Mainly this is to be seen as a sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. As you all know by now, Jody Foster hated what happens to Starling in this novel...so much so that she refused to do the movie(even though Anthony Hopkins will be back). It's an interesting, fun, fast, scary read! Do you want more? I think Harris did a good job of wrapping up the story, but the ending is a little bit out there (be warned). But the ride is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Word: Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed the way the book began in it's departure from the 1st two books. But after the introduction of the \\"Pazzi\\" I was finding myself a little bored and wondered were Starling was. The ending to the \\"Italy segment\\" was anticlimatic. Starling's intense investigation into Hannibals \\"Tastes\\" was good, but it makes you wonder shouldn't that have been done all the years he was missing.I can only say one thing about the ending\\" AWFUL\\". What was Harris thinking?If you find yourself wanting to put it down, go ahead, you will only be wasting more time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The joke was on me","review":"I waited eagerly for this sequel to come out and am so disappointed. The writing style is difficult to get used to, and Harris jumps from past tense to present tense in his sentence structure. Where were the editors? Characters are boring and I don't even know if I want to finish reading this book. Was Harris in a hurry to meet the deadline? Were the editors afraid to make constructive comments? Did Harris have one martini too many while he was writing? I find myself analyzing Harris instead of Hannibal. This can't be the same person who wrote Silence of the Lambs. Like another reviewer I wonder if he is on a remote beach, counting his money, and laughing his head off while drinking a martini? Dang! I wanted this book to be better. The potential was there. Where were the editors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out strong, but the ending is just terrible.","review":"I really like Thoman Harris and like many of his dedicated readers, I awaited the release of this book with great anticipation. I actually stalked the local bookstore waiting for it to come in.I read the book with great anticipation, but when I got to the end I was horrified. The ending is a disaster. The actions of the characters are not in keeping with any rational conclusion.I would return it if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"A THINLY DISGUISED SCREENPLAY","review":"After being thoroughly intrigued by his two previous novels, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this one. Harris's writing style resembles a novice: short, choppy sentences, two-sentence paragraphs, and excessive chapters (103 chapters for only 484 pages). The plot development was tedious at times, particularly the numerous pedantic references to Italian art and history, which were not explained to the lay reader. I did enjoy the characterization of Mason Verger (could he more evil than Dr. Lecter?) and the explanation of Lecter's childhood trauma. This novel was not written for readers, it was written for directors, complete with the ending. Let the cameras roll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I expected a great read after Silence of the Lambs but I didn't get it. It was as if another (bad) author ghost wrote this book. The ending of the book is totally implausable. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal doesn't come close to previous novels.","review":"Much will be made of the gory, sinister nature of Hannibal, the violence and the strange, disturbing ending. What concerns me the most is that in previous efforts Harris made the FBI seem as a capable law enforcement agency. In Hannibal the FBI doesn't appear at all. The agency knows Hannibal is back in the U.S. but little is written about attempts to capture him. Further, the manipulation by bureacrats to ruin Starling's career is hamhanded and ludicrous. In short, there are so many plot flaws and holes in this story that it is unenjoyable. One minor peeve: Harris or his editor should know how to spell sizable (no e) and buses as applies to the vehicles, not busses as a kiss. I waited six years for this book. I hope Mr. Harris will use the next six years to return to the good form demonstrated in Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Dragon To White Elephant-- Why Thomas?","review":"In my life, I have read so many books that another disappointment should not surprise me. Red Dragon/Silence inspired a feeling and fear that in the literary world I had at last found an author with an imagination unknown. I was wrong. Mr. Harris, what you have done! This is not the sequel the world deserved. The characters are either false, uninteresting, or totally alien to your writing. I can only conclude one of two things: either you did not conceive this book, or the Italian government has bought the rights to the screenplay.Still Your DefenderTony Watterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOULTE DRIVEL!!

I would venture to say, that Harris is one of the very few writers whose stories are more compelling in movie form. (Most likely because he will have nothing to do with the script). My advice?...Wait for the movie. I am sure Hollywood can enhance what Harris overlooked and produce another blockbuster hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING !!","review":"major letdown...highly improbable and the ending is absolutelyasinine.

Actually it could easily have been a bit MORE gruesome - why did Hannibal kill the fellow after eating half his brains? Why not just put his skull-top back on and turn him loose (still scrape the plates back into it if he wanted to get his jollies that way)? And there is NOT a large gypsy population in Australia. Clarice is unattractive from beginning to end. Mason Verger is impossible to visualise.I am grateful to the reader from Oxford of 13 August for putting me onto \\"Telepath's Dance\\" in \\"The Man-Kzin Wars.\\" As he says, a much better \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted words, wasted time","review":"Starling, Lecter and many other characters (especially the Italians and the Swiss, as far as I can judge) are nothing more than caricatures and cliches. Harris must have read too many books on popular psychology after The Silence of the Lambs. What a waste! (If you want vivid characters with lots of psychological insight, read James Ellroy's books!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so boring,I have yet to finish it.","review":"There are times when I'm reading several books at a time. I eventually finish all, but have not been able to complete \\"Hannibal\\". A book must really be a page turner to hold my interest. And frankly, I have better things to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Thomas Harris spent too much time describing things that were not essential to the plot. The ending was ridiculous. I wish I had not wasted my time reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't continue reading","review":"As soon as a I got to the part of Hannibel's horrifying experience as a youth, I thought something was up and flipped to the last three pages to find out that Harris lacked real imagination on this sequel. I won't go back and read the rest--I'm too disappointed. Honestly, trying to justify Hannibel and denigrate Starling so the two end up together seems like Harris just wanted this over with. Re-read Hannibel's own thoughts on evil in Silence of the Lambs and realize the character was betrayed in this sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"I bought this purely on the strength of Mr. Harris' previous books. I should have saved my money(and my Sunday). Totally unbelieveable, especially the end. I never cared about any of the characters, too much stuff that just kind of piddled away. I'll bet Harris is laughing all the way to the bank. I wouldn't even recommend this book to BORROW."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!","review":"As much as I liked Silence and Red Dragon, this 2nd rate novel is one you shouldn't waste your time with. The story never goes anywhere until the end, and when it does the result is horrible. Don't expect this to become a good movie unless they rewrite the story. Harris made a big mistake with this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have waited another 10 years for this one!","review":"Like the rest of the fans of Silence of the Lambs, I eagerly awaited Hannibal. The wait wasn't long enough. The first half of the book was enjoyable; a good read. But once Hannibal was kidnapped I wanted to throw the book across the room. Maybe it would have been too easy for Starling to come out on top, with Hannibal captured and everyone else dead. But at this point I'll take easy over completely unbelievable. I hope Jodie Foster doesn't agree to do this movie. There's no way her Clarice Starling would sell herself out that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please","review":"Come on, how can anyone give this book a one-star rating. This is a fantastic novel. True, this book has a different style from the Red Dragon and the Silence of the Lamb, but i think the readers should be glad about the differences because how can you expect anyone in the novel to be able to anaylse Hannibal Lector, like he did to the previous two killers. If any charactor was able to do this, surely it will destroy the legend of Dr Lector. Beside, this book offered an unprecedent double climaxes.p.s. i like the 'Dinner' scence at the end, it's make my skin crawls but at the same time, it's kind of funny as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much waiting for what?","review":"The thrill of the anticipation did not make up for lost time. this is the worst Hannibal series I have ever read. The characters are not themselves. It reads like the sunday paper. what a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An immersive masterpiece which will captivate almost anyone","review":"Hannibal. Dr. Lecter. Monster. It does not matter how this man is refered to, he is simply astonishing. Dr Hannibal Lecter is, in my mind, one of the mos profound and superbly charaters ever to appear on paper. His mind will amaze you, his acts will astonish you. For those of you who felt they they could not get enough of this spine chilling man in RED DRAGON and SOTL, read this and as Hanniabal says \\" keep an open mind\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Different!","review":"I too must admit a bit of disappointment in a book I have anticipated for years. It was enjoyable enough reading, but deviated so far from the flow of the original stories, I found my interest waning as the story unfolded. The ending was just too much to swallow (no pun intended!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Disappointing","review":"Add me to the list of people who are sorry they read this book. It was superbly written, as one expects from this author, but I wouldn't recommend it to any except those who enjoy the triumph of evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris Falls Prey to Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is a very skillful writer who told an insipid story. That is the sole compliment I can muster for his latest effort. I walked away with the distinct impression I had wasted my time reading a book in which the author became so enamored of his own creation (Hannibal) that he let the storyline spin out of control. Note that nothing bad actually happens to Hannibal. Like an evil Brer Rabbit, he is too quick, too clever. As Harris becomes reluctant to harm Hannibal in any way, he turns his pen on Clarice Starling and renders her wanton, silly and superficial -- so much so that she is no longer recognizable as the same character from Silence of the Lambs. I regret to say that as a writer of talent, Harris has slipped several notches in my esteem since his first triumph. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daft fairy tale","review":"Harris's earlier books depicted real killers, drawn from real cases. They took you inside the real world of a particular brand of police work, and the men and women that do it. THAT was what made them good. HANNIBAL has nothing to do with reality at any level. It's a daft, gothic fairy story that flies off into a dreary and lurid realm of fantasy, padded out with a lot of rather unfortunate and han-fisted attempts to portray high culture and sophisticated taste. It just doesn't come off. Maybe Harris is laughing at his readers, but I doubt it. I think he just fell victim to literary pretentions. Well,in so doing, I'm afraid he's only proved that a great novelist he is not, after all. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer of a sequel!","review":"Definitely interesting and engrossing at times, but the ending was totally disappointing and unbelievable. Very grotesque and graphic, and trips down memory lane for Dr. Lechter seemed silly to me. Hope the screenplay adaptation is much improved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the biggest book disappointment ever","review":"When I put the book down, my first thought was that the publisher must have really forced this one out of the author. Big print, lots of chapter breaks, it read like a short story. BS forensics, crappy plot, makeshift (at best)ending and even the voice is different in certain parts. This book should not be grouped with the others. Marketing, book schlock at its worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Be Written by the Same Thomas Harris","review":"This book was horrifying, and not in the way in which it was supposed to be. Hannibal is so poorly written that, for the first few chapters, I thought I'd been sent the unedited galleys of the novel by mistake. Harris moves back and forth through tenses more fluidly than Dr. Lecter's knife through one of his victim's gut. It's like the author couldn't decide if he was writing a schlocky screenplay or a novel. What's missing here is a serial killer, and the thrill of the chase - the most interesting thing in \\"Dragon\\" and \\"Lambs\\" was the suspense, the not-knowing what the hell was going to happen next. Even if you can overlook Harris's amateur prose, the plot is nearly non-existent. I'm going to have to reevaluate my respect for Stephen King (accident notwithstanding) after his praise for this novel in the NYTimes. By the time this book was over, I felt I'd been worked over by Mason Verger's swine. This book sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"I saw Silence of the Lambs, but I haven't read the previous two Hannibal Lechter novels. Hopefully, the old books were better than this one. Hannibal was a shaky rollercoaster of inconsistent plots, unnecessary graphical content (not the cannibalism - other events) and an ending not worthy of a second-rate comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Harris, We hardly knew Ye !!!","review":"One of the best novels I've read in many a moon, and I've read them all. Florence and Mason Verger were evoked so vividly in the book that while I was reading, a movie was playing in my head. The readers who gave this book 1 star reviews must be nuts -- RED DRAGON was oatmeal compared to HANNIBAL's rich polenta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe for disaster","review":"Take the worst books of Anne Rice, Mary Higgins Clark, and Stephen King (that's a lot of books!). Toss them into a word processor and mix at high speed. When the consistency is farly pulpy, fold in Dante's Inferno, any available Florentine travelogue, and Hawking's A Brief History of Time. Blend for ten years. Serve chilled, in an expensive decanter.And now the remedy: Stephen Dobyns' \\"The Church of Dead Girls\\", Ian McEwan's \\"The Comfort of Strangers\\", Patrick McGrath's \\"Asylum\\", or Iris Johansen's \\"Long After Midnight.Mr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending: Are You Freakin' Kidding Me?!","review":"I could have lived with the ending to Hannibal, had the rest of the book EARNED something so weird. As it is, it's an \\"American Psycho\\" ending, ridiculious, stupid and caculated to cause a \\"buzz\\" among readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent finish to the saga","review":"Definately not as good as Silence Of The Lambs or Red Dragon. It started slow and the ending was pathetic, but the middle made up for those shortcomings. I think Mr. Harris could have done better on the ending, and stayed whithin the realm of possibility for both the sociopathic and the \\"normal\\" personalities, instead of having the two meet halfway. All in all, though, it was a decent book, and a decent finish to the Hannibal Lecter saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Clearly the worst of the Lechter trilogy. Poorly paced and plotted, crummy finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperate, despicable, desolate","review":"Poor Thomas Harris. Silence of the Lambs was a great book and a hard act to follow. But still, we all hoped.....and he failed us miserably. His embarrassment must be overwhelming. Besides poor writing and a most convoluted story line, Mr. Harris has assailed our intelligence with a most ridiculuous ending -completely unbelievable. I can't remember being so disappointed in a novel. I hope the author takes up a new profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the end","review":"I believe there are one hundred chapters in this book (give or take a few). My advice is to read the first 99 chapters and write your own ending. You would undoubtedly come up with a more plausible and satisfying chapter. I was intrigued with the majority of the book and interested in the progression of the story. I must agree with other reviewers, however, regarding the disappointment I felt when Harris attempted to put meaning and victimization behind Lecter's evil. Lecter was infinitely more monstrous when his motives were shrouded in mystery. Simply said, I wish I had closed the book before the final chapter. If I had, I would have left it without such a bitter taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and ridiculous!","review":"I read both Dragon and Lambs and was terrified. I didn't find Hannibal scary in the least. The descriptions sounded like a 12 year old boy trying to \\"gross people out\\" by talking about bodily functions at the dinner table. I thought the ending was improbable and silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The writing is disjointed and at times difficult to follow. The ending was very predictable and stupid. The last chapter would have been sufficient. The rest was nonsense. Many characters, such as the Margot character, were unnecessary and cluttered up a dumb storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing","review":"I devoured Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, but Mr. Harris went with Hollywood on Hannibal. Instead of the rich characters found in his 2 latter books - we have the wooden character of Jodie Foster's Clarice in Hannibal and a lackluster story.I normally cannot put Mr. Harris' books down. I had to push myself to read this one. I was disappointed from chapter one on.I missed the rich earthy descriptions of the characters, the hypnotic story line that usually comes with Mr. Harris' books - you know the kind - where you start with page 1 and can't put it down till you finish. This book was lackluster,farfetched and totally Hollywood. I felt as if it was written in 3000 hours not 3000 days as he says on his website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter disappointment","review":"I cannot believe this book was even written by the same author. This book was only gruesome (as opposed to the chilling and intriguing psychological drama of his former book) and gratuitous. The author attempts to make Hannibal more sympathtic by introducing a character even MORE creepy and reprehensible than Lector. The character of Clarice is a disappointment and a joke; there is NO WAY this will be made into a movie as Jodie Foster would REFUSE to reprise her role given the absolutely awful and totally laughable ending. A waste of time and money... don't bother. I am sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"An average story with an absurd ending. Silence of the Lambs was great but it's hard to believe he waited so long to write a sequel like this. The previous reviewer said it best, I felt cheated. The story of Hannibal and Starling deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to almost the last chapter!","review":"This book kept me on the edge . However the last chapter was a let down for the whole book. I put my copy in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....Painful Even...Don't Bother.","review":"This book was a big disappointment to me. I usually have a high tolerance for bad writing and giant plot gaps in thrillers. They're beach reads - I'm not expecting Hemmingway. However, this book really pushed the limits of my tolerance. I've enjoyed some of the author's other books, so I expected it to be a fast-paced, nice escape from the daily grind. Instead, I got a painfully slow, unbearably boring tome. Part of the problem is that these characters are familiar to you from his other book (not to mention a good movie adaptation). What they do in this story is not credible - or interesting. Don't buy it just because you liked the first one...better off finding something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointment! It lacks any of the intense physiological horror we had anticipated. Maybe we'd been spoiled by Silence of the Lambs, but this sequal is slow,tedious, far-fetched and seems its only connection to its predecessor is the character's names! Too bad, it had such potential.If it was just any horror book I'd give it a \\"C\\", but as the sequal to a master...don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read anything by Thomas Harris, don't read this.","review":"Then again, if you haven't read anything by Thomas Harris, don't read it either. The first 300 pages or so were delightful. You were allowed, nay, drawn into Hannibal Lectors mind. You saw how he thought, you were shown how he lived. Starling had little to do with the story in the beginning, it centered mostly on Hannibal, and I liked that. Then all of a sudden, it switched courses. And not in a good way. I'm a fan of Thomas Harris, and if you want something good of his to read, try Red Dragon, Black Sunday, and (of course) Silence of the Lambs. Thomas Harris started out with a pretty decent book, but it didn't end that way for some reason. This book tarnishes the characters, all of them. From Barney and Crawford, to Starling and Hannibal. Oh, and I can't believe what happened to John Bringham. I liked him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"After finishing \\"Silence\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\" I felt like I should sleep with the lights on. \\"Hannibal\\" completely lacks that quality. There just is no tension, no palpable sense of menace in this book. That's the biggest let-down.And the ending? Clarice deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but in the end....","review":"The first 200 pages are really great--I was on the edge of my seat. However, from that point on I just felt that the situations and reactions of the characters grew increasingly unbelievable until the ending which left me sitting with a 'yeah right' expression.I've heard Jodie Foster passed on the film. after reading the last 100 pages, I know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"This book completely loses the flavor(excuse the pun) of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". Be prepared to suspend all disbelief about Starlings character and get ready for her to act completely contrary to the gutsy and self-contained woman we admired in the previous novel. I think Thomas Harris wrote this book so he could have a sequel for a movie deal. I would have given it a 0 star if that option had been available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book...couldn't put it down!","review":"Excellant book! I won't give away the details, but I think the scariest part isn't about Dr. Lecter being a cannibal on the run (from monsters worse than him!), it's the fact that by the end of the book you find yourself rooting for him! I thought the ending was superb, even if it was abit unbelieveable. I can't wait for the movie next year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Previously Good Author Crashes And Burns","review":"This book epitomizes all that is wrong in our current culture. Poor plotting, the \\"sensation\\" of mutilation, cannibalism. murder, and sadism all dressed up with dashes of gourmet information, psychiatric BS, and gratuitous horror. The ending is so ridiculous and so morally repugnant that it offends us in every area of our humanity: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. The terrible pity is that this author CAN write (I enjoyed every one of his previous books) but chose to turn into a literary Maplethorpe with \\"Hannibal.\\" Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense almost as sharp as the infamous insicors.","review":"A trip through the vast chambers of Lecters mind. You can feel his breath on your neck, his elegance and manners in every encounter. \\"Hannibal\\" lets us see the side to Lecter we dare to discover. Human suffering and emotions. Excellent read, intelligent writing, simply mesmerizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very disappointing novel","review":"After reading Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was really looking forward to the sequel. This book is a waste. A plodding plot, gore galore and a finish that is \\"bloody unlikely\\". Major surgery will be required to transform this sludge to the big screen. Bring back Will. (I would give this a \\"dog\\" if available as a voting option.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a huge disappointment.","review":"You have got to be kidding me. A decade of waiting for this. Hannibal being on the next MIR mission would have been a more believable ending than what we got. I wish I knew Thomas Harris's address so I could mail the book back to him for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be sent back to the kitchen","review":"After a fast paced, cinematic opening the book slows to a crawl and barely creeps. Harris exchanges plot for a romp through the grotesque that freezes the action rather than pushes it onward. I started the novel delighted to be meeting old friends but finished it feeling my time had been wasted, as had the characters. Enough has already been said about the ending. If this scrambled narrative moves to the movies it will need some serious rewrites with an eye to widening the lense beyond the freakish. Its now a modern Dracula story that left this reader feeling drained, not by the horror but by the effort to maintain hope that the writing would ultimately redeem the storyline. No such luck. If this was a meal I'd send it back to the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic gone awry","review":"This is as bad as it gets. This follow-up to the classic, superbly written \\"Red Dragon\\" and the brilliant \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" falls unbelievably and painfully flat. This book is regrettably almost excrutiating to read for anyone other than the most ardent Harris fan.An extraordinarily plodding and boring narrative and one of the most implausible and lurid plots that I have ever had the misfortune of reading.I cast my copy of this God-awful book to the swines. I don't even think that swine that haven't been fed for three days would read this drivel.Do yourself a favor and save your money; don't buy this book. Re-read \\"Red Dragon\\" and once again remember what an extraordinarily beguiling and engrossing experience reading can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's gotta be a better way to spend $13.98","review":"I kept working my way through this book, bored silly, hoping that Thomas Harris would redeem himself by coming up with a finale worthy of the excellent \\"Silence\\" and \\"Red Dragon.\\" So what happens? The worst ending to a book... ever! Consider this a warning: don't waste your money. Spend it on beer, instead. Even if you get sick, it's still be a better experience than \\"Hannibal.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!","review":"Not recommended!!!I cannot begin to tell you what a dissapointment this was. First, the entire book needed at least two more editings. Even had I enjoyed the plot (which was gastly in and of itself), the writing was attrocious! (As a previous critic said, you could easily begin at the back and simply remove pages at random!)I fear that like Stephen King, Thomas Harris has also decided to forego any real attempt at writing well and to simply slap his name on trash labeled as horror (read horrible) fiction!Alas...another author stricken from my reading list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pick it up if you don't have time.","review":"Well I hope that Mr. Harris is writing the sequel as we speak. He leaves the door even more open than Silence of the Lambs. I made the mistake of reading parts to my husband, and now he won't touch the book. For those who have less tendency to get queasy it makes us \\"hungry\\" for more. I enjoied it, but I'm worried that poor Clarice and Hannibal will be too old for the next go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadistic, Graphic and Pointless Gore and Violence","review":"I HATED this book. But I liked Harris' two previous books so much, I kept thinking he'd turn it around. I was so disgusted with his need to present the most horrific and graphic situations possible that the rest of the story was lost on me. In fact, so lost that I could never determine the point of it. There was not a character I could even begin to sympathize with, putting me in the position of wanting all of them dead by the end of the book. At least that way, we would know Harris wouldn't try to produce another Hannibal Lecter sequel. Does anyone else think this was merely a screenplay? And could the movie possibly tell the story (weak as it was) and include the gratuitous violence without being rejected by viewers everywhere? But without the gore, this book has no content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad","review":"I am an enormous fan of both \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". I consider them both among the best suspense thrillers that I have ever read in popular fiction. However, this latest effort is written so poorly, it's laughable. I would elaborate but I would be wasting your time as you should have no intention of reading this mess.In a word: abominable."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wonder it took Harris 11 years to write this!","review":"Harris surprised me. I didn't think there was anything too shocking left, but I was wrong. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine that anyone could overshadow Hannibal in his sociopathy but this is truly a macabre Cinderella ending to a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund!","review":"A very disappointing book! The book starts off fast-paced. Then it stops and crawls along with the most boring narrative. I felt no suspense, tingles up the spine, or chills of any kind. Unlike \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".Thomas Harris has been away for seven years - presumably to write this book. One would have hoped that he would have taken the time to sharpen his skills and bring more of an edge to \\"Hannibal\\". Maybe Harris was hoping that we would not miss the edge because of his previous works. I, for one, wished that I could start all over again with \\"Black Sunday\\" and come to this point. I think I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast-Paced with a let-down ending.","review":"I considered myself a Thomas Harris fan until I finished reading Hannibal. I thoroughly enjoyed both The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. I must have romanticized Clarice Starling's and Hannibal Lecter's characters because they were unrecognizable in this, the newest book. The plot was beyond far-fetched! Trust your judgement. When it starts to seem a little odd, please know its going to get worse! I also disliked the character Mason Verger-the veggie with attitude! Nothing in the story seemed to gel. All elements of the story seem to chafe against each other. The one good thing about the book was the pace. It is very quick reading but when you get to the end you may wish you hadn't. Harris does leave an opening for yet another episode in the Clarice Starling saga. Let's just hope that Harris' heart is into it the next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this book written in half an hour??","review":"Who were these characters? These were not the same individuals that were in Silence of the Lambs. I was greatly disappointed that Thomas Harris felt the need to use violence for just shock value, as I thought the previous story had much expansive value. The ending of this book was unbelievable. Unbelievable, but not in a good way, a better word would be stupid. Can someone please tell me how to get my money back? This book is more than a waste of time; it actually decreased my intelligence.Did anyone notice that the picture on the back of the jacket bore a striking resemblance to the description of Dr. Lecter? Would you say over identifying with your character?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not worthy of the attention it has been given.","review":"This was a disappointment. Although Hannibel Lecter is such a complex character, I didn't need to have Italian poetry included as part of the text. I thought this was pretentious. Also, the detailing of the vintages and foods was almost pornographic in its detail,as was the brutal descriptions of the dispatching of the victims. Also, Clarice's character did not seem fully developed. There were too many references back to The Silence of the Lambs. I think this would have been much better if it stood on its own. Unfortunately, I now feel exploited for having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete letdown","review":"Thomas Harris' \\"Hannibal\\" is not one of the worst books I have ever read - but it's close. I thought \\"The Red Dragon\\" and \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" were well written and entertaining, but \\"Hannibal\\" was a joke. Mr. Harris used so much gore that instead of being disturbing, it was funny. And the ending was ludicrous! If Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins have signed to do the movie, they must not have read the book yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but unbelievable..","review":"I knew this book wasn't very good when I found myself laughing out loud at the \\"scary\\" parts. I will admit that I had never read a Harris books before, however, I am sure that this was not one of his best. I read quickly through the long and uneccessary descritions, hoping that eventually I would reach \\"the good part.\\" Unfortunately, this never happened. I give this book two stars for it's entertainment value. It is easy to read and even has some laughs in it (even if the author did not intend it that way.) As for this becoming a movie..well, lets just say that I would go to the cheap show."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the paperback...or check it out at the library","review":"i read the whole book it three days...disappointing, but better than what's on TV. i found the ending ridiculous, because i'd honestly expected more from starling. again, a male writer who \\"doesn't get it\\" when it comes to writing women."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ENDING !!","review":"Wish I hadn't wasted my time getting to the end of this BORING book. The ending ruined \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" for me. I refuse to recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters and content not up to \\"hype\\", disappointment","review":"After the wait, this book is such a disappointment. Hannible isn't as evil as he should be. Harris has made Clarice a weak pitiful person, and he has done the same to Jack Crawford. Granted, the new evil person Mason Verger, is a good villian. But, after waiting so long for this sequel, I am so disappointed I could cry. Please don't make a movie of THIS book. I have read Silence of the Lambs twice, seen the movie three times and will watch it again. But, I will never recommend this book to anyone. I regret spending the money for a hardcover, wish I would have waited for a \\"used book\\" sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"450 pages of absolute brilliance, 25 pages of absurdity.","review":"It did take me a while to get into this one, as it seemed most readers. Once into it, I thought Harris' dedication to the theme, and charecteristics of Lecter were brilliant. The portion of the book in Italy was somewhat overwhelming, involving too many details and language, which the average reader is unable to absorb. The book, did however keep me involved until the final two chapters. The ending, however, was absolutely rediculous, and made me regret reading the previous 450 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, implausible and will make lots of bucks...","review":"Amazing what you can get away with when you become a big-name author...a first time novelist would be lucky to even collect a rejection slip for this one. With the exception of Hannibal, the characters are reduced to cliches...poor Clarice, superwoman downtrodden by the male establishment. But that's what it takes to sell books today. The ending is ludicrous, it can't be explained, so Harris doesn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing conclusion to the Hannibal trilogy","review":"I bought this book before it was released. I was as excited about this release almost as much as Episode I of Star Wars. But unlike that film, I was extremely disappointed by the results. A very gothic and boring tale about nothing. I was hoping for an exciting story of Clarice Starling and her hunt for the escaped killer Hannibal Lecter. Instead, it is a long, drawn out glimpse into Lecter's appreciation for life (ironic) and a new evil character that is trying to avenge his being condemned to a wheelchair by Lecter; I don't care about this new character. I wanted to read about the people that I have read about in the previous novels. There were some exciting scenes (the opening FBI raid and Lecter's escape from Italy) but that's it. Please do not make a movie. I don't want to relive the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and unrealistic","review":"This book was one I was looking foward to reading. Usually a good book I can read in two days because I don't put it down. This book though I couldn't find myself picking it up. The first half was boring. There was too many Italian refrences and words for someone who has never been to Europe to really enjoy. The other two Harris books punched you from the start where as this one I am still waiting for a smack. The ending was very false and seemed like Harris was trying to be out there . After reading the book I wish I hadn't, the hype was more enjoyable than the book itself. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sickest thing I ever read... and I HATED it!","review":"Now, I like sick stuff, and Silence of the Lambs and all that stuff he wrote just gives me the creeps. But this one sucked, 100%. For example, there is a part where Jody Foster ends up eating someone because of what happens to her. She should be in the movie, but on top of that her character would just not do it. Never. And it made me nearly vomit. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary KITSCH","review":"I just finished reading Hannibal and it it's idiotic. The book is the exact opposite of the movie. The book wants to talk about a very cultivated man and a strong woman but all it does is kitsch them! Mischa is A stupid idea! the cultural references to Dante don't link H and Clarice. For Dante, Betrice means divine revelation, much like \\"If you love me you'd stop\\" in the movie. if you want to understand h and c watch a hybrid hannibal starring a.h. and jodie foster. Thomas harris should read more and then write. I'd be ashamed to produce sth like this, at least in front of my characters..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a book this could have been.","review":"Judging by the cover I thought this book was going to be good, but then I started reading it. There was this whole title page thing which really was kind of a letdown as it was mostly just a repeat of the cover without the picture. The chapters list was somewhat more promising but kind of left me feeling empty after that I just kind of lost interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-christian, anti-jesus book","review":"This book is a definite attack on the christian values of jesus. It makes the villian the good person -- just like those who persecuted our savior jesus thought of themselves. it is a direct slam against our beloved jesus and christiantity and part of the liberal media's cultural war against us. imagine, making a \\"cannibal\\" who eats human flesh for pleasure intoa hero! jesus would be crying if he had read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending Ruin the Book for Me","review":"I only read this book because I was intrigued about all the gossip surrounding the movie and how the movie was changed. I wanted to read the book to see how it actually ended. It was a total disappointment. The Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs and the Clarice Starling written in Hannibal are two total different characteracters. Now I see why Jodie Foster didn't do the movie.One thing that I did enjoy about the book is that I found the movie was very close to the book, except the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delicious!","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" is superlative... a rare delicacy among modern popular fiction. Don't expect a copycat sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". This is an original, audacious work that is as stylish and engrossing as it is nightmarishly disturbing. The finale is OUT OF THIS WORLD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably one of the worst books ever written.","review":"Hannibal is a just plain lousy book. Thomas Harris appears to be mocking his loyal readers by giving them a poorly constructed plot and a ludicrous ending. Perhaps that is why he has not written a book in over ten years. He spends more time in telling us about Italian Renaissance History as relating to the Italian cop and what pigs can do to a poor soul than framing a concise narrative.The villains are boring and Hannibal himself appears at times to be a good guy. As for the future of Clarice Starling, the book makes me totally uninterested in her fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and astonishing","review":"I loved this book. It amazed me. I never believed that Mr. Harris could write another Lecter book without selling out to the hoards, like Crichton's \\"Lost World\\". I held my breath throughout the book, blinking my eyes while turning pages. I am in awe of Thomas Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the top","review":"The reason I'm giving HANNIBAL 4 stars is because middling Harris is better than 95% of what the rest of us write, but that said, this book does not live up to RED DRAGON or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I think of this work as overripe Lecter. Less is more, but in this book we get way too much. The plotting is over the top, and villain Mason Verger is beyond belief. What made the preceding books work was that you actually believed that these fantastic events could really happen. HANNIBAL is more like a fairy tale. You go along with it but you know it could never be real, and so the story often feels more silly than scary. But if you, like me, are a Hannibal Lecter freak, don't pass this one up. If nothing else, the good doctor's recipes will give you a chortle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The long wait resulted in a slap in the face.","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books that I have ever read. Hannibal Lecter is merely a shell of his former self and Clarice Starling is a lame pawn in the goings on of men. I will give Harris credit for Mason Verger. Verger was brilliantly disgusting! On the whole though, the story was quite lame as far as thrillers go. After years of waiting for the next Harris book I felt extremely flat at the end. The ending was absolutely absurd. Hopefully we've seen the last of Hannibal and Clarice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very easy to put down and forget","review":"Dull characters, obscenely unreal plot line, and, dare I say?, BORING. A huge dissapointment. Throwing in a few obscure literary and culinary references does not make for an intelligent book, when the characters are one-dimensional and the writing is stilted and dry. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this over-hyped drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal is too mellow for a serial killer","review":"I was truly diappointed by Hannibal. It starts out wonderfully,with Clarice Starling right in the middle of more FBI action. Butthen, Harris takes the story to Florence. It loses steam from there and the end is completely unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, over-the-top comic book gothic","review":"The novel is just a dark, satiric ride through the moral wasteland we're living in, playing against reader's expectations. I had one hell of a time with it. Clever, fast and mean. And 100% unadulterated by editors, agents or \\"market\\" expectations. Harris just published what he wanted, and he's one hell of a thriller writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding, but unsatisfactory at the end","review":"i revel at Harris' ability to make the reader feel sypathetic for Hannibal. He truly is a monster, but i was rooting for him all the way through. interesting that both mason and hannibal have younger sisters, but it is the very \\"monster\\"-Hannibal, who is tender and loving toward his sister even after her horrible death, whereas mason abused his sister and enjoyed watching her suffer. There are lots of interesting parallels in this book. The part with the dinner did make me slightly urpy, but made me cheer at the same time. the only dim spot is the end. It leaves the reader unsatisfied, almost like having dinner and no dessert. other than that a most addicting an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The monkey is off his back...","review":"I didn't read \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", nor the first part of this trilogy. I was only familiar with it via the films, which captured a perfectly horrifying set of images. I am now fully prepared to hand over all of that credit to the filmmakers. After reading \\"Hannibal\\" I can only assume that Thomas Harris is happier than I am. With this book he can finally put an end to the \\"when's the sequel\\" question that has popped up for years. It seems as though that was the sole purpose to this book, to end a series as ridiculously as possible as to guarantee no demands for a new installment. Yes, at times you are sufficiently spooked, and yes also, you spend far too much time reading about entrails. In the last act, you can almost imagine Harris at the keyboard clickly madly as he tries to come up with the most outlandish and absurd finale. I do hope that this truly is the last we see of Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment!","review":"Harris-please work on your endings. This book was the prime example of why you should just leave a good story alone and not bother writting a sequel. Silence of the Lambs was fabulous but Hannibal ruined everything Clarice is and made her a weakling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still thinking","review":"From time to time, I was annoyed at the change of viewpoint, narrative, first person.. but it often gave me the feeling that Lecter himself was narrating the story. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, but it wasn't a cop-out. Maybe he could have been a little more exploratory there.. talking us through some of the deeper wells of psychology that many of us are missing. However, this is not a book for those readers who want to be hand fed the meaning of everything. It was a deliberate ending with deep meaning, and it ties into Lecter's past. I enjoyed the book, and was not disturbed or dissapointed in the ending one bit. Thank you, Mr. Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, needed another edit","review":"I'm not sure what disappoints me more, the book, or the good reveiws, most notably Mr. King's. Erasing the line between popular fiction and literature? Give me a break. This book was horribly written. The author changed from present tense to past tense at every whim within the same paragraph. And the senator's name was spelled different in various parts of the book. Ridiculous. Did no one proofread this? As to the story, there was no suspense, just the gruesome details that a writer of Harris' obvious ability needn't have stooped to. I have my doubts that he even wrote this. Although I enjoyed the book as I would a cheap horror flick, I can scarcely recommend it. And I agree with those who didn't care for the ending. Totally absurd and random and should have stayed in the author's deleted files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal is Horrible","review":"After eagerly awaiting the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, I was very disappointed with Hannibal.If you liked the author's two previous books, DON'T read Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"I found this book to be predictable and disjointed. Harris should let an editor work with him since he constantly interrupts the flow of the story with psycho-babble. The method of Mason Verger's revenge is totally unbelievable. Anyone with a brain in their head would not be surprised at the ending. Since the two main characters seem very happy at the end, I can only hope there is no possibility of another Hannibal Lecter novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD SOAP OPERA BAD HARRIS","review":"This book does not have the suspenseful plotting or naratative drive of the two other books in this seris.Red Dragon was better than TSOL but, both books used Lecter as a foil to balance the disturbing natures of the two seemingly normal protagonists. Verger, used in that capacity in Hannibal was unrealistic. As a soap opera to flesh out the characters from TSOL this book is somewhat interesting. A prequel showing how Graham initially caught Lecter would have been far more entertaining.This is the first hardcover fiction book I've bought in years ,I will not make this mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I vote with the two star customer review. Starlings character not at all like her previous roll. Hollywood may be able to have a better ending; at least hope so. I felt let down by the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTING!","review":"I just finished reading this book yesterday and felt that I had to let you all know how bad this book is. I had such high hopes for it when it came out as I loved \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" However after reading it - I wish that I hadn't wasted my time. Most of the characters are disappointingly flat (especially Starling) and the ending is a complete joke. Harris has spent too much time describing the scenery and not enough time developing the plot. It seems like he wrote this in order to cash in from the success of the previous book. I FEEL ROBBED! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"After reading, enjoying and evangelising Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, this is a huge disappointment. The characterisation plumbs new depths of childishness, the plot (killer pigs) is contrived and the ending just simply beggars the belief that the previous two novels instilled you with that 'this could actually be happening'. Thomas Harris should go away, take stock and reconsider his abilities. Just writing what you can does not a good novel make. It's not a thriller, it's not suspenseful, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodi was right","review":"Upon hearing Jodi Foster wanted nothing to do with the next Hannibal movie, I was initally disappointed. Then I read the book. Where is the Harris who thrilled me through Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs? After shooting this dog full of holes, I am afraid to re-read those classics, fearing I might find fault with them. Have I become more sophisticated, or has Harris sold out? I fear the latter. The premise was unconvincing and contrived. I specifically requested this book as a gift and would like to publicly ask her forgiveness for money wasted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"This book was disturbing in many ways, not one of them interesting. No one who read SOL and understood the characters could believe that they are the same people in this book. I enjoy being scared by Thomas Harris; This book was not frightening just gross. If you loved SOL & TRD do not waste your time with this book. This book was not frightening just gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I've never felt compelled to offer a review on Amazon, but Hannibal inspired me. There are some books I wish I could un-read. This was one of them. I threw the book away after reading it. I am no English major, yet I couldn't help notice the number of obvious grammatical errors in the book. Apart from poor technical achievement, the author also irritates by attempting to impress us with his knowledge of art and food and finer things to the point where he appears conceited. And finally, we're supposed to like Hannibal? He still eats people! That's wrong... isn't it? Don't buy this book. If you have started it, put it down. It won't get any better if you stick with it until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hannibal\\" a disappointment","review":"And it started out so interesting! But by the end, Hannibal seemed way out of character, and Clarice wasn't the same Clarice from Silence of the Lambs. I was disappointed by the ending. Not nearly as good as Harris' other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I read Silence of the Lambs in a few days, it kept me so enthrallled. HANNIBAL took over a month to finish. I was so uninterested in it I had to force myself to finish it since I had paid for it! The last part of it was so ridiculous. If I had just waited and gotten it at the library I would have taken it back after a third of the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I adored Silence of the Lambs and was quite excited to read Hannibal... it was extremely difficult to get into. SLOW initially. Finally it started to pick up and I was going to keep on giving it a try. I believe that Harris was trying way too hard to outdo his work from Silence of the Lambs. How gross can we make this? How ludicrous can this be? He tried too hard and I feel that it unfortunately was what ruined it. Harris is a quality writer - and it seems to me that he tried too hard to create a new masterpiece rather than writing a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, I hated the ending, it made Starling out to be a complete idiot. It showed Starling with zero backbone and none of her cleverness from the first book. Hannibal (character) was good and I understood the concept of the entire book, I just think it could have had a different ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Readable, but lacking any credibility and deeply disappointing when compared to Red Dragon / Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLARICE WHERE ARE YOU?","review":"I loved the rich characters in Silence...., but here, Harris basically abandons Clarice and instead creates an atmospheric, gruesome and gothic story around Hannibal himself. What is missing is the resolve and further development of precisely what made these two characters so intriguing in Silence -- their fierce respect for one another, and their implicit \\"oppositeness\\". We never get what we want in this book, which comes from a completely different angle. For those of you who enjoyed the ending, I could not disagree more -- it has one the most disappointing finales in recent fiction, certainly that involve characters we know. I simply have decided to separate this story from the clarity and near-perfection of Silence..., which is a breed apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read, but not as good as the Others","review":"I thought the book read very well, and maintained a god pace. However, it did not have the psychological impact that the other two books (Red Dragon, and Silence of the Lambs)had. It did have some enjoyable and vivid moments and I recommend this book to any suspense fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, baby!","review":"This novel degenerates into an Austin-Powers sort of ending, so ludicrious that it was easy for me to imagine Lecter looking up from his harpsichord and saying, \\"Good evening, Clarice. You look so..shagadelic! Rowrrr..oh, behave, you naughty thing!\\" Thomas Harris has been a fine novelist up to now. What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"DOG\\" RATING, ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH!!","review":"How disappointing! While SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was suspenseful and thought provoking, HANNIBAL is predictable, boring and overly gruesome. The ending...well, it totally goes against what we know about Starling's character. I bought it the minute it came out. No patience! Had I waited even one day, I would have seen the awful reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I loved The Silence of the Lambs, and was excited to read Hannibal. I read Lambs right before Hannibal, and I think that Thomas Harris or his editor should have refreshed themselves too! Not fifty pages into the book, he makes a reference to Lambs that is inaccurate! I was stunned, and irritated. The style of Hannibal is totally different from that of The Silence of the Lambs. I think I may have liked this book better if I had never read Lambs. The scenes seem implausable, and is written in a dreamy quality I was not looking for in this novel. Some of the references to pop culture are wrong as well, another editing problem. (It wasn't \\"La Macarena\\") I don't recommend this book if you loved The Silence of the Lambs and are looking for anything similar. You will be very disappointed. If you go in with no expectations, it's an OK book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile. Depraved. Unworthy.","review":"I thought that Red Dragon was one of the best books of its genre that I had read, and SOTL was, arguably, even better. I can only assume that Hannibal was the author's reaction to the glorification of Hannibal Lecter that followed the movie of SOTL. If so, and Hannibal is indeed a parody of his earlier work, then Harris holds his readers in the ultimate contempt. I came away from this book feeling angry and disgusted (not to mention, cheated). This book has no redeeming qualities, and quite apart from its basic depravity, it's a big waste of time. It is sick, and my advice to the author is: \\"seek professional help\\". By the way, Australian coins come in the following denominations: 5cents, 10, 20, 50, $1, and $2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"Thomas Harris couldn't have had a better chance of another hit, but boy did he certainly blow it. The strong characters he built in Silence of the Lambs were changed dramatically. What scared me so in the first book was that the plot could be somewhat plausible. Again, Harris destroyed this possibility especially with his ridiculous ending. I wound up kicking myself for spending time reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star","review":"Harris revealed himself at last in this stinker of a self-parody. It shows he has nothing but contempt for his readers. Anyone can go to the library and search back issues of The Wine Spectator, Cuisine Magazine and Fodor's Italy and come up with enough obscure references to truffles and wine to sound erudite to the unwashed masses. This book was not a thriller. It contained no thrill. Harris just filled 484 pages with his self gratification fantasies dressed up like trailer trash at the opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Comeback","review":"Hannibal Lecter, the evil, cunning and shadowy figure of the \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" becomes one of the greatest dark-heroes ever created. By the masterpiece of Harris, we meet him again, this time with no bars between us. Perfect gentleman, troubled scientist, uncanny genius and ravening killer. All in one, and all in harmony. Under the setting sun, he plays Bach on his harpsichord while dining on his victim, savouring the exquisite taste of selected wine and human flesh. From Gothic Floransa to United States, a relentless chase issues, but it is difficult to distinct who is the hunter, and who the prey. Great work, summing up all the beauty of \\"The Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". Should definitely be read before the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter disappointment","review":"I don't get out much to see movies, and heard \\"Hannibal\\" was pretty gory, so I got the book. I thought \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" was a good book and movie -- and expected more of the same. Well, what a TOTAL waste of time, ink, paper, money! Terrible. Vile for the sake of being vile, and the conclusion was so utterly implausible. No *wonder* Jodie Foster didn't want to do this movie! The whole thing reads like a rush-writeup of someone's bad (and weird) dream. Very very disappointing. Two thumbs down. (Why aren't NO stars available?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"airplane fodder, nothing more","review":"I usually try not to spread bad vibes -- what's the point, really? -- but so much great stuff was written about this one on its jacket that I have to vent my disappointment somewhere.When characters are rendered vibrantly, you can \\"hear\\" who's talking without the author having to say it. Here, even with Harris telling you, the voices -- save Lecter -- are indistinguishable on any but the most superficial (and artificial) level.Every character is a caricature of type. It's expected to have its monsters of course, but a disfigured \\"Christian\\" who makes underpriveleged children cry and then swabs their tears to add to his martinis? Puh-leeez...No worse, but certainly no better, than a lot of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MONSTER DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Waiting 11 years for a sequel to one of my favorite books was hard enough... when the sequel is poor it's like a slap in the face. HANNIBAL is a bad book. I can't think of a single complimentary thing to say about this novel... isn't Thomas Harris a thriller writer? This book is without thrills. It turns the greatest villain of the century into a hero, and then drops him into a bad James Bondish plot (cybernetic pedophile without a face conspires to use pigs to eat off Lector's feet?!?) Endless Italy travelogue, Starling wasted, no Will Graham, needless lesbian mayhem...This should have been the greatest book of the decade, instead it was a bitter pill to swallow. I wasn't asking for the world, just a good, satisfying read. I can't even believe it's the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, very sad...","review":"Such a shame, after waiting for so long. Harris at his worst: no plot, ridicolous characters' personalities development and such a poor writing! Is he the same Harris who wrote Red Dragon? I doubt it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Blows!","review":"What, did Thomas Harris get sick of his own work halfway through? It seems like he gave up and just threw a bunch of crap together, bundled the manuscript up, sent it off, and called it good. What's with the garbled points of view? I found this book to be an insult direct from Harris to his fans. The plot was wooden and predictable in the beginning, moderately interesting in the Florence scenes, and then degenerated into total self-indulgent nonsense at the end. I agree: I think Harris has fixed his own wagon so he won't be expected to continue the saga of Lecter and Clarice. I see his attitude as \\"Hey, screw you American Reading Public. You asked for a \\"sequel\\", here you go, now leave me alone.\\"I'm disappointed in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS THE BUCKET","review":"TH has got to be kidding. Did we drop a little acid before getting in front of the word processor, Tom?? Not only is the book totally unbelievable, it's just plain gross. It reads like a book that was passed around in class, letting each new person write the next chapter. Doesn't flow, doesn't fit, doesn't make much sense at all. If the movie script actually follows the plot (which I highly doubt), they'll never get Jodie Foster. She's smarter than an ice cube, thank God. As for the folks who rave about this book, giving it 5 stars, well . . . whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Sometimes you read a book because you love the style of the writer and see what he/she has to offer. I really wanted to see what happened to Clarice and Hannibal. Unfortunately, I found the style of Harris' writing to be very disappointing. He has replaced an \\"edge of the seat\\" style with a over the top and extraordinarily unnecessarily grossness that ends up bringing attention to him, rather than his characters. On many occasions I could not help think \\"why has Harris written this in this manner\\". The only reason why I finished this book is that it gave me something to read on the train on the way to work, and in the hope that Harris' style would get better. Unfortunately it didn't. I'm surprised his publishers let this through. I will be very less interested in reading anything more that Harris writes. There are much better deserving writers out there that deserve sales rather than this ... ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break!","review":"I will admit that he writes extremely well. Also, I loved Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. However, the ending was so incredibly pathetic that for the first time in my life, I actually wanted to return a book and get my money back. The ending (was so terrible), that I can't believe I wasted my time reading the book. It's no wonder that Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as Clarice Starling. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me strength!","review":"If the movie script is true to the book, no wonder Jodie Foster turned it down. The edge-of-your-seat psychological suspense we've come to expect from Mr. Harris' previous works was conspicuous by its absence, the violence was gratuitous, and the ending was ludicrous. Borrow the book if you must, but don't pay money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious twaddle","review":"Hannibal Lecter is Thomas Harris. Page after page Harris displays his vulgarity. Describing paintings,clothes,food,books and buildings - the lifestyle of the rich and famous. And to crap it all our middle aged 'hero' gets to give the lovely Clarice a good seeing to.

It doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's write a new ending...","review":"because this one was VERY disappointing. While the bulk of novel was well-written and intriguing in its plot, it leads to an ending that will at first confuse you based on its style, then on how Harris thought he could get away with such a menial performance. It doesn't fit the rest of the book, series, and ESPECIALLY the characters.BOO HISS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A macabre feast","review":"Very disappointing. And Mr. Harris allows himself the privilege to REPEAT himself (comparing the Palazzo della Signoria to a Halloween pumpkin TWICE).And the final \\"feast\\" is really far-fetched: I wonder how it will look on the film-to-come. Hope Ms. Foster stays away from it. henry caraso, paris"},{"rating":"1","title":"And then...AND THEN...splat","review":"I pretty much enjoyed the read, anxiously awaiting the conclusion. Only to find the conclusion completely unbelievable. It's as if Harris just ran out of time (10 years not enough?) figuring out how it should end, and settled for something that fell, splat, on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting exploitation of an audience","review":"Whether you liked, or didn't like, Silence of Lambs (I liked it alot) .... DON'T Read this book. It is disgustingly exploitive of its audience with just barely enough plot to weave together the various episodes of insanity of the type we usually only read about in courtroom accounts (unfortunately). Unless you often immerse your mind in filth, skip this one entirely. The worse part of it all is that (1) this one is obviously soon to be on the silver screen- probably a big hit and (2) there is an audience for this filth (I'll have nightmares about that aspect for awhile)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing...","review":"After reading this book, my immediate impression was that Mr. Harris wrote what he thought people wanted. I suspect he was under intense pressure to write a sequel and finally succumbed. While not a bad read, Hannibal is so over the top that it's impossible (for me) to replay the events of the book in my mind without laughing. Hannibal Lector is no longer compellingly crazy, now he is just whacked. The ending isn't plausible, and by then you've stopped caring about Clarice and especially Dr. Lector. To me it would be VERY difficult to top Silence, this book proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not as intense as his other books","review":"I was very disappointed in this book!! as it lacked \\"the edge of my seat\\" page turner, as his other books gave me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious as hell","review":"This was my first Thomas Harris book. I found no characters empathetic, most of the story completely lacking in believability and much of the copy devoted to the author's self-congratulatory knowledge of all things pretentious. I give credit for the occasional well-written phrase, but overall I couldn't wait for it to end. With so much to work with in this story, it was a complete disappointment and the ending was beyond ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great letdown from RD and SOTL.","review":"I just read through Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs very quickly to set-up reading Hannibal. The first 2 books were incredible, I was intense in starting to read Hannibal. Unfortunately, I have hardly ever been so disappointed. The book worked for me until the final forth. From there it took on the ridiculous, and the ending was a huge, huge letdown. Absurb. I hope Tom Harris mercifully ends this story with Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I agree with what many of the other reviewers stated; the ending is neither believable nor logical. It is one thing for two people to have an immediate passion for each other despite other differences. But the development of anything else between Lecter and Starling is ridiculous and was never set up appropriately. I suspect in the 4th installment, which I won't bother reading, the author will explain that Starling was merely brainwashed and will find her way morally and bring down the evil doctor, thus lining Harris' pocket with another book. And are we supposed to believe that because of what happened to Meisha that Hannibal's existence is justified? He doesn't merely killer truly evil people, he kills his enemies which are not always bad people (like the guards in Silence). The story with Mason Verger is good but the Lone Ranger save by Starling is foolhardy. Thumbs Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The third but not the best","review":"Sorry folks. Just about every reviewer in the U.K hated the third in the series and for once I'm inclined to agree. 'Red Dragon' scared the pants off me, 'Silence of the Lambs' showed what a really good Author Robert Harris can be but 'Hannibal' just wasn't up to the job. I suppose the ending was the clincher. Without giving too much away it was in a word 'preposterous'. It's a word that no-one uses much these days. Maybe if Robert Harris writes some more novels it may come back into the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This was a horrible , boring, unsatisfying,book.

The way Clarice was portrayed in this book was not how, after reading Silence of the Lambs, readers would expect her to act. I don't want to ruin a bad ending for anyone so I won't get into the details. However, it's no wonder Jodi Foster refused to play Clarice in the future movie. The ending was a huge disappointment. In the past she was a strong-willed women. This ending was so unlike Clarice. Until the end, the book isn't too bad, but because of the ending, I think even one star is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"It's as if something happened to throw Harris from his game approximately 3/4 of the way through the book. The first half was wonderful -- drew you in, kept you wondering, made you read one more page... and another... and another... until you realized you were way overdue for whatever it is that called you.The ending is laughable, it's so contrived and rushed. With \\"chapters\\" containing only 4-5 paragraphs near the end, and such a lack of detail (not restraint, but HOLES), I have to say I wish I'd simply never read it, because the magic that Harris has been able to conjure before now seems utterly ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I anxiously awaited Hannibal. I was completely drwn into the dynamic between Lector and Starling in Silence of the Lambs and my return to Harris' work was yearning for moreof it. What I found instead was a story that stretched one's imagination to a breaking point. I find it unsettling that the relationship between Starling and Lector turned into such a disturbing fettish. That goes upstream against anything and everything we learned about her in the Silence. Perhaps if Starling's character played more than an afterthought role in the book, it could have developed into a beleivable scenerio. As it is, the relationship is simply false. I found Hannibal a dissapointing and goulish read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, but cheesy!","review":"there's very little to say in re characterisation and plot that hasn't been said in the other 2228 reviews of this book. I loved it, read it in a day, but thought the ending was a bit of a cop-out. I have three nitpicks.#1: the two officers Starling was helping in the initial police raid were called Burke and Hare. Oh pulleeeease!#2: The quadraplegic baddie was far too batman-esque. I mean, what's with the twenty four-hour tie him up and leave him there to escape method of killing him? MASON, YOU IDIOT, LECTER'S THE GOOD GUY. EVERY VILLAIN KNOWS YOU DON'T TIE UP THE GOOD GUY AND LEAVE HIM TO DIE WHILE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING.#3. the orange motif, which recurred over and over again was just silly. Moths are creepy. Lambs screaming are creepy. ORANGES AREN'T CREEPY.There. That's my bit said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated","review":"I wish Harris never wrote this one. He ridiculed the character, Hannibal Lecter. Moreover, i think Harris isn't a good writer at all. Just by researching on Italy and Behavioural science, he has included many facts but very poor with imagination and creativity. His description of serious and important sequences is poor as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Ending","review":"This book was so anticipated, especially with all the buzz that Anthony Hopkins & Jodie Foster might reprise their roles for a movie based on it. I was very disappointed in the ending which totally changed the characters we know from \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" and made them up to be part of a ludicrous finale. A shocker of a book, yes, but for all the wrong reasons. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Comparison to Silence of the Lambs","review":"I have been hooked on Hannibal Lecter since first viewing the movie \\"Manhunter\\". I read \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and anxiously waited for 'Silence' to be made into a movie. I bought \\"Hannibal\\" on audio cassette the very week it was released because I wanted to learn about Lecter's latest escapades. \\"Hannibal\\" is no comparison to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". Starling's role in this book is disappointing. The ending of \\"Hannibal\\" left a lot to be desired. If the movie ever gets made, I won't be rushing out to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Endings","review":"I had been dying to read this book since the first news it was coming out. Finally I got my hands on a copy and devoured it. I loved it. The suspense, the characters. I loved The Silence of the Lambs and felt this book was a good follow up, until the last few chapters anyway. I feel the ending is totally out of character for the heroine. The turn of events at the end just don't make sense for the Starling that was introduced in Silence. Now I understand why Jodi Foster isn't going to be in the movie. I won't give it away for those who haven't read the book, but be ready for a shock. I'm glad I read it, but I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations Were Not Met!","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to be published! I thoroughly enjoyed all of Thomas Harris's previous novels and I had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. Harris could have done so much with the return of Hannibal - instead he chose to bore us with gruesome details of an implausible story line. And the ending! It was almost offensive - it's as if he took the quickest and shortest route to wrap up the story to meet a deadline.On a positive note, he has a way of bringing the reader into the story with his wonderful landscape descriptions and historical and cultural narratives - they are the only reasons I kept turning the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"far too explicit","review":"\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is one of the most thrilling thrillers I have ever read. So naturally this made me look forward to the sequel Hannibal. Even though the style of writing is still slick, I found the descriptions of what one can do with human beings (dead or alive) way too explicit. Sometimes it is better to leave a little bit to the imagination of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half as good as \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"","review":"Trust me on this one: This is one case where you should skip the book and see the movie instead. Grab yourself some popcorn and go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Quite possibly the most anti-climatic disappointing ending ever published. With Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs as procuresses to this novel I was anxiously expecting a winner, but instead I read a poorly written novel that leaves the audience wanting closure and satisfaction. Harris tries to use shocking scenes instead of reality based sequences, the characters are unbelievable as is the story and the reader is never allowed to be sucked into Harris's world. The ending leads me to believe that Thomas Harris is trying to set up his next big payday. If you are curious I rated Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon as a 4 & 5 respectfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthy follow-up","review":"Pedestrian would be the best description. Nothing new here - just a rehash of Silence of the Lambs, and not in a good way. Isn't anything that hasn't been seen in works by Stephen King or John Saul, and the ending was not shocking but just plain strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a good book-- for me to poop on!","review":"Harris, Harris, what have you done to the characters from \\"Silence of the Lamb?\\" This book is so bad, taking more time out of my life other than telling you not to waste your time is like pooping on poop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I blame South West Airlines","review":"I wanted to read the reviews before I read this book. I REALLY wanted to read the reviews. However, I had a 2 hour wait for my flight at an airport, and I succumbed to buying this book. I will spare you all my thoughts because all of the reviews listed say it all. But I do have to add this; my flight went well, but this book went down in flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a gifted writer; what a shame.","review":"What I can't fathom is how a man capable of such captivating writing could produce this book, which only occasionally shows glimpses of what Harris can do. Needless vulgarity. Comma splices without end. An ending that's clearly only meant to shock. And shocking sadism that belies the author's gentle demeanor. Good grief. It's depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Follow up","review":"I have loved all of Thomas Harris' novels but I was extremely disppointed with Hannibal. The last part of the book was especially disappointing. I usually zip through books but this was a labor to finish. I think Clarice and Dr. Lector deserved a better story. I recommend all of his other books though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! All Shock value no suspense","review":"So much expectation...so little delivery. The only reason I gave it one star was because no stars was not a selection.This novel had none of the drama, intrigue, or suspense of Harris' other novels. Instead Harris opts for the most shocking characters and events imaginable, each more shocking than the previous. When Harris isn't trying to simply shock the reader it seems as if he's showing off his obviously impressive knowledge of art, culture and cusine.I read 'Slience of the Lambs' in one sitting and have looked forward to this book for years. I am so sorry I ever purchased it.If you have yet to buy this book, Don't!!Borrow it from a friend, or grab it out of the trash, which is where mine went."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ending in history","review":"After reaching the end of this book I have decided that I don't care about the money spent on it, I JUST WANT TO GET BACK THE TIME I WASTED READING IT! Let me do something worthwhile with it instead! It's so sad because the first half was good, but as soon as Lecter escaped Florence it completely went downhill. And don't get me started on how weird that whole thing with the pigs was. The ending is so ridiculous - it's as if Thomas Harris (after seven years) suddenly lost interest in his own book and just ended it without regard to whether or not it made sense. What happens to the characters is so out of place that one seriously thinks about just how Harris himself believes it. When they make the movie version I will not see it. Never. I almost threw the book out the window when I finished it I was so disgusted. For shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris Meets Felini","review":"I've enjoyed Harris's books and bought Hannibal as a knee-jerk reaction. Thru three-quarters of the book, I wasn't disappointed. Then, as if Harris got up from the typewriter and Felini sat down, the book simply crumbled from a full grown work into a meaningless satire of Harris' fans being willing to applaude anything with his name on it. The publisher should be ashamed in contributing to the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris has his chance....And blows it.","review":"Thomas Harris, in his last attempt, gave us not one, but two monsers to contend with: Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb. They were monsters because of their minds and their personalities, not their physical appearance. Harris, in both Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon, does not rely on the visceral, slovenly horror found in Hannibal.It feels as though Harris got lazy with his character. Dr. Hannibal Lecter has become like every generic brand bogeyman out there on the market today. Lecter was not scary in SOtL because of what he did - he was scary because of what he could do. Potential can be scarier than actualization, and in this case it holds true. Harris had the chance to deliver a bombshell of a book. Instead this book just bombs. Thankfully I had Deaver's The Bone Collector to wash the taste of Hannibal out of my literary mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque to the point of silliness","review":"Harris tells a great story, but all the way through I could feel him rubbing his chin and musing, \\"What other grotesque absurdity can I put in to turn my readers' stomaches without turning my readers off.\\" He neither turned my stomach (though he came close) nor turned me off (though he turned me off of the only sympathetic character in the book) though he gravely disappointed me.My recommendation is to see Manhunter, read Red Dragon, then read Silence of the Lambs but don't bother with the movie. Forget about Hannibal the book and the character. Let him vanish into the third world, never to be heard of again, as he did at the end of Silence.... You'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE END IS TERRIBLE","review":"Well, I couldn't stop reading this book. I would get home and read until I couldn't read anymore.I must say that it was an excellent book...until the end. The end of this book couldn't have been worse if it tried. The rest of the book was wonderful. The characters were well formed and I was wondering how the movie would butcher the excellent book. Now I'm hoping the movie re-writes the end. It's totally unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodie hated it...nuff said","review":"After reading the book, Jodie Foster said that she would in no uncertain terms imagine reprising her role of Clarice, because the character had become totally unbelievable. While she and Anthony H. await the re-write for the script, everyone else who has not been witness to this ridiculous pice of garbage should await the movie and see if the screenwriters can salvage the mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!! Thats all that's needed to be said","review":"The book has little to no suspense. The first chapter and the last chapters do a little. The rest is a long story that is very drawn out. The film better do some reworking. I usually like everything I read but this was just boring. Wait for the paperback or the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy book; however, was really a screenplay anyway!","review":"I listened to this rag on audio. Thomas Harris completely succeeded in his effort ... make lots of money on the movie. Good for him. What really grabbed me was DANIEL GERROLL as the narrator. Now HE is worth listening to ... even if he is reading an insurance policy. His range of expression is amazing. I will definitely look for him on audio books in the future. I would never have finished this as a book ... too unreal ... badly written ... NO ONE could be as smart as Lecter (really an unbelivable character) ... pompous ... wordy. But having listened to it read by Daniel Gerroll salvaged much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE Disappointment","review":"I know, I know, how could it possibly have lived up to Silence of the Lambs? But I thought there was a CHANCE. Turns out Hannibal isn't a monster at all, he's one of the good guys, and law enforcement is all on the take. And maybe I missed this, but did Harris only write in sentence fragments before, or is this a new affectation? His sentences begin in the middle, and then drift off, like you are walking into the middle of a conversation that already began. Then just for jollies, every once in a while he shifts into the second person, as though you are standing in the doorway watching all of this unfold and he is inviting you in to participate. And then he jumps back to third person narration.I had heard that Harris would not allow anyone to edit his book, and I believe it. I look forward to the edited version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Will Graham when you need him?","review":"Don't get me wrong. I loved Mr. Harris's new attempt but the character of Clarice Starling isn't the same. I do realize that time has passed between her success in killing Buffalo Bill in Lambs but this Starling isn't that entertaining. Mr. Harris should of pulled Will Graham out this time. The plot would of made more sense and given back the mystery of Dr. Lecter's motives. It would of been intresting to see Dr. Lecter encounter Will Graham in the open. Perhaps this is for the future. So for now enjoy Hannibal for what its worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book isn't really that bad. It's nicely written, but when you get down to it, the plot isn't very original (a nemises bent on revenge). I liked Hannibal Lecter better in TSOTL, because this book wasn't as \\"creepy\\" when Lecter is free. We do get a look at his private life, and learn that he is a fine art lover and is an accomplished piano player. This book is more of an action book then a \\"suspenseful\\" one. The ending, however, was quite surprising. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, it's a good bet you'll like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Downward Spiral?","review":"I was so disappointed with this book, I almost regret reading it.Now, let me step back for a moment. I am a huge Thomas Harris fan. I devoured \\"The Red Dragon,\\" ran willy-nilly through \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" and waited with baited breath for \\"Hannibal.\\"Unfortunately, \\"Hannibal\\" was a bitter disappointment. The ending was wholly unbelievable and implausible, not to mention borderline gory and grotesque.It seems to me that Harris rushed through \\"Hannibal\\" in order to satisfy the demands of readers and fans only to produce an inferior novel which left the devoted among us sour.I would hate to think that Harris's talent has been tapped. Hopefully, this is not the beginning of a downward spiral and that Harris has other \\"good things\\" in store for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This is the first book that I have read from Harris and found that I was very dissappointed. For one thing, I hate excess verbiage, which this book definitely entails. Second, if you are interested in elegance and upper-class lifestyles, which I'm not, then this book is for you since it entails very descriptive intricacies of the upper-class lifestyle. Third, the ending was terrible and completely and ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE, or even thinkable! From what I hear, from friends and other reveiwers is that Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs are a lot better. So with that in mind I think I'll give these two books a try. As for the Hannibal, I wouldn't give this book a high recommendation to anyone. Sorry but I was definitely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"I thought this book would be okay but found that I enjoyed it much more than Silence of the Lambs. I could not put it down from the moment that I started. The ending was such a surprise that I had to read it twice. I would encourage everyone that read Silence to read this. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations.","review":"After Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was hoping for the same type of page turner. Hannibal was a good book if you were looking for a psychological dissertation or head shrinking handbook. As a page turner, or as a follow up to Silence of the Lambs, it falls well short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we really need this book?","review":"After Harris wrote Silence of the Lambs I believe his intent was to leave it at that and not write another book. Perhaps it gives everyone comfort to know the outcome of Lector, but I was certainly pleased with the legacy of Lector ending in Silence of the Lambs. This book is unimaginable and just serves as an ending which I think was poor. Otherwise, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were two great books and I also reccommend Harris's other book, Black Sunday."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Novel From Author of 'Lambs' Sheepish At Best","review":"Hannibal is a story relying on previously developed characters thrown into a plot that gets weaker and more disjointed as the pages turn. The entire ordeal, and that is exactly what reading this book is, was unbelievable and poorly told."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deliciously wicked treat.","review":"I arrived at my local bookstore on the day of Hannibal's release. I couldn't wait to bring the good Doctor into my home and get reaquainted with him. What has he been up to I wondered. Who has he been sautéing? Has he been in touch with Clarice? All of my questions were answered and much more. Harris takes us on a journey through Dr. Lecter's deeply twisted mind. I actually found myself rooting for Hannibal as he is forced to confront vengeful enemies from his past. Harris introduces us to another dark, devious, character named Mason Verger. Wait until you get a load of this guy. I admit I am still trying to swallow the conclusion of the book; however, I will not complain about it. Hannibal is a highly descriptive, beautifully paced read that quickly takes a white knuckle grip on the reader and refuses to let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but disappointing ending.","review":"Another Harris cliffhanger is with us. Hannibal is loose and I too found that, once I started reading, I just couldn't put it down. It's Hannibal at his gruesome worst. I was most disappointed by the ending - not at all what I would have expected having read Tom Harris' other books in the Hannibal Lecter series. All in all though, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to all readers of psychological thrillers. Definately not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hannibal\\" is fine dining.","review":"A very different book, admittedly, from Silence of the Lambs, in it's own right Hannibal is better. Far better.Seven years after his escape, Hannibal Lecter is content to let the world move around him, provided he has what he loves most, beauty in any form. He also amuses himself by keeping up with the life of former...chat buddy?...Clarice Starling, who has learned the hard way the FBI doesn't take kindly to \\"Wimonfolk\\" encrouching on their territory.Hannibal's reasons for wanting to help Starling as his own, and never completely revealed. He's still obsessed with her (at one point he breaks into her car and licks her steering wheel).The biggest gripe I hear about the book is the ending. I disagree, I adored the ending. The world that Hannibal Lecter creats is enticing and intriguing. So is this book. Ignore the so-called critics. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN","review":"This novel is full of excitement and pulls you forward with every page. Lecter's uber-intelect is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"What, Harris was supposed to write a Hollywood ending?","review":"Okay, I stayed up all night reading this book the day I got it. I loved it. I couldn't resist reading passages out loud to everyone around me. Of course, the entire time I'm reading it, I am wondering how Harris can possibly end the story in a way that will please everyone.Well, the ending bothers me. I think it will probably bother me for a long time. And I doubt there will be a sequel that fixes things. The brilliantly and elegantly written final act will give me the heebee geebees for years to come. It really gets into your skull.Anyway, read this book. It is not a \\"feel-good\\" book. If you think it is a romance, I hope you mean that sarcastically. Don't be put off by all the people whining about the ending. They're all just mad because none of them predicted what was going to happen. And, hey, it's nice to know that I'm not so jaded that I can't be disturbed by something I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant prose, disappointing story","review":"As was said of another thriller writer, Thomas Harris writes like a slumming angel, but Hannibal is a disappointment. Hannibal Lecter was the devil himself in Silence; in this he's just human after all. And what happens to Clarice Starling seems so compeltely out of character, I just didn't believe it. I don't understand why Harris chose the most incredible scenario of all for her. It squandered one of the most believable, finely-drawn characters I've seen in modern fiction and reduced her to a mere Bride of Frankenstein. A letdown for me. And dinner with Hannibal again? No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please.","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is not that good. How it can be ranked #1 mystifies me. There are so many other great books to read, Cold Mountain, The Triumph and the Glory, The Reader, The Pilot's Wife, why should anyone try and wade through a half-hearted effort like Hannibal ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Great, the Phantom Menace of the printed word. A book with some great ideas, some beautiful prose, but one that fails to satisfy and has, to use a prosaic word, a dumb conclusion. Harris needs a good editor. Harris is a very, very good writer, but he should have resisted the pressure and written something else--not bowing to the moneymen who wanted a sequel to \\"Silence.\\" He must have known--why else did it take him 11 years to produce a sequel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think his heart was in this book.","review":"I was most disappointed with this book! It reads like someone besides Thomas Harris wrote the book. Clarice seemed more like a snippy whiner than the character Harris created in \\"Silence\\". I think she had more scruples than Harris gave her in \\"Hannibal\\". Would not recomend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage","review":"This book is one of the worst I have ever read. The ending was so implausible. Mr Harris has turned what was once a facinating charactor in to a supernatural demon who cannot be killed. what crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly good","review":"I still think the Red Dragon is the best of the of the series. I was surprise by the ending. I guess we can look for more from Dr. Lecter and Clarice. Perhaps Mapp or Barney will track them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing ending.","review":"After Red Dragon, which I considered exceptionally well written, and the best of the three, (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal) about Hannibal Lecter, I was hugely disappointed. While I'm sure that Italy is a fascinating country, I really don't need to read 250 pages of detail I can get from Fodor's...And the ending is really disappointing. I can't believe Harris let's it end that way. What a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nuts! I was hoping for a book - not a sequel to a movie!","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this book. I agree with the person who wrote that Clarice was wimpy and so is Dr. Lecter. The ending is dumb - putting it mildly! I was hoping that Mr. Harris would not stoop to writing a movie sequel and passing it off for a book - my mistake. It is definitely not a book I care to re-read! What else can I say? Don't waste your time - and don't buy it - get it at the library for free if you must! I'm sorry about the gruffness of this review but I'm just so disappointed! Oh, well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Not-So-Great ending","review":"Unlike most Harris fans, I haven't been waiting 11 years for this book. I'm only fifteen,and I read \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" last year. Still, I was looking forward to this book. I loved it until the last two chapters... I can understand the ending, but I really wish there had been more description of what Clarice was thinking. She went insane, but It was so fast, and out of character, that I had to re-read the chapter again.Except for the ending, I thought it was good. Mason seemed more evil than Lecter, and it was interesting to see some of the landmarks from earlier books so twisted, like the institution. I'm not afraid of Lecter anymore though. I appreciated learning about his history, but now he's too human to fear.Still, I wish there was more explanation for the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring & More Boring!!!!","review":"Thomas Harris forgot how to write! Silence of the Lambs was impossible to put down! Hannibal is impossible to get through. I could do without Harris' anti-christian politics at every turn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending Isn't The Only Cheesy Thing About The Novel","review":"Three different novels: one third action film, one third flat, quasi-literary travelogue, and the final third pretentious allegory. The action film is thrilling, the Florence travelogue stuffy, and the allegory insufferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!!! There will NOT be a movie!!!","review":"Here is another negative review...this is not a 3 star book! I can't understand how people can claim he wrote this solely with a future film in mind....there is no audience for this version of events. Maybe some day another writer can extrapolate beyond what happened in 'Silence of the Lambs' because as far as I'm concerned, HANNIBAL didn't happen! Morbidly entertaining at times, but when compared to the first two books, it really DOES appear that someone else wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing ending","review":"What a waste: the author of two horror classics yearning to \\"transcend the genre.\\" Is the ending a dream sequence or hypnotic/drug induced trance, or will the next installment find Clarisse and Hannibal digging up Jean-Paul Sartre's remains and gnawing on them? Who cares! As I finished this book, I was embarrassed for Thomas Harris, to think that this sloppy denouement was the best he could produce after so many years, particularly when the first half of the book is so well done. Harris wants to have it both ways: he wants the readers that Lecter's gory exploits bring, but he also wants to be taken seriously as an artiste. He has become the literary equivalent of Quentin Tarantino, by confusing self-indulgence with creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Waste of Effort!","review":"I feel extreme angst that Mr. Harris would waste this much of my time anticipating that this farce would become redeemable at story's end. What surprises me even more that readers seem to be polarized in their opinions of this book. Must be like buttermilk - you either love it or hate it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit before the end would have been my advise to Harris","review":"A disjointed and poorly flowing work by Thomas Harris could have been saved by a decent ending and used as a setup for the next novel. Instead Harris chooses to show his contempt for fans and characters alike by contriving an ending so unsatisfactory and unlikely that it tarnishes the works that came before. If not skipped entirely this book is best returned to the library before reading the ending. Any ending a reader can make up will be better than the one read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, exciting","review":"Creatively gory. More cartoonish than previous books in the series, but entertainingly so. This book actually has two climaxes; one is a conventional, action-oriented bloodbath (the film will probably end here), the other is far more macabre and disturbing. I can understand why many readers disliked the end, but I thought it underscored just how unrepentently diabolical Lecter really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i could rate it less than one star","review":"stupid plot. stupid story. just plain stupid. not to mention gross. after reading sotl i wonder if maybe thomas harris had a stroke, brain fart,or thought hollywood would buy it outright and jody foster, anthony hopkins would buy it--make him a little richer. he played us for fools-no one will pay money to see the movie-especially after money to buy the book. i have thrown the book away incase one of my children should find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best novel in the hannibal lecter saga","review":"having red the red dragon, silence of the lambs & hannibal, i find hannibal the most scaring of these novels. pure evil gets fascinating when it is practiced in style - and to me the horror goes much deeper than in the previous novels because it is made so clear, how fine the line is between good & evil and how hard it is not to \\"give in\\" - deep inside most of us have a hannibal lecter and i really felt that mine was moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even compare to the first.","review":"I read Silence of the Lambs right before I read Hannibal and because of that I was expecting something remarkable. However, I was thouroughly let down. The book started off with the same tone as the first, but as the book progressed the tone went off track. Another thing that I hated was the enormous change in Clarice. Her mannerisms, attitude, and even her speech changed with no basis for a change whatsoever. Lastly, one thing that made the first so incredible was the limited gore. It was only added when absolutley necessary. In Hannibal, the gore was completely unnecessary and sometimes I couldn't even begin to understand why it was in there. I don't really recommend reading this book, especially if you're a big fan of the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was the worst book I ever forced myself to finish.","review":"I am so glad I forced myself to check this book out of the library rather than buy it. It was beyond awful. I wonder if I can get a refund on the 50 cent holding fee I paid to the library..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A severe disappointment","review":"Harris developed a complex and psychologically powerful dynamic in the previous two novels. HANNIBAL not only fails to deliver on that promise, but proves to be a crude and distasteful parody of the serial killer genre itself. The book isn't even worth reading for curiosity's sake. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Mr. Harris thinking???","review":"I was so turned off by the graphic violence. I have read all of Mr. Harris's previous books and eagerly anticipated this one. I only continued reading it due to some misguided sense of duty or obsessive trait to finish what I start. There was so much he could have done with Starling and Lector's charcters. What did happen was unbelievable and out of charcter for them. Any real psychopath will tell you, it would not have ended this way. Hannibal- Every thing you always wanted to know about torture in 3 easy lessons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and dishonest","review":"Simple: if Clarice Starling was anything more than a plot devicce, or had any character at all, she wouldn't be so easy to turn into a monster. Compare, even with all her flaws, her strength and character in Silence with the cipher Harris turns her into here. Worse than a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"He actually wanted to write a screenplay....he should have!","review":"Harris didn't really want to write this book, and its painfully obvious after reading it. He actually wanted to write a sceenplay for the upcoming movie and that's just what he should have done instead of foisting this garbage off on his up-to-this-book fans. There must have been terrific pressure on him to produce a sequel. I'm sure large sums were offered and Harris probably buckled in and threw some words together in a short time. That's the real reason why he didn't allow any editing of the book. I wondered about that when the book came out, now its obvious why. I won't see the movie when it comes out and I'll encourage everyone in my circle to do the same. Harris should learn that you can't treat fans in such a shoddy manner and get away with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I was a huge fan of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and waited 11 years for this sequel. I can't remember the last time I was so disappoited by a book. The story is for the most part boring and the characters dull. The plotlines (all of them) are unbelievable and just plain gross or dumb. The worst part is that Mr. Harris in unfair to both Lector and Starling. In the pervious novels I was compelled and spellbound by both characters, here they are almost lifeless. I am sure that the ending was supposed to shock me in some way..I just thought it was stupid and a waste of time. I was looking for thought provoking conversation and got mumbo jumble instead. In a word: DULL"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let- down, Don't bother with this one.","review":"I found this book totally confusing. I kept reading on, waiting for the good parts that never came. The whole section in Italy was hard to follow. I can see why Jodie Foster would want no part of this. The ending made no sense at all. It has none of the suspense the first book had. I just thought this book was horrible. I was mad I wasted my time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending was terrible.","review":"I enjoyed the book for the first 400 pages or so. Once the ending started, it got very strange and disappointing. It just didn't work or mesh with the rest of the book. I couldn't buy it at all. Although, in hind-sight, the book is pretty absurd in a lot of points."},{"rating":"1","title":"ending on a bad note","review":"I have read Harris's RD and SOTL. I expected a good solid story. While Mason is something of a chilling character, and the story is somewhat interesting with the detour to Italy, it collapses from a poor, extremely muddled ending.First and foremost, it simply does not follow from what we know about the characters. Obsessive people do not change so easily, and the cheap psychology in the novel hardly justifies the character change at the end. The ending is not bad because it doesn't end \\"happily\\" or with clearcut morals, but because it simply does not follow from what we know.We learn reasons for some characters' horrific behaviors. But when one takes on similar behaviors for no compelling reason, we have writing that smacks of rush and cheap shock value.Somewhat contradictory to the above criticism, new characters are introduced, with their future easily and correctly guessed, much as we know the fate of a red shirt landing party member on Star Trek. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Sold!","review":"My first reaction to this book was, \\"it's just not grabbing me.\\" In fact, I considered the possibility of not even finishing it...what a mistake that would have been! By the time I finished reading Hannibal, I was sold... including the ending.I can see that there are many disappointed (mad!) readers out there, but I think that's because of the inevitable comparison to the film version of SOTL. If you're looking for a film sequel, you'll probably fall into the \\"hated it\\" camp. If you're looking for facsinating character portrayals and a plot that has the guts to go against the popular grain, then read this book. I plan to go back for \\"second helpings\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"less than inspiring","review":"The principal attraction of Lambs was the contrast between the thrill of relevation and the threat of violence. I kept reading in hope to discover the underlying tension from this dichtomy but alas there was no real relevation and only violence itself not the threat of it which is by far more interesting. A disppointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris let his fans down","review":"I have never anticipated a sequel with so much excitement. Consequently, it was with utter disappointment that I finished Hannibal. The book had so much potential. It started off with a great action sequence, developed Dr. Lecter's terrifying world well, and added a new monster-like character into the mix. It displayed Harris' phenomenal ability to narrate excruciating details of horrific events with a cold, almost casual detachment. However, I sense that Harris then either lost his way or simply chose to indulge himself. The climax of the story lost all of its momentum and was extremely sophomoric. And the absurd ending made a mockery of all of Harris' prior great work by causing Lecter and Starling to act totally out of character. As a Harris fan, I feel very let down. If Mr. Harris ever happens to read this, I urge him to rewrite the last half of the book and allow it to achieve its true potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Ending","review":"I can not recommend this book. Without being too specific and so as not to ruin the book for anyone who didn't read the book but intends to, I'll just say the ending made no sense to me. When you develop a character to have a sense of him/her self and then just go 180 degrees with them. That is not a surprise ending. It is an absurd and an impossible ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"4/5ths of a good book","review":"Well, You have got to be kidding regarding the ending of this book. Just terrible and not believeable at all. I will bet that when this book is turned into a movie the ending will be completely different. Did Harris just run out of steam?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal is in EXTRA RARE form in this novel.","review":"Tom Harris is inspired as the plot creator for Hannibal Lechter's latest adventures. However, the author lacks any writing skills and the publisher allowed this sophmoric piece of writing to be unleashed on the unsuspecting public. The writing was not horrific enough to detract from the beauty of the plot development and Hannibal is painted in a new light. Although it is definite worth reading, but it will never be studied as a literary masterpiece; just as another sequel done badly. This is one of those cases where we HOPE the movie exceeds the book. Strong cast, good director, and a miraculous screenwriter could have Hannibal attending the Oscars again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, terrible writer","review":"The story moved along apace. However, Harris is in dire need of an editor. I have two suggestions: Strunk & White and a damn MAP! Obviously Mr. Harris knows nothing about the Washington DC metropolitan area. And his pathetic attempts to be \\"avant garde\\" in his writing style (the distracting mix of present and past tense) are laughable. Bottom line: this story would have been spectacular at the keyboard of a true master. Lecter would disapprove of Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"How unbelievable - I was so excited to read this book and whata let down. The story was just plain gross and the ending was soincredibly unreal. I'll just continue to re-read Red Dragon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I thought to myself when I first saw the book on the shelf finally a sequel to Silence of the Lambs. I went to the library to put it on hold and was the 75th person waiting for the book. When I did get I only had it for two weeks, well it was two weeks too long. I found it boring from the beginning, middle and to the end. Though I must admit I skipped through most of the book hoping to find it more thrilling and keep on the edge of my seat, but alas. It was like Hannibal never came into the picture until the end. Mason Verger was a pain, Krendell was a nothing and what of Starling, well just that what. She was more interesting in Silence of the Lamb. I'm glad I didn't buy this book. Thomas Harris I enjoyed your first two books, The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, what a disappoint about the third. Can't wait for the movie, hope it will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking thrillers to a new level of degregation","review":"I do enjoy my thrillers. Silence of the Lambs was a fantastic fast paced book with exciting action. This book pushes the sick and macabre to new levels. In an effort to be more grotesque than any other writer, Mr Harris sacrifices everything it takes to make a truly satisfying thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated the ending","review":"I enjoyed the book, until the ending. So unbelieveable and out of Starling's character! Hated it! Really, I regret buying this book. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked S.O.the L., you're gonna LOVE this book.","review":"In Silence of the Lambs,Harris' presentation of the main characters was only the tip of the iceberg. Hannibal develops the title character and that of Clarice Starling beyond my greatest hopes and we are left with the question...who are the bad guys and who are the good? The richness of detail is wonderful. I was totally engrossed until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most disturbing read ever","review":"Although the entire book is horrific in its cold detachment, the ending was truly terrifying. Only non-fiction has ever scared me more. Although it's been several months since I've finished the book, one or two scenes are still the stuff of my nightmares. I am completely ambivalent about this book, on one hand wishing I hadn't read it, and on the other relishing it. It definitely makes the reader explore his/her own beliefs about good and evil, and the existence of absolute evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I, like many others, waited patiently for so long for this sequel. Hannibal was not worth the wait. The Mason Verger character was so disgusting and demented, that your stomach turns. Lechter and Starling were so completely different from their original characters, and most of the \\"bite\\" was taken out of Lechter by positioning him against the larger monster of Mason Verger. The end of the book was, to say the least, the most bizarre, idiotic, twisted way to end the book (I think only a psychiatrist would appreciate it). Silence of the Lambs was a page turner and a classic that is one of my favorite books (and movies) of all time. This was an utter disappointment and I am saddened that this is the best Thomas Harris could do after all that time working on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating ending of a trilogy","review":"A nonstop tale which kept me glued to the book. It had enough changes in rhythm to peak ones attention and stimulate ones mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If all-wise, all-powerful heroes are the dullest characters in fiction all-wise, all-powerful villains run them a close second. The parts of this book that follow Clarice Starling are interesting enough, but the parts that concentrate on Hannibal Lecter soon had me skimming forward. As a mysterious character casting a shadow of evil in The Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lecter was quite effective, but the more he moves into the foreground in Hannibal the more two-dimensional he seems. The torture scenes were particularly unsatisfactory, as the author seemed unable to capture the horror of his previous books and ended up substituting grossness instead. This book is another good reason to own a library card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant Attempt to Cash in on Reader Interest","review":"What a waste of money and time. Couldn't even finish it...flat characters, dumb plot. Written just for \\"jolt value\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"what in the world happened to the characters?","review":"After reading the Red Dragon and The silence of the Lambs, I was really looking forword to this book. Like so many of the fans, I rushed out and purchased the novel on the first day it arrived in local bookstores. And than I got home and read it... What can I say... None of the characters seemed like they were from TSOTL. Hannibal was a dark and mysterious person in the other two novels. Here he is focused on too much and all of the darkness is reduced to a some what annoying character. Starling, Crawford, and Mapp are basicly just there in my opinion. i felt that Harris' needed to expand on their characters in order for readers to care for them. Overall, the plot was not too bad, but when the reader does not care for the character, it is hard for a story to work. Also, I found the ending of the novel to be very, well just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me?","review":"Did Harris show the last 20 pages of this thing to anyone before he shipped it off to the printer? Anyone with half a brain (no spoilers, please) would have told him to trash the O Henry ending. After trying to legitimize a fairly decent horror story with page after page of psychobabble, Harris has Starling do what she is psychologically incapable of. It would have made more sense had she suddenly turned into an overweight Polynesian man. Perhaps that will be the plot of the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story ruined by poor ending","review":"Not even close to the high standard set in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or \\"Red Dragon\\". The ending is so ridiculously unbelievable that it wrecks what is otherwise a good read. I expected a lot more from Thomas Harris.Very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Development of SOTL Characters","review":"I admit that I sat glued reading Hannibal hoping that Harris's treatment of the characters would revert back to what they were in SOTL. Sadly Harris failed in Hannibal what he accomplished in Red Dragon & SOTL. The 3diminsional characters fleshed out in SOTL become 2 diminsional in Hannibal. Both Hannibal and Clarice deserved better character development that they got here. The \\"humanizing\\" of Hannibal and the \\"dehumanizing\\" of Starling was incredibly disappointing. The Starling character deserved so much better than what was afforded her, especially at the end. Granted a further sequel is now possible...but I have to admit...I certainly won't look forward to it as much as I looked forward to this sequel. What a pity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Red Dragon- excellent, SOTL - brilliant, Hannibal - waste of paper What a disappointment. The psychological picture of Lector built up in the previous books has been ruined by this sequel. If I didn't know better I'd say it was written by someone else. It started promisingly but just deteriorated into an extremely unlikely, dissatisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silence of the Hams","review":"First things first, Red Dragon ans Silence of the Lambs are classic books that gave great insight to the psychology of profiling serial killers and of serial killers themselves. And they were good thrillers to boot. However, this book is unbelievably bad. I wish I could have gave it a negative star review. Everything is wrong with this book. Jonathan Demme was being polite when he bowed out of making a film out of this mess by saying , 'it's too violent\\" . The whole premise of the book is ludicrous and the ending is even worse. It wouldn't shock me to find out that this book was ghost written by the same person who ghost writes those V.C. Andrews books. Turst me, save your money or give it to charity. If you don't believe me, check this book out at the library. You'll thank me and yourself......."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragic waste of paper and ink","review":"Okay, okay, I think I know what happened: Hannibal Lecter rose up through the pages, roasted Mr. Harris over a spit, and enjoyed him with poached asparagus and a nice Chardonnay. Then the good doctor finished the book himself. (Did he begin his meal with the editor as an appetizer?)Why is it that we can all agree about Red Dragon and Silence being so superb, but the 5-star folks rise up with righteous indignation when we 1-star folks call this silliness what it is? Mr. Harris clearly just wanted to get this thing done, at all costs. I feel like I've been mugged. I'm donating my copy, anonymously, to the local library. I don't want anyone to know I actually bought this thing.*Note to the nice Amazon people: Why can't we have the option of giving NO stars? This book didn't deserve any."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't even deserve commentary it's so bad.","review":"No, it's not too dark or too over the top. It's just plain badly written.

What in the world was Steven King thinking?."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE TIME OR MONEY!!","review":"When I heard that'Hannibal' was out at my local bookstore, I jumped in the car and bought it. What a great, great disappointment. Bottom line - the ending was completely out of character for both Clarice and Hannibal. After 10 years, you'd think Mr. Harris could come up with a better ending. The characters were reduced to rubble. Better than Hannibal's background etc. should have remained a mystery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr. Harris, Thank you Hannibal.","review":"I read your long awaited sequel with regret from the very first page. Regret because I knew I would have only a few hours to be with Hannibal's character.In reading I seek not perfection, but the ability to walk away with more than I had before I started. You have never disappointed me Mr. Harris. Hannibal certainly has never disappointed me. I experienced many moments of joy and emotional upheaval while reading your latest book. Hannibal again reminded me of how very much I have yet to learn and experience on a variety of subjects. You and Hannibal both educate and provoke. What more can one expect from a book.Thank you again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starlings and Lecter, we hardly knew ye!","review":"Apparently Mr. Harris needs to reread the first two brilliant installments of his trilogy. Hannibal takes two characters previously well developed and morphs them into entirely different beings. Clarice straying from her firm belief in law and order, regardless of the political climate of the FBI? Dr.Lecter delving in the psychobabble he so detested in the prequels and showing a human compassionate side? I think not! I finished the book this morning and immediately began calling all those I knew to be fans of the trilogy to warn them to save their money on this terribly disappointing \\"sequel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!!

It's wonderful--full of wit and intrigue and the wonderful prose that Harris is capable of.But in the last few chapters, he goes so terribly wrong that it just makes you want to cry. Lecter and Starling go so far out of character as to make you wonder what Harris was thinking. Did he deliberately want to disappoint and anger his fans? He certainly did a good job with this one. After waiting so long for this book to appear, and after enjoying most of it thoroughly, I can only say that the last few chapters of this book are the worst betrayal of character and reader that I have ever come across.Shame on you, Mr. Harris. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/3 good, 1/3 so so & 1/3 awful","review":"Perhaps this book suffered from the expectations of this reader; another problem may have been that I read the reviews prior to reading the book. All that aside I can only state that this book was a disappointment. Mr. Harris started off well, and the plot moved rapidly for the first third of the book, after that it detiorated rapidly, culminating in the finale, the inane ending. Awful! Even with a substantial discount this book is not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"A whole new book, a whole new direction. There is real (sick) humor in this one. Those who wanted a simple continuation of Silece are doomed to disappointment. In this who-is-going-to-eat-whom game, it's hard to know which sociopath to root for. The only sure loser is the FBI, which garnered no sympathy from me. I enjoyed seeing inside Lechter's mind, it turned a larger-than-life, mythic monster into a sick, twisted man. I was shocked and appalled by the ending, and yet absolutely intrigued by the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"who are these people? am I supposed to know them?","review":"I just don't know what to think. It's an interesting plot and it's plain that Harris is more than just a pulp thriller writer (sure do want to visit Florence now). I preferred Silence of the Lambs. I just can't imagine Starling ending up as she does. I worry that without Jonathan Demme to humanize/edit the story, this movie will fail. I don't think I'll be buying anyone this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and unbelievable","review":"I can't believe that Mr. Harris signed his name to this drivel.

There are so many ways this novel could have gone - I wish Mr. Harris had chosen a different option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing. I recently read the book \\"Red Dragon\\". I found that to be a great page turner. So, What about Hanibal? Starts off great! Had me hooked from the first chapter, only to be let down with the remainder of the book. What was meant to be a shock for the readers turned out to be uncharacteristic of Harris and unimaginative. It seems as if the Lecter/Starling Saga ends with little creativity and a lot of screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a crushing disappointment","review":"What happened to you, Mr. Harris?

Thomas Harris was obviously lobbying for his sequel to Silence of the Lambs to be on the silver screen before the mass market paperbacks hit the shelves. Although there were several bright moments in the story, by pandering to the filmmakers, Harris takes away the thing that makes reading so enjoyable-- the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Harris thinking?","review":"I waited to read reviews of this book until after I had read it myself, and I was glad that I wasn't the only one who was terribly disappointed. I was first introduced to Dr. Lechter in \\"Red Dragon\\", and got to know him better in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", but the Dr. Lechter in this book is not the same character. None of \\"Hannibal's\\" characters is well defined and mental imagery is fuzzy at best. I kept trudging through page after page of mundane text, anxiously awaiting another Thomas Harris climactic ending, only to close the book angily, and wonder \\"How could he do this to his readers?\\" My advice to potential readers is to just ask someone who had read the book about the ending.

However, I was very let down when I began Hannibal. All of the mystery and detail that made Silence of the Lambs what it is was completely abandoned when writing Hannibal. The only shock factor that this book contains is the goriness which does, I have to say, make Silence of the Lambs look like Dr. Seuss.

As sequels often go, this one belongs in your trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris destroys the cult of Lecter in preposterous sequel","review":"Instead of adding to the chorus of those who hate what Harris has done, I have to wonder why he did it. Having read how press and fan-shy he is, I wonder if he doesn't hate the whole \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\" cult of popularity that was created by \\"Lambs\\", and so, decided to destroy the characters. It also seems he came to regret signing a two-book commitment after \\"Lambs\\", and didn't have anywhere logical to go with the characters, so he lurched off into camp, and \\"healed\\" them both. I imagine him sitting in the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, laughing, thinking that since he created Lecter and Starling, he can do anything he likes, including ruin them. And ruin the characters he does, with the preposterous ending to this book. The book is a statement that the writer owes nothing to his characters, or to his fans. Loud and clear, Mr. Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best $$$ I ever spent","review":"So delicious, so full of subtle flavors, so rich, so satisfying... Reading this book is like a multi-course gourmet meat.Have you ever noticed how people who are used to white bread and margarine do not like real bakery bread and real butter?

No wonder they find the book disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK, until the end. Then it turned awful!","review":"The story was entertaining at first, not great, but just bad enough to still be entertaining. There were a few slow parts, but there were also some really good parts. Learning about Hannibal as a boy was interesting, he started to became a much more sympathetic charachter rather than the serial killer. My major gripe was with the last 100 pages. After the climax of the book, you have the biggest let down. I don't think that the ending really involved the same people that the book started off with. I think Starling must have an evil twin that replaced her in the very end, because what happened was totally out of character for her. Maybe she was bonked on the head and didn't remember anything about herself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read.","review":"This book is not merely a bad book, this book is so bad that it left me angry and wanting my money back. I could almost accept a book that had a disjointed narrative that spends too much time with weird uninteresting characters, a villain that is more disgusting than disturbing, and a silly side trip to Italy which feels like it was thrown into the book to so the author could write off a trip to Italy as a business expense. Those things I could accept. But an utterly illogical ending that betrays everything the Silence of the Lambs was about -- this I can not accept. This book is puke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply AWFUL!

I have read every Harris book multiple times and he is one of my favorite authors, but honest to god, this book reads like a boring travelogue for the most part, builds to a climax which never happens and instead meanders off into an utterly incomprehensible, unexplained, illogical, undeserved ending. If you must read this book, STEAL IT or go to the library. Give your money to charity or flush it down the toilet, but don't encourage this kind of self-indulgent crap. No wonder Jonathan Demme walked off of this project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more however did not impress much !","review":"As said expected more in-depth and more exciting, however it is the same thing as the past ( well what do you expect it is a sequel ) but hello ! the reader is more anxious. Till half way down the road the reader is still guessing and gives the impression as the Lecter guy never appears and just keeps on describing Clarice and her life history, and also praises Dr. Lecter as if he is Godfather or what. It is surely made good for a commercial success for the hollywood thing but as far as the book is concerned it is okay, written with the perspective of making a movie ( probably )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"It cannot be overstated what a disappointment this book is! Harris abandons the masterful, nigh-unbearable it-could-really-happen tension of his previous books and just goes off the cartoonish deep end here. The Italy section is very good, but the rest of the book is just preposterous and insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! The \\"Alien 3\\" of the Lecter trilogy","review":"Ending is just like getting the rug pulled out from under you. Why bother to build characters one can identify with if you are going to do what this book has done at the end? Starling is not Starling. Jack Crawford was utterly wasted -- why not just leave him out entirely?Harris spends a lot of effort trying to make Mason Verger an evil man and Lecter more or less a hero. I felt manipulated and did not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, horrifying reading, very well crafted","review":"Contrary to some other reviewers' reactions, I think this book is excellent and I enjoyed it very much--although \\"enjoyed\\" is an odd word for a book that leaves you with images you wish you could forget. Harris spares us little horror here. Many reviewers have said they were disappointed with the ending, but I thought the ending was very gratifying and made complete sense. This is not Patricia Cornwell, this is Thomas Harris. Readers who prefer surface characterizations and slick, abrupt resolutions should probably look elsewhere. If you were fascinated by Clarice and Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs, you should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money","review":"I have waited many years for another novel by Mr. Harris and was surprised to see that Hannibal arrived. I reserved a copy before its release and waited until I had a weekend to devout myself to this book. I had devoured red dragon, silence of the lambs, and thought that this would be just as delicious. Was I wrong! The book is disjointed, poorly edited and disgusting. The intelligence of Hannibal Lecter depicted in Silence of the Lambs and implied in Red Dragon, appears brilliantly in the first half of the novel but then disintegrates like the rest of the novel into trash and very poor character development. I would not be suprised if the first part had been written years before the second part. Agent Starling has changed dramaticaly, not matured but contradicts her established ethical and moral pattern. Mr. Harris owes his fans an apology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What a disappointment....after reading The Silence of The Lambs I expected so much more. Hannibal hardly held my interest for longer than 30 minutes at a time. Where is the mystery? These two characters came together so wonderfully in SILENCE and created such an intriguing relationship. One could have only anticipated the same for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I started reading Harris' books over the summer. It took me 3 months to finish this one. Talk about a boring read! The ending was horrible! What did he do- get bored with writing and decided to come up with a quick fix to end it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Harris does not deserve your financial support","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. When I finished, I said to my husband, \\"That's what happens when you write for money.\\" I enjoyed Harris' previous novels, and even considered them well-written. This novel is not well-written, lacks character continuity, and was very much a waste of my time. I do not believe you should encourage this author to write more material, and I believe this will make one quite awful movie. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this at night . . .","review":"Hannibal is suspenseful, well-written and hard to put down. Hannibal is not the only \\"monster\\" in this book--I was more afraid of those who had it in for him. And the knowledge Harris provides of what lies in store for Hannibal made it all the more compelling to read on. I have reservations about the plausibility of the ending, but it did make for a rather \\"tasty\\" finale. Overall the book was heavy on the gore, but it is the first of Harris's books in which Lecter is on the prowl, and thus our first real glimpse of his predatory behavior unleashed. I read Hannibal every spare moment I could . . . just try not to do it before you go to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book that, after I was done, I wish I hadn't read.","review":"If you enjoyed Red Dragon or SOTL, do yourself a favor and DON'T READ THIS BOOK. I don't think I will ever be able to watch the Silence of the Lambs again. The characters are just ruined in my mind. What a waste.I was going to loan it out when I was done but now I am more inclined to burn it to keep it from ruining anybody else's memories of Starling and Lechter.This was the worst reading experience I have ever had. The ending was just flat out terrible. There is no way around it.I can see why everyone is fleeing from the possible movie.I think Hannibal must have eaten Thomas Harris' brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointing","review":"I'm glad I didn't buy this book, but got it from the library. If I had bought it I would have felt like I wasted a lot of money. I thought the book was okay until the ending. But the ending isn't what you would expect and really made the book a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It met all my expectations","review":"In the years since I have read Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon I have hoped that Harris would deliver a sequel (or call it what you will) in which we find out everything we want to know about Hannibal Lecter.. what makes him tick? Why does he do what he does, what will become of his relationship with Clarice? I am deeply satisfied with the conclusion of this book, which I found to be thought-provoking and will probably continue to be, for me, long after Hollywood turns it into a catch-the-bad-guy thriller.My only complaint with Hannibal lies in Harris's inconsistent switching from past to present tense, and back again. Also, while it is plainly evident that Harris has done his research, I find the extent of detail provided to be at times unwarranted and discursive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A highly implausible, disappointing ending","review":"Clarice Starling (aka Jodie Foster) wouldn't do it! I liked the book and feverishly \\"ate\\" through it, but I was extremely disappointed with the ending. I believe it is better written than the first, but that Mr. Harris was at a loss as to how to finish it, and it shows. The Silence of the Lambs was frightening, Red Dragon was absolutely terrifying, Hannibal was not. It turned into a silly, unbelievable \\"love\\" story that is more sickening than the gruelish crimes committed in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little suspense - deeply disappointing conclusion.","review":"None of the deaths in this book come as a surprise - bad guys lose, good guys more or less win - thought the method of the killings shows a lot of thought and imagination.Even the end, which is unsatisfying and unbelieveable, was not a surprise - I began to dread it half-way through - it seemed the only way out for Starling and Hannibal. But it doesn't wash, and certainly doesn't satsify. When we read a book, we are looking for entertainment but also for something related to our lives and our world, however remotely, and Hannibal's conclusion is from some dimension so amoral that it fails to connect in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO very disappointing!","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I loved both Red Dragon and Silence, and this was such a let down. The entire plot was ridiculous, and the ending, well, that was beyond silly. In addition, I just didn't get into any of the characters - Starling was too much of a patsy, Lecter was boring, and Verger, although he did have the makings of a good character, was just too over the top. Either Harris felt pressured to write a sequel that he really didn't want to write, or he was just darn lucky on his first two attempts. I think that most Silence fans will be incredibly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL book with great ending!","review":"I disagree about Hannibal's ending, I loved it! the first two thirds of the book were so excruiatingly boring though, that I can't recomend it to anyone. Read Silence of The Lambs and Red Dragon instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"typical sequel","review":"I couldn't wait to dive into this book- the first \\"fun\\" novel I've read in a while. I had no fun reading it- the change in location after a decent start was disappointing (thought it had one or two good moments, and transitioned back well enough,if predictably) but the story line as it included Clarice was lame, and depicted her as a very one-dimensional character. I found Hannibal's background interesting,and I would have prefered to know a lot more about him. He doesn't have to do anything to be interesting, he just is. This book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Batzel","review":"For someone who puts out a book every 5 years or so, you would think he'd have enough time to perfect it. However, this book was horrible. The end made me feel like licking sandpaper. Hannibal - an utterly brutal and morbid serial killer - is seen as the poor hunted and misunderstood hero in parts. Whereas Clarice - a no nonsense logical symbol of justice - is reduced to a sick and twisted lost soul. What vile perverseness!I can see Hopkins doing the movie...but they'll have to pay Foster a pile of millions (and they probably will) to portray that witch Clarice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written purely for shock value","review":"This book resembles one of those shock movies whose entertainment \\"value\\" lies not in its storytelling (plot, characterization, etc.) but in its capacity to elicit gasps and winces from the audience. Apparently, Harris decided that the only way to top the high expectations readers have for this book is to head the story to an ending so obscene that it leaves the reader's mouth agape. The memories of cherished characters are demolished. The fate which befalls Clarisse is execrable. True, these are only characters in a novel. But one should expect Harris to deal with them with dignity, and not as puppets manipulated with prurient interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Harris Should Be Ashamed of Himself","review":"This is not a sequel to \\"Silence,\\" it is a crude joke. He's taken Starling and regressed her instead of building on her character. She speaks in Catskill twang through most of the book. Lecter is now one of these bad guys who only kills really bad people, or people trying to steal his wallet. Or people trying to catch him. Whatever happened to devouring census takers? He's not truly bad, now, in fact, the reader gets a cuddly personal history of Lecter which explains why he became so bad, darnit! It wasn't his fault! Some bad guys did bad things, and made Lecter bad! Mommy! I'm bad now! A misfire on every conceivable level, staring with the first chapter. So disappointing...so sad. Lecter is almost superhuman, does this guy work out or what? The ending will leave your mouth agape. Agape at the horror of what Harris could have been possibly thinking when he scribbled this missive on paper. Abominable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mason fed the dogs his face; I want to feed them this book","review":"After steamrolling through this book as soon as I got it in the mail, all I can say is \\"Why?\\" Thomas Harris crafted some truly awesome novels in Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. He's very cinematic in his writing...but now he's just got the meat cleaver out. Yecch. Unfortunately, the USA Toady review sounds like this, although I will say that their review was all political correctness and nonsense. Get off the soapbox - just review the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this took 11 yrs, then Harris should have taken 22","review":"The constant changes in voice and tense are jarring, and make the book read more like a screenplay than a novel, especially in the last chapter. Harris is not true to his characters as previously established in <i>Red Dragon</i> and <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>. Hannibal becomes the protagonist in this offering, and despite the author's attempts to make the character sympathetic, all he does is cheapen one of the most amoral villians in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"More is less.","review":"Worth a read for fans of the previous installments, but not nearly up to par. Most notable failure is lack of suspense. The plot lumbers along, through a forest of typically well observed details which can't hold interest because they're unnecessary to guess where things are headed. As for Dr. Lecter: fleshed out, he becomes more a stock super-villain, less a myth-like nightmare figure. Finally, the book is simply too thick for a relatively thin story. Mr. Harris could've used an editor on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but disappointing overall.","review":"The quality of the writing is excellent but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers -- this is not a fit sequel to \\"The Silence of The Lambs\\". The clumsy inclusion of a previous victim was difficult for me to swallow and the ending was almost impossible to accept. The final chapters read like one of Philip K. Dick's novels where he had run out of amphetamine and needed to finish it quickly. I wish I'd waited for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an utter disappointment","review":"For years, I've walked into bookstores inquiring anyone that would listen to me as to what Thomas Harris was doing. I was hoping, praying that he was doing something along the lines of Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, with this book, it appears as though that wasn't even close to the case.While the Red Dragon had characters and images that I'll never forget, this book is UTTERLY FORGETTABLE! All these years of waiting and we get this?!This book reminds me of how long we all waited for Boston's third album only to be disappointed and wish they had never released it, but instead had simply retired on top. Sadly, I feel the same about this book and Mr. Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and scary","review":"I read The Silence of the Lambs in the Saudi desert before the war. I can't describe to you how scary it was to read that book in the dead of night with a flashlight. I came away thinking the writer was brilliant. I haven't changed my mind about the author after reading this book. Lecter is fascinating in his insanity. I love the ending of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I give it one star only because there is not a zero star.I could not believe how disappointing this book is. I feel T. Harris must have been playing a joke on his readers. I once read that he claims he doesn't like to write this kind of book, but that is what the public wants. He must have decided to give us what we want and do it to disgusting extremes. The ending, the characters, and the plot are dissapointing,to be polite. I might get my money's worth from the bokk this winter if I burn it for fuel in the fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read.","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Harris's previous books I was eagerly anticipating Hannibal. What a mistake that turned out to be.This is by far the worst book I have ever read. The plot is laughable and the prose is downright pathetic. No matter what a particular chapter was about they all ended with something along the lines of 'the blood ran slowly down the wall...' or some other melodramatic drivel. Mr. Harris should have quit while he was so very far ahead with his earlier gems.I'm tempted to go see the movie version to find out if it could possibly be any worse than the book. Do yourself a favor, as Jodie Foster did, and stay as far away from Hannibal as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible","review":"This book is a horrible book. It did not live up to expectations considering how good silence of the lambs was. If you have not read this book and you enjoyed silence of the lambs then I suggest you pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"I waded through the revenge plot and was left with a handful of air at the end. What a jaw-droppingly bad ending. Mr. Harris, what were you thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal, \\"Master . . . master of puppets!\\"","review":"I couldn't put the book down. For all the negative criticism I'd read, I was expecting a far worse ending. Like a puppetmaster, Hannibal controlled everything and everyone. He destroyed the agent in \\"Red Dragon,\\" didn't he? Clarice, too, falls into his web. Not credible? Don't forget the drugs used and Lecter's command of psychology. I was rooting for him. Krendler was awful ( better off left lobotomized ). Mason was so sick, as to lose anyone's sympathy as a victim. Quite humorous, his demise by the very dogs he tortured. Okay, the pigs got to be a bit much, but a nice detail in that they smelled no fear on our dear Doctor. Hannibal is an awesome tale of horror, sometimes nightmarishly written, as if by stream of consciousness. Stephen King is about as frightening as R.L. Stine in comparison. As one review pointed out, I guess I AM in need of some serious therapy . . . just not with Hannibal Lecter, MD, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish published","review":"This is proof that editors don't read what they publish. The result is that this rubbish has been published. Giving \\"one star\\" rating is far too generous. Amazon should consider increasing the number of rating categories to include some negative categories."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted badly to like this book but could not...","review":"Along with millions of others, I loved Silence of the Lambs and I eagerly purchased Hannibal full of excitement. As I finished the last page of the novel, I truly felt that I had wasted my money. I am not normally squeamish but I felt that the story contained an abundant amount of unneeded grotesque scenes. And the ending was utterly unsatisfying and seemingly beyond the realm of remote possibility. As I trudged through the gore I was hoping that the climax would overcome the weak points of the story. It did not.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all just fizzled...","review":"Harris' writing style and imagery started out the novel with great potential. To my surprise the book was not filled with blood, mutilation and murder. The voilence lay more within the minds of Mason Verger and, of course, Dr. Lecter. I couldn't put the book down and found myself driven to read on not by the writing but by a morbid curiosity as to the ending. I found the novel's plot to build for a while, plateau and then fizzle into nothing. The only thing good about the ending is that is is completely unexpected... but that really is the ONLY good thing about it. I found the ending to be disappointing, confusing, unexplainable, and almost completely untied to the rest of the book. After following Lecter, Verger and Starling for almost 400 pages, I found the ending not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond disappointing","review":"Why, Thomas Harris, why? Why, after seven years, did you unleash this mess on your waiting fans? I was so happy when I heard that there would be a conituation of The Silence of the Lambs, only to be horribly let down by the results. The ending is ridiculous. It doesn't make sense at all - and comes so quickly after hundreds of pages building \\"suspense\\" (which never really happens). And do we have to endure so many people mistaking Hannibal Lecter for Satan? We understand that he is a malevolent person, but that doesn't make him the ultimate evil. Spare yourself the money and time - please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It is clear that Thomas Harris had a movie deal. And that he needed a book to fulfill the movie deal. So he slapped this unworthy work together. A very disappointing follow up to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After eagerly awaiting this sequel to a fabulous book I was incredibly disappointed. The author was not true to his characters. Their behaviour was not remotely believable and after enjoying both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was amazed to find this written by the same person. The plots were sloppy, the characters unreal and the pace boring. I would definitely NOT reccommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY Disappointing!!!","review":"I thorougly enjoyed \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\", so I was excited to read \\"Hannibal\\". What a HUGE disappointment!!! The previous novels I read until all hours of the night, and couldn't put them down. With \\"Hannibal\\", it was all I could do to keep reading to see what happens to the monster. The series of events in this novel were completely predictable and Harris' emphasis seemed to be on the gore rather than the story and characters. While his previous novels had great cliffhanger endings, the ending to \\"Hannibal\\" left room for a next novel, at best! The difference is, I won't purchase the next novel! I was VERY generous giving the book 2 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely ridiculous","review":"Thomas Harris' sequel to The Silence of the Lambs isn't too bad - until the end, which deserves all the negative reviews it has gotten. Surprise endings are fine, but they must be substantiated. The actions of Clarice Starling certainly are not consistent with her character as given in the previous book, which is why most found the end bewildering. For want of a shocking ending, the author completely sold a wonderful characterout...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannible-A Betrayal of Starling's Character","review":"I was completely disappointed with this book. Not only is it gruesome to the point of being an unbelievable tale, the author totally betrayed the character of Clarice Starling by making her weak and by having her completely abandon her beliefs and strong will!! Clarice would have NEVER done what the author had her doing at the end! Very, very disappointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond preposterous","review":"I can offer up no plausible reason why I finished this silly, over-the-top, wretched book but I did so I'll give it a single star. Assail me with gratuitous grossness, assault me with a ludicrous plot, but woe betide the author who insults my intelligence the way Harris did with his final outlandish chapters. Puh-leeze. People, wake up! Like Harold Robbins, a bestselling author of schlocky novels a generation before him, Harris in fact despises his audience and despises himself for catering to them. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris has resorted to shocking the reader","review":"I am not squeamish or prudish, and I loved each of Harris' other books, but at the end of Hannibal, I felt violated. The reader from La Luz, NM was correct when they wrote that the book could have used a better editor and that the characters - especially Clairce - go against type. Clarice never showed any indication that she craved the lush life, yet she ends up falling for Dr. Lecter's bourgeois trappings. What would her Daddy and Mama think? Plus, with Kendler out of the picture, her career could have been salvaged. Speaking of Krendler, I understand that this is a horror novel, but some of the more graphic details were simply unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret wasting my time reading Hannible","review":"The worse book I have ever read. The only reason I continued was that I read a review saying the last 100 pages were gripping. I regret not throwing it in the trash as soon as I realized it was written to be a grade B movie. Thank you Jodie Foster for not going forward with this obnoxious story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambivalence","review":"After reading the reviews of readers who disliked this novel, I can understand why they didn't like it. If you want to read a novel with clear-cut heroes and villians, this book is not for you. If you like the classic happy ending, read elsewhere. Harris' main characters in this novel, with the possible exception of Mason, are more real than many fictitious characters. They are not all good or all bad- they can experience ambivalence and in order to enjoy this novel, the reader must be able to tolerate that. I struggled with my feelings of empathy for Hannibal throughout this novel. I was shocked to find myself actually rooting for him, and I was disdained that I was acutally pleased with ending. I like that Harris has created a portrait of reality in that nothing is ever Black and White. Besides that, I found this book to be a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID!","review":"Well, my review is in..\\"Hannibal\\" is....* Hilariously implausible * Fatuous...in a disturbing way! * Plotted in suprisingly awkward form! * Ugly...rather than interesting! * A seeming attempt to extend an existing story line \\"to the limits.\\" (It overshoots the mark...wildly...like a drunken barnstormer.) * A BIG disappointment!Horror has never been so...well, just plain sophmorically inane. So much for expectations.Book buyers: save your money; don't encourage this degrading, despressing bilge.Library patrons: don't worry if your name is far down the waiting list.

One third into this mess, I thought something was wrong with me that I this book was so bad.....I then realized when it took over two weeks to finish this potpouri of garbage, that it wasn't me. This is such a cheap shot at what was a super series about a well-crafted demon, that it defies description. Most reviewers didn't like the ending, and true, it was terrible. It did, however, match the nonsensical story line. I am so disappointed! I'd give it 1/2 thumb up and advise all to skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than disappointing.","review":"If you loved the movie \\"Highlander\\", and then were disgusted at how the sequel was so bad in so many ways that it almost dragged down its brilliant precursor with it, you'll know what it's like to read this book. Not worth the time nor the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Moments - But Disappointing","review":"While I found this piece had the elements to keep my attention, pulling me in and driving me to turn each page, the ending was a major disappointment. Especially in the case of Starling, the conclusion is entirely out of character. It doesn't show a different side of her character, instead the book displays an unbelievable side. However, we've been set up for one more piece in the series. Should Harris decide to write it, I hope the final conclusion is more satisfying than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal - Yikes!","review":"I should have put the book down and walked away while I still had the chance but I had to know how it ended. As I read the last page I was just plain angry! I hoped that Mr. Harris would continue the strength, intelligence and unwavering sense of right and wrong he had brought forth in his characters in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". Boy, was I wrong. I have can't remember being so disappointed in a sequel to any book in a long time. It seems that all his chacters have taken a leave of their senses and turned,well, just plain stupid. Also, this book was probably one of the most graphic(violence), disgusting books I have ever set eyes on. There easily could have been less \\"blood and guts\\" and more imagination. For my money, I would definately skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, Harris fans...","review":"This book is a bitter disappointment. The real horror in Harris' \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence..\\" was the mundane, familiar nature of the terrible forces wandering among us undetected. This book turns Lecter into a cartoon character, whose powers are superhuman, and introduces others so other-wordly evil they begin to be funny; they certainly are completely unbelievable. Starling remains a three-dimensional character, but that's as far as it goes, folks. Harris may write beautifully, but in this book he has substituted gore for everything else--plot, depth of characterization, and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Harris kidding us?","review":"What a diabolical offering. My question is \\"did Thomas Harris really write this?\\" The book is riddled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Where is the grace with which Silence of the Lambs was written? The characters (esp. Hannibal) are all reduced to caricatures. The crime scenes are so over-the-top that instead of being left with that feeling of abject horror, you just skim through them.In Silence of the Lambs, Harris displayed an awesome understanding of human nature and the tiny flaws in our characters which make us so intriguing. Reading Hannibal, I was left with a feeling that he was stumbling about, not really getting to grips with his characters. It reads like it was written by a committee.I hope 'they' don't make a movie out of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!!","review":"Hannibal was great! It kept me on the edge of my seat and I never wanted to put it down. It was very suspenseful and had a very surprising ending. If you liked Silence of the Lambs you'll love Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Crystal was right!!!","review":"From all the praise heralded by other readers, I wonder if I had the wrong book sent to me by mistake. There is no way this is a three star book, much less a 5 star one. I forced myself to finish it, and then regreted turning the last page. If only I had been like Billy Crystal in \\"Harry met Sally\\", and read the last page of the book before starting it...(so if I died before finishing it, I'd know how it ended), I could have saved myself an entire weekend of agony and bitter disapppointment...not to mention the money wasted on this novel. When I heard the book was coming out, I couldn't wait...and started holding my breath for the movie. Now, given the unbelievable (and unforgivable) ending Harris chose to tack onto this list of incomplete sentences...I am no longer waitng to exhale. Mr. Harris, why????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Harris should have taken 12 years instead of 11","review":"Eagerly the most anticipated book of 1999, Thomas Harris' \\"Hannibal\\" is a wonderfully written book. That being said, it has the most dissapointing endings ever put to paper. Hannibal Lecter is as chariming and frightening as ever, however, even he cannot make sense of the ending. Mr. Harris took 11 years to write the third Hannibal Lecter book. Perhaps he needed 12. Memo to Dino De Laurentis & Co.: PLEASE, FOR THE MOVIE, CHANGE THE ENDING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"I am an avid mystery and psychological suspense reader and I have previously read all of Thomas Harris' books which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, I was completely disappointed in Hannibal and found it very difficult to complete. I actually forced myself to finish the book, hoping that at sometime, the climate would change and what I had come to expect from his writing would surface. At one point, towards the end, I thought this would happen; however, I found the ending of the book to be unbelievable and unprobable. It felt like a cop-out ending to just finish the book. In fact, the book seemed as if it was just written so the movie could be made. A completely commercial endeavor rather than good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mega let-down!","review":"This sequel is an insult to the prior two books. If this plot is all Harris can do with his wicked but fascinating Dr. Lechter, he should have given his creative juices another decade to distill before bringing him back. Then,again, perhaps he should have stopped with \\"Silence\\". Less is more in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart Stopping Chills Killed By Insidious Ending...","review":"Had me by the hairs on the back of my neck. Hannibal is every bit as unpredictable and evil as ever. Love Clarice Starling again in this book though she takes a back seat to Hannibal. But HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ENDING. UNACCEPTABLE ENDING. RUINED THE WHOLE BUILD UP. PREPOSTEROUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good audiobook, but....","review":"I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of HANNIBAL, read by Daniel Gerroll. I have to admit that when the first tape started, Gerroll's voice wasn't one I thought would be suitable for this book. I quickly changed my mind, though, and eagerly anticipated each time I got into the car and could listen to this book. Gerroll did an excellent job with the different voices, accents, and vocal impediments of the characters that I almost forgive how wrong the ending of this book was for the story and its characters. Yes, it was gruesome and gory, but I felt the ending was just plain wrong. I've been a big fan of Harris in the past, but he just lost me with this one.At least I can say I enjoyed Gerroll's reading and will look for more readings from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait for Thomas Harris Fans","review":"For all of us Thomas Harris fans, the wait for Hannibal was a long one, and maybe he has spoiled us with Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is a very good book, but it does leave you a bit empty in the end.I felt the premise of searching for Lecter and the fate awaiting him was quite good. I thought though the book dragged a bit as we became familiar with the history of Florence, Italy. We want action! We want suspense! Who needs culture?Overall though, the book allows us into the twisted mind of Hannibal and gives us some insight to why he does what he does. Clarice is basically a non-factor till the end of the book. The Mason Verger character is also quite interesting.The ending left me scratching my head, but also made me smile as Harris had taken me for another wild ride.

Your novels, the intriguing characters, transporting locales, and utterly morbid plotlines, are resplendent in a dark fascination. Oddly, perhaps, Barney posesses me most. Sharing Lecter's dark desire, with the focus and and intesity of a Marine (do I identify?)- astounding. All of the others, yes it was wonderful seeing them outside my memory castle, to become involved with their thoughts once again, to meet the newest persons, and imagine what may be next for them. Many will besmirch Mr. Harris (and Dr. Lecter? ) for such an ending. Dismiss them. The monster will posess you entirely- rest assured that to meet \\"Il Dotorre\\" will result in your loss of humanhood.

It seems that at times there was a narraitor telling the story, then at times it was as if it was in thrid person. I also didn't like the ending, even though someone told it to me. Over all it wasn't that bad. I'd say read it if you have nothing better to do and you can get it in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal Goes Nowhere!","review":"I purchased Thomas Harris' book \\"Hannibal\\" after reading the celebrated \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" years earlier (which I thought was good but over rated). Hannibal starts off well. The writing style at times is a little un-even but the story engages. The descriptions of Florence and other copious asides was interesting, but not relevant to the story and made for a lot of fluff. As the novel pushes onward to it's unpredictable yet predictable climax, I felt a little \\"ripped-off.\\" Agent Sterling's ambiguous laconic character left much to be desired. In reality, she would definitely be gay and more interesting as a person if this were so. As the ending approached, I had a strong feeling of being let down. Although my sense of what Mr. Harris was trying to communicate is that in reality people are never what they seem to be. Too bad it was done in such a round about and uneven way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Lector's mind","review":"I've never been one for mysteries, but I picked up this one, because I had seen Silence of the Lambs. I loved the character's. Here we see the insight of the Doctor's mind. All I can say is Wow! This is a quick read, with scenes and action on every page. Despite the sometimes gruesome parts, it keeps the reader breathless throughout. And the ending was . . . well, I really don't want to say how it ended. It just wouldn't be fair.This book is not for everone. Some will call it gross....Even Jodi Foster refused to play Clairce in the sequel...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can't get any worse than this!","review":"Hannibal is, by far, the worst book I have ever wasted my time on. I couldn't wait for this book to come out so that I could continue to read the wonderful Trilogy that Thomas Harris started with the great \\"Red Dragon\\" and even better \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". To me, it read as if he wrote the book at the last minute over a long weekend and the editors didn't have time to do their job because they had a deadline. Several reviewers have complained about the ending, but in my opinion, the ending is a merely a continuation of the mindless drivel that started with the first page. One star is too good for this piece of pulp fiction garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Script","review":"I am willing to bet that Thomas Harris had Hollywood in mind when he wrote this book. Why else would he so completely alter the personalities of EVERY character in his book. Mr. Harris you created some excellent characters in \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\" They were engaging, flawed and, in the case of Hannibal, truly frightning. In this book you have made them cardboard cutouts that will look good on a movie screen. I have never been so disappointed in a writer before (and I read often!). I hope that if you choose to write a new novel you will not consider it's marketability and stick to what you do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it Less than One Star!","review":"...I read Hannibal on an airplane. After finishing it, I wanted to be off that plane, and I knew full well we were at 30,000 feet.This book is TERRIBLE. WAIT, LEMME REPHRASE THAT......The first 400 pages are great. Creepy, gory and everything you'd expect of Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling. The final few chapters grind their way into one of the least believable, most idiotic plot twists in recent memory. Reading how the story resolves itself (what happens to Dr. Krendler, then Starling) is the literary equivalent of the sound Jim Carrey made in \\"Dumb and Dumber\\"I am a fan of both the books and the movies. Red Dragon (Manhunter) was fantastic, Silence of the Lambs, even better...This is dreck.I can only hope, pray and light candles to the moot hope that they change the end of this god-forsaken thing and make it into something good.Save your money...for that matter....BURN YOUR MONEY! Don't waste it on this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone rush you?","review":"After reading Hannibal, I couldn\`t shake the feeling that there was some kind of deadline in place here. After a great beginning,it seemed that the further along you got into the story, it felt as if Mr Harris was just in a hurry to get it over with. And that, to me , robs both Dr.Lecter and Clarice Starling of much of the qualities given to them in Silence of the Lambs.I would have loved to have seen a completely different ending than what was seemingly tossed out here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow waltz through the mind of a serial killer.","review":"If readers are expecting a terse writing style, they won't getit in \\"Hannibal\\". Comparing Hannibal to his previous work islike comparing a Monet with a Lichtenstein. You have to take a step back, relax your mind and languish in the mood and flow of the novel, nibbling on the references to Italian history and art. If you enjoy books that serve you the tidbits of the author's research, you will enjoy this. Hannibal contained very precise references to places were curiously intriguing on travel to Florence or Paris.

However, Hannibal was disappointing, As it Mr. Harris spent 450 pages of the book describing Italy, and 30 telling the events in the book.

The ending of this book gave me the impression that Harris gave up on the characters and just wanted to finish. The ending is ludicrous. Other than as a guide to pig breeding or a roadmap of Florence, the book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I keep hoping that this book would live up to its two predecessors, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Every once in awhile it offered a glimmer of hope in that direction but sadly it never came even remotely close to making the mark as it was often labored and the ending absolutely pathetic!!!!!! Please spare us a movie sequel!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bone chilling outlook on society in whole","review":"I listened to the book and lost some sleep over this sequel.

The narrator did a terrific job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is using Thomas Harris's Name and writing books?","review":"I was forced to read \\"Red Dragon\\" by my mother who thought it was the best book ever. I agreed with her and kept my doors locked at night. Also stopped using my 8mm camera for family events...Only kidding. I eagerly awaited \\"Silence of the Lamb\\".....Outstanding is all I can say. It kept me awake for hours just to finish it. I now have waited all of these years for \\"Hannibal\\". What a waste of time, money and paper. Wait until you can pick it up in a USED Book store and even then I wouldn't waste my money.How in the world could Harris think we could actually believe that Starling would end up that way?Is he more insane, than Hannibal?It also seem as if he had a deadline to reach and just finished the book off with gibberish to get it to print. DON'T WASTE MONEY ON FULL PRICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this novel the day it was released at the bookstores. Like many, I had anxiously waited to read the sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" This book was slow in the beginning, middle and end.

If there is a movie lets hope they change the ending, it was just too silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never dreaded reading a book before","review":"I'm a quick reader, but I just couldn't get through this book. Instead of not being able to put it down, I just couldn't get myself to pick it up. I began dreading each next paragraph.

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Hannibal & Clarice, a couple !!! What nonsense"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best Harris book ever","review":"Despite some other people says, I think Hannibal is twice as scarier than Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. This book is full of detail that you are in part of Hannibal and Clarice Starling. In my own opinion a well detail book gets in a way of being scare to go on. In Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, it's the book that goes on but sometimes you felt like you want to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't possibly put this one down","review":"Not having read any of Harris' previous work I found myself deeply enthralled by this book for which I have but one word \\"brilliant\\".The strong details and topographical descriptions easily lure the reader to whatever location is being described. The characters and various sub plots are carefully but effortlessly weaved together, artfully creating one great read. Finally, the ending is suprisigly consice, unpredictable and ties all the character's lives neatly into one little package. There are no strings left over and no wondering thoughs about a sequel.All in all this book is hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A sequel to the excellent \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" was eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, it was a huge let-down. The Clarice Starling from the former book had strength, integrity, determination, fortitude, and a working moral compass. In the latter book, however, Starling has been reduced to a quivering, mindless idiot with no will of her own who sinks into a quagmire of debauchery. Much of \\"Hannibal\\" is set in Italy, and the reader is provided with some insight into the factors which came into play and exploded to produce a Hannibal Lecter. Although we begin to see into the tormented mind of this man, we gain little sympathy for him. The writing itself is dark and as dense as a thick fog. I was incensed by the ending and thought it did a huge disservice to its predecessor. I found it to be forced and contrived and, frankly, I was insulted by it. I expected better from the estimable Mr. Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Harris ... you need help","review":"Dear Mr. Harris, I read it to the end because I thought ... well ... \\"maybe it's me, I've been a little distracted lately, I feel I should be enjoying this ... but I'm not\\". What in the hell have you done to Clarice? Talk about a sell-out! And, what sort of mind can come up with that last scenario? Oh boy, I'd be worried if that had come out of my imagination. If the film is going to be true to the book, I will not be going to see it. I've given it two stars because I, at the very least read it until the end (and wish I'd skipped that last bit!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time","review":"Why did thomas harris take so long to write such a jumbled, pointless and rambling book like this. You think if the man had spent so long on a book at least a few things would be evident. Simple things like a plot, a sense of intrigue and motives for the characters. This book lacks all the above. The whole time I spent reading this (time incidentally that was not well spent) I could not help thinking what is the point of all of this. The characters are shallow, Clarice especially. He seems to have run out of ideas for her and painted her as simply as possible. Even when I had finished the book, the same question repeated itself why? If you loved black sunday, red dragon & silence of the lambs please dont buy this! It sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Apparrently Mr Harris wanted to end Hannibal's reign of terror and put Clarice in her *place* b/c this novel is a huge disappointment.

Where to begin, how about the ending. My first thoughts were that the role of Clarice in the movie version of Hannibal should be played by Lisa Kudrow (Pheobe) of Friends fame, as Thomas Harris has reduced her character into a joke. I genuinely cannot believe that anyone following this story from it's Red Dragon beginnings would be anything but disappointed with this story. Hopefully word of mouth will quickly overtake the hype of this novels release and save millions of people the time, energy and money used to trudge thru this embarassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out there ... Way out there","review":"I'm thunderstruck that so many fellow readers have bought into Harris' tripe. Hannibal is a male fantasy that sets a new standard for the ridiculously absurd.

At least it wasn't a\\"safe\\" ending, ...Perhaps there is a subtextual meaning tothe dreamy epilogue we just don't get. Or perhaps he is just setting up the next book, in which he Sets Things Right. It's hard to say at this point.Some readers are so emotionally conservative the over-react to an ending they don't know how to deal with and write an exaggeratedly negative review of the entire book, which isn't fair. Hannibal is mostly as thrilling as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The stuff in Italy is brilliant, and the set up involving the nemisis is quite compelling. I don't see that much difference in literary style compared to the past Harris novels. I admit the ending is hard to swallow, but maybe it will make more sense when I read it a second time, or when the next book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regretted Starting Hannibal","review":"This is one of those books that you can't put down once you've started reading it because you want to know the outcome.

Homophobia, Misogyny, and Nihilism","review":"This homophobic, racist, misogynous, nihilistic book is not writing. It's not even typing. I wouldn't be surprised if Harris used a dictaphone while he was drunk one night while vacationing in Italy, and had some poor sub-secretarial sod transcribe it and FedEx it to the publisher the next day. Worse than the bad writing is the hideously offensive plot. Like the worst excesses of capitalism, Harris tries to top himself, create something new, and in the process manages to do more than offend -- this book is a tract for hateful, sexist, bigoted straight white men. I wouldn't be surprised if some adopt it as a theory of living, a la THE TURNER DIARIES."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING FROM BEGINNING TO END!","review":"I'VE READ ALL HARRIS' PREVIOUS BOOKS AND FOUND HANNIBAL BORING AND DULL.

Too bad the reception for Hannibal didn't prove him wrong. The ending is contemptible, the moral universe laughably cynical, and the erudition self-indulgent.And no, Harris doesn't 'own' his characters. Good characters own themselves, revealing themselves in their reactions to the god of their universe, who is, ultimately, the Author. Clarice would not have conceded her decency to the sick god of Hannibal.What garbage. When you search for Hannibal,you will also get After Hannibal, by Barry Unsworth. Read that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was extremely disappointed with Hannibal.","review":"In anticipation of the publishing of \\"Hannibal\\" I read \\"The Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" again so I could get continuity of the character.

The whole premise was rediculous and the ending was absurd.

Hardly. I couldn't keep reading it, it was so bad. I only continued because I thought that it HAD to get better. People urged me to keep reading for the second half gore.The second half was as boring as the first, and hardly any gore that I can recall.And don't get me started on the ending. The most pathetic and unbelievable excuse for an ending that I have ever read (or at least since \\"Meg,\\" that bad shark book).Don't even waste your time with the public library. If any Hollywood screenwriter can save this, I'd be shocked.Worst $25 I ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about reading this one","review":"What a waste of time. Harris takes two very interesting characters of Hannibal and Clarice and ruins them. I think Mr. Harris was either hurting for money or was under pressure to write a sequel to \\"Silence of the lambs\\" (a very good book), because this book is a poorly pieced together hunk of rubbish. I've read all three books in the Hannibal series and the second, \\"Silence...\\" is the only good one. In this book, Harris should have focused less on the little insignificant details that have little to with the plot and put that time into developing a plot that was worth something. Let me say this about the ending, it almost seems like Harris is intentionally writing an ending to make his readers mad. This ending is so stupid Harris seems to be saying \\"HERE-I wrote a stupid sequel for you so leave me alone!\\" Avoid this book as if it were the plague.

Are you upset because your brain has been pumped so full of Hollywood cliches and formula bestsellers, where the characters are paper thin and the plots are predictable, that you can't handle it when you are surprised by an ending and you actually have to THINK about the motives, intent, and psychology of the characters. The prose in Hannibal was full of poetic images and insight. Harris has played a joke on all of you worshippers of American cliche. The book is not about some serial killer, but it is about challenging our notions on what is good and what is evil, and about the defamation of Women in the 20th century. It's brilliant.

The key to understanding this book is the scene in which Dr. Lecter visits the exhibit on instruments of torture. He doesn't give them much attention but watches the reaction of the visitors with disgust and his usual sense of superiority.We, dear readers, are the visitors to the torture show and this book is Harris's one-in-the-eye, over-the-top offering to us thrown as though to a pack of jackals who are hungry for anything dead.If the reading public can't get enough of sickos and pyschos, then he's given us what we deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste of time - gore with no suspense","review":"Hannibel seems to be written for the big screen, not for Harris' readers.

I have to read the Red Dragon now, just to see for myself and can decide once and for all if I like Thomas Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Build me up, let me down.","review":"Wow, the ending was a real let down. As I approached the ending, I was hoping for it to be a dream (like on Dallas). Barney's involvement was thin and Clarice's Daddy-like devotion to Lector was cornball at best. Foster will never do the movie! The ending would have to be re-written in order for this story to fly. Read this one with a bit of caution. Don't aim high and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the WHOLE thing","review":"After \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", I don't have the words to express what a disappointment this book is. Kudos to Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins for passing on the film.Up until Clarice's ill-fated rescue attempt, it's interesting, although not nearly as good as the previous two books. The ending, however, is so ludicrous and inconsistent with Starling's character, that you'll wish it had never been written.Let's all hope that next book, Harris starts fresh with totally new characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe I Read the Whole Thing","review":"Poor writing, disjointed scenes, and an unbelievable plot--I kept reading, hoping it would get better. Alas, the ending only cemented my earlier conclusion--this book was a waste of time. I'm sure Mr Harris must be a talented writer, but it was not evident here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal-Smannibal!","review":"I was so anxious to read this book. Being a fan of Thomas Harris' other books, I bought this one probably before the ink was dry! What a disappointment! It started out fine, but everything you loved about these characters from the other novel was destroyed. He didn't stay true to any of the characters and I can only say that I hope they freely change the movie (if they make one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add me to the long line of Nay-Sayers","review":"Oh please, PLEASE, save us from authors tired of their characters and aiming only for that bonus check from Hollywood. Ponderous, confusing, stomach-churning (and that's just the prose, not the plot)...was I disappointed? You bet I was. As was my husband.We both agreed the end-game received short shrift. had Harris bothered to spend more time there and less time with Verger and his horrendous plot for revenge, I might have been able to accept the ending. Yes, yes...the bare bones of justification were there but I'm sorry Mr. Harris, it was not enough. You glossed over the details of Lecter's psychological seduction of Starling leaving most every reader bewildered at her abrupt personality change. Shame on you.For those of you who haven't yet wasted your time, don't bother. Go read something by John Sandford instead, or re-read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, depressing, disappointing unbelievable book","review":"After waiting, along with all the other Thomas Harris fans who enjoyed \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", for\\"Hannibal\\", I was thrilled when a copy became available at my library. Alas, it was nothing like what I'd hoped. Unbelievable! I simply can't accept this story. This book was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal Bites!","review":"This is a book which started off with and consequently, maintained a high level of intensity. But, apparently the author got tired of writing it and decided it was time to go to bed. So...after ten years of working on a sequel to two excellent books, we are left with the most pathetic ending I've ever read. Hannibal is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put paid to Hannibal and Harris","review":"In the first 100 pages we meet Mason whom Hannibal Lector tricks into slicing off his face with a piece of glass and feeding it bit by bit to starving dogs he's penned up. Then Hannibal breaks his neck and paralizes him. Mason does not die but rather lives in a wing of his house, behind a monacle (he cut out his other eye and the remaining eye must be misted for the dogs got BOTH eyelids) where he tortures orphaned black children into killing their kittens. This is revolting. My lord, I thought that I was immune from shock considering what I did in earlier days but this is too much. Realistic detail be damned; that defense could be used of Dr. Mengele's journals. This is perverse. If you read this, it will spoil your associations with the places where you read it. It ruined a vacation on South Padre Island for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally Disappointing","review":"Hannibal has none of the terror and suspense of Silence of the Lambs. Thomas Harris writes this book with nothing more in mind that to see how much he can disgust the readers. The book is slow-moving and does not really capture your attention. I can truely understand why Jodie Foster has opted not to return to \\"Clairce Starling.\\" I would do the same thing in her position."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unimaginative insult","review":"The story is unbelievable, the characters predictable and the ending a terrible disappointment. If it were possible to rate this book with a minus then I would give it a minus 10 stars. Buyer beware! If you must read it wait until your local library has it in the 'FOR SALE: $1.00' bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising begining that goes nowhere.","review":"Having read the first two installments in this series I was ready for another thrilling roller coaster ride. Sadly this installment only proves that Harris is either unclear or totally unaware of why his two previous efforts worked so well. The book opens with promise but soon spirals down into a ridiculous conclusion that makes you wonder if Harris even understands the very characters he has created. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was so disappointed!..I expected to love this book, this author's name like some of my other favorites is enough to sell me on a book, site unseen..Sadly, I wish I had my money back, and I have learned my lesson...A reader in Denver suggests this book was a parody, and if we did not get it, the joke was on us, well, I am not laughing, and I bought what I thought was a 'thriller', not a parody...I am not a happy consumer.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing with a ludicrous ending!","review":"The Red Dragon thoroughly intrigued me and left me eager to read Silence of the Lambs. That was equally as good. I was therefore eagerly awaiting the advent of Hannibal and rushed to buy the hard copy. What a disappointment! All the characters disintegrated into ridiculous caricatures of their former selves. What was Thomas Harris attempting to do? Destroy himself along with his characters? He has, of course, set himself up to write another sequel. Who in the world would waste time and money reading it? How unfortunate that no one appeared to critique this book before it went to final publishing--perhaps with some major rewriting Harris would have been able to redeem himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't decide between revolting or plain bad","review":"It took Thomas Harris this long to write a substandard sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"? The ending was so lame but then again it only was in keeping with the rest if the book. This really was an insult to the previous books"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hannibal\\" was this summer's biggest disappointment.","review":"Pedestrian prose and a dumbed down Clarice Starling made this book a major disappointment to me, especially so at hardcover prices. \\"The Red Dragon\\" is still the scariest book I have ever read, but \\"Hannibal\\" is a real ho-hum. Don't waste your money; it'll be all over the used bookstore shelves in nothing flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SILENCE OF THE LAMBS!!!!!","review":"Sorry but Mr. Harris really falls short here. Way too unbelievable to even be entertaining. I was especially dissapointed in Clarice Starling's part, or a lack of one. Hannibal deserved better but in being a fan of his it makes it a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"SILLY!","review":"I can think of no greater disappointment than when one of the penultimate 'bad guys' of thrillers, Hannibal Lechter, ceases to be scary. In this sequel, we're meant to understand and empathize with Lechter because of his rotten childhood (puh-leeze! ) And Clarice is nothing more than a wimpy victim in this one. What happened to that heroic woman we loved in Silence of the Lambs? Oh, I wish that this one could be unwritten, so that my opinion of Hannibal, Clarice, and Thomas Harris could have remained intact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book, or waste time reading a borrowed copy","review":"I guess the title of my review says it all. This is the worst book that I can recall reading. Harris apparently ran out of ideas but was under contract to produce, and this hunk of garbage is what he came up with. No wonder Jodie Foster turned down a chance to play Agent Starling in a sequel. I wish that I could just erase that book from my memory. It really was that bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hannibal\\" - Long wait for nothing","review":"I'll be brief. This novel serves two purposes. It shows off Harris' extensive knowledge, and it will make him a large sum of money. Apart from these, the book is overwhelmingly disappointing. Clarice would never behave in the ways Harris has her behave. The characters do not ring true, and at times the plot sequences themselves are murky and almost impossible to follow. Stay with the first three Harris novels. This one's a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starling, Lecter Betrayed by Author","review":"These characters would never behave the way they do at this book's end. Harris changes tense at a dizzying pace (even in mid-chapter) and clearly doesn't share the love of his characters that fans of his earlier works possess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated Hannibal","review":"After Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal was a let-down. Most of the story line was very difficult to follow and I expected much more. The parts of the book that took place in Italy were poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't make a movie out of this one!","review":"This is a hell of a book, and I don't mean that in a good way. It is Hell to get through, what with the constant switching between tenses, the sloppy writing (Harris reportedly refused to let an editor touch it), and the unbelievable actions of the characters. This was totally unfaithful to the character of Starling, especially.Please, please, Ms. Foster and Mr. Hopkins, make a sequel to the film, and disregard the novel completely. You could even use the novel's reported working title \\"Morbidity of the Soul\\", which even sounds more like a film about the not-so-good doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I read the first two books of the Hannibal series and they were just amazing. I could not read them fast enough. And when I finally received Hannibal, I was excited to start it. But as I continued to read it took so long for the plot to build. The story line was not flowing. Mason's plan is not original. It is only towards the very end when the book finally picks up the pace and maintains the speed and suspense as Harris's previous novels.All in all, it is a very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Wicked","review":"Kudos to Thomas Harris for not confining himself to writing a screenplay sequel. The complaints about this novel are largely unwarranted. The only one I have is about the very long interlude in Italy. It could have been shorter. I felt it was taking time away from the characters I was reading the book for in the first place; Hannibal & Clarice. The ending was so out of left field that I found myself totally accepting every word of it. Afterall, if the reader is willing to accept the cannibalistic superman that is Hannibal Lecter, why not this? My only question is, where did Will Graham go? Ultimately though, an exceptional, quirky ending to a remarkable trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I don't \\"get it\\"...I'm glad I don't.","review":"This book does for pork what Philip Roth's \\"Sabbath's Theatre\\" did for sex...makes the delicious seem unpalatable.And the ending?! It's as if Gloria Steinham appeared at a NOW rally squeezed into her old bunny suit.Can I have my mind hosed down please? I feel greasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!!","review":"Contrary to what others thought about the book, I thought it was great (apart from the ending!) Quite different from the first book. I cannot wait to see the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Resting on his Laurels","review":"It seems apparent that Mr. Harris was counting on the success of the first two books to help him here. There is a very weak plot, poor character development and a really poor, weak ending. My only hope is that they do not make this dull book into an even duller movie. Anthony Hopkins beware!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it NO stars","review":"I really enjoyed Harris' three previous books, but what a disappointment this was. No substance but plenty of gore, in fact it seemed to me that Harris was seeing how gross he could get. No supsense, no mystery, just \\"can you top this for disgusting...\\" excess. Sadly, too, not a single character with any redeeming qualities. I finally gave up half way through. I asked my husband how it ended and was glad to put it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not justice to Silence of the Lamb. Thumbs down!","review":"The story had me at first and then it lost me quickly. Too much detail about the Italian Art history. Too much Italian to interpret. The ending was absolutely ludicrous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Style and Plot left everything to be desired","review":"I love to read but I found myself skimming throughout the whole book. It was so contrived and implausible. What a disappointment. Thank God I got it out of the library and didn't waste my money. Just my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like the other Harris fans, I have been anxiously awaiting this story for years. Like the other fans, I wanted to love it. I expected to love it. But, loath as I am to admit it, I do not love it. The characters I met in this new novel are not the ones I knew from the previous ones. They are strangers. Their behavior does not follow from what we know of them. The book seems to have been hastily thrown together, which is strange considering the length of time since Silence. Typos suggest it wasn't even proofread with much care. Whatever the case, I will always remain in awe of Harris for The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending gave me a big \\"HUH???\\"","review":"Harris pretty much throws you in the action of catching an enigmatic killer by a sick & demented victim, and spits you out by the ending. Part of me thinks that it was Harris' intention of totally disturbing the reader with its totally gothic & unpredicatable ending, and the other half may be just to let the reader realize that the whole \\"Hannibal Lecter\\" hype is no more than a big joke. Harris may have taken too much hallucinatory mushrooms by the time he wrote the conclusion.I really wanted to like this book since it was quite expensive (even if it was 50% off). What a waste. I couldn't even admit to my girlfriend how much I thought the novel wasted my time not to mention my enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hannibal\\" ending leaves bad taste in mouth","review":"After finishing \\"Hannibal,\\" I was struck by a desire to find Thomas Harris and demand a refund. The ending of the book was easily the most disappointing, annoying, and baffling I've ever read. Was Harris trying to drive away loyal readers? Perhaps he'd been so pestered over the last 11 years to write the sequel, that he decided to get his revenge by concocting such an amazingly bad ending? I don't know. Maybe he grew tired of the book or simply wrote himself into a corner. Was it a weak effort at black humor? Who knows. In any event, it was a sad end to an otherwise highly engrossing book in particular, and trilogy in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful and predictable","review":"One can rationalize for several squarely typed inches here but nothing can excuse the cruelties, large and small which permeate these pages. Harris has run out of places to go and the only suspense left is whether one monster will have the chance to wreak revenge on another monster. Who cares and why should we? With a large Italian section which is utterly predictable (the only question being what gruesome way some will die) and an ending which tries to be poetic and winds up unbelievable and foolish. A waste of time and a precipitous drop from his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think of Lost World or the Last Don","review":"Just as Mario Puzo, the genius who gave us the Godfather also produced the Last Don and Michael Crichton followed Jurassic Park with Lost World, Thomas Harris has taken what was a stellar record and added a severe blemish. Dislikable characters, implausible plot turn after implausible plot turn and absurd ending and you have a real dud.JODI and ANTHONY if you are reading this, take my advice, do not agree to make this movie, do not give this a second life, let it die or get someone else to play the parts.This book needs to be priced more than 50% off for you to get your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?!?","review":"The brilliance of The Silence of the Lambs was the mental connection between the two main characters - the \\"quid pro quo\\". Unfortunately, Harris has written a storyline that keeps Hannibal and Starling apart until the very last scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating beyond compare;challenging beyond reproach.","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" was an experience I found to be everybit as delightful as was it revolting.Granted, there were plot continuity gaps and flagging pacing throughout, however there imperfections served to compell me all the more.The novel's ending seems to have become a consistant source of literary debate, and divided down the center between the camps of those whom found it unutterably mind blowing (as did I), and others whom, from my perspective, appear as if they were perhaps expecting something from a Steven King best seller.I give this end of a fine trilogy my highest esteem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO HIS EARLIER WORKS","review":"Hannibal was NOT up to par with Harris's other terrific books. It took me 3 painful months to finish it. If you have not read Red Dragon--it is one of the most powerful psychological profiles of a serial killer. Don't bother with Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word? Stupid.","review":"What a shame that Harris wasted the terrific characters he introduced in Silence (and Dragon) and dragged us through what I'd call one man's love affair with Italy. Sadly enough, the only time I detected some excitement in Harris' writing was when he described the buildings and streets of Florence, Italy. Otherwise he threw Clarice Starling and Hannibal to the pigs (literally). By the time the finale rolled around, the only thing I was interested in finding out was what wine the doctor was serving with dinner! (Note to author: You and Patricia Cornwell need to get together some time and talk about Italy. She can wax ecstatic over its cuisine and you can ramble on about its architecture and history. That way you can get it out of your system and your readers won't have to suffer through pages of the stuff waiting to find out what became of the main characters.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed by Hannibal","review":"I have been a faithful reader of Mr. Harris until now, I will no longer assume he will write at a level of quality, as he has in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping,Grusome,Surprising,Superb!","review":"This long awaited sequel did not erase the image of Anthony Hopkins as the supergenius, phychologist, cannibalistic serial killer.The suductive madness of this charcter is unforgetable.I was gripped,frustrated,and ultimately surprised by the events following the silence......of the lambs.The book had one more effect on me, one that distubs me a little... It left me hungry....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad parody of a Thomas Harris book.","review":"This book couldn't get published if it had been written by anyone but Thomas Harris. It's truly awful. The first four-fifths or so of the book read like a sloppy, overheated police \\"thriller\\" -- dozens of which line the shelves of every airport bookstand. The final fifth of the book is bizarre. Imagine a couple of college freshman getting stoned and then trying to write a gothic romance, and you'll have some idea of just how bad the ending of this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"As disappointing as can be","review":"One star because I can't give a zero (or negative) rating. I cannot express my disappointment in strong enough terms. There's no character here worth caring about, the writing is poor, the ending is ridiculous. And the grammatical errors were very distracting. Are we sure this wasn't a book created by a room full of monkeys banging away on typewriters all day?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horror!","review":"This is a book you can absolutely put down. In fact if you do put it down I'd respect you more. Why is America and the rest of the world getting so excited about a book about a serial killer? Is there nothing else we can get ourselves worked up over? Do the world a favor and buy any other book but this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I figured it out!","review":"Harris is Lecter and we readers are the pigs devouring this book. I can only assume Mason Verger is the mangled myopic publisher who feeds Harris to the readers. What a clever little inside joke played on the victims who bought this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, sophomoric sequel with a anticlimactic ending","review":"I eagerly anticipated reading this book after reading his brilliant Silence of the Lambs. In Lambs he very cleverly and completely developed Clarice Starling's character. In Hannibal, he made her a two dimensional character easily duped by Lecter. I felt the ending was as terrible an ending I could have imagined. I think Harris is in love with the character he created and this clouded his normally excellent writing and plot flow. The book began very well but after Starling's career was halted by Krendler, thereafter book seemed to have been written by another author. It is weak and uninspiring.If you loved Lambs, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating end","review":"Anyone who has read previous books by Thomas Harris has to read this thriller.. It beats all his others but maintains the same characters in this story so he has you saying oh so that's so and so from the other book. Blends beautifully from Silence of the Lambs. I highly recommend this book to lovers of mystery and suspense.. I enjoyed it. The ending was a real surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant sequel to Silence of the Lambs!","review":"Very few books capture your imagination and attention the way Harris does in Hannibal. I found Hannibal the best of the three Lecter works--hands down! The best fiction I have read...period."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rooting for the pigs...(hey! That's a pun!)","review":"I thought this book was a bit of sham. It seemed that Harris couldn't decide whether Lecter was just a poor misunderstood elitist/genious or the devil. Mason Verger was properly portrayed as the real monster, but I just can't get a firm picture of his she-hulk sister. Overall, a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"irratatingly fascinating","review":"I thought this book was going to be a work of art, really, until I got to the \\"Florence\\" section then realized later that the \\"Florence\\" section meant ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the denoument of the story!A breakthrough beginning for Clarice, Harris makes you see that she is tough and strong-willed... which makes the end remarkably odd, in my opinion. It was almost as if Harris was put under a deadline and came up with a quick and ill-advised ending to an unusually planned out story.After you have read the last page, you find yourself wondering \\"was this supposed to have been good vs. evil?\\" Who is the antagonist? Who is the protagonist? And I am wondering if Thomas Harris really meant for the reader to see it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst...","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I was thrilled to hear that their would be another chapter in the Silence of the Lambs and didn't hesitate to buy it. I can't believe that Thomas Harris write this - he really let a lot of people down. Do yourself a favor and stick to the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely unbelievable story","review":"This book was a huge disappointment, and not even close to Harris's previous books. \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" were both excellent - this thing is just absolutely terrible. I think Harris has fallen in love with his Lector character, who is a cannibal and a murderer, and can't bear to give him up to his just desserts. The way this book ends is disappointing and so awful and unbelievable that it made the rest of the story seem like nothing but a set-up. Frankly, I hated the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true sequel...","review":"...disappointing in every way. Flat, unbelievable characters; ridiculous situations; hare-brained schemes. Harris's (former) genius was that he could take the unimaginable and make us picture it. But not this time. I rolled my eyes too many times.The openng sequence read like a novelization of a bad movie, as if Harris had merely watched some Joe Bob Briggs fave and faithfully transcribed it--without adding any insight into characterization or motivation, or even the attention to revealing detail that made RD and SOTL horrific and yet believable.I'll no longer have nightmares about Dr. Lecter coming to eat me, because I no longer believe in him. And that's a darn shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sequel since \\"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\\"","review":"Harris is a \\"One-trick pony\\". Harris wrote the same book twice, in \\"Silence\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\". Now we know why. I will sell my copy of Hannibal for 25 cents. NO REFUNDS! The characters are completely without consistency, the plot far-fetched. Harris should have named this book, \\"Take the Money and Run.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe he was gone too long?","review":"Maybe authors write for themselves or for their readers. I'm not sure and probably will never know, but this book upset me because I was expecting so much more. Nothing to look for in a movie here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your time!","review":"I loved the previous books by Thomas Harris and couldn't wait to buy Hannibal...I should have. This was a mess....mixing of third and second person in the writing; wandering sentences; characters losing their characterizations; and an ending ... well that I just couldn't stomach.My own imagination created a better tale than this and I really feel betrayed....it was as if Harris felt he had to give us \\"something\\" ...better if it had been \\"nothing\\" .... because this was less than nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating but fatally flawed at the end.","review":"Harris has written a terrific book up to the last twenty pages or so. He exhibits, as always, an ear for a penetrating description; I loved, \\"The press brought out the Feliciana Fish Market incident every day and shook it like a rat.\\" I love hearing about Lecter's various forms of expertise, from Italian Renaissance art to the proper way to field dress a nasty poacher. However, I think he misgauged how much readers liked Starling for her earnestness and her sense of justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornographic trash","review":"I have no idea what the professional reviewers above are talking about. Certainly they are not refering to Hannibal. This book begins well, then degenerates into the most pornographic (and I do mean graphic) trash I have ever had the misfortune to read. I also get the impression that Harris did not want to write this novel. The writing is uninspired, the conclusion repulsive. The characters' actions are nonsensical. I am no prude. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two novels, but this I have removed from my home. It is just wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real crime was great, but horror is just ... horrible","review":"How one Earth could Mr Harris hope to follow his two earlier successes? The serial killer theme, which he reached ahead of every one else, was a popular literary gold mine. Such new material does not come along every day, or even every decade. So Harris stuck to his guns and, after years of pacing up and down, churned out more of the same - except that it wasn't the same. RED DRAGON and SILENCE were based on real cases. That was what made them so startling. And it excused the horror, because it we knew these things had really happened. In this book Harris spirals off into pure horror fantasy. No real cases this time, just the author's imaginings pushed to the limit of nastiness. The result is a pale shadow of his earlier work: indulgent, lurid, exploitative. Well, I guess that was a hell of a lot easier than coming up with new, well-researched, factually-based material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful!","review":"I was really looking forward to this sequel; I enjoyed the book and movie of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". While this book was well written, well researched, I feel Mr. Harris really went over the edge. I felt physically sick when I was done with the book. I love murder mysteries; Robert Patterson, Tami Hoag, etc., so I am not a prude on the issues of violence or sex. I cannot imagine this book becoming a movie. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this book. If you must read it, check it out from the library and when you return it, wash your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have to buy Hannibal, wait for the paperback!","review":"I waited a long time for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs- and I should have waited a lot longer. I was angry as I forced myself to finish this story but I found some comfort at having bought it at a 50% discount. If I had paid full price I would have sent it back to the publisher and demanded the return of my money. Silence of the Lambs is a great novel because it is scary and believable. Hannibal is a poor novel because it is neither scary nor believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Definite Dissapointment","review":"I can't believe after reading 400 pages of great character development that the last 100 pages would reverse itself into the cheesy plot of a daytime soap. ACK! Was Mr. Harris pressured to finish the book? We'll never know. What we do know is this book should not be put on the shelf next to his earlier work. When they make this into a movie, they WILL change the ending, unless Susan Lucci is starring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is AWFUL.","review":"In the last hundred pages, Harris betrays everything he apparently worked hard on establishing in his previous books about Hannibal Lector. To say the characters behave inconsistently does not begin to tell the story. You will feel cheated when you get to the end of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal by Thomas Harris","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book by Thomas Harris. If you are trying to compare it to the movie, don't, you may have some difficulties. The book does describe a number of the relationships in much better detail and it is interesting to see the history/relationship of the characters to one another. I do not wish to give away the story. It was a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life of Hannibal Lecter","review":"This book was truly written in a gorgeous and poetic way, just as Lecter himself would have written it. Harris is truly a mastermind. The movie, for those of you who have seen it, cannot compare to this incredible novel. The book delves into the sadistic and maniacal character of Mason Verger, it also speaks of the strong and beautiful F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling. Most importantly, the book delves into the past, thoughts and feelings of Hannibal Lecter. The reader finds out exactly what the term \\"free range rude\\" truly means. For those of you who are true Lecter fans, this book is a terrific read, and for those of you who are trying to understand exactly why and who Hannibal Lecter is, read this book. It is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we all reading the same book?","review":"I was a huge fan of both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, but I simply thought this book was horrible. It was one of the silliest plot lines I have read in years. I certainly hope that this book never turns into a movie. One of the worst books that I have read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing followup to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lamb","review":"I admit that I awaited this book as eagerly as a million other people, and I was disappointed! I have read 17 other reader reviews before I wrote this, so I will not repeat what several of the \\"one star\\" reviews said, since I basically agreed with them. Red Dragon was a terrific book and a very underrated movie(Manhunter). I didn't like Silence as well, but obviously Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster made the book seem better than it was because of their movie performances. Hannibal is a letdown, the ending was disappointing and the last part of the book was stomach churning--Which I guess you expect with Mr Harris. I did read it in one day though!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this book","review":"Thomas Harris seems to have lost all interest in Lecter and Starling, and instead of writing a sequel, he is written a parody. The book is more screenplay than novel, with only the visual sense employed for most of it. The new villians are frankly, terrible, not so much James Bond as Austin Powers.This book doesn't deserve to be made into a film. There's better fan fiction around than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just off the bull's eye","review":"This a great sequel to a great book. The plot is stranger then the other books but it is not over the top. i don't feel that any of the characters are unbelievible. If you are looking for a book on Clarice, this is not really that much about her. The Silence of the Lambs was about her, this book is about one of the greatest literary characters, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The character is so well written about, Hannibal is a well developed character. Allthough you may think that Hannibal is the \\"bad guy\\" in this series it turns out with this final novel that is not the case. The only reason this I didn't give this book 5 stars is the ending. It's a good idea but a few pieces are missing. I think poeple who say it's way over the top don't understand the characters. The ending is almost there, it justs missing one critical part. I think Thomas Harris should have added a little bit more to the ending. You see for yourself. Read this book! It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Main Character Interesting -- Ending Utterly Silly","review":"In our world of best selling drivel and paper thin plot lines, I was hoping to find in this author a much deeper semblance of character development. However, while Hannibal Lecter is arguably one of the most distinct individuals in our recent times -- the other characters are barely uncovered. Sure -- Starling is back and we do delve a bit into her past... but there isn't enough there to really associate with anyone in this book. To add to this pain, the ending makes absolutely no sense. I won't give it away -- but really... please... it isn't even a shocking ending -- it just happens. Oh well -- this was my first/last Thomas Harris book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror Story or Gourmet Magazine?","review":"I'm not a big fan of horror stories or movies, but with all the buzz about the movie, I decided to pick up this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The book gets close to being scary, but unfortunately it constantly retreats back into a laundry list of upscale clothing, art, food, literature and wine. Reading this book didn't make me scared, it just made me want to buy a new tailor made suit, visit an art museum and go out for a gourmet dinner (or better yet, prepare a gourmet dinner). The only real horror in this book was trying to guess what wine Hannibal would choose for his \\"gourmet\\" cannibal meals. Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were scary, this is just commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farfetched and disappointing","review":"Perhaps the screen play will be void of the lackluster plots Harris has used in this novel. I must admit that I was a true fan of the Silence of the Lambs piece and was expecting much more with Hannibal. For me, it was not near as appetizing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tame after red dragon and silence of lambs","review":"liked the pigs thought that was unusually well done. I'm also a writer and wish I was as good at narratve and dialogue as he is.
