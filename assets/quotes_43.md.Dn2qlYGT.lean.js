If you want to know the story of Martin Guerre, then good for you, but learn about it from somewhere besides this book. Natalie Zemon Davis obviously needs to go back to writing school. Journalistic type entries are pathetically interwoven within the story. It totally deprives the reader of hearing the base story of what happened with Martin Guerre and drawing their own conclusions from it. There is so much French interwoven into the book, that you almost need to be bilingual to understand what is going on.

I don't know how the kids in this book manage to pull of some of these styles, but they DO! Handmade clothes, foot-tall platform shoes, and hair in every color of the visible spectrum are just some of the things you'll see in this book. Short descriptions of the teenagers in the photos are provided, including where they acquired their ensembles and what their current obsession and \\"point of fashion\\" is. This book is pure Japanese pop-culture! The only gripe I have is that some of the text is hard to read against the photographs. Lime green and hot pink text probably wasn't a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Having lived for some time in Japan and making Yoyogi Park an obligatory weekend haunt, it's amazing that Japanese fashion can still make me laugh. Every hopelessly unoriginal genre of \\"original\\" Japanese fashion is represented: the goth lolita, the retro punk chick, the candy raver, the skater, etc. Rule of thumb: it's best to look just like everyone else--only brighter (or in the lolita case--with a foofier little hat)... This book had me and my boyfriend in stitches at the bookstore. I realize that it's supposed to be trendy~not funny, but honestly, some of these kids look horribly silly.

In my opinion, all the subjects are models, dressed by a designer. Maybe they thought that westerners would not notice that all or most of the women and men subjects are photographed more than once. Some show up again and again. In my opinion, the photographs are staged and the outfits are not the creations of the people who are photographed. Notice too, how all the outfits are top notch from head to toe. You would expect to see a few ugly or poor decisions if the photos were of real people.

What's great about the clothes the people wear is they do not appear to be pre-packaged \\"hip\\" clothes in total. True, I'm sure they're \\"hip\\" (some are probably expensive), but most of the outfits seem to be constructed from many different elements; a pastiche of derivatives that combines into something original and beautiful. You see glimpses of Sanrio, some obviously Western influences here and there, and countless gadgets, shoes, makeup, stuffed animals and items that completely defy description. I'm still not sure what to make of the 'Lolita' and 'Gothic Lolita' descriptions of some of the outfits, but overall an incredibly fun book to just sit and get lost in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Clothes","review":"Beautiful, colourful pictures of Japanese street-fashion.

An assortment of different styles are evident - punk, preppy, spins on traditional kimono and samurai costumes . . . but everywhere you look, brilliant colour permeates the eye. The photographer captures perfectly the personality of the wearer behind the outfit, caught in their street environment.I gave this book 4 stars for it's lack of depth - there are only the pictures with a bare four line outline of the style of the work (which really don't say anything, as though the person photographed really didn't give a damn about explaining their look to the interviewer)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can See Why Gwen Stefani was so inspired!!","review":"I really love this book!!

The fashions, while I'm sure they're outdated in Japan (the book was published in 2001), are just incredible.

No two pages repeat.As a knitter and designer, I can't say enough. These pictures and images truly inspire. There do seem to be some trends - from the \\"Sailor Moon\\" fashions, to the \\"Gothic Lolita\\" fashions. But all-in-all, there is just sheer originality.

The highlight in orange of a particular part described can help point out a part of the car, in order to easily identify from its surround parts of a car. The book gives some website to find information whether it would be about car buying to other automotive consumer information. The book, however does not go too much into detail of each parts of the car. This maybe good for someone who know very little about cars.

Only the parts are diffent [from a disc break]\\".The first 130+ pages cover what is in the owner's manual, but in less detail, and the rest mentions other repairs and directs the reader to the shop manual.Don't bother. Read the owner's manual if you want to do routine stuff (oil change, windshield wipers, etc), there is much more information there. If you want to do more, get a shop manual such as Chiltons to Haynes (I've found that the actual shop manual from the manufacturer assumes ownership of specific tools designed for that car)."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably better to buy the hardback version","review":"I bought the digital version for kindle through amazon.

It is probably a good idea even if the teacher does not have a student with TS.

This product fails in that respect and it's not worth my time to troubleshoot it.Also, the software is somewhat hokey. It isn't even written with a standard Windows interface so it's not as intuitive as I would expect.

The other is the chart of language families. Some headings are incorrect, like refering to the languages of the Philippines as part of the Indonesian branch!Despite those errors, I think this a good reference..

This album shows the band bringing in a disco influence, most noticeable on the opening \\"Shine A Little Love\\", and subtly so elsewhere on the album. However, rather than being a crass grab for a place in the pop marketplace, the disco sounds here show a band who actually wanted to try new things instead of making another \\"Fire On High.\\" Even though doing an interpretive dance to \\"Fire On High\\" helped me look good for the young women from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, it would have been counterproductive to insist that ELO continue in that progressive/art-rock direction rather than changing with the times.

After a tremendous run of artistic and commercial success with ELO, ELO 2, On The Third Day, Eldorado, Face The Music, A New World Record and Out of the Blue ELO pushes their credibility off a cliff with this pop, disco trash. I remember how betrayed and disappointed I was when I first heard \\"Shine a Little Love\\". This album marked the end of ELO for me. While almost returning to form with 1981's TIME (ELO with no string section? Bah!)ELO, beginning with Discovery began a long slow descent into rubbish with its weakest songwriting and bad sounding records.

Songs that others deemed lacking in strength should really be up for grabs under the headline \\"Personal Preference\\", since I didn't think \\"Last Train to London\\" was such a shabby song.

It features a lot of hits later on to be legends, and to hear it in a proper stereo can be just about it.Don't get me wrong, the only reason I rated it four stars and not five is because I think there are E.L.O's ablbums which deserve the meximum score for their genius quality. Besides that, this album is a fantastic one, and unquestionably one of their best ones.I would suggest you to try listen to this one, not for its hits, not for its quality (compare to 1970's recordings) but for its genius level of music, which you can always find in one of the finest E.L.O's albums.Very well recommended.

Sandi is his co-pilot who teaches computer skills to people who have never even heard of data processing. These are two people who truly make the world a better place. And through it all, Sandi was able to take meticulous notes of their trip so that she could share their journey with the rest of us in this wonderful book.This book is much more than just another travel log - it's real, true life, adventure. Sandi and Jay battle everything from bureaucratic swindlers to mechanical failures to bad weather, and the reader can't wait to turn the page to see what happens next.So get out your world atlas (you'll need it), settle down in your favorite chair, and prepare to read a story that you'll never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"Does not fit my JDP-15M.

I actually got this bag for my friend as she has a baby girl, and then I got the tan/green flaps for my baby boy. I haven't used mine as I am not due until February, but I really like that it has the insulated pocket for the feeding bottles. I think the material of this product is durable, not to mention the usefulness and convenience of the design.Although, I have to warn you that if it is available on Amazon, you should get it from Amazon and not from their outside vendors.

It works great for quick outings to the store, or even over night stays away from home. And my husband is good about carrying it because the colors are so neutral. You can't even tell it's a diaper bag! And I love the insulated pocket. Not only because it keeps bottles warm/cold, but it's spill proof so everything else is protected. The designer of this bag thought of everything. There are tons of storage pockets and lots of space. And being able to slightly change the look of the bag with the front flap is an added bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some critical flaws","review":"Unfortunately this bag has not worked for us. Although a magnetic closure is appealing, in reality it does not hold well enough. This causes the bag to often be bulky because you cannot pull the flap down and secure a closure. This also causes the flap to sometimes open when you are taking the bag out of the car, moving it around etc., because the flap hits something and does not stay closed. This is not convenient when things start falling out and you are trying to pick them up when carrying an infant. In addition, the inner thermal bag to keep a bottle hot/cold is nice if you use it, however when you are breastfeeding this pouch is in the way, and it is NOT removable. Not a good bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag!!!","review":"we love this bag - It is stylish (peole ask us where we bought it all the time),very convenient and big.

I also love the inter-changeable cover. we have a girl and actually use the pink or the blue cover.

This book simply and effectively addresses a core problem in human nature: self-deception. Presented as a series of conversations between two businessmen, one acting as a mentor to the other, the book walks you through the kinds of events that put you \\"in the box\\" of self-deception. Then, the book explains how you can get out of the box and, just as importantly, explains how to avoid getting stuck in the box in the first place.

The former will accuse the latter of \\"being in the box\\" while the latter may argue how the content oversimplifies things. In reality, like most philosophies, the answer is probably in the middle somewhere. The book recommends that we should evaluate our relationships as those between people, rather than objects, and that any problems we see may really be problems with ourselves.

They are not \\"quick-fix\\" solutions focusing on the short-term, but rather an eye-opening experience for long-term results.

I'm taking the time to write one for Leadership and Self-Deception because it was such a poor book. The content in this book could have been contained in a pamphlet.The author takes a story line approach that's excessively long and becomes tiresome. The illustrations should be shortened significantly. There are only a handful of concepts covered; the rest is fluff and a waste of space (and my time). I would have much preferred a book detailing concepts backed by concise illustrations and supporting examples. Rather then using bloated anecdotes, I would have appreciated a more engaging and intellectually stimulating approach. I can't imagine Stephen Covey, who endorsed the book, reading every page cover to cover. There's just not enough content to warrant it.If you have access to this book free of cost, it's worth a skim.

Had he lived, he easily would have taken his place with Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Chuck Berry as icons of that era. Considering his tantalizingly brief career, he contributed a number of classics to the rock repertoire. My favorite is the sensational \\"Twenty Flight Rock,\\" the song that quite literally first attracted John Lennon to Paul McCartney in 1957. (Check out Paul's great cover version of this song on his Russian album). \\"Summertime Blues\\" is another outstanding song which is as vibrant as it was when first released 45 years ago.Eddie Cochrane is sadly under-appreciated today, but this album will give you an idea of his talent and foresight.

I found a pallete I liked, so off to the paint store I went with book in hand. Turns out most of the colors in the book did not come close to matching the actual paint chip. I found the colors in the book to be browner than the paint chips at the store. Then the color codes for the paint did not match the codes in the store. I could not match most of the Ralph Lauren or Glidden paint color codes to what was on the paint chips. I had to ask the store to look up a color and give me the code so I could find the paint chip.Maybe it was a printing error that caused almost every color in the book to be browner than the paint chip at the store, but I expected the colors to at least be close.

The base is of no use. Also, the base arrived with one of the two taped holes for the wheel locks left blank. Any minimal quality check would have spotted this. When I called HTC they said to tap the hole myself. For what I paid for this base I could have made my own much better. The only good thing I can say is it's sturdy and the finish is good.

I bought it when it first came out and heve been the most impressed from day one. It is 6 years old now and cuts as good now as ever. It is light years more accurate that the dewalt or makita saws. I suggest buying a black paint pen with the saw and putting the pen on the 0 mark and every slash mark along the angle scale at every ten degree marks then the angle scale is easy to see. One of the nicest things is that the detents are easy to adjust minutely from for finish work and still work well enough for framing. IF the bevel marker brakes making a new one from colored tin is easy and then the tin can be bent closer to the scale for faster more accurate bevel settings.

I had already purchased most of the other Sor (solo) discs on Naxos. Adam Holzman plays these pieces quite softly. Perhaps he is playing--as did Sor himself--without use of right-hand nails. However his effect is achieved, the music has a consistently gentle quality. While not as expressive as it might be otherwise, I certainly find his playing soothing and almost mesmerizing (my cat loves this CD). Another plus is that these works--two lengthy sonatas (Op. 22 & 25) and several short piece comprising Op. 23 & 24--all flow together nicely; in this respect, it's perhaps better than most other CDs in this series. Musically, these works shouldn't disappoint in the least--to me, they're all typical, high-quality Sor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Sor, but this music simply isn't good","review":"I like Sor.

In addition to the sonatas, the other pieces are dull and lifeless as well. I definitely can't attribute this to the guitarist - it's just that the music isn't good. Just sounds like a beginning classical guitarist trying out a few tunes. No emotion, no passion, nothing whatsoever.

Both the plot and the characters were extremely two-dimensional and predictable. The heroine and her sainted husband (not to mention her dastardly father) were just too much. It was difficult to feel any of the emotions the author obviously wanted to evoke because the whole thing seemed a bit too hackneyed. Want a great Civil War book? Get the real thing--GWTW. This is only a weak imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Obvious","review":"I should have been suspicious of the pages and pages of literary raves at the beginning of this book - including the one that says \\"Better than Gone with the Wind\\" Give me a break. This story seems to be a sanitized version of the civil war south. The sainted main character and her even more perfect husband seem to have an unlimited supply of money, energy and tolerance for every needy character they minister to during the war and never seem to lose their virtuous patience On the other hand, the character of Emma's father is purely bad, a foil to all that goodness I suppose. All in all you get no subtlety, no complexity and you as a reader gain very little believable insight into why these characters behave the way they do. On the other hand, you do get plenty of overt preaching about the evils of war and racism - Duh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"Having read and enjoyed all of Gibbons' other books and I looking forward to this one.

I've read four of her five previous works and I am breathless to think that the woman who wrote Ellen Foster also wrote this flat, predictable, even annoying novel.

Her foulmouthed and racially prejudiced father dominates his long-suffering wife and 6 children but has a literary and artistic side as well. This abusive and tyrannical man collects Old Masters' paintings. Clarise, the formidable black woman who truly runs the family (as the overseer of Samuel Tate's dark secret, she runs him, too), cares for everyone and leaves with Emma when she marries and moves away from \`home.' The graphic portrayal of Emma and her surgeon husband's duties tending for the maimed and dying soldiers during the war is a heart-rending expression of the futility of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid look at the civil war from a fresh perspective","review":"The dichotomy between the way Emma's father reared her and what she knew in her own heart to be true is the conflict that makes this book interesting. Fiction set in the civil war South tends to romanticize or demonize the characters. But Ms. Gibbons offers a realistic cast of three dimensional characters who as in life; are neither completely good nor entirely evil. Her depictions of twisted family relationships are hauntingly accurate. Is it possible that the author has met my family?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"I purchased 2..the orange as well as the fuchsia.

Becoming a writer is not an easy task; however, my hat's off to all that ventures out to become an inspiring writer. I really enjoyed reading this book and how the author acquainted me with each of the characters. This book had an interesting twist, which left me feeling empty and without words.

It was like the book cast a spell on me. I could not stop reading. I remember staying up all hours of the night, reading this book with a flashlight, frantically turning the pages, hoping it would go on forever. It spoke to me on an intimate lever that no school-assigned swill ever had.

Poems like Dinosaura,We; In The Shadow of the Rose and My Uncle Jack capture the author still at the peak of his creative powers. Of course there are the typical Buk topics like horseracing, boozing, women, the outsiders, but Bukowski takes a soft turn by dedicating a poem to his wife which will catch many Buk fans surprisingly off guard. If you are new to Charles Bukowski's writing you will definitely want to get this book; it will inspire you to try his other books. If you're a long time Buk reader, you probably have this one in your collection already. I highly recommend The Last Night of the Earth Poems to everyonethat has a taste for earthy, lyrical and ballsy poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"I wish I discovered Bukowski earlier in my life.

Its very deep, sits low the ground and the back is very tall. One would HAVE TO purchase pillows to go along the back.

Maybe children under 4 who have no concept of cliched plots, bad acting, cheap props/costumes, low-tech special effects, and badly written scripts (which include lines such as: \\"You ungrateful muscle-head!\\" -Udo) might enjoy it. I know the movie makers weren't looking for aiming for an Academy Award and were just creating a movie that kids might enjoy, but the 4 and 6 year old children I was babysitting while watching this were laughing at the bad acting and cheesy plot lines. The 6 year old actually predicted the ending midway through because it was indeed that predictable.Overall, I must say I am glad that I rented this movie for free from my library, or I would have been angry. It provided a source of entertainment for myself and the kids, but not in a good way.Watch it, you might like it.

I'm familier with the history, the artists, and the techniques of this genre.Most fashion illustrations serve the purpose of either selling clothes or giving directions to people actually making the garments. Short of that, they've been used to present a fashionable illusion for p.r.I'm not sure what purpose of the often very abstract illustrations in this book are supposed to serve. They aren't glamorous. They aren't drawn well enough to sell or direct in the creation of garments. Perhaps they were intended as decorative illustrations at either point-of-purchase locations or on websites.Either way, I found the enclosed illustrations lacking in imagination, verve, and technical skill. This is the first book I've ever returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few pages are worth looking at!","review":"I was excited to received the book after reading the reviews, however when I got the book, only a few pages was worth looking at. Most of the illustrations looked like something that I did in elementary school, with few exceptions. I guess the idea behind the book is to show you all the different medians you can use, some poorly done. Most of the illustrations looked like school assignment I rushed through so I have something to hand to the teacher. Very poor collection of works, I expected a lot more.

The dynamic range goes from the inaudible to the earsplitting so that one is constantly reeling from the assault to ears. The composer actually comments gleefully in the accompanying notes on the choir's joy at singing at full (plus) volume. The music is wonderful, the sound is not.

That is the single most important thing that any customer needs to know about purchasing this songbook - many songs don't have the vocal lines in the piano part (some do, but that's because John Kander wrote them that way, I'm assuming.)The only thing wrong with this songbook is that it's too short. There are a few rarities (from The Visit and Curtains), but there are an awful lot of standards that I'm sure many of us already own sheet music for. I wish more Kander and Ebb songs were available in this format. Heck, I wish all of the great Broadway composers would come out with songbooks in this format.

His research into the role of testosterone is interesting but not convincing.I bought this book hoping for useful approaches to complement carefully researched \\"conventional\\" treatment for prostate cancer, but the author's opinion is that you can't use both.

Frankie is oust to a very small and quaint town in North Carolina.

I look forward to reading more books by her in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light hearted romance","review":"After purchasing and reading Full House which Janet Evanovich rewrote with Charlotte Hughes' help, I thought I would check this book out. I liked it pretty well. The main character, Frankie, was entertaining and funny. I had a hard time buying the premise that sets up the novel though. Frankie gets caught sleeping with her married partner who happens to be the police chief's son-in-law. As a result, she is sent to SmallTown, USA. It seemed to me that Ms. Hughes spent the whole book trying to convince us that Frankie, who was dumb enough to believe the cliche about the married man getting a divorce, was smart and savvy about everything else. Other than that, I liked the book. The secondary characters were suitably zany, and fish out of water stories, if done well, can be lots of fun.

Well, after starting & stopping (over & over again) reading this book I decided to make the time. This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. Similiar to the reviewer above, I found \\"Hot Shot\\" labored and just plain boring. I've attempted to \\"get into\\" the story for the last two weeks but just can't find any enjoyment with either Frankie or Matt. I don't buy for one second that Frankie is an experienced cop. I can't stand how within minutes of meeting someone Frankie will either isolate them or \\"change\\" her appearance/attitude to match what they think is the real her. the relationship between Frankie & Matt seems forced and there is not tension between them.

I found myself intrigued by the unexpected twists and turns in this captivating tale.

The book was a great \\"find\\" - I hope there will be more in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book felt choppy","review":"This book was split into three sections to tell the complete story. All three seemed too rushed and even though I usually love Kasey Michaels, the book seemed amateurish and not very well written. It was my least favorite of the Maitland Maternity books I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"farm boy with a sax","review":"This cd is the debut of John Ellis, best-known as a sideman with Charlie Hunter Trio. John plays tenor, soprano, bass clarinet and flute. This cd features his New Orleans friends Jason Marsalis, Roland Guerin and Nicholas Payton, plus Brooklyn buddies Aaron Goldberg and Bilal Oliver (who's actually from Philly and sings like a girl). The standout on this fine set is \\"John Brown's Gun\\" which features Bilal on vocals (although in concert John sometimes gets Dean Bowman to do the part) and is based on a folk song his Grammy taught him, growing up in rural North Carolina. Maybe someday Ellis will have a Grammy -tm to go along with his memories of his Grammy.Downbeat gave it a rare 4.5 stars and it's hard to find in bricks-and-mortar world (Fresh Sounds New Talent is known for discovering new talent -- Ellis, Bad Plus, Robert Glasper -- but not getting their cds out there much)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This entire album is really interesting and exciting to hear. John Ellis writes great songs. This whole band makes the songs lively and spontanious. I don't even want to continue trying to tell you about it, I can't. Even if you never listen to \\"jazz\\", get a good listen to this album. I wouldn't call it jazz anyway. Happy listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product but could be better","review":"This is a good lathe, it is quiet and functional. But as far as value for the money, I'm not so sure. It would take very little to add a couple of inches of bed length, a 6\\" tool rest and to beef up the locking mechanisms, which seem to slip now and then. Better bearings and a small face plate would be nice too. Jet should dump the stand (any wood worker can make a much better one anyway) and add some more bang for the rather large buck, and you would have a 5 star product. By the way, my lathe is now starting to make odd noises! Humph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality of Jet lathe","review":"I purchased my lathe from toolcrib in february of 2001 as usual tool crib shipped it promptly. It came in one box, I had no trouble getting it put together as all of the parts fit as they were suppose to. The instructions were fairly good and easy to understand. I had the machine up and running in about 45 minutes. It came with A 6 inch faceplate, however I would have prefered a 3 inch plate. The free tools that came with it were of poor quality,you could probably find better at fisher price.com. Overall this is a very good lathe for the money. I would highly recomend if your are just starting out or using it to supplement a cabinet shop as I am. I been using my lathe for about 8 months now and have had no problems with it. My drive center got stuck when I first got it, I called Jets help line ,and they were quick to resolve the trouble. They assured that if I broke the knockout rod all I had to do was call them and they would send me another one free of charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"BT Express on the Local Track","review":"This CD has all the hits but cheats you by giving only the short versions of Express and Do It ('Til You're Satisfied).

If you do just a little bit of research into the beginnings of cardiovascular diseases in the United States you will find a correlation between sugar and heart disease. Prior to the 1940's heart disease was not common then refined sugar hit the market,processed foods became readily available, and the fast food industry took off. Everyone claims that heart disease is caused by cholesterol from eating animal fats but consider the diet of the Eskimo. They eat a diet that is almost exclusively meat and fish and the rate of heart disease among Eskimos is shockingly lower than the rest of us. Why? They don't eat sugar. Constrastingly, India has the highest rate of heart disease and the majority of them are vegetarians! Why? Because too much sugary sweets!! Think about it !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is outstanding!!!","review":"I recommend this book especially to anyone who has a degenerative disease, such as arthritis, osteoporsis, cancer, etc. If you want to avoid these diseases, you should read this book! I have fibromyalgia. After eliminating sugar, I feel much better. I no longer need to take drugs for energy (such as steroids) and pain relief. This book gives you a list of things you can eat (it's a long list) as well as what you should avoid. It has changed the way I shop for food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shake the habit","review":"I found this book very disappointing. A lot of the book was devoted to why sugar is bad for you - over half of the book.

Cutting back gradually and eating lots of vegetables just doesn't make it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"Nancy Appleton is not a doctor and she has never studied medicine. This book is only another one of the diet industries opportunity to make money. Appleton does not give any instruction as to how to curb sugar cravings nor how to incorporate sugar into a balanced diet. This book focuses only on \\"mineral balance\\" within the body and \\"sugar allergies\\". Only 1% of the population has an acutal sugar allergy and each person's \\"balance\\" is different depending on their chemical makeup. She makes the simple statement to cut sugar out of your diet and not eat it at all; first, impossible to do and very dangerous and second, if we had the will power to cut out eating all sugar from our diet we would all be thin anyway.

I read \\"The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program\\" (DesMaisons) first, and I was spoiled by more rational, documented approach to the subject. To be fair, I only got through the first part of this book before I put it down in disgust. This book is the rantings of someone who feels passionately about something. Great. Now back it up. You can't just say, \\"This is bad and you have to do this!\\" Well... I suppose you can. But in my opinion that makes for a lousy book for someone who is trying to learn and separate fact from hysteria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy sugar blues or sugarbusters instead","review":"I'm a biochemist and Ms Appleton's declarations are not based in scientific fact.

More facts and less hysteria would have made a better case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing personal vendetta","review":"Nancy Appleton has clearly declared her personal agenda against sugar, but her lack of objectivity, organization, credibility, or substance leave much to be desired in this book. I was frustrated by the constant repetition throughout the text, and I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time to find any new information. In addition, I was hoping to find concrete, applicable suggestions on HOW to kick the sugar habit. While Dr. Appleton does attempt to include \\"food plans,\\" they are simply lists of the good, the bad, and the ugly. I do NOT recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you a sugarholic?","review":"OMG! In some parts of this book it is like she is writing about me and how I used to be growing up. Sugar is a deadly and addictive substance that really makes life miserable. Easy to read and follow. She writes from the heart with much knowledge.

Little did I know it was actually a MobileEdge and turned-out to be my favorite laptop case ever. When I got my nephew a MacBook Pro for graduation last year, I even passed-up that free case and paid for one of these. The magnetic flap on the front is convenient but yet very functional with some extra pockets inside for pens, etc., and the slide-out sleeve has what looks like bubble-wrap but made of cloth/felt instead of plastic...it alone protects my laptop well when I stow it between the arm of my recliner and end-table. :-) The handle is very comfortable to carry long distances, and the vertical design of the case is very accessible without requiring as much room to open as a \\"briefcase\\"-style case. I had a Targus bag before, but it just felt big and bulky.

It was always one of my favorite Prom night stories with it super natural aspect of a dead prom queen possessing a high school girl and trying to live the dream of being queen she was denied when she died in the school gym fire in 1950s. A lot better concept than a mere serial killer. My only problem is the same as with most 1980s horror movies. That is the DVD box art. I find it weird that 1980s had the most fantastic VHS box cover art and often some of the worst DVD box cover art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"I got this movie in a set of other classic horror movies includeing Carrie, because normally I love old school horror flicks, but this one just put me to sleep, wasnt worth the money I paid for the collection.

However, she recently lost her second child and she definitely has leftover issues from her childhood that she's managed to push aside. To say that she is ready for change is an understatement, and unfortunately for her, the change comes in the form of a nice, cute young neighbor with whom she develops a dangerously flirtatious relationship.Hanauer does an excellent job of giving Elayna justification for what she does, and makes her a sympathetic character overall. The writing is engaging and the story moves along at a good pace, making you want to discover what Elayna will do when she's faced with her most secret desires as well as her worst nightmares. The ending leaves you hanging a bit, but overall this book is well-developed and a good read. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all it was a good book","review":"I do not think this book was as bad as some of the other reviews made it out to be. I thought that the first 100 pages or so were a little slow and kinda hard to get through. The writer created great charectures that you really cared about and wanted to read on to see what happened. The books peaked just shy of the middle and the ending was a little long. The middle of the book was very good, a real page turner you couldnt put it down. All in all it was a great book, I enjoyed it alot, I enjoyed Elayna and felt like she protrayed a real house wife, a real person, and she was someone we could all relate to.

Why does her husband not own a cell phone as a lawyer in the present day and why does she not try harder to find/call him when he is missing for days with their child? There are other things at the end of the book that are very hard to swallow as well but it would give away too much of the story to detail them.

But considering she acts like a snotty high school girl I suppose it's appropriate.I expected much more from Cathy Hanauer. This is the first book I've read of hers and I am accutely disapointed. The character behaves like a spoiled brat, ignoring the potential danger that her daughter may be in and drolling over a young man instead of working on her marriage.It's a story that's been told a hundred times before and Cathy Hanauer didn't add anything new.

I love you and I miss your company, and I'm starting to feel distant?\\" That is what any normal, mature adult would do.An artice of Cathi's that I just read in Tango about dating proves that she is an immature adult, stuck in the 10th grade. She actually advised a girl who has been dating the same guy for 10 years and who is still crazy about that guy to try and \\"see other people\\" before they get married so she won't regret anything.Morons like Cathi Hanauer make having a normal, stable, loving relationship and drama-free dating experience IMPOSSIBLE.

But many of them were sung by Communists in other parts of the Soviet Block as well as in Western Europe and America. Listening to them one gets the idea of what it was like to be forced to take part in annual May-Day marches or to witness Party congresses after the bloody supression of the uprising of Hungarian workers in 1956. Not less significantly, the songs illustrate musical predilections of people who supported, organized, and run Gulag anihilation camps.

There is nobody doing lifestyle television in America who's better qualified to talk about Spain or more fun to watch.

Day 2 was better, but still intense. I kept up the dosage twice a day for 5 days, then switched to a Total Cleanse product for whole body detoxing.

Reading this book immersed me so deeply in Keyes' creation that I found myself staring at my alarm clock at 4:00 AM on a work day, having read all night.I don't want to give a synopsis of the story as it's too much for this page, but I will say it's epic fantasy at its finest. The Briar King has all the elements to make it a wonderful story without being derivitive or predictable.I heartily reccomend this book to fans of the genre, especially if you were,like me, disappointed with the new Jordan book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was free; still not worth it.","review":"I got this book for free on Kindle and it still wasn't worth it. Nothing in the story is original. The only real attempt at originality is the creation of new words and phrases (substitutes for ones we already have in English), which distract and annoy more than it serves to create an exotic atmosphere. There isn't even a mini-story to make you feel like finished the first novel. It's all just a set-up to get you to read the rest of the series. If they are anything like this book, I'll pass even if they're offered for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A decent fantasy. A bit more towards the pragmatic or realistic end of the high fantasy genre, I suppose you could say.The main character in the beginning being a forester, not a knight, or princess. Those turn up later, though.Plots to overthrow the queen, nasty magic, mythological monster-gods, all that sort of thing is here. So, a pretty decent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but hard to find it","review":"This author was recommended by someone who reads Robert Jordan. It was said to be similar in style. Nothing could be further from the truth. While Keyes has a good story, it has so much obscure language, irrelevant passages, etc., that it reads much like a first draft. If he had edited it better, cut out much of the waste and added more flowing description, instead of the choppy rough way in which it was written, it would have been tolerable, maybe even good. As an English professor, I read a montage of books from a plethora of authors and this is the first book in a long time I had trouble getting through, not because it was difficult to understand, but because of the poor editing, it was pretty boring. The only redeeming quality of this book is that Keyes does create a realistic, although somewhat mundane, fantasy world. I would advise readers to choose a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ebook with serious formatting problems","review":"Fair to middling. There's entertainment to be had. Not sure if I'll read the rest of the series. Maybe.This ebook had a few serious formatting problems. Paragraphs were unevenly and randomly indented. Scene cuts, or whatever they're called -- where there's an extra space between two paragraphs and usually a shift of some sort, in POV or space or time -- were not marked. One very different scene slid clumsily into another. It was very disorienting, and there's just no way it could have been deliberate. I expect and forgive these kinds of problems with self-published books but I don't think Del Rey should be making such simple formatting mistakes.Note: I read this on the Kindle app for iPad. It may be the case that these problems only show up on that platform, I dunno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, almost 5 stars.","review":"The Briar King is a very good start to what I hope to be be an equally good series. The story moves at a quick pace, and leaves alot of the details to your imagination, wich is preferable to me rather than write on and on about a persons clothing or food. The chapters are fairly short wich leaves the reader jumping around from character to character and building up a good feeling of tension among the many storylines converging together. I loved the fact that Keyes isnt afraid to kill off characters that you come to like, or save ones who you come to despise. My only complaint, is the names of some of the characters and lands and such are so complicated to read. Some of the names are so alien to my tounge that it distracts from the story. If not for that, this would be a 5 star book. Deffinately worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to download","review":"I discovered with Assasin's Apprentice, (Robin Hobb), that I really do enjoy fantasy books. I've read a few others and enjoyed them. However, this book was absolutely terrible. I couldn't wait to finish it and grumbled all the way through. There were a few parts I actually could follow, but there were many more when I couldn't really figure out what was going on.

It is set in a brilliantly thought-out world with a cast of well defined and well written characters. It starts off with Aspar White the kings forester (called \\"holter\\" here) who sets of to investigate a murder in the King's forest. Along the way he meets with a junior priest who has been kidnapped on his way to his new monastery in the forest.These simple events along with the actions of the Princess Anne outside the forest cascade into world changing events - and this book is only the start. I'm really looking forward to book 2 in this series and hope that it keeps to the same quality of this book. If it does then the author is giving authors like George RR Martin and Robert Jordan a run for their money in showing us a world that is either on the edge of destruction or renewal and is high fantasy at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading, unless you are desperate","review":"his book was such a piece of crap that I had to double check on my Kindle if I even finished it.

For a collector that wouldn't play with the set, it would make a lovely book just to look at, however for a little child this might not be a good choice.The princesses themselves are printed on very light weight cardstock - feels thinner than a business card; The dresses are printed on flimsy, slickish paper - similar to cheap gift wrapping paper.Two of the four dolls (Aurora & Ariel) have long hair so that their are tiny little slits in their hair by the shoulders in which you'd have to insert the top tabs of the dresses. If the dresses were made from a thicker material, this might not be a problem, however for a small child it's like putting a limp noodle into a needle hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Don't be fooled by the cover.

Not that that's an awful thing. The continuing saga of Marlys and Maybonne keeps me in tears, both from laughter and from sadness. The only reason this only gets four instead of five stars is that I'm starting to get a little burned out on them. Barry is so precise in tales of growing up, she's in a league with Groening, Judge, et al, in perfectly capturing, in a crude drawing, such common elements to our childhood as cereal boxes, bad haricuts, and boys who smoke. I highly recommend any Lynda Barry collection, and this chapter does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Scholarship","review":"The author was a well known scholar in his time.

Thoughts are incomplete and it follows no true timeline in order to follow the main character of the book. It gives the appearance of a poorly written defense of Lucretia Borgias' reputation. It leaves you unsure of the unbiased nature of the author.This book definitely should not be sold as a biography for Lucretia Borgia.

I did a bit of research and decided on the Jet...cost and reputation were factors. This is my 3rd jet tool...the JWSS-10 SuperSaw and a dovetail jig are the others. The machine is easy to set up, and does nice mortises. My 1/4\\" bit leaves a small hump on one side of the mortise...which I attribute to the bit. Unless it is a through mortise, you'd never know it was there on a finished piece. I set the hold down just a touch loose, and can easily slide the workpiece from one cut to the next. You'll need to go slow on the first cut, and back out the bit a couple of times to clear the chips. After that, you can move right along. Is this a production floor model machine? No. Did it cost [money]? No. Does it make good mortises? In my opinion, yes, and it is worth every penny of [money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool, quiet and powerfull, solid.","review":"I had been very happy with my mallet and collection of chisels. Merrily chopping away and spending time delving into the art of sharpening. I have built many an item this way. Then a project that came my way required an extensive amount of Mortise and Tenon joints. So as a time saver and as a profit decision, I acquired the JBM-5. Fit, finish and function are great. This is an amazing tool . The power is acceptable, just dont expect to muscle thru the work...you have to let the motor and bit clear the chips or it might stall. I only did this once, untill I learned to pace my work, the unit does have plenty of power. I do wish the unit came with the 2\\" riser block. I discovered I needed this after I started the project creating a delay. Overall.....great tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool - Get a Better Price","review":"I just got my Mortiser and it makes very precise and clean cuts. I especially like how it can be reversed on its base for mortising in 8\\" + stock.... most other brands do not give you that capability..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good basic mortiser","review":"Although the Jet has the same limitations as most other benchtop motisers, it is one of the best out there. It feels solid, it does a decent job of cutting mortises, and the motor has held up well. The supplied chisels are decent too. It could use a better fence positioning mechanism, the hold down need to be redesigned (preferably like the Multico), and I'd like to see a clamp that holds the work to the fence. I returned a Fisch mortiser for this one.I've used the Jet to cut more than 800 mortises in western red cedar without a problem. More mortises in oak, mahogany, hard maple. It does have a tendency to burn the harder woods, but it doesn't clog, and it doesn't stall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performer, Good Customer Service","review":"I've been using the JBM-5 for about three months now. It's a good machine and does what it is supposed to do (cut square holes). I did a fair amount of research before buying and the JET seemed to get better reviews than the Delta and I would recommend it as well.The only problem I've had is that the unit did have a damaged fan cover out of the box. The dented cover prevented the fan from rotating and thus the motor from turning. I called JET and they were extremely pleasant on the phone and sent the replacement parts right out (standard delivery). Overall I was pleased with their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective from the begining","review":"I just received the Jet Mortise machine yesterday. Took it out of the box, assembled it and plugged it in. At first it wouldn't do anything thing but hum a little. I turned the chuck a little, then turned it back on. It made a horrible grinding sound. Closer inspection revealed the fan on the top of the motor was grinding against the housing. Further inspection of the machine showed the bolt holes in the base were not taped square. These bolt holes attach the column to the base. I'm skeptical how square the machine would cut if the manufacturer cannot machine square bolt holes. This is my first Jet tool and it will be my last. I just ordered a Powermatic to replace this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Toy - Save Your Money","review":"Sorry to say that this was the highest rated bench top unit I ever heard about, and it really was just a toy. If you really want a quality machine, stick with the large freestanding units. Hold down and fence are sloppy (typical SE Asian machine), and the unit is quite underpowered. Great leverage from the handle, and you'll need it to jump over that first defective tooth (after that, it's pretty smooth). If you have one of those drill press type mortise attachments, stick with it until you can afford or justify the big machine....skip over this intermediate step. Who uses mortises anyway ? Get yourself a good plate jointer (biscuits) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet JBM-5 Benchtop Mortiser","review":"I recently purchased this tool and was very pleased at the ease of how it went together. I was able to make square holes only minutes after opening the box. I have other Jet equipment and for the most part have been quite pleased with their performance. The only reason I did not give this tool a 5 star rating are the chisels. I'm sure they are fine for general home use but,I feel the steel is not as good of quality as the companies that specialize in making the chisels only. I would also like to thank the craftspeople who respond to these forums so that some of us can learn by their mistakes ie. Delta \\"PIECE OF JUNK\\" mortiser. For the quality and price I will stick with JET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chisels need some work","review":"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using. This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it. Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating, this tool will cut perfect mortises every time. This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine. It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to my workship!","review":"I don't think I can say it much better than most of the other reviewers here, but that's never stopped me before.It's a very well made product, from the mortiser itself, the very sharp chisels that come with it and the chuck key. However, the hold down does leave a bit to be desired. It doesn't give me that sense of confidence at all times as far as whether or not it'll stay put...but it has so far.Personally, other than the hold down, I love this tool! If you're drilling holes and chiseling the waste wood or routing...well if you've got the dough (and in this economy, it's an understandable consideration!), give the Jet a looksee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"short mortiser","review":"This is not typical Jet equipment, I have a Jet table saw, lathe and band saw, they are impressive tools. I should have read the small print with the mortiser. the throat is just enough to mortise a 2X4, in hard wood the motor jams because of wood chips, the chuck is too small 5/8ths would have been a better choice and hard to access. I did keep the machine and added a spacer for wider stock. It does work better than my drill press but not much.Rich"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tool","review":"Having promised my wife new cabinet doors for the kitchen, my reward was to get this tool. It's performed very well. Ease of set up is a real plus. I've got the Delta mortising attachment for my drill press, and this is a lot easier to set up and to use. It could be improved by offering a higher speed range, since it tends to bog down a bit with deep mortises in soft wood, But, for the convenience of an easy to use dedicated bench tool, the Jet has done all I've needed - 21 doors done, and the results speak for themselves. I've been a serious hobby woodworker for over 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a machine!","review":"I received my mortiser today and I was punching holes in less than 15 minutes.

It was shipped in its original box and the 50 lb plus packaged was kicked around by the US Postal Service. The motor cover had a dent big enough to prevent the motor from turning. This story gets better though. I called Jet and they immeadiately sent out a new cover at no charge. Set up and operation was a breeze and it works as advertised.

This is the diary of the unflappable and determined Sister Blandina recounting her experience when, as a young nun, she is sent to a mission out West. Let me tell you, she is an amazing woman! Strong, brave, and absolutely unwavering, she knows how to get things done and how to deal with all sorts of tough characters. Along with hundreds of other nuns, Sr. Blandina helped to civilize the West, although history and popular Western fiction largely ignores the contributions of these brave women. This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to know what the Wild West was truly like. Why has America left unacknowledged the crucial role that Catholic nuns had in making the West a more Godly place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"At the End of the Santa Fe Trail","review":"Be very careful if you are reading this book for an accurate historical account. She embellished many events and dates, such as her meetings with Billy the Kid, which do not appear to be possible or truthful. For example, when she describes her dramatic first meeting in Trinidad, CO, with Billy the Kid in 1876, he was in Arizona and not a leader of a gang.

I read 120 pages before tossing it, hoping all the scene setting would lead somewhere, but it never happened.

But after forcing myself through 100 pages or so, I finally had to give up. I found Ms. McArthur's style too disjointed to entertain or engage the imagination. She describes bulkheads and electronic consules better than she describes the action of the story. Dialogue is stilted, with everyone talking in choppy, uninformative sentence fragments. It's amazing they communicated anything at all. My interest in the mystery waned with every chapter I read, until I decided it wasn't worth the effort. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating and complex tale.","review":"The density of ideas here is vast, with action being of secondary concern. There is an interweaving of storylines, both mystery and science fiction, which creates tension and movement through the pages. I found the constant flashbacks by Commander Halley to her relatives and their political turmoil to be interesting, but not readily relevant, and thus a bit of a distraction. Overall a really interesting book--a 'thinking man's' science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tank leaked after 4 years, not worth $200+ ($300 Cdn!)","review":"The tank has started leaking (not the fittings) after approx. 3-4 years, assume it is corroded, definitely NOT the quality you should get for such an expensive product.

Seems to always be the price/performance point that I go for. Not the top of the heap in build quality, but what do you expect when the price is on the low-end? Fortunately, over time InSinkErator has improved build quality and features. The latest model is definitely the best of the three and I sure like having a large temperature control dial over the previous small hole for a screwdriver.As for hissing and spitting issue, the solution is simple - turn the temperature control down so it is below a boil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great unit except for the cheap handle/nob","review":"I have ownded this item for 4 years. My parents had a similar device, though a different brand, and we fell in love with it. I bought this one hoping for the same quality, but was disappointed. While the tank and fittings have been fine, we have had trouble with the turn knob from the date of purchase. It doesn't sit tightly on the unit, spins freely without turning on the water sometime, and just has a cheap look and feel to it. Even when it does work, I just don't like the design. Since it is somewhat loose, you can't really predict which way to turn it to get the maximum water flow, and you have to play with it back and forth to finally get it going. I can't recommend this product, and would suggest you get a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the product hate the quality","review":"This is my third instant water heater. the first InSinkErator one came with the house and had a copper tank.

The third one has a stainless steel tank so I thought it would last. It failed after 2.5 years. It leaks at the gasket between the top and bottom halves of the tank (looks like there may be an o ring in there). Wow - I am not pleased.

The price has gone up $45 dollars in three years. What cost us $152 three years ago, now cost $199 at Home Depot. Don't waste your money. When it was working properly it was great.

Insinkerator replaced the tank at a cost that floored me (service man told me AFTER he replaced the tank that he was going to replace it and how much it would cost) Within months, it went again, but they insisted it was the tap, which would have costed another $300.00 to replace.

The unit starts leaking from the bottom after about 11 months of use. The unit is poorly designed. I keep the unit at about 150 degrees, far less than the maximum setting. Inside the unit, there is a clear plastic tube about 2 to 3 inches in length that connects the tank to the dispenser tap. Over a very short period of time the plastic tubing becomes brittle from the heat and cracks, thus causing the unit to leak from the bottom of the plastic enclosure holding the stainless tank and heating element. The tubing costs less than 25 cents which causes this $200 unit to fail. The leak has caused extensive water damage underneath the sink before I detected the leak. Until the manufacturer makes a design change, these units will not be dependable. You are better off capping the hole in the sink and heating water in a microwave and save your $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"InSinkErator H770 not a good choice","review":"I purchased an InsinkErator 770 seven years ago.

I could dig out the warranty information and get a replacement since it has a 3 year warranty but I'm choosing not to replace it. When these break down they leak under the sink. Everything gets wet. If you have one, be sure to keep items that can be damaged by water in some sort of plastic bin or bag to prevent them from getting ruined when your unit goes out. As others have mentioned, every time I've replaced my unit in the past, the fittings have changed so it's not just a simple change of the tank that can occur. The fittings need replacing as well. It seems to me that after all of these years, they could come up with something that doesn't leak all over when it goes out. A waste of $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handy product but poorly made or designed.","review":"My experience is much the same as other reviewers who have gone through two or more InSinkErator hot water dispenser in ten years or less.

I would consider going to a different brand, but it appears Emerson Electric manufactures basically all of the brands that are widely available in the U.S. Perhaps I'll investigate the European models to determine if any of them might be more reliable. Otherwise, if you want the convenience of instant hot water at the sink, just expect to replace the unit every few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better with a more expensive model","review":"I really love having instant hot water -- use it all the time.

Except for the tank leak, it worked as expected. So many people have had the same problem that the connections to the tank must be a bad design, worse than a manufacturing defect. I bought the more expensive model with the stainless steel tank. It's only been 8 months so can't tell if it's worth twice the cost.-----It's now nearly 2 years since the more expensive model was installed. Performed flawlessly until yesterday. A leak.

It's a big job to do by yourself but with a little planning it can be done. Putting on the wings and getting them levelwasn't too bad. I clamped a 2X4 to the table leaving about 12\\" hanging over. Then I could push the wing up to the board and get a bolt started.My first cut was to check the 90 setting of the blade. I ripped a short piece of stock and stood it on the table on its cut edge. Slid the square up to it and there was no light to be seen. Very impressed.I am less than impressed with the included blade, however and a new one will be the next purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uptown Flamingo","review":"Great product.

I also noticed that when I'd try to open one Windows computer from another in the \\"Network\\" dialog it often wouldn't work the first time, but if I tried it again it would work ok.After eliminating every other cause for these glitches, I replaced one of the switches with another of the same model and the problems persisted.After eliminating that, I got a different routerTRENDnet 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit GREENnet Standard Switch (8 x 10/100/1000Mbps)which made these annoying little problems go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good.","review":"Well built, clean.

Other ports work just fine at 1000Mbit, but you will have to experiement to find the ones that do work. On top of that, some network devices will not negotiate at all including two 100Mbit laptop network cards, one 3com and one xircom which are very solid, reliable devices in any other situation, but do not work with this switch.Other users complain of overheating issues or freezing issues that require a power cycle, or even complete failure after about a month, but I have only had mine a few days so those problems havent come up yet.Go with any other 8 port gigabit model.

I'm not sure why this book has an average of 4 Stars. The only thing I can figure is the people rating it have not read his other books and have nothing to really compare it to.

I LOVED The Notebook. Loved it! But this sequel is not about Allie and Noah's life (from where it left off in The Notebook). I want to know about Allie and Noah's life from the time she chose him to them winding up in the senior home. I feel like Nicolas has left a huge gap; us knowing them from the start of their relationship and the end of it, all in the same movie! What happened in between? Their wedding, the births of their children, etc. They had such an intense relationship, I just want to know their lives together. This was too much a generation jump for me to be a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"The Notebook was a wonderfully romantic book, but this - The Wedding - is uninvolving and repetitive. This is supposed to be a contiunation of The Notebook and follows the story of Jane and Wilson; Jane is the daughter of Noah and Allie from The Notebook. Wilson and Jane have drifted apart from one another during the course of thier 30 year marriage, and this is Wilson's story of how he gains redemption for his misdeeds all those years. The characters are flat, the dialogue is repetitive, and I felt like I was reading the same chapter from beginning to end. Every chapter is almost identical to the one before it (in terms of words and descriptions), and I found this book to be boring and badly written. There is no depth here, and the writing is as if someone is speaking to you all the time. For instance, \\"I got up. I went out. I went to the store. I felt happy.

(just being honest!)","review":"I've only read one other Nicholas Sparks book, The Rescue, which was much better than The Wedding. The beginning of The Wedding was especially depressing (I'm a newlywed so maybe I don't want to know that marriage can become THIS dull/unromantic?) and the middle was very unrealistic and almost laughable (planning a wedding at the last-minute and having everything run so smoothly?! yeah right!). I haven't gotten to the end (YET) but I'm not holding my breath for any huge surprises. But it's good to know it gets lighthearteded/humorous at the end. I gave the writing style/ease of reading a few stars for good measure, but I really think this was a shallow read. For unpredictable page-turners with DEPTH (the type of book I prefer), I highly recommend anything by Diane Chamberlain.

The outcome is predictable and known for most of the book. (Will the wife fall back in love with the husband? Since she starts to almost immediately, it's pretty clear). The message seems to be that a man must go to outrageous lengths in order to please a woman, and if he doesn't, he is simply a failure as a husband. I'm a woman, and even I don't buy this.The only reason I finished the book was that it was an easy read, and I kept thinking that there would be more -- that there would be an interesting plot twist.

It is one of the best that Nick had written..it's a beautiful story that captured marriage life that many people might experience in reality. It's the sequel of The Notebook and it's a must read.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A husbands Journey to save his marriage","review":"I was so pleased with this novel. I was very anxious to read it, after I had read the Notebook. I absolutely adored the character Wilson. He was so determined to convey his ardent love for his wife in the most exquisite way I have ever read on paper. The story revolves around Jane and Wilson's daughter, who Jane thinks is rushing into a marriage with a boy that she has been living with. Throughout the novel Wilson endeavors to become a better husband by cooking elaborate dinners and attempting to lose weight. The novel also includes Janes affable father, Noah, who aches the loss of late wife, Allie.This novel will not dissapoint Spark fans...it delivers a strong message that marriage is sacred and should never be taken for granted."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too sappy","review":"I've really tried to get into this author's writing but again in the Wedding, I find his stuff is just way too sappy and predictable! His characters are \\"made for TV\\" and his plot line leaves little speculation as to how the story will end. We wrote stuff like this in Creative Writing 101! If you want something mindless for the plane or the subway ride to work, then I recommend this book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Daunting Task - He Did it!","review":"I was hesitant to read this sequel to The Notebook, which is my favorite book ever. I didn't want to ruin the original somehow, but I was pleasantly surprised at how Nicholas pulled this off while remaining true to the original characters. Noah and Allie will always remain very real to me, much the same as Evan in Anna in Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Some characters live with you forever. This is an excellent sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too gooey, sappy, lovesick romantic for my tastes","review":"I could not get into this book... around page 85 I started speed reading.

Sparks before. Beware, he writes books of the same quality that Kinkade paints pictures. If you like the stuff, go ahead. His books have the feel of a product after exentsive market research into what a women of the age group 35 and up, married and with some income would like to read. It is soppy, overly sweet, with little understanding what a longterm relationship is really all about (the author cannot be older than 35 himself). This is what I expect to read in a romance novel that is devoid of sexual references. Save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow throughout....surprise at the end!","review":"I can see how most readers would find it boring throughout the book...but I'm usually one to quit reading books halfway through if they're really THAT bad. But...this book has a surprise waiting at the end that's worth all of that and more. I gasped at the surprise and my fiance looked at me like...what in the world are you going off about! I loved it...I truly did and I just can't get over how incredibly romantic the young author, Nicolas Sparks really is. I mean...you'd swear he's gay! Straight men just simply aren't that naturally and creativly romantic! I'm a fan for life! His wife is a lucky woman if he's anything like the men in his novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie","review":"The book has an interesting plot devise, but I found it rather predictable. It really only contained enough material for a short story and probably would have had more of an impact if it was written as one. I can imagine that this is the type of book that will be better as a movie. I'd suggest waiting. The end of the book didn't surprise me at all, but in a movie form with adequate directing maybe it would be less predictable. If you wait for the movie you might be pleasantly surprised.To be fair I did laugh my head off at the story of his proposal."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great, I keep it in my car","review":"This book is fabulous... Nicholas Sparks never ceases to amaze me! My mother (50 years old) and I (19 years old) both found this book to be incredible, despite our age difference. It was beautifully written, and had a very exciting plot twist. My best friend had recommended me to read this book, and i was so grateful for her good taste.

The book is a continuation of the Notebook and takes it to the next level without completely focusing on the characters in The Notebook. The Wedding tells the story of Noah's daughter and son-in-law, and how over the years they managed to lose the love in their marriage. The Wedding had a suprise ending that shocked me, and I loved reading about the new characters in Noah's life. It is definately one of Nicholas Sparks' best books.

Definitely had me fooled at the end though! Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Could be better. Could be worse.\\"","review":"I dove into this book after enjoying \\"The Notebook.\\" With familiar characters and a warm, easy writing style, I wanted to know the narrator and his family better. As I continued, however, it felt more and more like sneaking into someone's diary and I wasn't sure I wanted to know all of the intimate details.It must be said, this author, Nicholas Sparks, is one romantic fellow! He clearly knows what it means to love and be loved and for this, I applaud the story. And just when I was getting a little bored with all the wedding details, he pulls a fast one that made the hair on my arms stand up and my throat feel a little thick. So, while I contemplated giving \\"The Wedding\\" only three stars, I had to add another half star and deem it a good read to satisfy my own romantic nature. Cynics, stay away.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.

A feel good book for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have been a fan on Nicholas Sparks for about 5 years now. I buy everyone of his books as soon as they come out. I am afraid to say that is going to change now...this book was a huge disappointment. I must say that the last three have disappointed me. Bend in the Road was the first to let me down, Nights in Rodanthe continued the downward trend and The Wedding was the final straw. This was the story of an average marriage; a man and a woman growing apart over time. In my opinion using the characters from The Notebook was a cheap ploy to pull in readers. These characters were average and pulling Noah and Allie into was unnecessary. Those two should have been left alone. If you are looking for the magic of Noah and Allie skip this book and read The Notebook again. I also suggest trying a new author, Kirk Martin and read Shade of the Maple, the love story is ever bit as moving as The Notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WEdding","review":"One of the best books I've ever read.

It was really hard to keep my interest. It only was interesing in the very last chapter. The last chapter was good, but it really didn't go along with what happened throughout the rest of the book. If you think back, you realize it doesn't fit together. My friend read this and thought it was great, so I guess everyone has a different opinion. I honestly thought it was the worst book I have read. Message in a Bottle and Bend inthe Road were 100 times better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, right!","review":"First of all, men like this don't exist, which is probably why I thought of it as so sickening.Next, to the review. Wilson and Jane are a middle-aged couple having some marital troubles. He forgets their anniversary, so the next year, he plans some freakishly odd gift where he leaves notes and little presents around the house all leading up to them meeting at her parents old house for a dinner date. Then we have to read through a page and a half of them having sex in what was once Jane's parents' room. Am I crazy, or do we all feel sick when we read something like, \\"Down to the floor went her new dress and my jacket.\\" (Yup, I thought so.)So, unless you like reading about what goes on in a 40 year old bedroom (yes, everyone does it, and I enjoy reading romances, but Sparks makes all of his sex scenes graphic.)This is all I shall leave you with my friends. Take it or leave it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"It took me months to read this book because I couldn't get into it! After reading The Notebook, what a let down!

I guess Nicholas Sparks had beginners luck with The Notebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution","review":"No reinforced stitching and very small thread at that.

First, it was replete with with \\"pep talk,\\" which was time-consuming to read and irrelevant to the goal of mastering crucial SAT test-taking skills. Second, it was thin on substance, which may be why the author had to use extra-large fonts to fill up the pages. The few SAT test taking strategies, designed for the so-called \\"2400 Club\\" members, were nothing you cannot find in most quality SAT prep books. Also, with the pre-2008 edition, the lay-out was so messy that it was actually hard to follow. Finally, having just coached my daughter for the January SAT (in which she scored perfect SAT scores), I think it's misleading to insinuate that one could earn perfect scores on the SAT simply by using this one workbook. From my perspective, nothing short of disciplined work, relentless practice, and a positive mind-set would achieve that.

Bad overview.","review":"If you're looking for a great overview of parenting, this is not it. It is clearly made up of bits and pieces of various sermons, and fails to address several of the Scriptures most directly given to parents, namely those given in Proverbs. It also seems to be targeted at Sunday school teachers rather than parents.If you're looking for a lot of good thoughts on parenting, teaching, and children, this book is incredible. I've never underlined so many thought provoking passages. It is particularly strong on the value of teaching children. It's a great source of quotes.Regardless of the lack of biblical coverage, and unsystematic coverage of the topic, I'd still recommend it. If you already have a couple of books that cover the topic of parenting, this would be a worthwhile supplemental read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The term, \\"Stepford Wife\\" is so well-known today, it's hard to believe it all started with this little novella. In it, Joanna and her husband move out of the big city to the idyllic suburb of Stepford, Connecticut, where life seems perfect. Joanna hopes to be active in Women's Lib activities but soon finds all the wives in town want nothing more than to cook and clean. And all the husbands go to the Men's Association every night. Why?Having loved the 1975 movie version ofThe Stepford Wives, I expected the book to be just as intense, but it was a big let-down. The book isn't the least bit scary - or interesting. The writing is spare and uninvolving, the characters sketchy and bland, and there's no action. The story is frozen in 1972 with all the references to Betty Friedan and NOW.If you're looking for thrills and chills, watch the movie. Even the silly 2004 remake is more interesting than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read!","review":"This book is a great read if you're looking for something that makes you think and does not take too much to go through. I read pretty quickly normally, but even for the average reader, this book flies. But, despite its length, there is not shortness of story. Ira Levin managed to capture my attention with a novel you could finish in a sitting.Leaps and bounds better than the recent movie based on the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read, Deep Questions","review":"I read this book when it came out because I loved Ira Levin's \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" and wanted to see what he was doing next: Levin was always trying something new. This book is a fast read with a fascinating (for the time it was published, 1972) plot. All the wives in the small town of Stepford have fantastic bodies and no brains at all. In fact, these wives are content to serve their husbands as sex partners, cooks, dishwashers, chauffeurs, nannies, you-name-it. The wives never complain. Joanna, the hero, who with her husband has just moved to the town of Stepford, begins to suspect that something is very wrong, and soon her life is in danger. Levin treats the topic of women as full human beings (or the denial of women as full human beings) in a thriller fashion, and it works. The term \\"Stepford Wife\\" is now part of the American English vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levin sees the future","review":"In many ways, Ira Levin is a visionary. His greatest works were written decades ago, yet they are more significant today than ever. The Stepford Wives, while downright spooky, is at the same time a glimpse at the runaway science that makes the concept of humanistic robots seem more plausible every day. In it's day, the novel was viewed as dark and slightly absurd. Today? Who's to say that tidy, smiling woman who lives next door isn't filled with circuitry and microchips instead of blood and bone? One of my all-time favorite books. And written with the cut to the bone conciseness Levin has mastery of.

I enjoyed it on a purely entertaining level. I did not read it from a feminist or science fiction point of view.After finishing the book in one reading I was not disturbed by the anti-climatic ending. Ira Levin let the reader imagine and conclude what happens to Joanne and Bobby.This book is great \\"no-brainer\\" and I would recommend it only as a beach book, or if traveling ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"When I first finished this book I was not pleased. I wanted to know EXACTLY what was going on in Stepford and how they were going about transforming all the women into perfect housewives. But after a day or two of thinking it over, I really liked how the book ended...you come to your own conclusion about whats going on.I was also pleased that it wasn't your typical 'bad guy loses...good guy wins' sort of ending. (I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it at that.) I've recommended this book to all my family and friends, its a very stimulating quick little read. Can't wait to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stepford Wives Revisted","review":"Having seen the original film. I wanted to see how the new movie would compare.

It's not that kind of thriller I expected. I don't know why the story irritated me. Is it because I am a female or I am not an american so that I cannot appreciate the sarcasm? If it's a thriller, I believe, it's only for women. Maybe it points out the deepest fear for women. Also the story leaves me many question marks. If it's not the structural problem of the story, it must be my lack of knowledge for western style literature or american culture. However, I agree with the excellence of how the author schedules the story. He did tell a four-month-long story, not just picked some time points out, and, in the meanwhile, still kept reader interested in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stepford Influence","review":"With The Stepford Wives, Ira Levin perhaps defines one particular style of horror or suspense fiction. Taking a normal situation and turning it upside down, eerily so, Levin blazed a trail for authors like Stephen King or Bentley Little. Levin presents readers with the town of Stepford, a remote suburb away from the grind of big-town living. Idyllic, inviting and almost utopian, Levin begins to introduce oddities, imperfections that lead both the protagonist and the reader to conclude that certain things aren't what they seem. And of course, they're not.After reading The Stepford Wives, I was immediately surprised at how much influence the novel obviously had on some more contemporary horror and suspense authors - Andrew Neiderman's Amnesia and Neighborhood Watch as well as Bentley Little's The Association owe a lot Levin's Stepford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generous survey of music from 16th Century Germany","review":"Berger and Convivium Musicum hail from the School of Musicology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, but this CD is far from dry and academic.

With amazing paper collage illustrations and Xiao Ming and his mother, this one includes the characters for person, big, small, sky, water, mountain, and sand. It also includes the characters that opened my eyes wide and led to my first custom made Chinese charm from Jiayin Designs that I still wear often around my neck--the characters for woman and child and how when they are put together--woman and child together--the character that results means good.If you want to read my reviews of 35 different kids books related to China, visit my 7.2.2012 on myoverthinking(dot)com"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 FINE WORKS","review":"Here is another pair of string quarets that sounds great & better.The quartet number 11 is the better of the pair.IT is like almost 40 minutes long.The other one is fine because it was redone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Daniel Easterman struggle","review":"Daniel Easterman obviously is finding it harder and harder to create intriguing plots that are surreal but yet believable, and totally exciting. His \\"the 7th scroll\\" is the ultimate masterpiece; mixing X-Files like mystique with Indiana Jones excitement.

Here the author talks about the disease, how to treat it to control it, and what types of life-changing habits need to be broken and new ones made.The book even outlines what types of exercise is good for us. I was told years ago that weight training is a taboo for diabetics... not so according to the book, and the author explains why.I wish that I read this book 10 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better wheels","review":"I thought I was getting an item with mobile casters but I did not read the description well enough.This item has one caster wheel and two stationary wheels that you have to stop, bend over and tighten a hand bolt to lock. Moving the item around is easy if you have a lot of mobility room but if you have that much room...you don't need the stand. Save your money and look fo a stand with at least 3 mobile wheels and a lift/lower locking type mechanism.

Wouldn't buy again and will probably not buy HTC products either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like gliding on ice, deadly ice.","review":"This mobile base went together in just five minutes. The steel and wheels are all of good quality material. Caution! When I was cutting a 24\\" X 48\\" X 5/8\\"piece of plywood, the tablesaw started to tip due to only one wheel at one end. This almost cost me severe injury to the face as the blade was still running. Talking to techs at HTC, they tell me I would be better off with the \\"four wheel\\" mobile base for tablesaws. This stand is being returned and I am buying the HTC 2000 as recommended by the HTC tech team. The one star is for the quality of this product, not safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful - Except as a Footstool","review":"I purchased this book for the first part of my Biomechanics class. We raced through the first 10 chapters, and each one was very difficult to understand. Fung skips steps in his derivations which, for an undergraduate, made studying more confusing and time consuming.Probably the most frustrating part (at least for an engineering student) of the text is that none of the equations (except the ones from Chapter 1) are applied to anything. Not even for the problems at the end of each chapter. The book is just a long list of mathematical derivations regarding hypothetical blobs, I mean \\"bodies of mass\\", in space.In summary, I wish this book had a lot more examples pertaining to applying all the equations written in this book. Perhaps application of these equations will be used in the second part of my Biomechanics class, where we use yet another Fung book. I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for me","review":"I am the matematican and I had to start learning C.M. from this book. And I didn't like it. First chapter is some very simplified approach to linear elasticity, but it doesn't developed any intuition and reading it was waste of time. Stretch tensor was introduced with avoided notion of polar decomposition. This presentation was far less intuitive for me. The linear algerbra behind primal stresses is described and computed in details, but nowadays the student involved in computer methods and engineering must know this things in my opinion. And the language is not instuitive: me, matematican, couldn't do most of exercises after reading chapter they relate to. It tasted like old-fashioned book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backsmart book","review":"I have had recurring back issues for quite some time (12 years) and have done lenghty research to help aleviate pain and improve performance. With that being said, I found this book to be entirely too basic for me. Much of what's covered are sretches and abdominal and bicep exercises.....very little lower/upper back exercises. If you're an athlete or somebody who's been active consistently, you probably won't find your answers in this book. However, for older or non-exercising individuals, this book has decent basic guidlines and is decent starter information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Good Health","review":"A few months ago I had an excruciating back injury from falling off a horse while jumping, that the most extensive therapy and treatments didn't help much more than my regular exercises I was doing before the injury. After nearly two months of constant pain and disability, I found this book, and within the first few days of doing the first (easy) exercises, I felt significant relief from the pain. Just doing a few simple postures stretching ( wall stretches) and stretches throughout the day had me back to normal in a short time, and I do the core exercises daily with the free weights to keep my back in good shape.This was the first book that had offered be many choices to choose from rather than the basic floor exercises I was given during therapy. Recommended to anyone who has back pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful, and not original","review":"I find that these stretching exercises exacerbate my back pain. I'm sure that some people might find them helpful, but overall there's nothing to them that couldn't be gained from a good beginning yoga class.The strengthening exercises are essentially Pilates exercises.I wish I hadn't bought this. I was hoping for some kind of new approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for former athletes","review":"This book was a total waste of time and money for me. This book might be good if you are a former athelete, has has experience with exercises of this kind and had people coach you in the past. For an Electric Engineer like me that has back pain due to spending 12 hours sitting behind a computer screen, this is way to overwhelming.The stretches alone took me forever to understand and almost an hour to go through. After that I was so sore that I couldn't excercice on the next day or so.I still believe the best approach is to look for professional help. In one hour, a qualified instructor can demonstrate how to do things properly without getting hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Time Consuming","review":"While the concepts in the book seem sound, following the program is way too time consuming for those that have jobs and family. I might be able to complete the workout schedule described if I had no job; but even then most of my day would be spent working out. The author himself is a self-confessed fitness junky and this carries over into the recommended workout schedules. Your best bet would be to mix and match concepts from this book with concepts from other books concerning back and total body fitness to create your own custom work out.It seems a good, well rounded total body workout book that takes back pain and injury into account has not yet been authored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too aggressive and harmful exercises","review":"i tried the program and had a big disc blowout while performing these ultra aggressive exercises"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Backsmart review","review":"I decided that the book deserved a 5 star for it's thorough coverage of exercise and weight training. In that sense, the workouts covered are good for everyone, no matter what eating plan they are following (as long as it's healthy). Maybe that's even better. If you are following an eating plan that makes sense for you, is healthy and varied, and are ready to add weight training into the mix, this book is for you.If you are ready to even take your routine up a notch, are doubting your form, are not seeing the results you wish, then this book is for you, too. It's great. It's as informative as Body for Life by Bill Phillips and as well written which I used for over a year. Additionally, The Backsmart is more flexible with the workout routines and exercises, and explains how to vary them. There aren't a lot of books for beginners on this subject. And, again, this book isn't just for beginners, it's really for anyone interested in fitness. Completely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"just more snake oil","review":"What posseses a health care professional to make such grandiose and unsubstantiated claims?

There are 2 wheel locks that keep your saw in one spot while working. Once you are done, just unlock the wheels and move it out of the way. This makes cleaning up very easy. For those of use with smaller shops, this is a big help. Order this with your new saw and during the assembly process of your saw, get your saw on the mobile base as soon as you can. It will save your back. The mobile is very well put together and very easy to assemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"base flexes","review":"I have this base under my Jet saw. Every time I start the saw the whole thing wobbles. HTC should have used a heavier gauge steel for the corner pads and caster supports (or put four casters at corners, instead of three). The frame is too flexible. Even blocking the corners does not stop the wobble. No safety issue here, it's just disconcerting. Extra bracing between the extension table legs and the saw helps somewhat (I added a much needed shelf).

This is a well-researched and beautifully realized book. The color plates are exquisite, artfully showing off the painstaking precision that Menaboni lovingly employed on his subjects. Thomas Kinkade may be the Painter of Light, but Athos Menaboni is the Painter of Iridescence. Not even Audubon could best him at it.Roger Tory Peterson lauded him as our greatest bird artist and Robert Woodruff commissioned a new Menaboni painting every year to adorn his Christmas cards.

Yes, it still has the four colors and all the cards you've grown used to. It includes an extra card that really makes the game unpredictable.Appropriately names the \\"Mayhem\\" card, this card allows the person who played it to trade cards with any person they so desire. The twist? Anyone else then trades cards in the same pattern. It might be one to the left, three to the right, straight across, etc. Naturally, the person who played the card gets a good deal, but everyone else has no idea what they'll wind up with. The card is also a wild card, so the person who played it gets to start play with a new color.I played it recently with some friends, and we got a great kick out of creating mayhem. And with four of the cards in the deck, there was plenty of it. It throws off any strategy for a few turns, but creates a nice twist on an already fun game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made in the shade.","review":"Great hat for white water rafting.

I applaud the Liars efforts, as on paper this would seem to be an album I would love but unfortunately, compared to the afore mentioned bands, they come across as amateurish. A 9/10 rating from Pitchfork is laughable. In other reviews that I read much was made of the drumming on this album. I'm not sure why, it's fairly boring and repetitive. The singer sounds like he'd rather be sleeping. The guitar does nothing to warrant attention.

Some times it vibrates so much that I have to take it off. At first I thought I might have installed the wrong way. I tried couples of different ways but it did shake and vibrate in all different positions.

It's one of the only books about the late eighteenth century novel that isn't drearily plodding and worthy -- the prose is a joy, full of quirky flair and fizz that will remind you why you ever found fiction sexy. Rousseau, Austen, Scott, Hazlitt, Hogg, Hays, Wollstonecraft, Byron -- this is one of the mosty distinctive and persuasive books available about any of them. The section on Hazlitt's confessional Liber Amoris is the only good thing I know on the subject & puts Tom Paulin's embarrassed dismissal in his big biography to shame.

The only songs I can even stand to listen to are \\"Waves\\" \\"Jackie Cane\\" and \\"Renaissance Affair\\" and one of those was on their second album anyway! I don't know if they were going for a tacky-ish, retro techno type sound but tracks like \\"Everytime we live together we die a bit more\\" are unbearable to listen to. I can't recommend this CD, despite \\"Jackie Cane\\" and \\"waves\\" which are actually quite good (the 2 stars I gave this CD are for those two songs, the rest, are ........). However, some people apparently love this CD. There's no accounting for taste, eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disjointed album but great songs","review":"I do not have any problem giving this album 4 stars and best of artist title.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible disappointment","review":"It's true enough that this album bears almost no relation to other releases by hooverphonic.Unfortunately, the band has shuffled into mediocrity with this release. The only tracks on the album that I can even *remember* are 'Mad About You', a nice and straightforward pop song with some jazzy influences, and 'Renassance Affair', a song from BWPM which they probably included to leverage the popularity of a recent Volkswagen commercial.To call this album anything other than bubble-gum pop would be a stretch. While the band is certainly not stagnating in their past musical space, it's a shame to see them abandon their creative signature sounds in favour of radio-ready ear candy.Anyone who loved the Battersea EP (or even the 'mad about you' EP) will be disappointed by the lack of drum-and-bass and trip-hop influences on this album.I can only hope that the band continues their trend of musical evolution and abandons this vapid style with their next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big departure, and I'm leaving with it.","review":"I was all happy the other day when I saw this album on the shelf (had no idea it was out). The little \\"featuring song from VW beetle ad\\" sticker should have alerted me about what was ahead, as that song is Renaissance Affair from the Blue Wonder Power Milk album. The album starts out quite nicely with the first two tracks and quickly becomes very boring, bland pop music. It finally (believe me I barely made it through the whole album) ended with the \\"VW tune\\" as the marketers have dubbed it. But I already have that song, on a far better album.Say trip-hop and acid jazz are long dead, I don't care, I still happen to like it. Hooverphonic has obviously departed from the sound on their previous albums, and I'm leaving with it. So if you really like the two first albums, be careful with this one.."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing, creative band","review":"I was drawn to this cd after hearing \\"Jacky Cane.\\" The guitars in that song sound like a mix of Blondie and Nirvana mixed together in my opinion. It's a real standout track, and the neat thing about Hooverphonic is that all their cds are quite unique. This cd is more likely dream pop than triphop, but I have no complaints, because whatever genre it is, the songs are good none the less. Another stand out track would have to be \\"The Magnificant Tree.\\" The beat of that song is spacey and mysterious, and the lyrics are quite trippy and fun. \\"Waves,\\" another amazing track, with dreamy, refreshing lyrics, from beat and the vocals was also beautiful and laid back. I could go on about all of the other songs, but I reccomed you hear you the cd for yourself. It's not like other Hooverphonic cds, but this is my favorite that they have. It's a quite a musical experiance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"The Magnificant Tree is, with the exception of a couple tracks, a huge disappointment. I love Hooverphonic's first 2 releases, so when I heard they had an album due I was extremely excited to hear something new by them. After giving the whole album a listen, I was sad to find that it wasn't nearly as dreamy as the other two and almost none of the songs grabbed me at all. In fact, most of it is terrible! If you have any interest in Hooverphonic, I suggest you skip this The Magnificent Tree, and head straight to A New Stereophonic Spectacular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative Rock Smash Hit!","review":"Ok this is the one thing i don't understand.... I hear this is a real \\"POP\\" album, i hate pop music, pop music to me is just an artist out their just to please, HooverPhonic's not out to do just that.. but they are not my favorite band. the magnificent tree is the first HooverPhonic cd i have bought and probably not the last. My favorite songs on the cd are: Mad about you which she sounds like a haunted Beth Gibbons (from portishead) which i love!! Out of sight which is sort of pop until you listen to the lyrics she sounds sort of angry... Reniassance Affair ok it was on the beetle commercial but it was still a cool song i think people descriminate because of that.... ok Frosted Flake Wood it was a very good song... but i did not quite get the message here.. it sounds like a fairy tale but breakfast foods wasn't the message i got from the song.. maybe a guy shouldn't talk to shrooms i think that was the message!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooverphonic's starting to ...","review":"I was looking forward to hearing this CD.

The only track I thought was worth adding to my MP3 collection was \\"Autoharp.\\" Rennaissance Affair is also good, but it was on BWPM so it doesn't count. \\"Everytime We Live Together\\" sounds like an attempted Portishead ... and not nearly as good as the real thing. \\"Vinegar and Salt\\" made me think of Goth ABBA.I highly recommend Hooverphonic's previous work, but steer clear of this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get me wrong...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Hooverphonic. They're one of my favorite bands. But compared with their first two albums, this one is terrible. I think they tried to be too \\"popular\\" in a cheap way, using hackneyed phrases like \\"We'll always be best friends/Something between you and me...\\" that are at best empty and worthy of being lines from an episode of a teeny-bopper sitcom/drama. This may sound silly, but one of the things I loved about their older albums was the way you couldn't tell what Geike was really singing, and when you did figure it out, the words made no sense. Now their songs seem to be about relationships (of all overdone things!) in a really unoriginal way (e.g., \\"Every time we live together we die a bit more,\\" etc.). Anyway, they still have a pretty decent sound, although noticeably deliberate, and I do adore the song \\"Waves.\\" It's the only one you can really listen to without having to consciously block out the sickeningly trite words."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"im convinced this isnt really hooverphonic. It doesnt even come close to the quality of their other two CDs. I loved A New Stereophonic.. and all though Blue Wonder.. lost a little bit of the mellow techno part of the first CD it was still full of great songs. TMT has lost EVERYTHING. its like listenin to really bad pop. i admit Mad About You is very catchy and Waves can take you away. but other than that... if youve been a fan of Hooverphonic for so long like me, do your self a favor and dont disapoint yourself. If anyone wants to get a Hooverphonic CD please get one of the first two, just pretend this one was never released. I hope Alex does a better job next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Adventurers","review":"If you are sonically adventurous, then you will love this CD.By the way, I know most of the other reviewers hate \\"Frosted Flake Wood,\\" but it's an acid trip of bubble-gum-pop proportions! If Willie Wonka had a theme song, this would be it! If the Monkees' songs were redone by Massive Attack, they would sound like this! And if you like it, then you should definately pick up Broadcast's latest, \\"Ha Ha Sound,\\" cause every song on it sounds like \\"Frosted Flake Wood\\"!Come on, ignore \\"Mr. Doubt\\" and \\"give that mushroom some warm food\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad characature","review":"I was sorely disappointed with Hooverphonic's third release The Magnificent Tree. Not only is the title ridiculous, but the sound is like a bad characature of their first two albums. They tried to continue the previously wonderful trademark sound, but it just falls completely flat and derivative. This album is damn near unlistenable, except for the re-issued final track which capitalized on the TV commercial. I had to use mine as a frisbee because I couldn't stand the site of it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, they made it.","review":"ANSSS and BWPM taught me two things. First, Geike Arnaert has one of the most thrilling voices in the popular music scene today. Second, she didn't dare to use it. We also learned that Hooverphonic can produce the most amazing songs, now and then.With The Magninficent Tree it all seems to come together. An arrangement leaning towards sythpop with a bit of trip-pop thrown in and traditional top quality glam-pop songwriting. It took three albums, but now it seems that they manage to put together a full album of Good Songs. And Geike finally finds the self confidence to bloom as a vocalist.As some have stated, they have strayed far far away from the traditional trip-hop that coloured ANSSS. But who cares. The songs are simply better written and performed this time. And that's what really matters.Ok, I doubt anything will ever beat Inhaler, but as an album, this is Hooverphonics best effort so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Magnificent nothing","review":"Who, what, why and how? Can you call this Hooverphonic. It has no similarities to any of their past works. I was so excited to receive this cd and now I can't wait to get rid of it. I almost cried. I needed my fix of Blue Wonder Power Milk and I got the blues instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding offering","review":"I feel, having read other customer reviews, I must put in a good word for this cd. I was familiar with Hooverphonic only because I heard their single \\"Club Montepulciano\\" on a sampler cd. When I saw their cd in a store, I decided to give it a listen. I fell in love with the cd immediately.Perhaps this is not their best cd, as other customers have stated. But that just excites me, because that means that I will probably only love the next ones I buy even more. Still, as a stand alone cd, I think it's great and one of the best cds I've bought in a long time. Definetely worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one bites the dust","review":"Well, with this release Hooverphonic joins Morcheeba and Tricky on the list of trip-hop/acid-jazz artists who seem to be more interested in mainstream crossover than producing the intriguing/hypnotic music that gave them their notoriety.This is a collection of slick electronic pop music - nothing more, nothing less.Music: slickly produced, easily forgottenLyrics: vapid to the point of being irritatingVocals: lovely as usual, but...One more nail in the coffin of the trip-hop movement. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"staring into space","review":"Great music for mellowing out at the end of the workday....or at the start, when you're still in that not-quite-here-yet state.

I don't know what happen to the group, but they lost their energy. The music is lacking the feel of acid jazz, and has become more of a slow jazz album. Don't be fooled by the other reviews. I have listed other artists above that I enjoy. If you enjoy what I listen to, then be warned, stay away from Blue Wonder Power Milk and The Magnificent Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Before You Leap","review":"Before I begin, let me just say that I am a major fan of Hooverphonic's first album - mesmerized by almost every song. It was one of those CD's that everyone else who wasn't in tune with my taste would get sick of because I never took it out of my CD player.Since then, however, I have found their albums less daring and 'out-there' and more forced - especially Magnificent Tree. I feel that the majority of the singles are simply trying too hard to be quirky while more focus should be directed toward crafting good songs.It is one of those albums that you force yourself to listen to all the tracks because of your history with the group, but one that eventually becomes a two-track album. Those two tracks are \\"Mad About You\\" and \\"Out of Sight.\\" While these two songs - OK, maybe also \\"Jackie Cane\\" - were strong enough for me to keep listening, the rest are generally forgettable.Fan or first-time listener, take this venture out for a test-drive before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best...take a pass...","review":"I'm not an electro-pop fan but I happen to have bought a couple Hooverphonic CDs many years ago.

Instructions are very well written. You need to know what you are doing before attempting to install this yourself. Took about 2 hours to install.

I've been to five auto parts stores and no one has a mount that both fits on the Honda factory-installed mount (which is epoxied to the glass) and on the CIPA 26400 rearview mirror.

I did some research and read reviews that 5A's were a good weight to start out with. I also liked the fact that these sticks had a rubber coating on them that looked good and provided some extra grip. I know it is probably from my inexpierience in gripping the sticks that the rubber actually caused a slight blister on my finger. I received these sticks in October and finally in February and there are thumb sized holes through the rubber and the top of the rubber is loose.

How disappointing.The musicians play this very mechanically. No emotion. And I don't know how one can't get emotional playing this piece. I got bored and turned it off. I could be jaded, having first-hand experience with this music, but I'm inclined to npt believe that.Another problem I have with this recording is some of the tonal depths. The piece, as an orchestral composition, has high treble notes and low, pouding bass sections, which aren't brought out in this performance. I don't know if the recording is poor, or the musicians purposefully quieted the rhythm and bass sections.

The clangorous intervals collide, shooting out vicious sparks of violence and rhumbas of jagged rhythm. It's like the skeleton of the Elephant Man. In fact, by stripping away the elaborate plumage the true revolutionary Rite is revealed.The other two pieces weren't what I bought for -- but the other reviewers seem to like them so I'll give them more time to soak in.

Even for Americans living on the coasts, in cities like San Fran, LA and NYC good, true chinese food is hard to find (and is more often of the southern Sichuan variety).

It informs the reader as to the political history of China and the way that Chinese cuisine has been inextricably linked with the politics for many generations. It describes the intricacy of planning and preparing Chinese menus which satisfy the eye and the taste buds, while entertaining, educating, and delighting the person who is dining. It discusses the balance a chef should strive for in taste and texture, and brings a whole new dimension to westerners reading about Chinese cooking for the first time.All of these things are intertwined in a plot about an American food writer who goes to China to find out about her dead husband's past and to interview a fine, young Chinese chef.

All three novels share some common elements, but in the previous two the narrator was a more well developed, hence interesting character, and it was unclear how things would progress.On the other hand, if the writing in the first chapter does not bother you at all, you might like the whole book like so many of the readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"This was highly recommended to me by a relative who knew my passion for all things food.

It is generally reviled among more experienced musicians and especially by FOH sound techs, who find the effect disruptive to the house mix when used on individual instruments.In converting the chip to work on 9VDC, numerous compromises were made compared to the 120VAC rack units.

BBE's sonic maximizer gives us back all that clarity.According to BBE, they claim their efforts are more based on cleaning up differences in speakers, ambient differences, etc, where different frequencies are reaching our ears at different times microseconds apart and muddying up the sound.

They have created a slow and crushing doom-trip through the vast oblivions of space. While listening to this you'll feel as if you are slowing being pulled past the event horizon of a black hole, without any hope of ever seeing the light again. This is where all journeys end, and the fear of the unknown beyond begins. If I had to pin a tag on what exactly to call this kind of music I would go with Portrait Doom. That is crushing funeral-like doom that paints a vivid image of what the artist is trying to portray.

The discussion of rape and violence in this book is so graphic and true that as a reader of Chin Lin Shi's horrible abuse you will feel more like a friend to her than of a simple witness.I constantly wanted to reach into the story and pull Lin Shi out and give her a safe place to be. I was extremely disturbed by the sexual subjectation that she (and through her, and women in China) have to endure. It really made me stop and think about what do men in America (not to mention other places in the world) say about women behind closed doors.This is a definate must read.

To add one, I had to go right to Louisville Ladder and shell out another $31.00 (cost plus shipping) for what would likely have cost the company mere dollars to have included as a standard feature on the ladder. Honestly, and as originally noted, the ladder looks great and I'm sure that it will serve me well, but I feel absolutely ripped off that this high priced, quality item does not include a paint shelf as a standard feature.

Judging by the reviews I've read, I am not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have read the entire series of Dr. Kay Scarpetta and would always get so excited when a new book came out in the series. However, this is the first time I was strongly disappointed in one of the books. I felt Cornwell was all over the place with her characters, which made it difficult to become involved with any of the characters with any depth. Each chapter went from one character to another but never deep enough to feel connected or interested in any of the characters. In fact, there was less about Dr. Scarpetta in this book and she has always been the main character. This was a true disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a NO star category","review":"Read 80 pages, couldn't finish the book. I've already crossed Patricia Cornwall off my list of authors twice before, but somehow I think she's going to go back to the good mysteries she used to write. In the case of this book, I was out in a store and a list showed this book high up on the Best Sellers List. HOW IN THE WORLD DID THAT HAPPEN? I'll never buy another book without ready the reviews on Amazon. This was trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I couldn't believe how bad this book was. I wanted to give it no stars, or negative stars, but that's not an option. As the other posters have noted, there is essentially no plot, and what plot there is remains unresolved. It is a series of disconnected ramblings. Truly, truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"They keep getting worse","review":"I think Patricia Cornwell is trying to see how badly she can write and still sell novels. Her past few novels have been just incredible--the characters aren't believable any more, the story lines aren't wrapped up properly, and the material is just plain depressing. In this one the formerly righteous crime fighters turn into murderers, and all of the characters act like wimps who don't know right from wrong. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbfounded","review":"This was an awful book. If it had been written by anyone other than Patricia Cornwell it never would have made it into print. How on earth did a blind guy escape from prison? What wasn't implausible was silly.

But the last 3 or 4 Scarpetta books defy credulity. Cornwell has become so obsessed with Wolfman -- who is a real bore as a character -- that she is now even resurrecting dead people to deal with him. This book was a terrible waste of my reading time and the last Scarpetta novel I will read unless the REAL Scarpetta comes back. That's the intelligent, feisty character who began this series of books. (I won't even bother to mention the disappointment of a near-400 page book wrapping up all its plot details in its last 30 pages -- what a ripoff!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better not to write this book","review":"I used to be a fan of Key Scarpetta, but this time...To make it short - Patricia Cornwell is running out of ideas, and this book is a sad prove of the fact.

This one takes the cake. SPOILER!Two years and not a peep from Benton Wesley. Wait...Yeah, Benton Wesley is not dead, he is just undercover! Okaay. Geez, I think we all know Dr Scarpetta could keep a secret. Then we have this international conspiracy which is seriously laughable. Then, there is the martyr and the victim of every law inforcement agency-Scarpetta's niece, Lucy. I'm tired of hearing how everybody is out to get her because she is gourgeous talented lesbian. Please, kill me.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad day for Scarpetta","review":"Having loved all of the other Scarpetta books, I read Blow Fly with a sense of anticipation. Unfortunately, this wasn't met at all. The book lacks the mystery of the preceeding volumes. All of the characters seemed manipulated towards the ending, which wasn't nearly so obvious in the other books. I was disappointed with the third person perspective, although I understand while it was used. However, Cornwell calling Kay \\"Scarpetta\\" throughout the book seemed to distance her from the character. If she was calling the main character of her story by last name, she should have kept it consistent throughout. Overall, the story seemed tired and not very imaginative. Hopefully the sequel (whenever it comes out) will be better than this uninspired novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I waste my time?","review":"I've stayed away from this series for a few years but chanced on the Blow Fly and thought I'd give it another chance. Why ever did I even attempt it? I've missed a few in the series, having given them up a few years ago, but nothing has changed. Apparently Kay S is as misunderstood but perfect as ever. How a totally self-centered and egotistical character could gain a following is beyond me.Her fan club of dysfunctional people continues to swarm round. Every one of the characters in the book is as demented as the criminals in the story. And almost nothing happens in the book except her niece becomes a cold-blooded murderer but no one seems to think this an inappropriate way to act.I'm now hoping Kay goes on the hunt for a terrorist and all her friends and associates somehow are blown to bits as a final installment. I could go on with the many reasons why this book was such a waste, but the book simply doesn't deserve that kind of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if we quit buying, she'll go back to writing good books!","review":"I have read every one of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I really enjoyed the forensics and thought the writing was excellent and the mysteries were interesting. I was very angry when she killed off Benton Wesley and swore I'd never read another. I should have stuck to my guns, but when you're in an airport and need something to read right now......I mean, how bad could it be? Well, it was boring, it was depressing, and the BIG SURPRISE was an insult to my intelligence. I don't believe it for one second, not one. Nope. Can't happen, didn't happen, I don't care how much Patricia thinks her readers want it. She needs to go back to the basics that made her books so wonderful. I for one am sick to death of all the melodrama, all the outrageous coincidences, and all the depressing helplessness of a woman who was so appealing to us once, because she was so capable and had so much common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoned-in and terrible","review":"I picked up the book in an airport as a \\"vacation read.\\" A novel this awful was almost enough to ruin the vacation.Not only is it poorly written, it is poorly organized. There is absolutely no suspense or excitement. There are far too many (shallow) viewpoints, and one ends up not caring about any of these narcissistic fools, and hoping they will just go away or shut up.With any luck, Patricia will decide to shut up and retire. It seems to me she's just interested in raking in the cash so she can buy a few more Hummers. She should be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"The only saving grace of my experience with this book is that I borrowed it from the libary, so I didn't spend any money on this sorry piece of fiction.I have read ever Scarpetta novel and used to love them. I entered into this one knowing that they have been going down hill, but this one hit rock bottom. I got to the last page (not knowing it was the last page) and eagerly turned the page for the next chapter and was greeted by painfully empty endpages.Please, take my advice (and the advice of just about everyone else) do not bother with this one. You will walk away disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total collapse","review":"I used to wait in anticipation for the next Scarpetta novel to come out. After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another. Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating. I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement. What a letdown. Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews? I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia. Please don't buy this novel because soon all the used book stores will have dozens of copies with hardly a page turned. Patricia, please retire with some dignity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"If this was the first Conwall book I had read I would have put it down after the first chapter.

I have never read Cornwall before, though I've heard of her, of course. This is the beginning and the end of my relationship with Ms. Cornwall. How many books did she try to ram into this one? At least five: Lucy and Rudy's relationship and the crime they were involved in; Nicky and her mother's murder; the evil twin brothers, and how they fumble through life; then we have Bev out there at the boathouse and her relationship with the handsome twin; oh yes, let's not forget the little boy who popped into the story out of nowhere; and on it goes. But here's the positive, I bought the book for fifty cents at a library used book sale. It's not hard to figure out why a library would dump this one! Readers, don't even waste ten cents on this horribly written book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly inept","review":"The latest Cornwell is an embarrassment to book lovers.

It's written from the perspective of different characters, everyone but Scarpetta it seems. The wit, the humor, the intelligence that make Scarpetta novels my favorites are completely lacking. The Scarpetta storyline it seems is spiraling further and further away from reality, its plot relying increasingly on farfetched coincidences, over-the-top bad guys and well, just plain boring sub-plots thrown in for bulk. Why did Scarpetta stop investigating real crimes and instead became the target of a huge conspiracy of evil? It is really hard to stomach anymore. As a once die-hard Scarpetta fan, I thought it would be impossible for me to dislike a Scarpetta novel, but this one is only worth reading to keep up with events. And one MAJOR issue - don't read the synopsis if you don't want a very important plot detail given away!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbled and disjointed","review":"I had several people recommend this book to me. I wish now that I had not trusted them, but at least I didn't buy it in hardcover.In every other series I've ever read the author managed to have each book stand alone, so I wasn't too worried that I hadn't read any of the other books in the series. Bad idea on my part! Maybe if I'd known more about the characters I could have understood what the heck they were doing. As it was, this book was nothing more than a jumble of disjointed scenes. And those scenes don't even flow smoothly together. It puts me in mind of someone trying to put together a beautiful picture by taking a handful of pieces from about 5 or 6 different puzzles. None of the pieces fit together so its nothing more than a jumbled mess.So, ask me if I want to bother reading any of the other books in the series after reading this one? No, thank you. I at least like all my puzzle pieces to fit smoothly together even if the whole picture isn't going to make any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed by the story line. This was not up to the usual standard of the previous Kay Scarpetta novels that were created. It seems the author is lacking ideas to continue the trials of Dr. Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment for Cornwell/Scarpetta fans","review":"I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels, and both the Andy Brazil books and loved them all.Eagerly, I bought Blow Fly and started in. I wasn't sure if time had just taken it's toll on my reading desires, or if the book was truly as disappointing as I found it. It was the latter.Like other reviewers, I felt the book seemed to jump around with very little flow and there was VERY little of the forensic aspect that attracted so many to Scarpetta in the first place.The plots have become so far-fetched and ridiculous it's tough to enjoy the book with a straight face.The book also ends in a way that leaves the reader KNOWING there will be an equally-bad follow up.If Patricia Cornwell is unable to continue the Scarpetta stories with the intelligence, wit and drama we've all grown accustomed to, it's time to retire the character and start with something fresh and (hopefully) better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a roar, ends with a whimper...","review":"I became addicted to the Scarpetta series and devoured every one. Sad to say, this one gave me bit of indigestion. Ms. Cornwell, what have you done to our beloved characters? Marino was always an out of shape slob, but we knew he was the best at what he did. In this book, we only got the slob. And Lucy! There was finally a strong, beautiful character who happened to be a lesbian. What happened? Her sexuality was one of the things that seemed to make Lucy who she was. And remind me not to rob any banks with her; she spilled her guts within 24 hrs.Bringing Benton back to life sucked the life out of Scarpetta...she was strong, intelligent, and in charge, it seems, till she met him. All of a sudden she was the damsel in distress needing to be saved by the all encompassing male hero. Rudy, the human Ken doll, deserves no mention. Never. Ever. Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the story?","review":"Why? With so much talent , why not move forward with new adventures , not make a composite of the old.

The same villians are portrayed - there must be more evil Kaye Scarpetta can foil. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the ending?!","review":"I agree with a lot of the previous posters. I was really eager to buy this book after being a Scarpetta fan and loving most of the previous titles. I finished the book last night and was totally disappointed with the ending (or lack thereof). It was like a book version of what the Matrix Reloaded was for film, just something shoved in the middle to tie up loose ends and serve as a vehicle to promote the next installment. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow On By Fly","review":"This was the most disappointing book I've read in a long time. The only reason I finished it is that I kept hoping it would get better. Too many story lines, and none of the characters are really likeable. And with the sudden ending of this book (did you have a deadline to meet Ms.Cornwell?) I can't believe there will be another novel with the ridiculously boring Chandonne character. Enough is enough! Please, Ms. Cornwell (and your editor), get back to your old form and give us back the Kay Scarpetta stories that kept us up all night because we just couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's worst yet","review":"If you loved the \\"old\\" Kay Scarpetta novels by Cornwell (as I did!), you will find this one the biggest disappointment yet. I kept reading, thinking that it HAD to get interesting, but no dice. It was almost as if the author had to adhere to a set number of pages, then suddenly realized she only had 5 pages to go, so wrapped up the story quickly & inefficiently. The book was a waste of my money & time. I think I'll just stick with Kathy Reichs and determine that Cornwell has \\"lost\\" her past talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book ??!!","review":"I will never believe that Patricia Cornwell wrote this book. It went everywhere, yet absolutely nowhere. I'm sick of the Chandonne story line, that we clearly will be hearing from again. I'm also sick of writers having people come back from the dead, just to keep a story going. Not to mention having prisoners easily escape from maximum security prisons, just to make room for a sequal. Do you mean to tell us that prison guards let dangerous prisoners, with \\"Nothing to lose\\", out of handcuffs BEFORE they are safely locked in their cell ?? Please....give readers credit.The new twist with Lucy's behavior was beyond disappointing. I have been a Cornwell fan from the beginning and like another reader said, felt like throwing this book against the wall after coming to it's end, which by the way, was not the end. Will the real Patricia Cornwell please write us another book and dump the Chandonne's while she's at it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the end?","review":"*Warning- I give away some of the book details in this review* I have read all of the Scarpetta books and was excited to see this one at the bookstore. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers when they said that it seemed like she was in a rush to finish the book. As I was approaching the end, I kept thinking, wow, it must wrap up pretty quickly considering I only have a few pages left. It completely left me hanging! How can she tell you that a killer has escaped jail, whose only purpose seems to be to kill Scarpetta, but just leave it saying that Scarpetta knows he is coming for her and Benton next? I can't believe I spent money on a book that had no ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"won't read","review":"I haven't read this book, & I love Patricia Cornwell, but after reading the reviews I won't waste my money.

But this book redeems those bad ones. Kay Scarpetta is back, stronger than ever. Although the reason for Benton Wesley's \\"fake murder\\" didn't ring real, I for one am glad for his return. Lucy is more likeable in this book - a real tough computer geek. And so is Scarpetta. She seems more like the Scarpetta of old. And of course Marino never changes, thank goodness. The story line was good, the characters great, and this was one good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLIES RIGHT BY","review":"This is definitely one of PC's best! Her writing style, while vastly changed, is exceptional. I'm not sure if I like the style as well as her others - it is hard to get used to the 1st vs the 3rd person writing style; but the book itself is wonderful. PC has outdone herself in letting the readers see how far Kay has fallen yet there is still that spark that suggests she will become the strong Kay that was before. I think there is a human aspect to Kay this time as opposed to just the robotic perfect Kay Scarpetta presented to us in the past. Simply wonderful. Cannot wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried it on cassette","review":"Before the end of Tape 1, Side 1 I knew I'd go no further.

Clearly, no one is editing her work any more-- the frequent chapter breaks are random and chop up the already bizarre plot, there are POV shifts within chapters (heck, within individual pages), and she's taken an unpopular past plot point and is trying to reverse it in a pathetic, unbelievable fashion.This book is a mess. Don't even bother checking it out of the library, let alone buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! The resurrection of Benton Wesley was never very well explained (and if you didn't read the book where he \\"died\\", you would be totally lost), there were several things alluded to that didn't come to fruition (e.g., what seemed to be a relationship that MIGHT develop between Lucy and Nic), but, worst of all, after chapter 118 (page 443)the author just seems to say \\"I'm tired of writing so I'm quitting after a few more pages.\\" Everything was sort of wrapped up with few, if any, explanations and Jean-Baptist Chandonne was left out there roaming the Louisiana bayous. WHAT A CHEAP TRICK TO BRING ABOUT A SEQUEL. Well, guess what! I won't buy it or read it. Another disappointment was the fact that Kay Scarpetta wasn't much of a heroine in the book. Her former exploits were alluded to frequently but I felt as though she was crippled or retired or both. Patricia Cornwell seems to have lost her touch. YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"next book - the heroine is revealed to be a space alien","review":"Obvious, overblown, silly.Big plot points that make no sense.

Very disappointing to me, as they were great in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saved me the cost of the book","review":"As a fan of Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta, I'm glad I read the reviews of all who read Blow Fly before purchasing this book. (My title says it all.) I have read all of the Cornwell/Scarpetta novels and I, too, like many reviewers have had trouble with the Chandonne characters. I enjoyed Cornwell/Scarpetta when the focus was on the forensics. Maybe Cornwell will heed her fans demand and get back to the basics of her early novels!

I was hoping to move beyond the Chandonne brothers. If you have not read the previous books the reader will be totally lost because Cornwell seems to be tying up a lot of loose ends from previous books. It seems ludicrous that after all the grieving Kay Scarpetta did for Benton that he gets resurrected. There is a big build up of events in this book, but the conclusion comes with amazing speed. It could not believe the story wrapped up so quickly.

I gave Blow Fly about 40. And after all those words, I still didn't give a rat's behind about Scarpetta or any of the other characters. I've read every Scarpetta novel, so theoretically I should have known what the backstory was, and had some emotional investment in the characters, but apparently The Last Precinct didn't make much of a lasting impression on me - I couldn't remember what had happened, or why I should care.Tempe Brennan is a more interesting medical examiner; V.

I, too, kept waiting to find the details of what I had imagined Kay's next move to be after her dismissal from Richmond. Alas, and woe is me, us, them, her...

Was at Border's by 9:30 on its release date to buy it. When I started reading it and realized that it was Chandonne again, I was soooo disappointed. But I kept plugging through, hoping that something would catch my interest. It didn't. I guess Patricia has run her course. Kate Scarpetta totally needs a reworking. When I think back on how exciting her first novels were, I feel screwed out of my $20.00. Oh, well, there's always Dennis Lehane and Jeffrey Deaver to look forward to. They NEVER disappoint me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the level of other Scarpetta novels","review":"This was the most disappointing Kay Scarpetta novel. I wish I had read the other reviews on this site before I bought the book. I probably would have bought it anyway, but maybe I would have waited until it came out in paperback. Fans will read the book to keep up with what is going on, but this is a disappointment. Much of the book is drawn out and tedious and then everything raps up in the last 10 pages.

Authors, whether brilliant of just plain OK, have only so many good books in them. Once they go beyond that point, it's all downhill. And when the author was brilliant, the fall appears even more dramatic and disappointing for the readers who had once anxiously awaited their next release. I would put Patricia Cornwell in the Tom Clancy category now. Both have gone way past their limit. Comparing Blow Fly to Post Mortem is like comparing Teeth of the Tiger to Hunt for the Red October. In other words, there is no comparison.If they can't or won't give us the quality that were are used to then they should not write at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After hearing the hype on TV about this new novel, I ordered it.

It is boring, to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed faithful Scarpetta fan","review":"I was so excited to receive and start reading Blow Fly. As it turns out I am 3/4 of the way through the book and I am having a hard time finishing it. I feel all Scapetta fans have been let down. I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this latest lack of storyline etc. My sister is also an avid Scarpetta fan and she was also very disappointed. I hope the next novel in the series brings us back to characters that we know and love. Hopefully, this one will be explained as a bad dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"What happened here? This book felt forced from the very beginning. If I was reminded of all the past plots for the main characters one more time I may have screamed. New characters were never fully developed and the old characters droned on and on. And then when you could maybe feel some building up of the book's finale, Cornwell wrapped it all up in about 3 pages. It's as if she said - well I can't think of anymore so - boom - I'm done. Sadly disappointing - it will be a long time before I pick up another of Patricia Cornwell's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Bad To Worse to AWFUL","review":"With the last two titles, it became increasingly clear that Cornwell has either run out of stories, or has simply stopped caring. Blow Fly stuggles to be Harris's Hannibal, with Cornwell going so far as to directly rip off ideas from that book (remember Lector's memory palace?) The biggest problem is that THERE IS NO STORY. All of the characters mope around, and if I sent this story into my editor, she'd send it back to me and cancel my contract. This book was SO BAD that, after reading it, I returned it to the bookstore. It's sad that someone of her talent has simply stopped caring about the quality of her work, and is now dumping this awful stuff onto the public. What's even worse is that she expects people to pay for this. No more for me. I'm done, and so are a lot of her fans. Goodbye."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh so disappointing","review":"I couldn't get over that when I was less than 100 pages to the end, that nothing was really coming together. It was like we were reliving the past for a very long time - then whoop - let's write us an ending. Even the ending as it stood was just a summary and not properly told. Why? Who knows - perhaps she needs a longer, better break so she can come back a write like she used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"small spoilers","review":"I just needed to add my vote to the \\"very disappointed\\" list.It wasn't a bad thing that Ms. Cromwell switched to a narrative point of view, but the 1- to 2-page chapters were very disjointed, taking up a lot of space in the novel without giving bulk to the storyline.The characters had all lost their character. (I MISSED Marino's \\"Yo!\\") No one talked the way we've become accustomed to them talking.The climactic ending was anything but climactic. Did Ms. Cromwell get bored with her own novel at the very end? We weren't even allowed to \\"witness\\" what should have been a very satisfying end to the serial killer, we're just told that he's dead and we have to be satisfied with that.I will definitely wait until I read the reviews of the next Kay Scarpetta novel, because even the \\"cliffhanger\\" isn't enough to drive me to the book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read It - Even if it's Free!","review":"What a waste of time - What is it about Kay Scarpetta?

And worst of all, after slugging through all the pages, the action is all over in about 4 pages -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unending torture","review":"The worst of Patricia Cornwall meets the worst of Thomas Harris (Hannibal). Kay Scarpetta's creator has mimicked Harris' descent from taut to turgid; suspenseful to soporific; exciting to enervating. A good gift for the trashcan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer","review":"I love the Scarpetta series and am a huge fan. I gave the police series a chance but didn't like it, so I have been anxiously waiting for the next KS book. Unfortunately, it would appear that Cornwell has forgotten how to write. This book made no sense - it meandered around circling a story without ever actually telling it, and then it ended so abruptly my head was spinning. I am hopeful that this book was simply filler - something to keep the readers busy until the next real novel came out - but I am going to wait for the reviews before buying any more Cornwell books instead of gobbling them up first thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Cornwell book I buy?","review":"It took me more than a month to finish this one and I didn't enjoy it at all!

No more Cornwell books for me unless the reviews are really good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a disappointment,,,","review":"I am such a Cornwell fan, reading all of her book, even the cook book! But this one is not her best work. Seems as though this book wasn't cared about. Took me forever to read it and I usually read them in days. The wittness protection card has been played so many times, it's just a tired story line. I found myself not caring about the characters like I have in other books. The ending was so weak I didn't realize it was the ending. How disappointed I am, perhaps next time Patricia."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree...","review":"I was really excited to read this book, but after reading it I'm afraid to say that it was pretty bad. It doesn't have the same focus as past books in the series - it seems at times that this book is not even about Scarpetta. It is much more of an ensemble cast, which is disappointing. Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that this book spent most of its time on descriptions and events that didn't really matter, and then wrapped up the climax and ending way way too fast. After finishing it, I thought \\"This is it?\\"If you're going to read it, definitely check it out from the library - don't waste your money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly Blows!","review":"So there I was, believing what everyone had told me: Cornwell's stuff is really cool. So I go off and pay freakin' full price at my local bookstore, eager to find a best-selling author who actually knows how to tell a g.d. story...and discover this laughable, excremental exercise in frustration. Cornwell couldn't get a passing grade in a high school composition class with this crap. The screwed-up use of tenses and awkward grammar nearly drove me nuts. Obviously, this author believes her own inflated press releases. Now, of course, she's becoming a TV crime-reporting pundit. That's like having Marcia Clark and Chris Darden tell the world how to convict slam-dunk guilty murderers. A very bad joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible read, even for a die-hard fan","review":"I really enjoy the Scarpetta books, but this one is truly unreadable, poorly written, with a hard to follow story line.I re-read The Last Precinct before starting Blow Fly, which helped, but this book is a disappointment. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big wind-up, no delivery","review":"Having read The Last Precinct, I looked forward to its follow-up, where hopefully Cornwell would help convict the Hairy One (Jean Cardonne) and in the process also jail his crime-ridden French family. Alas, Blow Fly gets off to a good start but dissolves like the Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz in it last hundred pages --a puddle of slimy goo on the floor. A long dead Scarpetta lover suddenly reappears. Jean Cardonne --supposedly blinded by acid-- can suddenly see again and escapes from prison. Further we are subjected to page after page of pyscho-babble as Scarpetta's inner self is explored. And the ending, oh the ending ! It sets us up for still ANOTHER Hairy One saga.Not for me, Ms. Cornwell, unless you catch and kill him off in the very first chapter and proceed with another totally new set of Scarpetta characters, letting Kay do what she does best, working her forensic magic with the likes of Marino to chase down the perps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"I have enjoyed Ms. Cornwell's previous books, that when I saw that she had written a New Scarpetta novel I immediately bought it. The book was a terrible disspointment. The story line, if you can call it that was never really established. It was nothing morning than snipits of various charters lines which really went nowhere. New potentially interesting characters were introduced but they were never really connected to the story line in any meaningful way. The chapters were two pages long and resembled notes for ideas which were never put together or developed. Ms. Cronwell's writings have evolved into dark tales of the seriously mentally ill rather than on Ms. Scarpetta's talents as a forensic pathologist. Too bad I was really looking forward to a good read, this book was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomniac???????? This is the book for you.","review":"Ok, let me preface by saying that I swore I would NEVER EVER buy another Cornwell novel after the last 2 extremely disappointing reads. BUT, in a moment of stupidity, weakness and boredom, I picked up BLOW FLY. You know how they say never go shopping when you're hungry cuz you'll end up buying crap you don't need???Another painfully slow, slapped together and somewhat confusing novel by Ms. EGO maniac. Question.....How could Hairboy just walk out of prison if he was supposedly rendered blind from the formalin? So many questions, so little plot.C'mon Patty, spare us....save a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, disappointing, LONG","review":"I waited and waited for this book to come out. I wish I had waited some more and waited for the paperback. The last Kay S book left us hanging, and this one didn't take away that feeling. Dr. Kay is not the main character really, This book is written in 3rd person and it gets really irratating. This book has so much going on with each main character, Kay, Nic, Lucy, Marino, Benton, Jean-Bapist, Bev, and Jay there is no character development. The way the books end is disappointing, you are all set for the big take down, and bammmmmm nothing, they tell you about it as an after effect \\"oh yeah and Lucy got so and so\\" Benton says.You should have let Kay get on with her life after 6 years and kept Benton away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows: A Series","review":"I will be short. Only the serious die-hard fans will appreciate this book. The pacing is all off. The third person doesn't work here. I found the different storylines and storytelling confusing and distracting. This is second-rate at best and a trend in poor storytelling. All that is happening is so unreal and an insult to the reader! This book blows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - 0 starts I was forced to add 1 * b/c of site.","review":"Coming off the ending of The Last Precinct three years ago, I could not wait for the Scarpetta series to start again. After reading the first 100 pages of Blow Fly I could not wait for it to end. I finished the novel in hopes that it would get better but it only got worse. The big problem with this book is that Scarpetta is in it about 40 of the 465 pages and as a reader, I felt jilted. The story seemed rushed, no focus, and unbelievable which is surprising for Cornwell. I hope she comes up with another Scarpetta novel quickly to fix the mistakes of this one. I would not even recommend taking the book out in the library in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell is not at her best","review":"I'd been looking so forward to this book. But when I got to the end of the novel, I wondered where the rest of the chapters were. I felt that as a reader, I was shorted. True, there were some great aspects of the book, in particular, bringing together older characters and introdcuing some new ones. But for the most part, the book left me hanging. Some pretty big events happen at the end of the book, but there were few explanations and no closure at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read her early books--not this one!","review":"So very unlike Cornwell's earlier works. This one has no likeable characters, a rotten ending, cruelty to animals, is depressing and you'll dislike everyone in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly didn't fly with me.","review":"I am an avid Kay Scarpetta fan, have read every book, but this one may stop the process. I found it disjointed and leaving huge gaps in the plot. And the characters have changed too much in this book to feel they are the same people I've grown to know and care about over many years. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book","review":"Loved it! Much better than the last Scarpetta novel. I think that Patricia Cornwell did a great job. I have followed all of the Scarpetta novels and even though I loved them there were some that bordered on mediocrity. Glad to say that this one isn't one of them. I wish everyone would read the books prior to the reviews because some of them are just off the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Patricia Cornwell really write Blowfly","review":"I have read all of Ms. Cornwell's Scarpetta novels and this one was so different that I am convinced that she did not even write it. First instead of writing in the first person as with all her other works this one is in the third person.The story is chopped up into very small paragraphs so there is very little cohesion and the plot is paper thin. It reads like a bad soap opera with the return of Benton Wealey who was supposed to be killed. Lucy became a cold blooded murderer and Marino has gone from abrasive but with solid substance to a foul mouthed wreak with not much character and not much to do with this book. Scarpetta herself was cold clinical paper cutout the only conscession to humanity was the addition of a dog. The most annoying thing and so like Ms. Cornwell's earlier works was the vauge hints of relationships. Very disapointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, Patricia,.... You can do better!!","review":"I'm a die-hard loyal Scarpetta fan, but I must say I'm a little disappointed in this book.When I hard Kay Scarpetta was coming back, I marked my calendar for release date, & began counting the days!As I started reading I kept waiting for that \\"magic\\" hook to come along-you know the one that grabs you and won't allow you to put the book down, keeps you up all night- but it never came, but kept reading till the end. As I turned the last page, it was like \\"what,.....thats it?!\\"Try again, Patricia.You left Chandonne open, let's do better this time, let us see some of the passion that Kay feels on a case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...its ok?","review":"I've been a devoted fan of Cornwell's work from the beginning. With that said, I thought this book should never have been written. The way she brought past events into the storyline made no sense and the characters were superficial. How do you explain the tie-up of the Talley & Chandonne characters? How does Lucy go from being a computer geek to somekind of superspy vigilante? And Marino..he used to have some really good depth to his character, now it seems like he's comic relief. Would someone please explain how can you bring back a character like Wesley on such a lame premise?!? C'mon Cornwell, stay true to your fans, don't just write a book to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-Think the Plot Patricia","review":"I was so disappointed in this book that, after finishing the last few pages, I immediately began lookin on the internet for reviews and other reader's comments. I borrowed the book, so I don't have the same buyer's remorse that other readers have exhibited, but I certainly will not pay good money for a Scarpetta novel in the future.I knew I was in trouble with the plot, when the story line was still unraveling and I only had a few pages left to read. What a mish-mash of characters, unbeleivable events and unresolved issues.Ms. Cornwell: Get your act back together and give us what we love to read.....Kay Scarpetta working on interesting forensic problems. Enough with the Chandonne family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointing Cornwell Ramble","review":"Just BORROW the book - I keep wondering what the hell has happened to the finely plotted and wonderfully detailed novels of the Patricia Cornwell of the past. This one is not quite as bad as the last two - Black Notice and The Last Precinct. But the Hurry-Up ending smacks so much of Poirot in the drawing room finale, it's hardly worth the bother.Do you not have an editor, Miss Cornwell?Do you think your name alone will sell your books?Do you think we are stupid?Too bad - another once-fine writer has gone over the edge into unbelievable plots, superficial wand-waving, and too much teen-age-girl-angst-type dialog. GET A GRIP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"BLOW FLY\\" blows","review":"As a serious fan of Patricia Cornwell's \\"Scarpetta\\" books, I looked forward to reading \\"BLOW FLY.\\" Unfortunately, I feel my money was wasted. The story drug on...page after page...chapter after chapter...only to have it hurry up and close--with all kinds of loose ends!! This is NOT the way to write a novel!! All the familiar characters have dramatically shifted in temperment and even sexual proclivity (Lucy is fooling around with her new \\"partner\\" who had previously tried to rape her when she was having a clandestine lesbian affair?? come on!!!). The twist of having Benton masterminding provocative letters being sent to spur the protagonists to action is interesting--but why reveal Benton's non-death and manipulations so early in what appears to be a continuing saga?? Really--the way this book was written makes it a big YUCK--not the best selling crime fiction we have come to expect from Ms. Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"So I am not the only one?","review":"I was beginning to think I was the only one that did not enjoy Blow Fly. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! I was waiting for months for the next Kay Scarpetta only to be let down. This novel is extremely hard to follow, it jumps around too much and the characters are so pathetic...what happened to Kay Scarpetta??...a woman so on the ball, so sure of herself. I should have read the reviews before I bought this one. Hopefully Patricia Cornwell will get back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next up","review":"This is the next book in the series that I was missing. I plan to start reading it today, and am thankful it arrived quickly and in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"This reads like a novelist's first effort. It's badly written and badly edited. Unnecessary, speculative descriptions of characters that appear for only a paragraph feel like padding, while Scarpetta herself is almost an incidental character. Lucy is a mess. Teasing her partner? Annoying. Murdering another character? Unconscionable, even if he is a scum bag. Cornwell's knowledge is starting to grate; her description of a helicopter pre-flight routine doesn't add to the story, it feels like she's showing off. And the plot? Absurd. (Please tell me why Lucy the technological wizard immediately thinks Chandonne has escaped when he supposedly calls her from in front of her building; can't she call the Texas prison to check? Ridiculous!) I wish Cornwell hadn't published this book; it shows a certain level of scorn for her many fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"The ending falls far short of what you'd hope for - the Scarpetta novels are often a pleasant (if reading about murder can be pleasant!) way to pass an afternoon, engrossed in an engaging story. In this novel, Cornwell weaves together the lives of various characters, allowing the reader to see into the mind of the killers from the beginning. Given all that we \\"see\\" as readers early on, one would expect to see all of the results unfold in front of our eyes (in words and, therefore, in our imaginations): not so. If you don't mind a disappointing ending, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Patterson instead","review":"I am disappointed I choose to read this before reading the new Patterson book. At least he can keep a character fresh and interesting. This book is awful. Patricia you are the reason I started reading mysteries. Hopefully you have already started the next Scarpetta novel and will renew our faith in you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor (and a plot, and better characters and...)","review":"Quite simply the worst installment yet of the Scarpetta series. When will Mrs. Corwall get over her fascination with the Chardonne family and get back to writing the forensic thrillers that made the Scarpetta series such a hit? The latest Wolfman reprise gave hope in that promised to be the last...until the final pages where it's obvious that he will reappear in a future novel. Scarpetta, save us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Actually, my title pretty much says it all.This book was an absolute bore and I found myself skimming it.I will not give any \\"suspense\\" away but there are developments here that should be beneath the author. If Cornwell wants to continue the Scarpetta series, she owes her readers better than this. Perhaps its time to \\"retire\\" Kay Scarpetta and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness for libraries","review":"Cornwell's writing lacks depth in this book ... the book is disjointed and the writing is simple. After plodding along for awhile, I took the book back to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"By far her worst effort. The plot comes across as a poor takeoff from the Dallas TV series of the 70's. Like the TV series it lacks creativity and imagination. Most unfortunately her main characters Scarpetta, Lucy and Marino seem as shallow images in this novel. They never seem to come to life, nor does 'Blow Fly'. The idea that Benton is still alive, and that Lucy, Marino and Senator Lord know, but that Kay is kept in the dark seems so far fetched. Much like Bobby coming back to life on Dallas, and everything in between some sort of dream. Skip this book. I enjoyed her earlier novels but the last four have definitely been duds, and this one is at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the _ _ _ _ did I just read!","review":"I finished \\"Blow Fly\\" last night and was really disappointed. The first 80% of the book did nothing but dredge up old characters and plots. There was very little if any forensic work which is the reason I read Cornwell. The ending felt like I fell over a cliff. When I read the last page, I wondered \\"What the (blank) did I just read?\\". Patricia Cornwell will now join James Patterson as two authors I will not subject myself to until they clean up their acts! If you like a good forensic read, check out Kathy Reichs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filth","review":"Speaking of books, last night I tried to listen to that Patricia Cornwell book, Blow Fly. It's the most disgusting thing I ever heard. I listened to the first CD and thought it surely gets better, but the second was worse. I hit the stop button so hard that I nearly knocked the player off the night stand. And to think there are 13 CDs in all. I can't believe people read such filth. I would donate it to the library, but I wouldn't want anyone to know I had it in my possession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother . . . .","review":"Either Cornwell has lost her touch, or is off her meds. This Scarpetta novel is as bad as Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross.The ever-changing inner perspective of the characters (Kay, Lucy, Marino, Benton, Jean Baptiste) was just annoying. I am surprised we didn't get a chapter from the dog's point of view. The plot didn't seem to going anywhere, then all the loose ends were hastily tied up in the last 20 pages.A lot of the plot devices were just plain stupid (the kid and crooked US attorney \\"just happen\\" to be on the plane with Kay - yeah right!)Someone do a post-mortem - because the Kay Scarpetta we loved is dead. She's been killed off by her egotistical creator. This boodk at the top of the bestseller lists, but that is due to Cornwell's past reputation and shouldn't be taken as a indication that one should waste time reading this piece of tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big fan letdown...again!!","review":"I almost stopped reading on page one when I realized Cornwell carried the use of the third person narrative into this book, too. It did not work well; it makes me think she's not writing these books anymore. And, when what's produced is ridiculous and boring, it solidifies that thought even more. I was surprised and confused about Lucy coming on to Rudy and that Scarpetta was barely in the book at all. I don't understand how intelligent readers are to accept that the Wolfman just strolls out of prison...blind, on death row, high security, etc. Ridiculous. I was tired of that character when he first appeared and am dreading the next book where I'm sure he'll take center stage. Also, to so quickly kill Bev without much story, to not share Jay Talley's ending with us, and to wrap up the story in about three pages? What a letdown. As a book editor myself, I am stunned that something like this went to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kay Scarpetta, R.I.P.","review":"I don't know how long I can keep on buying Cornwell's follies. First there was Isle of Dogs -- perhaps the worst book EVER. Now there's this Kay Scarpetta book with almost no Kay Scarpetta, and even the meager appearances don't ring true. Here's a frightening thought: Cornwell has lost touch with her own main character. Lucy commits cold-blooded murder in this book, and Kay is OK with that. My old pals Kay and Marino used to go to any length to catch the bad guys. Now I can't tell them apart.So not only is the main character MIA, but there's nothing to like. The plot is nonsense, Lucy's secret agent antics are pointless, Benton's resurrection just means we're in for more bad relationship scenes, and it's like Kay suddenly drank Love Potion No. 9: everyone loves or admires or lusts after her.The longer you dwell on this book, the worse you feel. Nothing adds up, nothing makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a horrible book","review":"Could not even finish this book. Written in the 3rd person it is very hard to follow.I have waited for this book for several months.Patricia Cornwell is a much better writer than this book portrays. I wish I would have taken the time to read the online reviews before I spent my hard earned cash on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback or don't even bother","review":"I have read all the previous Kay Scarpetta novels by Patricia Cornwell and I was really disappointed with this one. After I finished the book, which was tedious, I had no idea what the book was about or why it was written. The characters were disjointed, storyline disconnected... not like her other novels. I had a difficult time plodding through this book, but I kept waiting for all the loose ends to be tied up (or at least make sense). Unfortunately, that never happened. I should have waited for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic...what's wrong with you, Patricia Cornwell...?!","review":"This was perhaps the worst of the Kay Scarpetta books, and I consider myself a loyal fan of Patricia Cornwell's. The characters are disjointed and the plot lurches from one improbable scenario to the next. The introduction of the character Nic(olette) Robillard is purposeless, as her development is so stunted I felt no sympathy whatsoever even though this woman is seeking justice for her mother's murder while simultaneously trying to raise a small son on her own since her husband abandoned them. While it was indeed fun to revisit the horrific brothers Chandonne and the palpably nasty Bev Kiffin, the last 10 pages of this novel are clearly a hastily, poorly thought-out, thrown-together attempt at bringing closure to the entire mess. It's so hurriedly concluded I literally felt betrayed by the time I got to the last page. I'm not bothering to read any further Scarpetta tales after this debacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I bothered to finish the book...","review":"I kept thinking it would get better and I gave her the benefit of the doubt, because I enjoyed previous books by Cornwell. But I agree with others that are also tired of the wolf man character, and I missed the forensic science piece that always made her books so compelling. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Favorite Author, But...","review":"This book fails to live up to the standards we have come to expect from Patricia Cornwell. It is as if someone else wrote this book. Perhaps after the aptly named \\"Isle of Dogs\\" and the non-fiction Jack the Ripper book, she lost touch with Scarpetta and how to write her.Cornwell abandoned her usual style of writing her hero in the first person, and in so doing lost her focus. Gone are the things that made Kay Scarpetta so compelling--her investigation skills, her caring for those close to her, her cooking.Simply as a work of fiction, it is a book that spends 400 pages on its set-up, and only a few paragraphs on the payoff. This is not a good book in any sense. It seems that Cornwell may be spending too much time on \\"Prime Time Live\\", and not enough on what made her so popular. Until then, the reaser may want to spend time reading Lisa Scottoline instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters, poorly tied together, no flow at all","review":"The second installment of poorly written books by Patricia Cornwell. I had hoped the last novel was just her reaction to a contract that she was forced to uphold. Perhaps that is still the case. Find someone else to read for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch, it hurts","review":"Reading this book was painful. I had to force myself to keep turning the pages, which is quite a change from earlier Cornwell novels, when they almost seemed to turn themselves. Halfway through I was ready to just put it down, so I came here to read the reviews and see if there might be something coming up in the second half that would make forcing my way through this somehow worthwhile, but everyone else's reviews were absolutely correct: This book is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Patricia Cornwell?","review":"Life is too short to read this book.I am so disappointed with the latest Scarpetta installment that I have taken to writing this - my first ever online review - as a warning to other Amazon users NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK. Do not part with your hard-earned cash. It's not worth it. Patricia Cornwell - you used to be great. But without a doubt this is the worst novel I have ever read.PS I only gave it one star because there isn't a zero star option."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money...","review":"I used to love Kay Scarpetta but after this book... It is so bad that I can't even finish it... I put it in my garage sale box. Her non-Scarpetta novels were so bad that they belong there too. I am really so disappointed. I think Patricia Cornwell is tired, burned out, or lazy. She has definitely lost it. I can't believe she allowed this book to be published. It's an embarrassment to her and those who take the time to read it. She made her money on the Scarpetta character so I guess all is not lost for her. 0 stars is not an option... should be... even minus stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I've obviously missed something big regarding Patricia Cornwell's relationship with Scarpetta. Why so much narrative rather than action and dialogue? Why the muddy plot? Is this Cornwell's attempt to drive readers away from Scarpetta so that Cornwell doesn't have to write about her anymore? I'm confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I was given this book as a birthday present from someone who knew I liked writers like Tess Gerritsen and Lisa Gardner. Having never read any of the previous 'Scarpetta' novels, I will confess that I was somewhat in the dark about the history of the characters. Unfortunately, I could find no characters that I cared about or were the least bit interested in. I was also given another 'Scarpetta' novel to read, but I think I am going to pass. BLOW FLY was absolutely unreadable. One of the worst reading projects I have ever attempted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore","review":"Well, I was deeply disappointed and the only reason I finished this book was because I kept thinking it was going to explode in the end - well it did - right up in my face! I don't like how suddenly we are reading about Kay in the 3rd person, I like being in her head - not just 'watching' her. I actually went back and re-read an earlier novel, just to fall in love wtih the author's writings again."},{"rating":"1","title":"An imposter must have written this!","review":"I started reading the Scarpetta novels in order a couple months ago and finally got to Blow Fly. Upon starting this book, I immediately felt disconnected from the character of Kay. All of a sudden Kay is now just 'Scarpetta' and is treated like a background character. The feelings and thoughts are not there in this book, it is like someone else stepped in to write this one. What should have been an explosive revalation in the book was barely even a wimper and was casually mentioned like what the author had for breakfast. The end was awful too. It was like Cornwell got tired of writing and then just wrapped things up in a few paragraphs. I hope like heck that the next book in the series is back to the original format, this one was a definite downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific crimes and abrupt ending!","review":"I've loved Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels for a few years. I was excited to pick up Blow Fly but had a tough time with all the abundance of horrific details of the crimes. The twists and turns the story was taking had me spellbound yet at times confused. But as I neared the last 5 pages of the book, I wondered how the book was going to end and tie up all the ends...and boy, was I on target and VERY unhappy with the ending! Benton knew the Dard family and associates and they didn't know who he was? And he happened to kill one twin in the wine cellar while the other twin gets away so easily? Give me a break...it all ended too quickly, too conveniently when there was so much wonderful promise...what a huge disappointment. And now after reading reviews of her next 2 books, Trace & Predator, I'm not sure I can stand more disappointment and gore through Scarpetta's eyes. I think I'll be looking for a new author who is more consistent...sorry Patricia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I'd have to agree that this was a major disappointment, especially after waiting so long for another Scarpetta book. I would have been willing to wait longer for a good one. After reading for what seems like forever, on all sorts of different tangents, I noticed the end of the book was getting very close and I didn't see how everything could be resolved satisfactorily in the remaining chapters. I was right. The ending comes out of nowhere, no suspense, is over before you know it, and leaves you thinking, \\"That's it? What a waste of time.\\" The whole book shakily builds up to a nothing ending. I'm glad I only borrowed this from the library, and didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put a fork in it - its dead.","review":"Briefly - Patricia Cornwell has gotten so bored with her charcters in the Scarpetta saga that she can't even put together a coherent novel. This poor excuse for a story has minimal suspense, minimal charcter development, minimal plotting, and when all else fails, PC reverts to tell us all the so-called \\"techno\\" stuff regarding ammunition, helicopters, electronic communications. Where, oh where, is the forensic discussion and plotting to unlock the mystery? Oh, I forgot. There is no mystery, there is no plot, only PC's thinly disguised contempt for her charcters. Please let the series go and don't subject us to any more of this junk. BTW, if I could, I'd give this book a negative star rating of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge disappointment...","review":"Huge disappointment in the Scarpetta series. The book seems to be loosely gathered ideas, the plot jumping all over the place.Jean-Baptiste Chardonne, on death row, suddenly contacts Scarpetta, Lucy, and Marino. He's planning some sort of show down, but what can it possibly be leading to, with him on death row? A side plot involves a chain of murders in Louisiana, which Scarpetta is called upon to assist in - but could this be some sort of manipulation, too, on Chardonne's part?Very little actual action in this book, and Scarpetta actually plays more of a supporting role than the lead. A different - but unsuccessful - venture for Cornwell.There is a huge surprise in this book, that I don't want to spoil - but I will say, that I can't understand why Scarpetta wasn't aware of it LONG before now. Extremely incredible, to me. Also, the cheap unfinished ending detracts from the book as a whole. Very dissatisfying read - sure hope the series can pick up soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Kay Scarpetta","review":"Just finished \\"Blowfly\\" after waiting 4 1/2 months to get it from the library. I read a lot about Lucy who almost seems not to be the same Lucy, and way too much about the character I didn't even like in the past novels, Jean-Baptiste Chandonne. Kay Scarpetta and Pete Marino seemed to be incidential characters. The chapters seemed to \\"hop around\\" from one character to another and I got to the point where I didn't even bother to keep it all straight. I was able to put the book down 12 pages before the end to start dinner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful effort","review":"I was so excited that there was finally a new Kay Scarpetta book by Patricia Cornwell, but after reading it the only word that comes to mind is \\"pitiful\\". What a waste of talent. This book was leaden. The well-known and normally well-drawn characters were twisted and contorted beyond recongnition. The new characters got no development, and therefore I could not have cared less if they lived or died. And the \\"surprise\\" was stupid and ill-conceived. So sad, so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Side of the Force","review":"This is just amazingly bad. Cornwell has spent way too long gazing at the Dark Side of the Force. The improbable Jean-Baptist Chandonne and his absurd family of criminal masterminds have taken over the novels. What made the Scarpetta series interesting was the forensics, and maybe with CSI This and That all over TV, Cornwell thought she should d something different, not realizing that the serial killer is a truly overworked genre.Everyone in this series is angry and out of control, not just the criminals; it's depressing, for in reality things just don't work that way. There are always sane, focused individuals who make the world work, despite the angry dysfunctionals. Cornwell has lost sight of that and of the drama in the confrontation of the competent and the others.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad excuse for writing","review":"My husband and I really agreed that it is one of the worst books we have ever read. He did not even finish it it was so porrly written. The last 40 pages or so, she just gave up and wrote a pathetic ending. So much was a stretch and made no sense. I would not recommend this to anyone, no matter how desperate you are for something to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now its offical","review":"Friends of mine have been saying for a bit now that the Scarpeta serise is done. I didn't want to belive them than I read Blowfly.Patrica Cornwell has fallen victim to \\"established Author Syndrom\\". I didn't think it could ever happen to her but I shouldn't be surprised considering how often it has happenned to others. Just to name a few Tom Clancy, Ann Rice, Stepen king and Robert Jordon. It is indeed a sad day.Overall-Not bad, just the same old same old forulmatic and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"my 2 cents","review":"In my opinion this book is borderline-acceptable, but only as a stand-alone and not as part of a series.As an installment in a serial, there are too many inconsistencies in the events reported in earlier installments versus how those same events are represented here.Also there is a shift away from the 1rst person perspective. Perhaps it is meant as a vehicle encouraging the reader to feel the same distance that perhaps Scarpetta is supposed to be feeling, but I don't like it. I'd prefer consistency.All-in-all, to me this book has the bad after-taste of a ghost-writer filling in in order to meet a deadline. That doesn't mean I won't buy and read the next one, but if the inconsistencies and the wrong feel continues in the next it will be my last Scarpetta novel purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to bad but bad enough","review":"This is so not typical. What happened. All through the book I was wondering if there was a book prior to this that can explain how the character got so depressed, ugly and just painfull to read about.And the Benton story?? That is so lame!! She better not kill him off or do some dramatic things around his character. And if it ends up Benton and Kay under witness protection together, happy ever after I am really going to faint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the Title?","review":"To save some verbage, I agree with so many of the most recent negative reviews for all the same reasons: way too many plots/characters/overlapping details/unlikely far-fetched coincidences, an ending that's far too abrubt and unbelievable, characters with whom it's hard to feel intimate, much less sympathetic (PLEASE, GIVE ME AT LEAST ONE CHARACTER I CAN CARE ABOUT AND LIKE!!!!). This book was dark, dark, dark ... and I was ashamed of myself for continuing to subject myself to wading thru the muck - tHere was no redeeming point to doing so. And, truly, why the title, BLOW FLY? The flies were one small element in one chapter early in the book. Perhaps they have some importance to the rest of the story that I was too ignorant to follow; but anyway, I don't get it. And I don't recommend this book to anyone. I'm off to read some Anne of Green Gables to get the bad taste out of my mouth...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should've Known Better","review":"This isn't the first time one of Cornwell's novels left me feeling as if she she had better things to do than to finish writing her book. Blow Fly has such a compelling title, I thought I'd give her another try. It was waste of time and money. Those wishing to read a well-written series featuring a female forensic anthropogist/consultant would be well-advised to check out Kathleen J. Reichs's Temperance Brennan series. In my opinion, Reichs's novels are everything Cornwell's are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that????","review":"HUGE disappointment! I should have known from the moment that Patricia Cornwell started referring to the main character as \\"Scarpetta\\" that something was seriously wrong with this book. Finished it only out of morbid curiousity - could this actually get worse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fly in my soup would be more enjoyable!","review":"As a fan of Patricia Cornwell, I was really disappointed by this novel. It almost seemed as if someone else wrote the book, and not Cornwell. The characters lacked their usual depth, grittiness, and familial interaction. Lucy, Marino, and Scarpetta seemed cardboard and hollow, almost one dimensional. Half of the book is spent reminding the reader of each character's history (as if we need a refresher course). This lackluster effort comes to a dismal, predictable, and incredibly speedy ending. The finale is probably the worst part of the novel, as it wraps up in about 5 pages, without a hint of suspense, drama, or thrill. Definitely not an \\"edge of your seat\\" read. Fans should skip this one and hope the next effort is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Poorly written. Plot was never developed and the novel ended abruptly. As a long time fan of the Scarpetta series, this was a tremendous disappointment. Wait for the paperback issue if you truly want to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Kay I love?","review":"I was looking forward to meeting my old friend Kay Scarpetta again, but she was a shadow of herself in this latest book. All the characters lacked their unique personalities and depth, leaving the plot flat. All the members of the Scarpetta cast were depressed and lifeless and seemed to have little true interaction with each other.The ending was particularily disappointing--a slapdash conclusion that really isn't....there's another book out there in development waiting to finish off the Chandonne's--I hope. I've gotten very tired of this plot line that has been running through several Scarpetta books. The Wolfman was never Cornwell's best villian, but he's been around the longest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pat, what happened?!?","review":"I have to agree with these other reviewers. This book was not of Patricia Cornwell's usual high quality. I was looking forward to reading a new Scarpetta novel after wading through Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed. Unfortunately this book lacked the suspense seen in previous Scarpetta novels. I thought the writing also lacked the edge I have come to expect from Ms. Cornwell. The ending was both too easy as well as unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another author meltdown","review":"I have not felt this disappointed with a book since I read Hannibel (Thomas Harris). Don't waste your money or your time on Blow Fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia! Enough with the violent porn fantasies, please!","review":"As anyone who's read her work knows, Patricia Cornwell is an exceptionally talented writer of crime novels, with a clear, distinctive, intelligent voice, and a wonderful knack for plot, character, and meticulous research. But the relentlessly sadistic musings of her various bad guys have gotten so far over the top, that they swamp the rest of the book. \\"The ultimate union with a woman is to release her, to hear her scream and moan, to cover himself with her blood...\\" blah, blah, blah. All Scarpetta seems to encounter now is the most extravagantly evil sort of cartoon psychopaths, rather than murderers with identifiable human motives. Really, it's creepy, and psychologically wearying to the reader. Patricia, please stop it. All these one and two star ratings are a message. We buy your books because we genuinely enjoy your writing, but you're better than the unmitigated dreck with which \\"Blow Fly\\" is needlessly laced."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF","review":"THIS IS NOT A KAY SCARPETTA NOVEL, AND TO SAY SO IS FALSE ADVERTISING. AS A HUGE SCARPETTA FAN, I CAN TELL Y0U THAT CORNWELL AND PUTNAM HAVE KILLED OFF KAY THROUGH THE FLIMIEST , SADDEST RIPOFF I'VE EVER READ. THIS BOOK IS TRANSPARENTLY AN ATTEMPT TO GET YOUR MONEY, AND MINE, AS SCARPETTA FANS. THE NOVEL READS SO BADLY, LACKS SUCH EXCITING FORENSICS - AND NO SOLID STORY THREAD - THAT ONE MUST ASSUME THAT CORNWELL, GIVEN HER BUSY SCHEDULE, DID NOT WRITE THIS BOOK. CHARACTERS MERELY BEAR THE FAMILIAR NAMES OF KAY AND PETE AND WESLEY BUT NOT THEIR PERSONALITIES. AND THAT THE BOOK IS IN THIRD PERSON TOTALLY DESTROYS THE UNIQUE VOICE THAT IS KAY'S. THE EDITORS AT PUTNAM HAVE TO BE HELD AS ACCOUNTABLE AS CORNWELL IN THIS GREEDY RIPOFF. KAY IS DEAD, AND I FOR ONE WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CORNWELL BOOK. EVER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipshod","review":"Looks like there was a rush to end this one without much reference to what came earlier. When we have a blind man escaping from prison by driving away, I began to suspect that the author lost track of the plot somewhere along the plot line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghostwriter???","review":"Cornwell's picture may have been on the dust jacket, but nothing about this book is typical of her writing. In all of her other books about Scarpetta, the book is written in the first person.This book is like it is being narrated, and poorly at that. Many, many paragraphs/sentences have no flow. The transition from \\"The Last Precinct\\" to this book made no sense. Thinking maybe I missed something along the way, I went back and read the last four chapters of \\"Last Precinct\\". Should have just read that book again and not wasted the many hours spent reading this one. My one star is generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster and confusing","review":"I had not read any reviews before I got this book, but after I struggled through the first 1/3 of the book and was totally confused, I came back to Amazon and read reviews. I wish I had done that first, I would have saved time and money. Long a fan of PC, I thought I missed something--like a book or too. I didn't like the way she hopped back and forth in the story between characters--I couldn't stay focused. I hope that her next story is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"With 20 pages to go in the book, I was sick to think that this must just be part one of a long, confusing, annoying 2-book sequence. Then, boom,it was over. The auhor must have hit her editor's deadline or she, too,was so sick of the book that she just wanted to end it as quickly as possible. All action takes place \\"off screen\\". 9 out of 10 plot twists lead nowhere. WAY too much time is spent finding out what a psychopath is thinking. This was the WORST book I have read in years. I cannot convey how bad this one is. Avoid... Or, just read the last 10 pages - the first 400 don't have anything to do with them anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO WROTE THIS BOOK???!!!","review":"I haven't even completed 10 chapters in this book... I'm not sure I can finish it. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I am so glad that I got it from the library.The first thing I noticed and it is HUGE, HUGE, HUGE... Why did Cromwell go from writing Scarpetta in first person singular to third person? Very, very disturbing... I'm having a hard time reading this book for that alone. Did she really write this book, why the sudden change?And I know they BIG SECRET (I was told), what utter and complete TRASH. I haven't like the last few books. The themes have been off the wall, unrealistic, and sometimes downright unreadable.What happened to the much honored author of yesterday? Is she gone forever? Will she be forever ill with the fatal \\"New York Times Best Seller\\" disease, which seems to affect most good writers? Why do authors listen to editors and/or publishing houses and forget their loyal fan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I thought it was a great departure from earlier novels. The switch from first to third person allowed far greater insight into the various characters in the book. Her books were becoming very formulaic, in my opinion, and I think this helped reignite my interest in reading more in the Kay Scarpetta series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her usual work","review":"I keep hoping Patricia Cornwall will rebound and start writing the kinds of books she used to write when I first started reading her. Kay Scarpetta was one of the most dynamic women to hit the fiction scene and I could not get enough of her during the early years. But perhaps time has weakened her and Cornwell, too. She just isn't as clever as she used to be.I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries. You simply do not get enough twists and turns and unpredictable plot points here. You get a lot of formula and the same thing you see in many mystery novels. I would really suggest you go back and start with her earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Cornwell Intentionally Alienating Her Fans?","review":"Patricia Cornwell has apparenty become too successful to put much effort into her books anymore. The characters are so inconsistently written from one chapter to the next (especially Lucy and Marino) that its hard to believe the same person wrote every chapter. Marino was a promising character throughout the Scarpetta series, although Cornwell never quite got his tone right. In this book,he is reduced to a pathetic, imbecilic loser, and thoroughly unlikeable. Lucy has become totally unbelievable, as has another character that has morphed into a \\"supercop\\" more appropriate to a James Bond story than a Kay Scarpetta mystery. And Kay herself has been marginalized.The story plods along, dull and grim, until suddenly ending in a couple of dozen pages, as if even Cornwell cannot take this story anymore and is desperate to see it done with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"One of the most disappointing books I've ever struggled to finish. Characters that had been nicely developed in previous books were portrayed poorly. I believe, though I can't be sure, that there is an attempt here to tie up loose ends from a prior book. I didn't feel anything was tied up, just dusted off so that there could be another book about them. Yes, there is a clear indication that another volume about the Chandonne family will be forthcoming.No stars at all if that were possible. There was absolutely NOTHING worthwhile here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book.(I have collected every one). I felt that the whole book was a huge disappointment in every way. Expecting the reader to believe that Kay's nearest and dearest would have treated her in such a fashion was laughable. Patricia, you should have let sleeping dogs lie. My advise - borrow it from the library. You will have wasted your money if you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down, at first.........","review":"I agree with those who reviewed this and asked, \\"what happened to the ending?\\" I too was disappointed and toward the end, was thinking, how could there possibly be only a few pages left when the story just got really good? So I give it 2 stars because it started out really good, but it ended abruptly. I also agree with others who state that Scarpetta is a dark depressing figure, Marino is a pathetic overweight person and Lucy, in this one, she comes on to her partner who is a male, so this just adds some confusion and hypocrcy. Overall though, I have thoroughly enjoyed Patricia Cornwell novels, but I am left confused and thinking I need to reread to figure out how we got from point a to point b...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Ok I am totally confused by the whole Benton thing, it's worse than a soap opera! It being written in the 3rd person was bizarre since none of the other Scarpetta's are. She has set it up for the next book but poorly done. I am a die hard Patricia Cornwell fan but this book had no passion to it... reminiscent of Un-Natural Exposure. I am very disappointed and see I am not the only one! Better book next time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative and disgusting","review":"The villains of this piece, the Chandonnes, are as appalling as they are impossible to believe. I guess this shouldn't be a surprise, since the title is taken from a maggot. Cornwell is far more fascinated by the Chandonnes than I ever have been. The manipulative part was far more infuritating. These characters seem to come from a different series. Scarpetta is so remote she seems comatose. Lucy's sexuality slides up and down the continuum -- difficult to accept from such an out and proud lesbian. Marino is his old self, confronting his feelings for Kay (at least internally) with uncommon candor. He's the only one that feels familiar. And THE plot twist (I won't give it away) is so manipulative that I feel as though I've been played like a violin. In all, an unpleasant experience. I agree with the previous reviewer who encourages the talented Ms. Cornwell to just move on, get past the Chandonnes, and give us a credible story we will actually care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"I could have lived with the narrative switch to 3rd person for Cornwell's protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, and I could have lived with the resurrection of Benton Wesley if his actions in this book had been the least bit believable. But I can't find any redeeming value in the absolutely ridiculous \\"plot\\" that results in the escape of the Wolfman. There is nothing remotely believable in Blow Fly.This book makes me wonder if Patricia Cornwall died and some totally untalented writer tried to cash in by cobbling together a rehash of her previous novels.Don't waste your money or your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!!!","review":"This book is awful! I found myself wondering if it had been ghost written by someone who hadn't bothered reading the other books in the series. The characters are caricatures of themselves, and the story line and \\"ending\\" are ridiculous. I have never written a review before, but I was moved to do so by the sheer awfulness of this book. Patricia Cornwell can, and should, do better. She owes more to her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited three years for this?","review":"I was a big fan of PC, but sadly she was all over the map with this story line. The ending was abrupt and left far to many unanswered questions. It seemed as if PC was getting tired of her own story toward the end and just pulled the plug. PC is more talented than what was projected in this book. If this was my first time reading a Scarpetta novel, it would have been my last. I loved her work in the past and will give her one more chance, but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad as James Patterson","review":"I agree with all the reviews that said this book sucks. Instead of Serial Killer, this book can be summarized as \\"Serial Sequels\\". The only book in recent memory worse than Blow Fly is Big Bad Wolf by James Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Patricia Conrwell and was excited to see this book come out. However it just isn't up to her usual standard. I agree with the other posters, it seems like the end was hurried and just thrown together. I think the ending could have been better. So what if it they would have stretched the book out another 50 pages to finish it right. I read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in two days. I could have handled a few more pages to wrap this book up right."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"I read Isle of Dogs and thought it was the worst book that Cornwell ever wrote. Move over Isle, Blow Fly has you beaten by a mile.At least I was able to finish Isle of Dogs, but I will never finish this one.I wish I had read all the reviews first at this site before I wasted my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: Disappointing","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell, I began reading her books because I enjoy thrillers and live in VA, making it easy to follow along. But the last few Scarpetta books have gone down hill. The latest, Blow Fly was horrible. I could normally get through a Cornwell novel in a day, it took me 2 weeks to get through Blow Fly and then the end felt like it was rushed, as though she was pushing to make a deadline. If this is the kind of Scarpetta novels we can expect in the future, she should just save it, I won't buy the next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is garbage","review":"This is the first Scarpetta novel I've read since Cruel and Unusual several years ago. It stinks. The plot is totally implausible, and none of the characters is developed to any degree. I felt as if all of the important action (with one major exception about halfway through) happened before the book began or offstage. In addition, Cornwell seems to have got into the habit of suffusing every scene between two women with erotic tension. Yet even that theme, if it is one, goes nowhere.Cornwell was either under incredible time pressure when she wrote this or has become sick of her characters. Her editor should have sent this one back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"Always anxiously waiting for her latest novel, I was truly disappointed with this incredibly bad novel. Sorry, it was a disjointed story with an ultimate insult when he walks out of deathrow? So predictable and not even believable. The last two books I read were so disappointing. It'll take a really inspiring tale to get me to buy another one of her novels. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. As a big Scarpetta fan, I was really excited to get the latest installment. Looks like it will probably be my last. It seemed to me that the book spent most of the time leading up to something big and then within two pages wrapped everything up without details or specifics. It is hard for me to believe that this is the same author who has entertained and fascinated me for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time reading this one","review":"I read and loved all her books a lot.

I can't believe PC wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"Who wrote \\"Blow Fly?\\" Not Cornwell. She must have people writting for her and not paying any attention. I hate to think that she would have made such tremendous errors. Wish I had time to reread it and make notes, but the glaring ones are 1)they have a blind man driving 2)Why does Marino drive to New Orleans in his shape instead of flying? 3) They hear about the missing woman on the radio but none of them hear about the prison escape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I have been a fan of Patricia Corwell and the super Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Kay, for years; however, I found this book to be a real disappointment. Based on this performance it is clear that Ms. Corwell has run out of plot lines and should retire Dr. Kay to the annals of literature. Blow Fly skips between characters at a frenetic pace and within its pages Ms. Cornwell has succeeded in nothing more than continuing to portray the characters in her books as superheroes rather than normal people that readers can identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"was this really written by patricia Cornwell???","review":"I have been a big fan of all the Kay Scarpetta series in the past,but this book was so way off the mark, it was very hard to keep myself reading it in case it improved along the way.It didn't.The whole style of writing was different,poor farfetched storylines,no depth in the characters,it really seemed hard to believe that this was written by the same author as the other great books in the series.It seemed to jump around a lot as well,as though there has been a missing novel in between!!Since when has Lucy been into boys?The last few novels she has been portrayed as a strictly girls only type of gal,now she is having sex when she feels like it with her work partner?Bizarre?Marino's character so was different i just couldn't get my head around these people.This book was so not worth the read,i was disappointed ++++++++++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Save your time and your money.

Lucy who loves her aunt and is driven to murder in this book so that her aunt can be reunited with the \\"love of her life,\\" has totally went off the deep end. And wouldn't you think her and Dan would have talked about the dead Benson is previous books, seeing as how know everything that they stood against before they are willing to throw to the wind for this reunion? I really had a hard time getting past the character shifts to enjoy the story. I found myself actually being drawn to the secondary characters more because of this shift. And as for the ending, I agree with most of the other readers, where is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to my favorite author?","review":"I am so dissapointed in Blow Fly. It seems like P.C. rushed thru the writing of this book. I am only 3/4 of the way thru and I can't wait to be done with it. The content is very graphic and violent and is not the creative work we are used to from P.C. There is no character development, because she is recycling the old characters, the chapters are only 2 to 2 pages long which makes the book very choppy and there is no \\"meat\\" to the storyline.I hope P.C. has a better book in the works. I used to wait with baited breath for her latest novel to come out and would shell out the $$ for the hardcover. I think I'll wait for her next one to come out on paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"After spending three days reading this book, I simply cannot tell you how annoyed I was at the ending and the book in general without foaming at the mouth. Of all the lazy ass, stupid, arrogant ways to end a book. I'm so grateful this was a free book club book, otherwise I'd be utterly pissed if I shelled out the full price for admission.Who in their right mind thinks the reader will not be upset if you allow most of the action to occur off the page, while leaving major story threads dangling?This book was poorly planned, poorly written, and so shortchanged fans that I can't imagine myself ever reading another book in the series. For my part, this book is the end of Scarpetta's journey.I wanted to leave zero stars for this book, but unfortunately Amazon won't let you post without a star rating of at least one, which is far more generous than I feel at the moment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bomb!","review":"Patricia, did someone hold a gun to your head forcing you to write this drivel? I've been a diehard fan since your very first book; but the last several Scarpetta novels have gone from bad to worst. When I saw that there were only a few pages left of Blow Fly, I assumed I'd gotten a defective copy since there was no way all the various story lines could be wrapped up satisfactorily. Well, they weren't. Bang, bang! Everyone's dead. Benton is alive again, and all is forgiven by Kay.Please take your time and write a good book next time, or don't waste our time or dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good One","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly.

The characters are all disjointed and isolated from each other. It's too grisly - I really don't want to read about women being terrorized, chopped up and used for alligator bait. There are too many plot lines and most of them are ridiculously braided together in the last few pages. Kay Scarpetta is a gifted forensic pathologist - if Patricia Cornwell (or whoever wrote this book) is tired of this idea, then let her create a new character - but don't change horses in the middle of the stream.Patricia Cornwell has a very vivid imaginiation. If she keeps up with this drivel, she's going to have to imagine that I'm still buying her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got the outline-where is the book??","review":"Such a disappointment-a sketchily told story, not filled in at all, jumps all over the place, a lot of disjointed scenes that don't add to the story at all.

My dog tried to eat it, but even she gave up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly another Dallas dream","review":"I have read EVERY Kay Scarpetta/Cornwell book and enjoyed every one EXCEPT \\"Blow Fly\\". The critics ARE RIGHT this time... the book is boring & is not up to the quality that Cornwell is/was known for. Then when her boyfriend, who was supposedly killed in a previous book, reappears live and well---reminded me of the dream episode from Dallas. ie: when you run out of story lines, bring back a dead character! Don't they do that on soap operas, too? If you do decide to read it, it can easily be skimmed by skipping whole pages to get to 2 or 3 interesting parts.This book should be on the shelf with cheap romance novels. I am hoping \\"Trace\\" is better...I'm going to read the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell has lost her way...","review":"I was so excited for the new Scarpetta novel, but this book reads like a bad soap opera!

Just not good!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lab rat reads again","review":"I agree with 95per cent of the reviews here. This book was very bad and I really did not want to give it one star.

Does Cornwell just live on her laurels these days? None of her later novels reach the quality of her earlier books. In Blowfly there is too much of an effort to mix all of her earlier characters, and this does not work.Sorry all this has happened to an author I use to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big let down","review":"This novel was written so different than her other Scarpetta novels. A big dissapointment. Too many story lines going on. Too much , too fast, even too little. I have all the novels and was so excited to get my hands on this one, but due to tight finances, waited until I could find it in a thrift store, which I did, for $1.99, and I am so glad I didn't pay full price! I would have wanted a refund! Patricia, don't make the same mistake on the next one, if there is a next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I am a long time Patricia Cornwell fan and have read all her books. I was looking forward to the return of K. Scarpetta in BLOW FLY but this is a dull mess. The story jumps around, leaving loose ends everywhere. The plot, if you can call it that is thin, senseless, and totally unbelievable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeble attempt by author to redeem herself","review":"I was a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell (mainly because of her character Scarpetta) until she wrote the worst book ever written - Isle of Dogs. I vowed I would never waste another dime on her books. I borrowed Blow Fly only because it was a Scarpetta novel. After reading the first few very depressing chapters, I realized I no longer cared about her characters. I skimmed the next half, and only began to take an interest (albeit minor) in the old gang in the last few chapters.I've read my last Cornwell book. Even though she didn't resolve the characters and plot, I'm resolved I'm not going to waste any more time reading anything by Patricia Cornwell. How in the world does she continue to get featured by book clubs???? - obviously they don't get advanced copies.Amazon clearly needs a rating below 1 star - I think a 'rotten egg' rating would be appropriate here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"Even though this book wasn't what I'd been waiting for; I WANTED SCARPETTA! it was a compelling but simple read. To many questions were answered to quickly and others left you hanging. Ms. Cornwell what were you thinking? This book isn't one of your better Dr Kay books. If you are preparing us for a Last Precint series just make a public anouncement.Yes, you do need to read this book if you're a fan. No, you don't need it in hard cover, unless you buy it used. When the sequel comes out I'm waiting a year for the paperback edition.Disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"After considerable thought, I have come to the conclusion that Cornwell did not write this book. I can't fathom how as good an author as she, who has written so many very good books in this series, could come up with such a dog. This book plain stinks!It has no flowing continuity, but jumps back and forth and around to too many different unimportant characters. All her previous books of this series I found I had much difficulty in putting it down; this book, when I put it down, I wanted to leave it there. I read about 40% of the book and floored it. Patricia, write your own books!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I guess some readers just don't get it.","review":"Although I read these reviews frequently, I am now (for the first time) prompted to write! I want to scream, \\"It's the characters, stupid!\\" As a huge Cornwell/Scarpetta fan, I was leary about reading this book due to the poor reviews. Admittedly, this one seems to have a \\"style\\" different from the ones in the past, the focus being on the characters more than usual. (Usually, the focus is on the \\"action.\\") I really thought Cornwell did a fine job here. I was glued to the book like I usually am to a Cornwell/Scarpetta story. So I respectfully disagree with the negative reviews. For the first time, I'm glad I didn't adhere to the advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe people didn't like this book....","review":"I MEAN COME ON!!!! BENTON IS ALIVE! LUCY IS WITH MEN! MARINO FINALLY ADMITS HIS LOVE FOR SCARPETTA! JAY TALLEY IS CHOPPING UP WOMEN IN THE BAYOU!!! WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LOVE ABOUT THIS BOOK? I think that people need to get over the old Scarpetta. The series was getting redundant and Cornwell finally shook things up. You people are so afraid of change that it is sickening. No one stays at a job their whole life! The book was good and you people need to get over yourselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whose fantasy is scarpetta living?","review":"One wonders whether Cornwell is getting bored with her own life. Writing is invention, not acting out! Get with it, PC, and bring back the old Kay! Forget about mooning over old lovers. The whole business with Wesley was never quite believable anyway. And what in the world is happening to Lucy? She is metamorphosing into an adult Kay, but showing psychopathic tendencies. Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coincidence abounds in recycled plot","review":"Long a fan of Patricia Cornwell's character, Kay Scarpetta, and her adventures through numerous novels, this book disappointed me. No need to waste one's time reading this book of recycled characters, recycled plots and coincidence. Pick up earlier books in the Scarpetta series and enjoy the character and the author at their zeniths."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I wonder what the heck happened to my favorite characters. I've been an avid follower of the Scarpetta series and it just breaks my heart to see the downfall of one of my most loved fictional characters- Kay Scarpetta. I hate Blow Fly!!! After The Last Precinct I couldn't wait for the follow up but then Blow Fly turned out to be a dismay. What happened to Lucy? She used to be very inspiring but in this latest book her character seemed shallow and ineffective. There's not an iota of thrill and suspense in this book - a far cry from the previous Scarpetta novels that smack of chilling and riveting scenes that made my hands shake while reading in the wee hours of the morning.Anyway I'm not giving up on Cornwell. I'll just wait for the next book and hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AGAIN !!!!!!","review":"After reading 'Black Notice' I decided to remove Cornwell from my library. Weak as I am though, I read 'Blow Fly.' Another disappointment. Same old story. Cornwall needs a sabbatical to give us some fresh material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"I have been disappointed in her last few books to the point where I can't even finish reading them. I did get through this one, but it was a struggle. Never again! At least I learned from my last mistake and got this one at the library. I still keep hoping she will return to her old form, but this seems to be par for the course now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow, blew, BLOWN","review":"Ugly, ugly, UGLY! A sorry apology for the cracking good writer Ms Cornwell used to be. Graphic descriptions of low butchery, shot'em-all-on-the-spot show downs and improbable resurrections are not the stuff I like to find in a good thriller. Besides, I feel I'm quite fed up with serial killers. Why do they kill? Because they're mad, of course. Wow! Shocking! I'd rather have your old fashioned butler any time... And what the hell happened to spunky, self assured, self reliant, rational Doctor Kay Scarpetta? Who is this pathetic looser stumbling around with no rational purpose, this pale wraith of her former robust self?And why on earth should a brilliant, beautiful, smart girl like Lucy waste her life away ad a dumb gunwoman? And what is this fascination with self made judgement and execution on the spot?Get yourself together, Ms Cornwall. I used to love your novels, but now I feel very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's really awful.","review":"Like lots of other readers, I have read all of the Scarpetta novels and loved them. This one is beyond terrible. It is very boring, quite distasteful (sick really), and the main characters are no longer likeable. Kay is in love with herself and mean. Benton is mean and rude. Lucy is crazy and makes stupid mistakes. And Marino has no dimension. I would say that P.C. didn't write this book, but her previous book about Jack the Ripper wasn't very good either. There was so much ego in it.Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic attempt.","review":"This so called book was a pathetic attempt to milk money from Cornwall's loyal readers. The only reason she wrote this garbage was she needed the money. The publishers went along with because of greed. This book was short choppy gobbledygook. What was this with 90 million 3 or 4 page chapters. Cornwall wrote her own death warrant for this series when she killed off a main character. This was a pathetic attempt to \\"write\\" that wrong. She has lost this loyal reader for good. Hasn't she heard of letting the hero riding off into the sunset. Let's hope she has learned her lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I looked forward to another Scarpetta novel, having read all the others, but this was a real disappointment. It didn't really seem to go anywhere, and jumped from one idea to another, so it was confusing. I kept wondering if I was missing something! I was hoping the Chandonne story line would come to an end in this book, but, it seems there's room for more, as seen by the ending, which happened way too fast with very little detail or explanation. I still feel like I missed something. This was a very disatisfying book, to say the least. The Kay Scarpetta I love reading about would not have put up with this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow don't buy","review":"V. disappointed.

The only resemblence Blow Fly has to the prior stories is the characters. Everything that has kept me coming back formore in this series of books was totally missing from this one! The story is disjointed, the characters we've grown to like dispite themselves now have no personality or depth. I kept waiting for it to get better but unfortunately, it never did!Ms. Cornwell, I can't believe you really feel this book is up toyour normally high standards. Shame on you if this was done only for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Me Away..........","review":"If someone had told me I'd finish reading this book and throw it across the room in disgust I'd have said never. I love Kay Scarpetta and looked forward to the release of this book with great anticipation. What a disappointment! What happens to these writers after a few very successful books? Does their success go to their heads and they forget what their fans want? I finished reading the last page of this book and sat there thinking this must be a mistake, where is the rest of the book?! Don't waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"465 Page A Waste of Good Paper","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels and this by far was the absolute worse I have ever read. 465 page of overly descriptive writing with and ending that took 10 pages to get through. It was a huge disappointment. To much time was given to the description of Jean Baptiste Chardonne. If you have read her previous novels where this character was included then you know the history behind who he is and what makes him tick. The need to rehash it and then describe wine and his disillusions in such great detail where more time could have been spent on the other characters and there frame of mind and motives would have made a lot more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"I'm still wondering if this is really a Cornwell book.

I hope she has plans for better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"I've read all of the Scarpetta novels and this one is just plain bad.

It leaves you not just hanging (which would be ok) but checking to make sure you picked-up a complete copy of the book! I seriously thought there was a chapter missing from my book. Don't bother reading this until the next book is out to complete the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"Right from the first page I got the sinking feeling that this was a \\"Kay Scarpetta\\" novel in name only! Gone was the brisk, fascinating view through Kay's eyes... alas, this book was written in the \\"third person\\", so it loses ALL of it's appeal for die-hard readers like me, who want to hear all the workings and observations of Scarpetta's mind and heart as the plot is intricately woven. No interesting forensic details, no interesting plot, and none of the gifted writing of previous Scarpetta novels! If you didn't know better, you'd think this book was written by someone else... I'm not going to waste my time finishing the book! And believe me, I'm not going to buy the next Scarpetta novel until I look through a copy first to see if PC has gotten back to writing books to her former high standards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed/bored are understatements","review":"I am in the process of deciding if I want to continue reading Blowfly. Being a loyal Scarpetta fan, I feel I should read it. But there is not any incentive to continue to read this book. I'm about 100 pages into it, and will put it down if it doesn't pick up. Unlike in the other books, I really could not care less about the people or happenings in this book. In fact, I don't think I'd be missing anything if I put the book down forever. So, don't waste your money on purchasing the book, if you really must read it, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"I've just started reading the Scarpetta novels last month, going in order. When I opened the to the first page of this book I was confused. Then I thought well, this is just the preface. We'll get to the first person narration from Dr. Scarpetta in Chapter 2. Nope it was still 3rd person. I flipped through the book stopping in various spots to check if it was \\"I\\" , or \\"We\\" \\" on the find \\"He\\" , \\"She\\" and \\"They\\". After 11 books written in 1st person, Cornwell changes to third person. That is not normal in a series. The whole tone of the book is different. I've not even finished it yet. Having a hard time getting into the grove with changing each charcters point of view each chapter and not know whats really going on with Dr. Scarpetta like the other previous novels. Hope the rest of the books in this series are not all written in third person. If so, I may have to give up on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"Clearly Blow Fly left a lot to be desired..........especially in light of the fact that the author is quite capable of delivering more to her readers. Rather than focusing on an authentic, scientific approach to the storyline, Ms. Cornwell uses her descriptive expertise to develop character after character - some of whom have little if any real role in the novel. In essence, the tedious nature of the latter leaves the reader unquestionably bored. Lending to that (and a BIG yawn here) is the disastrous manner in which she finalizes the story beginning with the \\"Wolfman's\\" jail break. If I wanted to read comic books, I would buy them. The incredulous events in her final pages leave one to ponder whether the author intended this novel for individuals who were challenged with exceptionally low IQs. Given her remarkable talent for writing, Blow Fly is definitely NOT her best effort. Sadly, it is an insult to the intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset","review":"I am upset at having wasted my time reading 465 pages. I had never read a Cornwell book and I don't think I ever will. Just as some of the other readers, I kept measuring the number of pages left and wondering how in the world the author was going to tie up all the loose ends in such a short time. Well...needless to say, she didn't...at least not for me. I literally threw the book in disgust when I finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this series?","review":"After reading my late mother's copies of UNNATURAL EXPOSURE and BODY FARM, I eagerly checked out Kay Scarpetta mysteries at my local library. Then I checked out BLOW FLY, even though some of the earlier entries weren't available at the time. The third person format was very dull. I quit long before the end. In fact, I didn't care enough to check the end of the book to see what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment Reigns","review":"Patricia Cornwell used to write terrific books about Kay Scarpetta, filled with action, suspense and science. Her latest effort, Blow Fly, is terribly disappointing. For two thirds of the book the main characters stumble and bumble their way through the plot, lost in self-pity and paralyzed by neurotic worries. They have become pathetic caricatures, and fill the pages with anxiety and meaningless dialogue. Dr. Scarpetta half-heartedly investigates a brutal murder that turns out to be irrelevant to the flow of the narrative. The book comes to an unsatisfying, sudden ending, as if the author remembered that she had another engagement and had to abruptly end her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the ending?","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the previous posters. In fact, one review sums up my feelings exactly - \\"When it finally did get going, toward the end, I kept looking at the number of pages left, wondering how it was possible that I was almost finished when there was obviously so much story unresolved.\\" I thought for sure there was a 'To be continued' in my near future. I was shocked when the answers were supposedly crammed into a few short pages. Did Ms. Cornwell run up against a deadline? The book definitely seemed like merely a segue to the next installment, which will hopefully be much more fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again!","review":"After the last two Scarpetta disasters, I swore off Cornwell. But got suckered back in by the promise of the \\"old Kay.\\" Well, I got the \\"old Kay\\" but from the last two disasters. Tortured, lugubrious characters; improbable, conspiracy-theory plots; and worst of all - written in present tense! How pretentious and very distracting to read. Like it or not, Ms. Cornwell, the prime consideration for a writer is the audience. I suggest you stick with a diary if you feel so compelled to put forth your own agenda at the expense of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK OF THE DECADE","review":"BELIEVE THE REVIEWS!!!!

Here is a thought: Kay Scarpetta, get over yourself! Who would even want to be around this morose woman. I didn't care for (or like) any of the characters. What scares me is that the Wolfman is poised for yet another return. YIKES! Badly written, no ending and characters with dead personalities. Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"Evidently Patricia Cornwell believes that content doesn't matter anymore and environmentalists everywhere should be up in arms that even one tree was sacrificed to print this book. Ghosts from the past are resurrected so that new characters need not be created, the plot is contrived, bloody and boring, Kay is almost beyond redemption and Lucy should be in prison.

Here is a flow of words splashed together; there is no cohesion, there is no real story just endless blather.Oh, what happened to you, Ms Cornwell?

How did the Chardonne family end up in Baton Rouge? How did Winn know who Scarpetta was on the plane? What was the Dard piece about knowing Nic's mother?? Did Nic ever make the connection between seeing Bev at Walmart and once she was killed at the swamphouse? What...now Nic's family owned the swaphouse that Jay and Bev were staying at? Were Jaime and Lucy once involved?Maybe my ADD was in rare form but I couldn't follow a single thread in this book.

I was so disappointed. I am so used to Kay Scarpetta telling the story in the first person that reading the story in the third person gave me the eerie feeling that someone else wrote Blow Fly. There was just too much effort explaining the past that I became weary reading it. When reading the other Cornwell novels I just flew through them because the story was so engaging and interesting. I found myself with this book scanning ahead hoping it would get better. I had a bit of difficulty dealing with inconsistencies in this book compared with events in Black Notice and The Last Precinct. I find myself unrealistically wishing that the author would rewrite it in her usual style so I could believe I haven't wasted my money or lost confidence in her as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to Patricia Cornwell?","review":"Yikes! I ussed to rush right out and buy the hardback copy of each new Patricia Cornwell novel, but I'm certainly glad I obtained \\"Blow Fly\\" from the library. Cornwell's writing has definitely gone downhill right along with Scarpetta's career. My first clue was that this book, unlike every other Scarpetta novel, was written in third person -- not from Scarpetta's point of view. I guess this is because she's not actually IN the plot quite a bit of the time. At any rate, it seems like Cornwell is grasping at straws -- right up to the \\"let's bring someone back from the dead\\" moment. These used to be great police/forensic procedurals with interesting repeating characters. Now the Scarpetta books are full of paranoia and long, drawn-out character descriptions.

I was so puzzled by the ending, there was no suspense at all!It seemed to me that this book's purpose was simply to set up the scenario for the next one.Bad news, wolfman is on the loose and unfortunately that will require one more book to put him to rest.I also would favor a brand new case in the next book, with maybe only one paragraph devoted to wolfman, mentioning that Kay gets a phone call from a long time associate to let her know that a man covered with baby fine hair was found, bled to death, having mistakenly bit off his tongue while looking at a picture of Kay.And that's it, bury him and move on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Englishteachersnightmare","review":"Judging by the number of typos and missed grammaticals, even Cornwell's editors couldn't bring themselves to actually read the thing. Too much talk about the past with very little action bearing on the story. New characters are too thin. I've read better \\"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\\" essays. Didn't someone notice there was no ending? It just stopped. Be glad to relax with a real Cornwell novel. Get this girl an editor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Would Have Read These Reviews Before Buying the Book!","review":"I really did NOT like this book. I'm a big fan of the Scarpetta series and was looking forward to the newest entry. However, Blow Fly is not up to Cornwell's usual standards. My main complaints:- the use of present tense is annoying- the short choppy chapters are probably meant to keep the book screaming along at a quick pace, but they interrupted the flow of the story- what kind of ending was that??!?- don't feel there was any real character development except for that of Jean-Baptiste.- do we really need to spend the first half of the book re-capping the prior books in the series?BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware, this is NOT a welcome return to Scarpetta!","review":"WOW - I can't believe how poorly written this is. If Patricia Conrwell actually wrote it, she must have been terribly distracted. I'm thinking perhaps a ghost writer did it, someone with none of Cornwell's previously demonstrated skills. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - get it out of the library if you must, but this is a book you'll want to throw away, not keep! Patricia, we miss you! Come back - with a REAL Kay Scarpetta novel (and never mind Isle of Dogs and all that other stuff.) Just because you may be bored with Kay, it doesn't mean we are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta Fan- but awful ending","review":"Read the book in two days. Was really enjoying it until about 2/3rds of the way through. For those who have read it, I still don't understand why Benton was sending those letters??? It is like she took a hatchet and just zap- finished the book without reaching closure on a number of the story lines. Very disappointing. I agree with other readers-- let's move on to some new criminals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"This was one of the first Cornwell books that falls flat. It is poorly written and not the quality that we have come to expect from Ms. Cornwell. The story line is not well developed. The chapters are short and dis-jointed. The ending doesn't end. You get the feeling Ms. Cornwell was under a publisher's deadline and rushed (with disasterous results) to complete a novel that was only a partial rough draft. Greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grave Disappointment","review":"Sadly, the negative reviews are justified; Cornwell's latest in the Scarpetta series remains a grave disappointment. Essential scenes (which I cannot divulge here in repect to those who have not yet read this book) are given short shrift while less important scenes are highlighted. At times, Scarpetta appears as bloodless as the cadavers which she examines! Indeed, much of the novel does not ring true--it is as if those characters that we have come to know and enjoy reading about have de-evolved into caricatures. It is truly a shame because Cornwell is a first- rate writer. Perhaps her next book will help shed some light on the myriad of questions that Blow Fly leaves unanswered (along with this reader scratching her head in bewilderment)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"Patricia Cornwell? tell me it's not so.

Benton's re-emergence was explored previously and his role should have been laid to rest.This novel was disappointing, lacking in the vivid characterisation deployed in the author's previous works and its denouement was hurried and unsatisfactory.The horrific Jay Talley met his maker far too simply and the reader is left with the feeling that Cornwell has lost her conviction with regard to the superb plotlines and characters for which she is celebrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the ending?","review":"This book was very disjointed, more so than her past books. It has been three years since we read of Scarpetta, and yet we are supposed to remember everything. Up until the last few pages I would have rated it a lot better but Where is the ending? I have never seen a worst end to a book. There should have been mucho chapters to go. I guess we will have to wait another THREE YEARS to hear from Scarpetta and of course we all know the plot line. Get a grip and write like you used to, PC. And drop the other series, it stinks even worse than this one. I swore I was not going to read her anymore. I should have kept my promise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it SUCKED","review":"This was one of the most self indulgent pieces of garbage i have ever suffered through. her reputation is shattered!. previous novels were excellent (except the Andy Brazil series) but even in the last couple, Cornwell's ego started to dominate her good judgement. this book is filled with needless ego boosts for the characters and the author. it appears cornwell was either intoxicated or lazy. either way do not pick up this book and pray that her editor gets the guts to tell her to clean up her act before she tries writing again. the story was also absolutely incredulous and read more like James Bond. Unfortunately Kathy Reichs will be left to dominate the Genre until Cornwell finds her marbles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reluctantly agree","review":"I read a lot of these reviews before I read the book itself (thanks for the spoilers, folks P~), but was astonished at the preponderance of negative feedback. Now that I've read the book, I can only agree. To begin with, for a while, I was convinced I'd skipped a book in the series. The rest of the book was so contrived, and it did indeed wrap up myriad ties in a moment, it seemed. I am very disappointed and I hope Cornwell shuts it down at this point, since she simply phoned this one in, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"Simply put, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Hands down!I was looking foward to a new Scarpetta novel - but this?

I said I would not buy any more of Patricia Cornwell's books. But I did. It was an error.This book is awful. I am over halfway through and I do not think I can finish it. In many, many years of reading I can count on my fingers the number of books that I have started and have chosen not to finish.It is a shame. Patricia Cornwell is one of the most talented and engaging writers I have ever read. I would put her up there with John D. MacDonald, Faye Kellerman, and better than Jonathan Kellerman. But not now. It is as though only part of her is writing. You can still see the talent in her work, only it is not being used anymore. It just sort of sits there. In the past when she was cooking the talent was hidden the way it is supposed to be.Do not buy this book. If you have not read them buy any of her first ten Kay Scarpetta books. They are excellent. There you will meet some interesting people. Here you will find only regret"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, Kay...? Can you hear me now?","review":"Cornwell is completely out of touch with the characters she created. The story is terrible, there's virtually no forensics, there's not a single autopsy, there are too many inconsistencies to count and improbabilities fuel the whole too-long book. After spending years letting us get to know Kay and her inner circle, these characters are strangers to us, doing and saying things they just wouldn't do.It appears Ms. Cornwell's muse has left her. This is a real RIP moment for a series that had been slowly dying anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I have always been a fan of the Kay Scarpetta series and bought this book, expecting and hoping for a better read than the last few books Ms. Cornwell has written. I can only say I was really disappointed. I was expecting a Scarpetta mystery in line with the earlier ones and this one doesn't even come close. Written in the third-person, it seems impersonal and not even about the Scarpetta I used to love.Maybe it's me, but this book (along with some of her latest ones)reads like it wasn't even written by Patricia Cornwell. At least, not the author who gave us the earlier installments in this series. I'm beginning to wonder if she isn't following in the steps of James Patterson - simply placing her name on a mediocre book written by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow by this book!","review":"This is the worst Patricia Cornwell book I've ever read! It jumps from one thing to the next and is very hard to follow. I think Ms Cornwell has spend too much time running after Jack the Ripper and trying to find out who killed Princess Diana, and NOT enough time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay writing, horrible plotting","review":"Cornwell is still a technically fine writer, but the plot, character development, and pacing are just plain awful. As I got close to the ending, I kept glancing at the few pages left, wondering how PC was going to tie this all together in just a few pages. She doesn't. In fact, there was more ink devoted to explaining blood spatter than to delivering a plausible ending. Too bad. This book was a real disapointment. In fact, I'm going to hunt up my receipt and return the darn thing. PC doesn't deserve to earn royalties on this turkey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"This is a boring book. Using Kay Scarpetta as an attention grabber isn't fair! I loved all Cornwell's forensic novels but this one is rehashing previous books. Hopefully, there is a story in there somewhere! No forensics yet and I'm halfway thru. It is a struggle to finish! Wish I didn't waste my $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell are you sure?","review":"I waited for ages for this book, I have always prefered the Scarpetta novels. But the writing didn't even read like Cornwell. I think Kay was called Kay maybe 5 times in the whole book. Lucy needs to find a good woman and settle down, what happened to Janet? Benton back from the dead? I'm not sure that it would be possible for Lucy or Marino to lie for that long to Kay.It didn't feel like a Scarpetta novel and it didn't read like one either. That being said the stage is nicely set for the next book which I hope goes better. Although I find myself missing the days of Temple Gault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your averages!","review":"You'd better check the customer review averages for this book. You give it 5 stars and the only four reviews give it 3, 2 and two 1's. Mine is the third 1. This is a poor excuse for a Kay Scarpetta novel. The third person, present tense, is a constant annoyance. The plot is contrived and unbelievable. I was hoping for better from Patricia Cornwell, but her books have usually been either very good or very bad. This one is very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a roar, ends with a whimper...","review":"I became addicted to the Scarpetta series and devoured every one. Sad to say, this one gave me a bit of indigestion. Ms. Cornwell, what have you done to our beloved characters? Marino was always an out of shape slob, but we knew he was the best at what he did. In this book, we only got the slob. And Lucy! There was finally a strong, beautiful character who happened to be a lesbian. What happened? Her sexuality was one of the things that seemed to make Lucy who she was. And remind me not to rob any banks with her; she spilled her guts within 24 hrs.Bringing Benton back to life sucked the life out of Scarpetta...she was strong, intelligent, and in charge, it seems, till she met him. All of a sudden she was the damsel in distress needing to be saved by the all encompassing male hero. Rudy, the human Ken doll, deserves no mention. Never. Ever. Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave disappointment","review":"Having read all the Scarpetta novels, I was looking forward to another, but disliked Cornwell's approach from the get-go. I never rekindled any like for any of the characters, and felt she muddled her way through a half-baked idea. Very little held together, the characters were all on the verge of or within nervous breakdowns, and just when things would get suspenseful or interesting, the novel would break down.It's a pity that once good novelists like Cornwell or Clancy really make it, they rest on their laurels and dispense with the aid of a good editor. The more recent efforts from these authors are not good (I didn't even finish Clancy's, it was so bad, which is in shocking contrast to his older books.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"While eagerly anticipating this release, I was edgy about the lengthy span between Scarpetta novels. After borrowing the book from my area library, I was disappointed in the fragmentation of the story. A new residence for Kay and Rose, continuation of the malignant evil of the Chandonne twins, a potential new friend for Lucy...none held my interest. I wanted the forensic leads, the puzzling threads of evidence, Kay cooking when she is stressed. I would go back to reading the first five Scarpetta novels before I would bother with Blow Fly. Jean Baptiste is out there, perhaps intent on eradicating Benton for real the next time. I hope this storyline is put to rest in the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dolorous ending for Dr. Kay","review":"I am not sure if it is because of the times we now live in or my own lack of hope for the future, but I could barely get through this book. The lengthy discussion of torture and death was excessive and I too found a loss of love for the main characters. Lucy is now a hired killer - it was just a annihilation of people I cared about. Very disappointing and it will be my last Kay Scarpetta read although perhaps not my last Cornwell read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book was extremely disappointing.The story took a long time to unfold but it never really developed. This book is totally unlike the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack","review":"Well, this book completely threw me off. I've read almost every book Cornwell ever written, and I've always felt pretty confident in her vision of the Scrapetta series. This book however - what is this?! The characters seem to have the same names, but act totally unlike themselves. The Benton thing seems to come completely out of the blue, and reminds of a soap opera plot. New characters pop up and get pages and pages written about them, while Kay is barely mentioned. Lucy doesn't seem to be gay anymore. The psycho killers are conveniently explained, their psychological damage is easy to figure out, since they seem to be written as if the writer followed a text book. The language is crude. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the things happening and the plot seemed rather ridiculous. Never thought I'll find myself regretting spending money on one of Cornwell's books, as I've always considered her to be a gifted and talented writer. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Patricia get sick of writing?","review":"I loved all of the books in the Scarpetta series, but I think Patricia Cornwell has gotten sick of writing her. Blowfly hits a new low, with a build up to nothing. The ending reads like she got tired of the book and decided just to end it without explaining anything. Her books have been on the downward spiral since she killed off Benton in Point of Origin, and it just keeps going down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Stale (includes spoilers)","review":"After her last novel about Kay, etc. (The Last Precinct) I came to expect that this would be a follow-up to tie up loose ends. What a disappointment! Patricia Cornwell seems to be coasting on her success with the previous books in the Scarpetta series, and I found this book very different. Switching from 1st to 3rd person was the very least of the transgressions. I mean, come on! Kay was exonerated of Diane Bray's murder, yet she's hiding out in Florida like a hunted animal? Benton Wesley is actually alive. Lucy has a boyfriend! The chemistry between Kay and Pete Marino was in that he DIDN'T admit his feelings for her. And are we destined to be tortured with redundant references to Chandonne forever like with Carrie Grethen? My suggestion to readers is that, rather than wasting money to buy this book, borrow or check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"--Scarpetta's lost her charisma--","review":"BLOW FLY was not my favorite of Patricia Cornwell's books.This story continues with the life of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, who in the earlier books, had been the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, Virginia. Now, Kay seems somewhat adrift as she is living in Florida, and works as a private forensic consultant. She's asked to look into a case in Louisiana, and finds that a killer that she had met in the past, may again be resuming his life of destruction. Scarpetta's comrades, Detective Pete Merino and her niece Lucy both take an active part in this book, but like Kay Scarpetta, they lack luster. All of the characters seem to be showing the dark and unlikable traits in their personalities.Starting with the book's title, I found the entire story to be disconcerting and distasteful,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too abrupt an ending - - what happened?","review":"As an avid reader of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was so looking forward to this, her latest. The book was pure Cornwell, up until the last chapter, where she abruptly ended it, leaving me to wonder if she finished her required number of words for the publisher and felt no need to continue. Come on, Patricia, and respect your readers. Return to your wonderful style of writing which catches up the reader and pulls them along until the end of the story. Don't just shove us off the cliff (or down into the cellar)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have read every one of Patricia Cornwell's books and would proudly list her as one of my favorite authors until Blow Fly. This was one of the worst books I have ever read and I was so disappointed in the writing and story that I could barely finish it.I'm not sure why but Cornwell seems to be more into writing about everyone's sex lives than writing a story with something of a plot. Truly, this was so bad that when I finished, a stranger came up and asked how the book was and I told him it was so awful that he could have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost better","review":"cornwells past few scarpetta novels have been lackluster, mundane, in short boring....with blow fly we see the return of some of the pacing and characterization that made her early books so successful.....on the negative side the ending leaves alot ALOT to be desiredand far too many dangling plot threads......for the next scarpetta novel let's see the tale of one of her first cases, because it's starting to feel like i'm reading about my grandmother"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOW FISH","review":"I was a big fan of Cornwell and her ficticional character, Scarpetta.

Aside from those moments that defied logic and the abrupt and unsatisfactory ending (couldn't we at least be a witness to the demise of the hideous Jay Talley?), this book completely lost focus of its central character. Were is Kay Scarpetta? She is the heroine, right? Way too much Lucy and her glitzy spy toys. I think Ms. Cornwell needs to re-read the first books in her Scarpetta series to remind herself of what a compelling and thrilling author she can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll second that","review":"The other reviews say it all. The book stinks! I don't know if Patricial Cornwell has given up writing for investigative work for the media or what. But, obviously she can't do both."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be joking!","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I tentatively forgave the author after picking up Isle of Dogs in an airport bookstore. What garbage that was. Almost killed my fan status for good.I echo the previous, negative comments. Scarpetta was missing much of the novel and the characters behaved in an inanely, scripted manner and were completely unbelievable. The conclusion was laughable.Oh, and one last question in my mind: if Benton had to \\"hide\\" from the evil Chandonnes...how is he so \\"free\\" now that a few of the dirty members are dead? Seems like big daddy's still around and he was supposedly the one to fear, right? Ridiculous! This book is drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me my money back","review":"This book is simply awful.

Everyone involved in putting this one out should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Having read all of the Scarpetta novels, I must definitely say that this one was the worst. The novel jumped around way too much. It lacked the intrigue that all of the other books had. I had to keep reading it in hopes that it would get better, but it never did. The book was poorly developed and written. I must also say that the ending was very disappointing. It was like she just stopped writing. I am in hopes that if and when she writes another Scarpetta novel, it will not be like this one. Please go back to the old style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"A downward spiraling trend....sadly. After much anticipation this book was a bitter disappointment to me. I feel PC had to scramble for ideas just to complete the book. And the conspiracy theory, I mean, come on. I don't mind stretching my imagination for the sake of fiction, but this was beyond 'stretching'. It was good to have familiar characters back (even if they did act out of character) but at what price? Let's hope PC will take a page from the old Dallas TV series and this will 'all be a dream' and we can get back to the Kay Scarpetta that we know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected......","review":"Being an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell, I was looking forward to curling up with this book for an exciting read. Unfortunately, so much of the book was reminding me of all the happenings in the books I've already read, that I was surprised to be almost to the end without ever having gotten to the juicy mystery I was expecting.

I began believing that this was a book about Kay Scarpetta, ace forensic pathologist, but it isn't. It is about a bunch of unfinished business. Unfortunately the loose ends aren't tied-up all that convincingly.I guess I have learned to expect more from Ms. Cornwell.

Then came Hornet's Nest. I think I would rate that the worst book I have ever read. After that book I only bought the Scarpetta books. I thought the quality deteriorated somewhat, but they were still worth reading. Then came Blow Fly. In my mind this book is almost as bad as Hornet's Nest. The characters in Blow Fly are totally unbelievable and (with the possible exception of Nic Robillard, a minor character) completely unsympathetic. The story did not flow well. Resurrecting previously killed off characters made the book even more absurd. I felt compelled to finish the book only because I had bought it. If I had taken it from a library I would have returned it unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"This book is going in so many directions it will give you a headache!

I waited 3 years for the Scarpetta series to continue and was fully disappointed. The character is in about 1/4 of the book as the book focuses on Marino, Benton, Lucy and the Wolfman. The book was missing something and that was Scarpetta. I hope Cornwell can redeem herself by writing another Scarpetta novel real soon. I was so disappointed. I would not recommend reading this one as I consider it a skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people?","review":"As most Patricia Cornwell fans I was excited to learn a new Kay Scarpetta novel was being released. I have read the book and I am extremely disappointed. The two questions I had throughout the book were \\"who are these people?\\" and \\"who wrote this book?\\". The book is written in third person unlike all the others and the characters have lost all \\"human\\" qualities. I must be honest...I did not like any of these characters! I'm sorry Ms. Cornwell...I won't be reading another \\"Scarpetta\\" novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I was so looking forward to it...","review":"This book was awful. I was waiting patiently for her next book in the Scarpetta series after being disappointed with the Jack the Ripper novel. Bringing back the \\"wolfman\\" character was bad enough (he was BORING) but then to introduce characters that had no life to them, no spirit and no depth only contributed to the downside of the storyline.I always loved when Kay was in the kitchen...one of my favorite books is her Winter Table. And I love Foods to Die For. Those came from the heart of her character. In this novel she is a lost soul with no roots. And to leave Richmond for what? The Benton situation made no sense and although I always loved his character, the reunion was shallow and definatly non-climatic.Will I buy her next novel? Probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta should be put to rest!","review":"This book more than any other i've seen illustrates how someone comes up with a very good book or two, establishes a name, and then churns out pure junk in order to make more $$. As a great admirer of the first several Scarpetta stories, it is disappointing to see Cornwell doing this to her readers. The story is absurb, the story-line almost non-existent, the details unbelievable. How does the villain, on death row in Texas, now blind, covered with hair all over, manage to kill his guards, change clothes, and walk undetected to freedom? Please! All this is apparently setting up another Scarpetta story, with more $$ for the author from her trusting fans. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, watch reviews, and if Cornwell ever reverts to previous form, get on board again. For now, Patricia Cornwell should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too generous for this book.","review":"After the enormous disappointment of the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" fiction fantasy in which we were treated to the author's own personal theories and conclusions as FACT (which they are not), I was really looking forward to seeing Scarpetta, Lucy and Marino back in action.

However, the narrative is over used in this novel, and it is lacking alot of the dialogue and character interactions we are used to. Alot was left unexeplained in this novel-alot of what happened in \\"Last Prescint\\" was never explained and we are left wondering what has occured. The ending was quick, and will leave readers eagerly anticipating major character resolutions in the next book.

Patricia Cornwell had to write this book in order to tie up a bunch of loose ends. Kays life in Virginia is over and destroyed by Bentons death. Lucy is not much better, Morreno...ditto, etc. Patricia could not have written another who done it, autopsy stuff, good old fashion murder without giving some closure to the last couple of books. Now we have things back in order enough for her to continue on with Kay Scarpetta and friends. It will be interesting, however, to see which way she goes with this. Will Kay and Benton get back together. Will everyone start working for Lucy at The Last Presinct or will Patricia go in a totally different direction. As you can see, she needed to write this book. Looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely discouraged.","review":"I haven't even read the book, although it is sitting right here. After reading these reviews I started to just throw the book in the trash, but I think I'll donate it to my local library instead.I think Cornwell's books started going downhill when she brought Lucy out of the closet. I'm not homophobic, but everything started to go weird after that and has never returned to the great books she used to write about Scarpetta. Just my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have read all of Cromwells books and enjoyed most of them. When I started reading BlowFly I kept wondering Where is Scarpetta? It was about everyone but her but as the book went along I thought is this even a Cromwell Book?

The tormented Benton-give me a break and Jean-Baptiste breaking out of prison blind then walking off with the car keys-To do What? Drive? I can't wait to read how she explains that in the next book. I couldn't believe she didn't address that part of the plot-what is he the Road runner? And when he's sitting waiting for her to visit him he's drinking and eating the cupcake pretending that he doesn't know she's there. How on earth does he know being blind and behind glass?

I'm giving her 2 stars for the benefit of the doubt, but basically, every negative criticism people have levied at it here is accurate.Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series on a downward spiral:","review":"As with most \\"popular\\" authors, Cornwell's books are getting worse and worse the more she tries to write. This book is written in the present tense, which makes it difficult to read. She jumps from character to tired old character, and guess what? Surprise! A character you might have thought was dead is.....not dead! How many times can she do stuff like this in her series and remain credible? The first few novels in the Scarpetta series were terrific. Welcome to the popular authors Downhill Slide Club, Ms. Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Cornwell","review":"I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell, but this is the worst Scarpetti book that she's written. I usually can't put the book down--but it took alot longer to read this one. Scarpetti is tough and also human, but it just wasn't the Scarpetti that I know & love. Events brought her to the bottom, but she's one tough lady and this book didn't even sound like her. I was very disappointed and I hope the next one brings back the real Kay Scarpetti."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad Blow Fly","review":"I have read every Cornwell book written and was looking forward to reading Blow Fly. This book was a huge disappointment. Thankfully I got it from my library and didn't waste any money on it. It was written in the first person, which didn't work well. Each chapter was a different character - so it jumped around constantly. The plot was very weak. And the ending was so anti-climactic that she wrapped it up in the last 15 pages. It felt like she got sick of writing the book and just came up with whatever she could to end it. Maybe she was too busy researching Princess Diana's death for her TV appearance to spend much time on this book. It was definitely a half-hearted effort. If you're a staunch Cornwell fan, you'll read it - but don't waste your money on buying it - go to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-read an older story....","review":"This is the last PC book I will buy in hardcover unless something changes. I have ready every PC book and while I felt the last couple of efforts were not up to par, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, no more.Where to start? First, there is the distinct lack of a plot, plot twists, or any meaningful mystery--the things that have been PC's hallmark. Instead, we get to spend time on the analyst's couch with each of their characters exploring their personal angst. This might be cool if this added greater depth to the characters, but it doesn't--its just a rehash of territory covered in previous books.Your time any money maybe better spent re-visting one of her earlier novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"she must be out of her mind","review":"I liked her former novels a lot, they were suspenseful, and I couldn't stop reading till I read them all, but this is the worst book I've ever read, honestly. Half of the book is senselessly violent and the other is about how everybody is ridiculously enamoured with Scarpetta (which by the way looks just like Cornwell, according to the descriptions). Every third sentence is a praise to her soft flesh and her elegant demanour and how courageous she is...I had to put it away half-read, it's so childish. I just couldn't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever Written","review":"I would have given this book a -5 stars if it was possible. I have read every book I could get my hands on for most of my 42 years and I can honestly say that I have finally read the worst book ever written. This book is horrible. Cornwell can't decide if she wants to be James Patterson with her 2 page chapters or maybe a spy novelist with her international plots that are completely lame. After I finished reading this garbage my first thought was to donate it to the local library but then I thought some unsuspected person might check it out and read it. So instead I threw it away so no one else would be exposed to it. Life is to short to waste one second on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly - Blows !!","review":"I've read every book in the Scarpetta series and as a HUGE fan I pre-ordered this book and eagerly awaited my copy. I was so excited the day it arrived and ripped open the box in anticipation. Unfortunately there is no other word to decribe this book other than - TERRIBLE. I'm almost offended that Patricia Cornwell thinks she can deliver this poorly written garbage to her loyal fan base without backlash.Patricia Cornwell should spend less time trying to uncover the secret plot to kill Princess Diana, or uncover the true identify of Jack the Ripper and focus some attention on the charector that made her the money she needs to travel the globe on her kooky quests.The only thing this irritated fan can do at this point is warn some unsupecting person (you) looking to purchase this book. Don't waste your time or money on this one. If I could return it - I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"The blind can now see...and drive too","review":"I have to agree with the other negative reviews on this one. I had read the previous novels in the Scarpetta series, and this one proved to be a big let-down. The ending is a mess - too abrupt and certainly leaves you with too many questions. Also, how does a death row inmate escape, kill two guards, and drive away from the prison when he is supposedly blind??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"I've always enjoyed the Scarpetta books but this one was definitely not one of the best. The plot was somewhat predictable. Benton's being alive was actually not surprising, or even interesting.Patricia Cornwell has become a victim of her own success and has lost her originality as she churns out boiler-plate stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews first...","review":"Okay so it wouldn't have made any difference. I loved Cornwell's writing and yes, even after her last 2 average novels, I was going to give her another chance. I'm only 1/2 way through the book and it's horrible. What happened to the snappy dialogue that we're used to?? I think I'll check her next novel out of the library instead of wasting good money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!","review":"I purposely did not read the reviews on this one before I gave it a read. Patricia Cornwell has certainly disappointed her fans. The characterization was flat throughout. I kept thinking this has to get better. The ending came abruptly, and afterwards I felt cheated! I have read all of Cornwell's novels and this by far ranks as the worst ever. I think a lot popular authors become more concerned with pumping books out for the (...) than anything else. I mean when you are already rich and famous...why bother entertaining others? I will read reviews on the next Cornwell novel before I plop down my good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"what ??","review":"Would the real author please stand up !!!Benton Wesley - What !!!Utter tripe. I have so enjoyed the Kay Scapetta series and was so completely disappointed by this one.And what's all this third person nonsense ?? give me back the scarpetta I know so well and love !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"Patricia Cornwell simply could not have written this book. If she did, then she's totally out of touch with her characters and their behavior. From a long-time fan, I'm recommending that she stop this farce with a ghost writer and get back to basics. Add some science back in (all of which is appallingly lacking from this book) and bring the characters back to their roots. Both Lucy and Marino keeping things from Kay? I doubt it.Until I hear that Cornwell is back on target, I'm extremely happy that Kathy Reichs is keeping her Temperance Brennan series alive and well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe she wrote it!","review":"I have read all the Scarpetta books and this is not one of them. This book is so full of pornographic dreck, that I cannot believe Patricia Cornwell wrote it. Possibly she wrote the half dozen or so short chapters (out of over 120!) in which Scarpetta is almost in character, but the rest? I truly believe she has a team of writers hacking away at ghosting, but who came up with the mindless non-plot? The real question is where are her editors? Do they think her readers would not notice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"This book is so unbelievably bad it's hard to believe Patricia Cornwell wrote it. None of the characters are recognizable from their former selves, for starters. The plot is beyond bizzare and contains some major holes. And we're expected to believe that escaping from death row of a max-security prison is relatively simple. The book is not written in first person as the other Scarpetta books are and is in a strange diction style that is hard to follow. Finally, it contains way too much blood and guts and gore. Yes, I know it's a murder mystery but some of it really seems gratuitous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I loved all of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels and was excited to see a new one arrive. After reading it, I regret spending money on it. What happened? The change from her usual first person narrative to third-person present alone drove me nuts. And at the end, things just suddenly seemed to be wrapped up - like a tv show that has to fit everything in during the last five minutes. I agree with another reviewer -- it was hard to believe she actually wrote this. Truly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Cornwell Really Write This?","review":"Blow Fly was so boring I'm hard pressed to think Patricia Cornwell really wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"I have been a fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta for a long time, and was just dying for something new! I couldn't possibly have been more diappointed. All the classic mistakes, she would start going in an intersting direction then plod on to something that was out in left field and not even pertinent. I knew it was useless when I had 20 pages left and the story had more unanswered questions than answered ones...and I didn't care. She rushed the ending, seriously wrapping up one of the most interesting pieces of the story in one and a half pages, possibly trying to make it a cliff hanger, but definitely missing the mark. I had no interest or caring for any of the main characters or what was happening to them, and Scarpetta was a washed out bland, version of herself. Patricia Cornwell's style of writing is still as good as ever, but this book lacked substance and is well beneath her ability. I agree with the other review, I wish I could get my $22 back and read the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Finish","review":"I thought maybe it was just me, maybe I didn't understand the book. As I read the other reviews here I can tell you- It's not JUST ME. This book was hard to finish, it wasn't as good as any of the other Kay Scarpetta novels. I am a die hard Cornwell fan, and have been waiting years along with the rest of you to get my hands on a new Scarpetta book. But what has Scarpetta come to? Everyone in this book is angry and depressed. Lucy is a killer, Marino leaves his home dejected and depressed, and Benton is back? How could Lucy and Marino hide this fact for so long? There are characters that just show up, like Rudy. What happened to Teun? And the ending, oh boy. After reading the whole book.. I won't give it away..but to have it wrapped up so quickly and easily didn't statisfy me. Hopefully the next Scarpetta book will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish","review":"I was sorely disappointed. This was the first Scarpette book that I hadn't purchased sight unseen, due to my dislike of The Last Precinct. I checked this out of the library and I'm glad I didn't waste my money.The story is disjointed, jumping from place-to-place, one dislikable character to the next. I found myself reading and rereading pages of dialogue to try and understand what they were so angry or upset about. Marino is a patheticself-pitying whiner, Lucy is neurotic, and Wesley and Chandonne are just bizarre. Scarpetta, in spite of then book being \\"A Scarpetta Novel\\", is barely in the first 200 pages.I read about 300 pages and then decided I wasn't enjoying myself and wasting my time. This is the first book I've put down unfinished in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This is a confusing mish mash of a book that rarely made sense and did not cause you to invest in the characters, as we all have for many years. It's the only Scarpetta book that I had to force myself through and was glad when I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"The only good thing I can say about, BLOWFLY,is that I took it out from the library & didn't waste any money buying it. As a big Cornwell/Scarpetta fan, I was truly disappointed by this book. Scarpetta is relegated to a minor character & the rest is just convoluted drivel. When the end finally came, I couldn't believe how hurriedly it was wrapped up! I was also terribly disappointed that Jean-Baptiste survived to darken yet ANOTHER storyline. Fans of Scarpetta can only hope the next book begins with the medical examiner finding Jean-Baptiste dead on page one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"After years of hearing people rave about Patricia Cornwell novels, I decided to listen to this book on audio CD. I stopped listening half way through. I kept thinking that the story would get better and the pace would pick up -- but it didn't. It was unneccessarily gory and had no real story line. I didn't connect with any of the characters. (I can't imagine listening to all 13 CDs.)I just don't see what all the hype is about her being an excellent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"I was really disappointed in this latest Scarpetta novel. The plot was all over the place and there was not enough about Scarpetta. The ending was rushed. Why bring Benton back? MOVE ON......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Day Job...","review":"The absolute worst piece of trash I've ever read!! I should have had a clue when I had to keep stopping to ask \\"Is there a PLOT here?\\" The rambling, self-important tone of the abysmal writing is appalling. PC has been slipping in recent novels, especially the \\"other\\" series in the Carolinas and she has completely gone over the tasteless, amature edge. I don't care how much research she's done, when she puts in endless minutiae about guns and ammo that serves no purpose in the plot, it just seems like grandstanding. \\"Look at me! See how smart I am!\\" Get a day job Patricia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the reviews first.....","review":"All the negative reviews are right on the money. Boring book. No need to go into details...others have done that. I doubt I'll finish the book.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT....looked forward to this book as did countless others. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly BLOWS!!!","review":"I am glad that my public library had the latest Scarpetta offering. It saved me the anguish over losing $26 on a piece of not so hot fiction. Cornwell should be disappointed over this stinker as most of her loyal readers seem to be. It's the worse soap opera script ever written and Patricia...YOU should be ashamed of yourself to treat your loyal readers to such drivel!It's a waste of time to read and long winded. Where were the editors!!!! Thank God Kathy Reichs came out with hers first. Help us Linda Fairstein...we are suffering from novel withdrawl!Save your money kids!!! Check it out of the library if you have to read it. Amazon has much better offerings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time - a really BAD book!","review":"I agree that this was the worst book I have read in a very long time. Like other reviewers, I WAS a Cornwell fan, but not any longer. If anyone else had written this trash, it would have never been published. What a disappointment and a rip-off. No more of my time or money will go to Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's Enough","review":"Well this one did it for me. I've gone from \\"I can't wait for Cornwell's next book\\" to \\"never again wanting to read about characters like these.\\" I can definitely do without any more reprise of the twin, sicko, Chandonne brothers who, among other things in this butchered novel, take pleasure in using a woman's severed arm for alligator bait. Worse yet they may may never actually die--Cornwell has one of her characters actually return from being convincingly killed in a previous novel! I think Cornwell's extensive research for her recent Jack the Ripper book has taken a toll on what used to be one of my favorite authors. She seems to want to depict men as capable of being even more hideous than ever rather than writing an entertaining thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fan is Disappointed","review":"This book was a let down. I've loved all of her other Scarpetta novels. When I got to the end of this one I felt a great sense of relief that it was finally over."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Blow Fly Blew - One Star is too gracious","review":"Over the past 3 months I have read all the Scarpetta novels and have watched them go from great to grave. Throughout the novels Scarpetta becomes more and more unlikeable - a snob rather than a caring human being who is more wrapped up in her home, Persian rugs (who cares if they are machine woven?), plus, if she really finds Marino such a repulsive human being, than why does she frantically call him every time she is followed or there is a loud noise outside? I'm just glad I took these books out from the library ~ I feel for those who have purchased these books - especially in hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly: A Scarpetta Novel","review":"I've been a big fan of the earlier Scarpetta novels---but what a disapointment this one was. It was like it wasn't even written by the same person. The revived bad guys were almost cartoonish, and the new charactors (which seemed to have more attention than Kate) were somewhat interesting, but never fully developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell must be getting tired...","review":"That is the only excuse I am come up to explain the total lack of effort put forth on this book. Having read all of her other books I was eager to get my hands on this one. Don't know now why I bothered. Boring!! If you must read it check it out from your local library don't waste the money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Below","review":"I'm a big fan of MS Cornwell and have read several of her Kay Scarpetta stories. This one I checked out of the library and it is a good thing I did not buy it. Though I can say I enjoyed reading most of it, it just seemed like she had to pull a bunch of chapters together, link them somehow, and make it a story. Maybe she was pressured after finishing her Jack The Ripper book, I don't know. I just felt strongly enough about this book to say my piece because she is capable of so much better. If you get a chance, read all of her other books but save this one for when you are desperate or just plain bored... then again this might not be an appropriate cure for boredom unless you have a high tolerance level like I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on here?","review":"I have read every Kay Scarpetta book out there and this one is, in my opinion, full of errors. First and foremost, Lucy left the FBI due to that relationship with Carrie and the problems with the computer system she created as an intern. Never before have we even heard of this \\"rape\\" scenerio. Also, how can she even think of trying to pull off Benton's return? It's time for some new characters, not a return from the dead like some sort of deranged soap opera. Where is the Kay Scarpetta we all know and love? Why has Particia Cornwell forgotten her own books? I hope it gets better after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time's up...you have 2 pages to end the book","review":"I have read every one of Cornwell's novels and like many, have looked forward to Kay's cleverness and medical sleuthing. Although I did enjoy the twists and turns as the novel progressed, the ending was so amateurish, clipped, and unsatisfying that one has to wonder whether there was a reason for the shabby and uncreative way the author ties up all the loose ends. Did the publisher give her an ultimatum for a deadline and she had to somehow finish the book in a few days? How can the author deny the reader that inevitable confrontation between the good and evil forces? Extremely poor job done writing the climax. Viagra anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Go There","review":"I put the book down after reading 79 pages. I couldn't get any sort of continuity in the story. I got tired of trying to stay on course with the book. I have read only two other Patricia Cornwell novels and one I found OK and the other, was just as bad as Blow Fly. I doubt if I will buy other Cornwell novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standard","review":"Cornwell shifts point of view here, from protagonist Kay Scarpetta's first person vulnerable (which made the earlier books so interesting) to third person boring. She devotes endless pages to minutiae that have no bearing on the plot, and describes the characters in one-dimensional terms (Scarpetta is \\"lonely,\\" \\"brave,\\" and adored by all who know her, while the rather pathetic Chandonne is invariably presented as loathsome because of his congenital abnormalities). Strangest of all, it seems that around page 440 Cornwell realized that she had to start wrapping things up, so within 10 pages or so she whips her characters into line with almost no emotional satisfaction for the reader. One particularly frustrating outcome is that of the three nasty villains, one is disposed of offhand, another dies offstage (as we are later told), and the third escapes (also not shown), no doubt to induce us to buy the next Scarpetta book. Ms. Cornwell, get back to where you were before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell jumps the shark","review":"Very disappointing work. Her book on Jack the Ripper obviously didn't do well enough, so she rushed out this stinker. The only cliche she left out was the evil twin,...wait there are two evil twins in this. ;-)She is much too talented to produce this stuff. Blame also goes to Putnam for putting this out. Should have gone directly to paperback or maybe under a pseudonym."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed","review":"I am \\"trying\\" hard to finish this book. I have a 1/4 of it yet to go, and it is difficult to keep going. The book is like a jumble of words and misplaced sentences. I have to keep referring to previous chapters and pages, just to try to follow it. In many places, it doesn't make sense and I am tired of trying to figure it out. It doesn't flow like her other books. I havent read a cornwell book in a few years. Her first 3 or 4 books I couldnt put down. Read them in 2 days tops. But lately, just aweful. I hope she gets it together and brings Scarpetta back to her sense!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"I won't repeat what other posts have said, but I would like to add my vote for worst Cornwell book. Having just started the series a few weeks ago (I have a few weeks off work), I quickly got hooked and now am extremely disappointed. This is a horrible book, once again for the reasons people mentioned: bad, anticlimactic ending; unbelievable \\"surprise twist,\\" change to third person, plot jumping all over the place, etc.I accidentally read Predator out of order and that one was horrible as well. The reviews for Trace seem bad as well. Three strikes and you're out, Cornwell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Flies Have Already Finished With This One","review":"I'm only half way through the book, but it is bad. Cornwell really rips off her faithful following with this pile of bull. Living in LA, and on the bayou, it reads like a very poor travel-log. Now we have Nic added to the characters, and no more development so far of the previous characters. BENTON LIVES! ... wow! ... now Cornwell is turning to the soap opera genre. I'm sorry I already bought \\"Trace\\" ... I guess I'll have to read it, but this time the reader is on trial, not the criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"blown","review":"I am an avid admirer of Cornwell's books and just completed Blow Fly and was blown away with the lack luster content. I sure hope the next Scarpetta novel is a 5 star because this one seemed rushed, harried and scattered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the new Scarpetta novel. The length of the chapters were far too short to fully explore the characters, the narrative style did not work and the twist in the tail was simply ridiculous. It seemed like she had severe writers block and had to come up with an audacious storyline to bring out the much anticipated novel. The characters were also not explored in any depth. I am a huge Patricia Cornwell fan and bought this book and waited until Christmas day to read it so I could sit down and fully enjoy it. I finished it the same day, but only because I wanted the nightmare to be over. It was terribly written, incomparable to The Last Precint. I hope Patricia Cornwell gets her act together as it was a terrible follow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let-down!","review":"I patiently worked my way through the book, hoping that the other negative reviewers were wrong. Unfortunately, they were correct. And the ending... what a total let-down! Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a lot to be desired","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwells novels and I have never felt as if I desired anything more from them. They always hold my attention and interest. I find them facinating. As I started this book my usual mode of constant page turning quickly turned into looking for reason to put down the book...I just could not get into it. I was bored. Then ending just seemed abrupt and did not make any since to me. It was predictable and slow. I have the upmost faith that Cornwell will redeem herself in the next novel...I hope anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinkola!","review":"I was appalled and aghast while reading this...thing. Yes, I finished it. Kind of like watching a train wreck - don't want to look but must. Patricia (and Patricia's editor!), what were you thinking?!? I could have dealt with all the plot landmines if not for the tawdry ending. What a cheat. What a cop out. Glad I got it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so disappointed!","review":"This book is terrible. It read as a cheap horror story and the ending fell flat. I hope that she starts Kay Scarpetta with a clean slate in her next novel. I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell didn't realize what a lousy book Blow Fly is. If the choice were possible I would give this book no stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blown off by Blow Fly","review":"I thought Isle of Dogs was a dog, but this book really was a disappointment. I did not like the third person writing, and I missed the nerve-tingling excitement (frisson) that used to make me read a Cornwell novel in one sitting, even when my vision was very poor and reading was painful. Cornwell seems to be well motivated to contribute her resources to real world forensics;maybe that is the best use of her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read every one of Cornwell's books and I have never been disapointed until now. This book appears to have been written by committee!Cornwell over focuses on her character's emotions. By this time, the reader knows what drives them. All this angst is distracting and takes away from the plot. Her people are well fleshed out; now is the time to turn them loose and let them do their jobs.I had a difficult time following the plot. One chapter appears to be thrown in. I never understood why.The ending disapointed me the most. Rather than witnessing what happened, we are told what happened. Where's the fun in that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The author cuts the heart out of the book by using the third person narrative; at first I kept flipping ahead to see if Kay herself would join us at some point, but alas, she did not. The cast of characters we have known for so long seems here to be played by unenthusiastic and not-very-talented stand-ins and everyone spends an inordinate amount of time feeling sorry for themselves. The return of Benton Wesley was about as believable as Bobby Ewing in the shower in the old \\"Dallas\\" soap. Towards the end of the book things began to get more interesting, but the tale was abruptly brought to a halt by the killing off of the vast majority of the people who were causing problems - voila, no more story left (or, are they REALLY dead... but at this point, who cares). Maybe Patricia Cornwell was pressured to do another Kay Scarpetta book when she really didn't feel up to it. Hopefully she will bring the good doctor back in style someday, or if not, let her retire with dignity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled the fun","review":"I wanted to read this book, but the reviews here give so much away (Bentorn, etc..) that I have since lost interest. I will think twice before checking here again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"Hopeless. I gave it one star because I couldn't go any lower. All it did was simply tie up a number of loose ends & clear the ground. Please Miss Cornwell, go back to your first-class forensic stories again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to end a book","review":"I too was sad about this book. They last 50 pages seemed like a train wreck. The reviewer below who gave 5 stars says something about an evil nephew needs to reread it's son not nephew. I wish I hadn't bought it in hardback. Read it at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a scarpetta novel","review":"a huge let down!! i did finish the book only because i was still hoping to the end that there would be some hint of it being a scarpetta novel. it didn't. after having read all the previous scarpetta novels i was quite taken aback at the change to 3rd person. it was very difficult to overcome. the twists incorporated into the novel do not fit with the characters in any of the previous novels except in name only. there are also many inconsistencies with the references to the past in a failed attempt to try and explain the sudden change in everything that you thought you knew from being an avid reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"Having followed Patricia Conrwell's Scarpetta series, I would have to say that this one lacked her usual flair. The books starts out at a good rate, but by the time you finish it you will disappointed. Without giving away the ending, she leaves you hanging about some of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Cornwell stopped liking her characters","review":"The Last Precinct was probably her last good book. After that, she just stopped liking her characters and demeans them. Not even worth getting from the library. Even getting past the disgusting opening, it's boring. Too bad, her earlier books were worth collecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly BORING","review":"A real lowpoint for the Scarpetta series. No new characters and absolutely no action whatsoever, other than excessive perspiration. I was sooo disappointed.The early taut suspense of Body of Evidence and all those other great novels is simply nonexistent in Blow Fly. This one's not worth the cost, if you must read it, check it out from your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Fly - a real annoyance","review":"I haven't finished this pathetic tale yet, but when I have this opinion of what I am reading I like to check other reviews. I see the majority feel the same. There isn't anything new in this book, just a retelling of all the characters pasts and their connections to each other. Someone said the characters had changed so much they were unrecognizable. I don't agree, expecially Marino, if anything is has become more gross, in looks and behavior. Who'd put up with a boorish slob like that anyway. I really don't think I need to finish this disgusting, rambling story as the ending sounds to be anti-climatic.Come on Ms Cornwell you are capable of better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it.","review":"I bought this book years ago and attempted to read it. I got a few pages in and just couldn't keep going. It's written in present tense, and it was very distracting to try to read. Just a few minutes ago, I found it on my bookshelf, and thought I would try to read it again. It didn't fair so well this time either. I really can't stand this method of writing. I was a fan of the first few Scarpetta stories, and I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I really enjoyed the first several Scarpetta novels, but this switch from first to third person is absolutely detrimental to the series. We lose all insight into Scarpetta's mind. The bouncing around between characters is distracting, and I don't like where the series is going at all.I am also slightly biased because I think authors that base their main character on themselves (or who they wish they were) are ridiculous and lack imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book marks the end of a good ride","review":"Warning! This book is the one that \\"jumps the shark\\" concerning the Kay Scarpetta series.IF you must read it just keep in mind that the book goes downhill here and continues to her latest book \\"Scarpetta\\" Charaters come and go, Rudy disappears entirely from the rest of the series and the storytelling and 'feel' of the book takes a 180 turn. It feels like someone else was writing this and the rest of the books that follow and Patrica was just signing her name to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Blowfly\\" blows.....","review":"When this book came out, I grabbed it up expecting another fast and furious ride with Kay and Company. Instead I get a load of gratuitous sex of the saddest kind, bumbling \\"investigators\\", a stumbling plot line (I'm being kind here). Hideous, heinous, horrible.... you get the point, dear reader.I really didn't think this author could make a misstep, boy was I WRONG. Hope she gets her act together... a mind like hers is a terrible thing to waste.I've waited a while before indulging in my favorite detective's world, hope it's straightened out and Kay is once again on top of her game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"This book was not what I expected. The writing was written as though by a narrator, observing each of the characters and their thoughts, which I didn't like. I'd read bad reviews of this book, but I purchased it more out of curiosity than anything else, since it is a link between the last book and the one after. They could definitely have introduced certain characters better than they did...and half the time you are left thinking, \\"huh?\\" Definitely not my favorite book by far, but since I have read the other books by Patricia Cornwell, I'm not giving up hope on the author just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy","review":"It is hard to believe that the same author that wrote all the previous Scarpetta novels actually wrote this. The style is totally different, and not for the better. There is no central plot, no main crime to solve, just a jumble of hodge podge thoughts leading nowhere. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I persevered, but....","review":"I can't believe I actually wasted several hours reading this book, nor that it was ever published in this state. It just doesn't make sense! I initially thought it was because it was so long since I read the last of the Scarpetta novels, and so had forgotten about the ruddy Chandonne family, Benton's death, etc, but by the end I realised that there were holes in the plot holes. Loose threads unravel throughout the novel, promising serial killer storylines just peter out, the characters that we know and love do completely random things, and the ending was just carnage. I actually came to read these reviews to see if it was just me being monumentally slow, but it looks like Cornwell's managed to baffle and bore most of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and Boring","review":"I am astounded at how bad this was. I quit reading Cornwell a few years ago and this is yet another reinforcement of my decision. I wish I would have read these reviews BEFORE I bought myself this novel - I would have saved myself time and yet another disappointment. You will be so annoyed at how stupid the ending is. Don't get this and believe what the other horrible reviews say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I religiously read Cornwell's first half-dozen novels, when her stories (\\"The Body Farm\\", etc.) were fresh, carefully crafted, and innovative. That was a long time ago. I got turned off as the series became sloppy and autobiographical, but I decided to pick this one up to see if the books have regained their form. They haven't. This is awful, sloppy, unfinished, and uninteresting. There are so many wonderful crime novelists out there, no reason to read second-rate books."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, absolutely awful","review":"I suggest that Cornwell go back and read her earlier works to remind herself how to write. Her writing in Blow Fly was atrocious. Poorly developed characters; the sappy, unbelievable and unnecessary resurrection of Wesley Benton; and a copped-out ending. Honestly, what was up with that ending? Why did PC think her readers deserved a denouement that consists basically of Benton telling Scarpetta: Don't worry all the bad guys are dead. oh, except the hairy guy; he's still around somewhere. let's go drink wine and be brilliant together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, then Angry","review":"This book is not simply a matter of the author not reproducing some of her early triumphs. The book's ending is so bad that I wondered whether the author just finished it off one night and whether a self-respecting editor ever saw the piece. The book as a whole was disappointing, due in part to a peculiar style that sometimes seems more like the brief notes that outline a book to be written, rather than the book itself, and partly because of the increasingly unsympathetic characters. Marino contributes nothing, but drinks a lot. The Benton character is absurb. Lucy's actions suggest that she has \\"lost it\\" in her darkness. And Scarpetta is often discussed from afar. Then come the last pages. I cannot remember another book that was concluded so poorly. What seemed disappointing ended up making me bad, because I felt that I had been cheated out of the book for which I had paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTLEY AWFUL !","review":"I have long been a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell. I love Cornwell's writing style, with her trademark ability of bringing scenes and characters alive with an abundance of meticulous detail. But the writing in Blowfly is noticeably different and awful -- choppy, sloppy and painfully lacking the delicious attention to detail that filled her previous efforts. It seems like the book was published while still a draft, or even -- dare I say it -- written by a lesser-talented ghost-writer. Cornwell herself couldn't have simply lost her talent, so I can only conclude that she has lost interest in creating art and is just hustling books to print for the paycheck. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown....","review":"I can't believe this book was written by the same author that brought us PostMortem and the wonderful character of Kay Scarpetta. The author has turned her into a minor character in her own series! The plot skipped around entirely too much to keep my attention. The Chandonne characters are tired and old, and I dread their inevitable return in the next book. The plot twists, such as they were, I found to be very uninspired. Still, I feel there are enough crumbs left in the series to make a comeback in the next installment....the author needs to return to her earlier installments to reintroduce herself to her own characters...she has been away from them too long, and it shows. I will read the next installment, but I will not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All loose ends!","review":"I was SO DISAPPOINTED! There were interesting characters but they had stories that went nowhere! And why name the book Blow Fly????? I realize the book bases itself on previously introduced characters, but the plot just never made it. The ending was horrible. I found myself wanting to call Cornwell, after reading nightly, and asking why she let me down at the end??????? I think Cornwell is brilliant, but this was bad. It had a lot of possibilities but too many side streets. And where was Scarpetta?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I have just finished reading BLOW FLY (with the most difficult effort!)...and I must say I am finished with Patricia Cornwell. Hooked on her first novels, I eagerly awaited the next Kay Scarpetta volume. However, I noticed a definite turn in PC's writing with HORNET'S NEST. While I continued to purchase her subsequent novels (I am a collector of First Editions), I had not read them until reading BLOW FLY this week. Cornwell's work has taken a most decadent and perverse twist. In place of good mystery and intrigue now appears page after page of gross convoluted text. The reader is mired in confusing perverted dialogue, jumping from one character to another, chapter after chapter. With concentrated effort, I managed to finish this latest book of Cornwell's. If Patricia Cornwell's name was not on the cover, I would swear BLOW FLY was not written by the same person who wrote BODY FARM. I will no longer purchase any of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I felt that the latest Scarpetta novel did not really tie in with previous books - it was almost as though the author suddenly decided to change directions but left some discrepancies throughout the series. Being written in the present tense made it very difficult to read, and from the third person perspective made the characters seem distant and unreal.Having said that, the storyline was engaging and the plot wrapped up nicely at the end... however, I am left with the feeling of WHERE TO NOW??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Page Turner","review":"Sure, the 3rd person point of view really threw me off at first and the constant reference to Kay as \\"Scarpetta\\" seemed cold, but this was another good page turner by Patricia Cornwell. It's great to get to know the other characters who are so important to these stories. The references to the past were necessary. Sure, people may not want to read about it all the time, but the past is what shapes us and, realistically, people do dwell a lot. It's amazing how everything intertwines and you're left feeling 'oh wow!' rather than 'duh, saw that coming 2 books ago'. I can't wait for the next installment. I hope it's soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this Blows...","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. No joke. I'm a big Scarpetta fan, but this book is incoherent, inconsistent, and frankly incomprehensible. The characters we've grown to know so well don't even sound like themselves here, and are making choices that are completely out of character. Plot lines are either completely unbelievable (arms on gator hooks??) or mundane (I should care about Rocco Marino's death? Everyone's always talked about what a creep he is!).Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happenned with character development ?","review":"I adore these novels. I think Patrica Cornwell is a talented and gifted writer. I also think Blow Fly is the first of the series that seemed written in a fog - in a hurry. It feels in a way that Scarpetta is more nuisance than Ms Cornwell's literary muse.I found the re-introduction of Benton - while certainly not surprising given the attention given his character in The Last Precinct - was placed in the book in a manner that we readers would feel grateful just for his return - and that \\"shock\\" would get us through a book in which the characters - -even though they are well travelled and well honed - seemed entirely one dimensional.Now all that said, I of course look forward to the next in the series - but only if Ms. Cornwell can re-emerge with a more fullsome and compelling Scarpetta and Co."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Switch!!","review":"To all you Cornwell fans, I have found something better: Kathy Reichs!I was hooked on Cornwell, but couldn't wait for new Scarpetta books to come out so I found Kathy Reichs. Her characters are similar to Cornwell's but are much more developed and interesting. The plots are quick and enchanting and you are never left wanting more. The science is more interesting in Reichs' books and the humour is much better too. Switch now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trace","review":"Excellent reading- didn't wan't want to put it down. Read it in 2 two days! Patricia Cornwell lives up to her usual high standard of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time to explore other characters","review":"This book was the worst book I've read in a long time. It's not that P. Cornwall has no talent, I think she has simply run out of genuinely interesting ideas for K. Scarpetta.And like all great characters: S. Holmes and H. Poirot, there comes a point where there stories have finally been told and it's time to move on.Like so many books now a days, authors are writing the same stories over again, with the same characters, just different scenes. I know publishers are pushing for this as it creates a steady stream of readers, and a steady stream of cash - but this one should have never made it past the senior editor's desk.I felt like this was a blatant attempt to \\"sell\\" another repetitive idea to the P. Cornwall fans.If you're a die hard fan of hers, then you'll read it and be disappointed.If you're not, then I rec'd passing on this one and picking up a book with characters who are new, change is almost always a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I see it isn't just me - P.U. this book stinks","review":"I am not even through reading this book yet and I came to Amazon to see if it was just me who doesn't like this book. I have read every single Scarpetta book and like all of you I preorder ASAP and anxiously await the new one... This is written ALL WRONG. Was not every other book written in the 1st person????? I see about 95% of the reviews are negative. Do I even bother finishing?? I don't run to pick it up or stay up all night for \\"just one more page\\" so perhaps I should throw in the towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where'd the ending go??","review":"Thankfully I got this in PB at a used bookstore. I was getting seriously irritated when I only had a few pages to go in the book, thinking there wasn't enough time to wrap this up so there was going to be \\"To be continued......\\" on the last page. How wrong I was. It took about three paragraphs to bring the book to a highly unsatisfactory ending. Think there's a few CHAPTERS missing!On top of that, all the characters are made unlikeable in this book. The reactions of Marino and Scarpetta to various events are so out of character I almost wonder if someone else wrote this book. Obviously, if you're a diehard fan, 681 negative reviews won't dissuade you from buying it anyway. ;-) But hopefully you'll get a cheap copy and read with really low expectations.....maybe then you won't be as disappointed as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have I missed something?","review":"I thought perhaps that my book was missing a last chapter until I read a few other reviews. What happened to Jean-Baptiste? Crime novels should tie up the endings. I got the feeling that the publishing deadline arrived before the book ended! I was enjoying the book up to the last 2 chapters - very odd to say the least. Was expecting some confrontation with Scarpetta and J-B.Having enjoyed most of Patricia Cornwell's previous books, (especially Jack the Ripper and Post Mortem) I found this one very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead Zeppelin","review":"Somehow this book just doesn't seem to get off the ground. I put it down after 120 pages. Cornwell's other books were better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing the touch","review":"This is easily the poorest Scarpetta book I have read. The first four books in the series where excellent, but since then the storylines have become more unbelievable and the writing has declined. The biggest problem is that the author has great difficulty in writing climax scenes to her novels. In this novel, it seems that she has decided to ignore totally the need for a satisfactory end to the story. Instead we are told that some events have occurred \\"off camera\\" and we should accept this.Any story needs a beginning, middle and end. This story barely has an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 thumbs down!","review":"A \\"disappointing read\\" are the 2 words I would use to describe Cornwell's latest novel. I waited to read this book, letting the suspence build, and once finished, couldn't believe I lost sleep reading it. I am a huge fan of Cornwell's, but this last novel was a flop! It was like she waited till the last minute to write Blow Fly. I felt it was poorly put together, the chapters were short, I HATED reading it in the third person! What happened? Would the real Particia Cornwell please stant up?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I had read the reviews on this site before getting the book mistakenly thinking that the book couldn't be all that bad. I was wrong. I have read all of PC's books and been a big fan for years however I couldn't stand this book. It was a complete waste of time. If you are reading this thinking, like I did, that such a gifted writer could not have failed on her latest attempt - believe me she did. Although I am starting to think, like others, that Ms. Cornwell couldn't have written such a terrible book. I am very disappointed. Don't buy it, borrow it, give it or check it out at the library. If is a waste of time too precious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have bothered","review":"I gave up on the Scarpetta novels a couple of books ago, but my hairdresser gave me this so I got sucked in again. It was just awful: morose, depressing, characters were inconsistently or badly developed, pace way too slow until the ending when things resolved (and I use that word loosely) abruptly and with strange gaps. Where's the editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed..........","review":"I loved all the Kay Scarpetta books. That is until I got to this one. Writing it from a narrator point of view instead of Kay's perspective like the others, makes reading this book very strange. I tried valiantly to put that aside but couldn't even get through the first 50 pages before I gave up. I hope that future books go back to the way they were before because Blow Fly definitely wasn't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOW FLY BOMBS","review":"At first I mildly intrigued that Cornwell decided to write this book from the perspectives of others. That way we could get inside what Lucy, Marino and Benton really thought. But as the book went on I came to realize: I miss Kay Scarpetta. She was hardly in the book and when she was... she didn't quite seem to be the Scarpetta that I came to know and love. Where did she go?The ending? I will not even go there... major major disappointment. I read the last sentence, turned the page and realized that was it. Ms. Cornwell could do better. I hope she does since I am a loyal reader and will be next reading Trace. Bring back the Kay Scarpetta we know!! PLEASE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing waste of time!","review":"I just got done reading BLOWfly, and I have to say I am in shock over how disappointed I am. The end was by far the worst I have come across. I was about 10 pages from the finish and kept saying \\"How on earth can this all end in a few pages?\\". The characters had nothing to them, chapters seemed rushed and thown together. I have always loved the charcter Kay, but she has turned into such a boring whimp I dont know if I can stand reading another book about her. Save your time and money and reread an old Scarpetta book, you will enjoy it much more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops","review":"Oh gosh. Look at the time. Better end this thing quick. Let's see, can I tie all of the loose ends up in a few paragraphs?

It was disjointed and many of the plots made no sense or were never fully developed.I'm ok with bringing back the character that died off in the previous book, but why he pretended to die, how Lucy was involved, and how it related to the Wolfman's family was really confusing to me. The ending in the wine cellar made me wonder if pages were missing from my copy. I just didn't get it.And that sums up my feeling on Blow Fly...I just didn't get it. This one goes into the Goodwill bag immediately. No second read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"What in the world happened? I love Kay and Cornwell's writing and have gotten many others interested. When I saw that there was a new book we all waited, reviews aside. The reviews were right on. I enjoyed the beginning and figured the recap was for those who were reading for the first time. I kept waiting for something to happen. The end was SO disappointing that I was checking to see if maybe I had missed some pages! DO NOT START WITH THIS BOOK to get into Kay and the rest of the cast.Skip this and pretend it never happened. Maybe a sequel would explain what she was trying to do???"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is one too many.","review":"I agree with all the negative comments I've read so far. This may do it for me as far as reading Patricia Cornwell in the future. Why has she allowed her characters to become so hardened and morose? There is not a likeable person among them; and if the reader does not care about the people in a novel, whats the point of reading it?Some revelations and answers to long-standing questions were made clear, but becuse of the afore-mentioned facts, I couldn't work up much interest.My biggest regret, second only to wasting the money I spent on this book, is that I didn't read the customer reviews until I had already bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY? ~ A TOTAL ANTI CLIMAX...! WELL BELOW PAR..","review":"I agree with almost every post regarding this novel.Having read ALL of Patricia Cornwell's works this was a real dissapointment.The ending ~ from Chapters 122 to 124 were like a student hurring to finish an exam essay!I would have thought with a 3 year wait since 'The Last Precinct\\", we would have not have been subjected to such a lack lustre ending.....The book itself was an average read ( up till Chapter 122 )as it tied all the well known characters together, however it ended so badly that I would advise anyone contemplating reading it to not waste their time....Miss Cornwell is this really the best you could do?...Please give your readers the respect they deserve.Andrew N ~ Australia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"Truly, one of the worst books I have ever read. This was just plain awful. It was so disjointed, vague and just plain unbelievable that I, for the very first time in reading an offering from Patricia Cornwell, really struggled to finish it. I kept turning each page hopeing against hope that it would get better and it didn't; it got progressively worse. The only good thing I can say about the ending was it was swift!!Ms Cornwell; Please go back to the formula that worked because this style of writing clearly isn't and your fan base is telling you this loud and clear. A one star rating is being very generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last Cornwell novel I'll waste my time on....","review":"Such a disappointment. Fame and a well-known name do not always equal quality. The book got off to an okay start and perhaps even had potential to go somewhere. (I am being generous.) But it seemed like Cornwell just got tired of writing and scratched out a third-rate ending. I'm looking for a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to kill them off and move on","review":"These characters are getting very tiresome. They have been reduced to poorly drawn cartoon images - only capable of extremes of emotion.

Dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Scarpetta fans!","review":"I just finished \\"Blow Fly\\" and can't believe how awful this book was! I was bored through most of it with the incredible descriptions of computer intelligence and weaponry! There was no real plot here - it just rambled around and around.

What a disappointment for a Cornwell fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and Twisted","review":"I'm only half-way through this book but want to say that these characters are the most morally repulsive people I have ever read about--and I don't just mean the bad guys!!! I read all the Scarpetta's up through Black Notice and I thought the books got more and more disgusting to the point where I felt contaminated by them, and to no real purpose. The medical examination plots--which I found interesting--have taken a back seat to the development of really horrible characters and the most graphic sexual violence. On top of that, I find all the books homophobic to say the least. It's time for Cornwell to get some therapy and start a new series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Early Scarpetta novels were gruesome yet literary. Kay was likeable, human.

Gafieiras were dancehalls, homes to dancers and dance bands, and the music fused samba and other early styles such as frevo and choro with sizzling, North American big band swing. This 2-CD set includes some of the era's best bandleaders, such as Severino Araujo, Radames Gnattali and Zacharias, along with several tracks from the Orquestra Victor Brasileira in the 1930s, when samba songs hit the mainstream. Intelligently assembled and well documented, this collection fills a major gap in the hidden history of one of the world's most fertile musical cultures. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Nonsense","review":"The author has a basic misunderstanding of the motives of de Baif and the political realities of that time. The inability of the author to grasp the actuality of de Baif's real circumstances has led to a book which owes more to fantasy than fact.The complete failure of the book to express the workings of political patronage at that time has again led it up a cul-de-sac from which there is no return.This book will be of no interest to any real political or social historian and indeed may actually compromise the perceptions of political or social students seeking enlightenment.The factual basis of the book is frequently faulty will glaring errors and omissions.I do not endorse this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice but...","review":"I prefer to spend more money on mobile bases that fit specific machines. No assembly hassles and 1 piece solid construction.If my wife let me have more time I'd just mig weld my own frames together, and use GOOD wheels.That's my only complaint. That front locking wheel is one of the cheapest wheels for the purpose. This particular piece of equipment gets moved round in my shop alot. Locking and unlocking is erksome but I can live with it for awhile longer.What I'm inclined to do is buy a better wheel and on my next mobile base purchase just get some better wheels to upgrade during the assembly process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite displeased","review":"After spending nearly $100 for this base, I am quite disappointed. First, the axle bolts had fine threads and the base was coarse threaded. I had to strip the threads on the axle bolts to get the wheels on. The 'brake' system is a joke, as other reviewers have noted. The swivel caster hides under a tongue flange, making it impossible to lock \\"with your toe\\" as the manual suggests. I compare this to the Delta universal base under my table saw, which has a wonderful \\"step on - tap off\\" locking mechanism that is always readily available. As noted, even though this is sold specifically for the JJ6 jointer, it does not fit. Through bolting is required for real stability. If you only move your jointer to get to something behind it, you may be pleased. If, like me, you have to store your tools in a corner and roll them out and lock them down when needed, you won't be pleased.

She generously let me preview it before I gave to her as a present. It's an enjoyable movie, for sure. It's feel good but not in the usual Hollywood fake feel good style. Still as far as being unbalanced by too many drugs and alcohol it's pretty tame. I prefer Terry Gilliam's take on medicinal imbalance. The main actor plays his part convincingly. The movie has a very even plot tempo. At first I thought that the hallucination was cheap and they could have done better with animation or CGI. Once the film completed I understood why they went with the cheesy outfit.This is not a movie you should show kids. Too young they'll think it's a puzzling comedy, too old and they'll possibly think it's a drug glorifying mess. It's good enough that I went and looked it up to see who it was based on. I think you'll like it unless you're one of those humorless religious people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instantly into my \\"top 10\\" all time!","review":"It's All Gone Pete Tong is excellent from first to last scene. Paul Kaye is amazing. It's a movie that should be seen multpile times- it gets better and better. Besides just having a great story line and premise, the direction is great, the use of music and sound creates lasting emotion. The way they edit the sound to toggle between Frank's deafness and what is just normally happening from scene to scene is so well done that you'd have to concentrate on how they do it to understand it, because it flows so seemlessly and naturally to let the viewer feel what he's going through. This movie is funny, dramatic, original and so well made in every aspect that I would recommend it to everyone. Own this movie and pass it on- people will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, very different movie","review":"I've watched this movie twice. The first time I believed the first frame of film which reads something like \\"This film is based on a true story\\", something like that. It was hard to watch for me because it brings out a lot of emotions. I sometimes didn't know if I should laugh or feel bad about the guy's situation. Then I read these reviews here on Amazon and saw that someone compared it to Spinal Tap and that it actually is not true at all. I watched it a second time and for some reason knowing that it was not true it really allowed me to just laugh and I did that much more than the first time. The tennis scene with the humus was hilarious and really remined me of Spinal Tap. If you like Spinal Tap you should like this, although this is a lot darker. Just remember that it isn't true."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete disappointment","review":"i had heard good things about this film so rented and watched it. i thought it was a total waste. every cliche from vh1 behind the music rock star biographies is here, only w/ the tiny transposition to the DJ/rave world: the huge star with fame and fortune. the subsequent over-indulgence in loud music, sex and drugs. the fall from grace. and then, you guessed it, the redemption! aided of course by the new woman who appears in his life to right his course, gorgeous naturally, and coincidentally - available.there's 3 or 4 good laughs in the film, tops - hardly making it a worthwhile watch. i strongly recommend skipping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatriz Batarda is the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen","review":"The film was alright-BUT I just want to go on record as saying that Beatriz Batarda is the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen-PERIOD!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHAMEFULLY UNDERSEEN FILM","review":"It's All Gone Pete Tong was realeased theatrically in the US starting April 14, 2005, and for some reason it never found much of an audience, though everyone seemed to have heard of it. I suspect that it's because the majority of the people who will most enjoy this film are not generally theater-goers and prefer watching movies at home. That said, however, everyone I know who did see the film in the theater couldn't stop raving about it.I can't wait to see this film again once it's on DVD. I saw it three times in the theater already and totally loved it - I couldn't stop raving about it to everyone I know and taking people to see it!And Paul Kaye and Mike Wilmot deserve tons of award recognition for thier performances in this movie, come the season.I hope this movie willl not continue to be overlooked!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Varley Wizard","review":"The printing quality of the book is atrocious. It's as if it had been scanned in at low-resolution from a bad copy. The text is blurry and noticeably bitmapped, making it less-than-enjoyable to read. The first and third reprints of the series -- Titan and Demon -- don't seem to share this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varley's search for GOD","review":"I loved the book -- great Sci-Fi with a lot of adventure and twists. Much of his writing reminds me of Piers Anthony. However, Varley is preoccupied with his own religion which occasionally shows up very clearly in his writing. It really doesn't bother me, but he is searching for God -- \\"he protesteth too much.\\" I've seen it several times in people who pooh-pooh God and any afterlife but cannot keep from talking about it -- they and he are after the same thing. Very simply he's looking for God and the meaning of existence. Like most aethist's or agnostics (for all I know he's Southern Baptist)who blame life's miseries on a non-caring or non-existent God, they apparently don't understand that God gave this world to man and He's letting man \\"run it.\\" So, keep looking John, and while you're at it, write us some more of that brilliant fiction -- you might find Him along the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard meets the level of excellent set in \\"Titan\\"","review":"Wizard is easily as good as its prequel, Titan; the two are among the best books I have ever read. The fall into alcoholism (and subsequent recovery from it) by the main character, one of my personal role models, is touching. The story is compelling, offering both emotion and action. It is a must-read for all lovers of great writing, whether they are sci-fi fans or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increasing sophistication but increasing bias","review":"For those of you who liked Titan, Wizard will not disappoint. But for those of you who thought some of Varley's editorializing in Titan was annoying, you will also encounter more of it in Wizard. While Titan tells us that humanity is vicious and animalistic, and abortion is a sensible option for any career-minded woman, Wizard lets us now that smart people are atheists and all the males of any species want to do is rape the females. That said, it's still a great book. Varley introduces a number of new characters, particularly Chris, Valiha, and Robin, who invigorate Gaia's landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Sign Language Phrase book","review":"This book is great for those learning A.S.L. because it gives you conversational phrases that you would normally use in taking to deaf people. Much like a Learning French Tape that tells you basic phrases you would use in English and French so that you can learn to converse in Sign by knowing the right phrase and style to use.The only problem I had was that some people have a hard time figuring out the correct hand motion from the illustrations. Also if you are not used to ASL sentence structure you will have a hard time understanding some of the phrases.I found it to be a good hand book for teaching basic sign phrases and words.I suggest using this book with a class or an Instructional Video. It will help to see the signs in motion so that you can match the motion with the illustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't learn grammar - absorb it!","review":"This book is a perfect way to learn ASL grammar. I've been studying ASL for a year, and most books I've found either ignore grammar and basically use English word order, or else try to explain the grammar in a rule-based way.Learning a foreign language like French or Japanese is full of complicated grammar. Lou Fant proves that there's another way. You can really get the hang of ASL grammar without memorizing compicated rules and doing dull exercises.By showing good examples, and explaining the principles rather than the rules, you just absorb the topic-comment structure of ASL grammar by observing. This book makes it easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the best!","review":"This book is a good resource for learning ASL signs. While it does do a good job introducing beginners to ASL phrases and also displays the difference between ASL and Signed Exact English (often mistaken for ASL), it does not explain the grammar rules of ASL. The point being that, after one has learned the signs in the book, one has no way of knowing how to form other phrases on their own. Instead of teaching the method, this book teaches memorization. This is okay sometimes but for those who REALLY want to learn the language and become fluent, it is not enough. To learn ASL grammar, I would recommend \\"American Sign Language: A Teacher's Resource Text on Grammar and Culture\\" by Baker-Shenk and Cokely. All in all, this book is pretty good and is much better than many other resources out there, it's just not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally learning to hear through the silence","review":"I have searched for books to help in my advancement of ASL and found this book the best in giving incredible and easy understanding of American Sign Language. Previously I found the grammar of ASL difficult to grasp, but with the easy to read instruction and wonderful illustrations it is coming together. I would love to see more advanced books written by Lou Fant."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource; the best way to learn ASL from a book","review":"This is an excellent resource for those who wish to use real-life ASL as spoken by the American Deaf Community. Unlike other books on the topic, The American Sign Language Phrase Book avoids \\"Signed English\\" (the use of ASL as a word-for-word analog to spoken English). The book presents the grammar of ASL, showing sentence structure, phrasing, even slang, and noting when spoken English words are inappropriate. This is the only book I've seen that could really facilitate a friendly conversation between a hearing and deaf person.The down side? The illustrations are hard to get used to. Because The American Sign Language Phrase Book (properly) emphasizes facial expression, there is often not enough detail given in illustrating the hands.My ASL teacher recommends this book to the exclusion of any other ASL dictionary"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guru's Review","review":"After signing & interacting with the Deaf for 17 years, interpreting for 9, and teaching ASL for 3, I confidently recommend \\"The American Sign Language Phrase Book\\" for beginners. Its user-friendly, how-to approach is especially appropriate for those seeking simplicity & accuracy in basic everyday conversation. It teaches commonly used vocabulary in proper ASL sentence order, including facial expression and body shifting. Perfect for the beginner's do-it-yourself manual to gain the confidence that you're \\"signing it right!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginners Book","review":"This phrase book gives your learning a jump start. You have to really study the pictures that have movement to understand them, but once you have done it a couple of times, it becomes much easier. I bought this book for an adult education class I was taking in ASL. Nothing beats an actual person teaching you ASL, but this comes close. It did have a few phrases missing that I expected to see (They teach you \\"Thank you\\" but not \\"You're Welcome\\"). Overall a great book to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The American Sign Language Phrase Book\\" by Lou Fant","review":"I have been studying A.S.L. for over two years. \\"The American Sign Language Phrase Book\\" is the latest book I am using as I move ahead in my abilities. This book demonstrates the progression of signing in phrases rather than just single words. The illustrations aren't always as easy to read, but that is why I keep my older books for reference. This phrase book is necessary to help learn how to become fluent in A.S.L. and to be able to converse with the deaf and hearing impaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good, but I wish it were longer","review":"The illustrations are well done, and the language presented is very helpful. I would like to see a longer book with more examples. When I first saw the book, I was concerned that the illustrations would not be specific enough, but they are quite well thought through and easy to read once you understand the notation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Classroom","review":"This book is required reading every semester in my journalism class at the University of Maine at Farmington. It always receives rave reviews from my students who get caught up in the drama of the stories.

Due to it's limited size (and price !!) it covers the most important topics of x-ray structure analysis in an easy understandable language without boring the reader with mathematical details. You really get a good impression about what the basic principles and problems of x-crystallography are, and how the can be solved. Everybody wanting to start with x-ray structure analysis should read this book at the very beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good introduction","review":"This text is well-written for the stated purpose of introducing chemistry students to the subject of crystal structure determination. Graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates will find this an outstanding point of entry into the field. The language is mostly very clear, but at times, Clegg presumes too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader. Still, it is a more accessible text than most, being light on mathematics, brief, and written in a (mostly) lucid style.One specific comment, and this may seem trivial, but it is a truly unbelievable oversight on the part of the publisher: the images on pp. 14-15 are printed in literal black-and-white, not grayscale. Hence, the beginning reader may find Clegg's discussion of diffuse fringes quite confusing, as there are in fact no fringes anywhere on the page. The images look rather like a bad Xerox, which is unfortunate, since they really form a visual foundation for beginning readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Golden Book of camping and camp crafts","review":"The book that i recieved was in excellent shape ! i already had a copy of this book but it was missing the last page and back cover.

JSP does a wonderful job of cleaning up the sound of these early recordings. This box set is consistently lucid and filled with amazing performances by artists largely unknown to modern audiences. One disc focuses on OTM recorded and released in the UK (they were big fans apparently). While I strongly recommend this box set to OTM fans, I knock off one star for the overabundance of \\"humorous\\" novelty selections. While historically interesting and containing some strong instrumental work in fits and starts, the novelty wears off quickly and the \\"humor\\" often would appeal only to a KKK member. Still all-in-all, an impressive collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"haven't played it yet...","review":"This is supposed to be a Christmas present so it's hard to say how much fun the kids think it is.

Amplification is only 1/2 Watt per channel, but I've found it's enough for both gaming and movies. Since the majority of the PSP's sound comes out of the bottom speaker holes (not the front) it's nice to use while gaming for the grip feature and to have the sound ports facing you (not necessarily because you need to crank it up on games). The stand is great for movies, of course, and there are ports in the back for headphones and power. The device comes with and uses 2 AAA batteries (unless you connect the PSP adaptor, then no batteries are required.The only little complaint is the power light is a little bright (it's right under the screen), but not too big of a complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Dont do it.","review":"Does not work with psp 2000 or psp slim whatever you want to call it.

Despite these issues, it is a good listen and would most likely be well received by fans of the band. The music is strong and the band displays a lot of passion live. The tracks were also cut so that you can hear a bit of back and forth between the band and the crowd, adding to the live experience.For those who are interested in more of the experience from the same concert I would suggest looking intoLive At La Zona Rosaby prog-rock band Coheed and Cambria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing ...","review":"... with many errors, mistakes, even typos, as well as poor research and many inconsitencies - I put it away after about 100 pages.

The saw is heavy duty and should last for years. I was able to rip wood accurately with the fence and also make accurate cuts with the miter gauge. Excellent saw for the price and excellent quality.

I have nothing bad to say about this saw. I've had to request some replacement parts (for a sheared bolt and for a misplaced fence tape measure) and Jet customer service was helpful and prompt in getting me the replacement parts.

One can do that without giving up their identity.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Biased","review":"While I agree that this is a powerful and elegantly written story, it suffers from obvious bias. Most disturbingly, it soft-shoes the issue of domestic abuse. In fact, in one passage, the author seems to take a sort of perverse pride in recognizing that Lakota women tolerate physical and mental abuse and think little of it. The author generally side-steps the issue of whether her own husband was abusive but shows her hand toward the end of the book by recognizing that the stress of constant surveilance and imprisonment \\"takes it's toll.\\"I do not believe that this is a matter of judging another's cultural mores by Western standards of decency, but rather recognizing that issues exist outside of the sphere of cultural relativism. Crossing the line by striking your spouse is wrong, regardless of circumstance or cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Riveting","review":"I decided to read this book after a few events in my life made me realize the inadequacy of my education regarding U.S. treatment of indigenous peoples, both in the past and today. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. On one hand, since I am just a few years older than the author, I could completely relate to the emotions and rhetoric she expresses from that tumultuous time period. The references to activist names and views from that time period awakened some powerful emotions.On the other hand, as a Caucasian woman, the author took me into new territory and a different way of life, which is the real value of this book. The racism to which she and other residents of the reservation were (and probably still are) treated is abysmal. We, as a country, love to point the finger somewhere else, but some real soul searching is in order. Mary Crow Dog's account is sincere, convincing and honest. I highly recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Our education system tends to overlook the details of Native Americans. This book blew my mind.

The film shows the exploitation of the Jamaican workers who get paid pennies for their work. It shows the terrible working conditions, long hours, inadequate accomodation and the total injustice to the workers who seem to be stuck in a never ending cycle of pain and humiliation just to survive.The workers struggle to get proper medical treatment for onsite injuries which are a regular thing when working with machete's all day long.This documentary does a great job in exposing this inhumane treatment of the Jamaican sugar cane workers which has been a secret for so long.'H-2 Worker' named after the H-2 guest-worker Visa's they must obtain is a great film well worth watching this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Album","review":"The Game's voice is definitel changed and his lyrics are mostly about Gangstas and Guns in Untold Story.The DVD is just JT introducing The Game and his album.

She ran away from her widowed mother's care one day following school, after spending the last few months going from well-behaved honor student to a disturbed delinquent.

Good for Desktop usage, but not for traveling. Once it was formatted, I was pretty happy and quickly transfered 10 gig of data over. However, after just a few days, the hard drive failed and started making a \\"clicking\\" noise. I was no longer able to access my data at all and my laptop will not recognize it.

They are taking over the world. this book is more for people who like reading about violence or blood and guts. a good quality of the book is where the rats attack and fight back with the rats.

This movie is not funny or creative. If your idea of entertainment is watching boring, balding, whining, Paul Giamatti have a mid life crisis about acting and losing his soul, then this is your kind of movie.This movie is stupid and the dialog is flat and forced at times. I would not waste my time on such garbage. The whole Russian soul stealing thing is just dumb. And the ending of the movie, what ending??? It just stops. I wish I would have hit the stop button 20 min into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie has an outlandish premise in the vein of Being John Malkovich or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: your soul is a physical thing that is extractable, easily removed and returned. In addition, it is sometimes preferable to be without a soul for a while, or to borrow someone else's. It's not the premise that bothered me but the fact that the film did nothing with this concept: neither dark comedy nor insight into whether the soul is the essence of humanity. Some visually beautiful scenes, very good actors, and yet it all seemed flat and...soul-less. This film did make me want to see Uncle Vanya on stage, as I was reminded what a great play it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Paul, not your best...","review":"I LOVE Paul Giamatti, and I had high hopes for this movie, but, sorry...didn't make more than 30 minutes before I shut it off.

I read the reviews and the phrases \\"Flat out funny\\" and \\"You'll laugh till it hurts\\" caught my eye. I couldn't make it past 48 minutes of this god awful and boring movie. In those first 48 minutes I think might have mildly chuckled for a split second. Peter Travers must have smoked some bad crack before he watched this. The plot is slow moving and convoluted. I didn't make it to the end so I cannot comment on that. Trust me on this....THIS MOVIE WILL NOT MAKE YOU LAUGH!

The variety of motifs from around the world are unique and fun. Once you have mastered the simple motifs, you are free to interpret these desings with more sophisticated color patterns, backstitching, beading or more. Are these simple motifs....yes. Can you combine them to created more mature themes? In some cases, yes. There are themed motifs, unique animals from around the world, transportation, occupational, international themes, florals, borders etc. I think this would be an excellent investment. At the current prices, who can complain? In addition, if you have the opportunity to introduce someone to cross stitch, this would be a welcome teaching aide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy","review":"I'm very dissatisfied with this book.

I wanted a book that would give me a good introduction to the subject. I found it very informative. Although the book is a few years old the information on satellite internet and tv is very useful.This is a good book if you're looking for a guide to the different types of RV's. It includes practical information on such things as the onboard amenities like fridges, showers,etc. The book also describes the process for draining the sewage tank.If you're an RV novice like me and you are looking for a good introduction to the subject then this book is well worth it. The author also has some common sense recommendations on buying an RV and getting the best deal possible. I suggest looking beyond a book on RVs if you want to get the best deal possible. Buying a vehicle is about the art of negotiation and your ability to not be manipulated by the salesman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I have read this book from cover to cover and it is great!

Buy It.","review":"'Chansons' by Guillaume Dufay, performed by the European early music group, Ensemble Unicorn, is a fine sample of early non-liturgical music. One of the most revealing things about it is how much the pieces sound liturgical to the amateur ear. But that should not be too big a surprise, as popular music has often been built on spiritual origins (witness the influences of modern gospel on soul music).As other reviewers noted, contrary to the sense of the title, only half of these pieces are actually songs, in the modern sense of the French art song or Chanson. But that doesn't make them any less enjoyable. I find the performances comparable to my benchmark for similar early music performances, the Clemencic Consort.A very nice, inexpensive sampling of great early music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Compilation","review":"The 27 tracks on these two CDs are not all Baden Powell, but this is basically a compilation of artists that have a loose connection to him.

Anyways, I like a game not only with tight control, but with a good story as well. I don't want to spoil the story, but it is very...unique. The creatures are great. The sound is the best you'll find for creepy games. The new first person view is added, and works like a charm. Controll is a bit clunky, but managable. All in all, it's a fun one that you need to check out. Creepy damn dogs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I've been a big fan of the Silent Hill series, so I figured buying SH4 would be a great thing to do. WRONG!! At first, the game seemed OK. After a while of dealing with the repetitive and increasingly annoying portholes and immortal monsters, I quickly lost interest in the game but decided to play it to the end to see the ending. The plot about Walter Sullivan believing the apartment was his mother was beyond idiotic. Protecting Eileen got very irritating, especially since she was very slow and couldn't do anything to help. Overall, the game was boring and I wouldn't recommend it to die-hard SH fans. If you've never played any of the other games, then you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"HOW can anyone not love this game it's awsome if you like silent hill even just a little bit this is a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happend with Silent Hill?","review":"This game is not as good as the first three. I expected the forth one to be the best because the 3rd game was nearly as good as the 1st one. It's not good a good game because unlike the other 3 it's not scary/disturbing. The first cutscene is very scary, but not the rest of the game. The badguys are lame and aren't scary. There are gigantic two headed Siamese twin monsters, that can be killed with only a pipe. Most of the bad guys are like this(really weak). The bad guys practically wait to be beat up/shot. The lamest bad guy in the whole game are zombie nurses who burp when you het them. How stupid is that? The ghosts are also no fun, because they take forever to beat, and theres lots of them. These are the strongest bad guys, but it's impossible to run away. It's really annoying.At the end of the game you have to walk though the same levels again.This game is really lame, and it shouldn't be played unless you're a baby or toddler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series....","review":"I thought this game was pretty cool at first, but It then slid way down the hill of awsomeness meaning it sucked.

I do recommend this game to Silent Hill fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Silent Hill beaten path...","review":"Silent Hill 4 is, truely, a game made for Silent Hill fans. More info is delivered on the Hope/Wish House, Dahlia's involvement and just about any other point in the Silent Hill series that seemed confusing. I look forward to the next two reported games (Silent Hill 5 is already in production, it's said) as more background games than anything. The first three were to leave us wondering about just what Silent Hill really is ... and I hope the next three will clarify it all.That said, this game /is/ different from the last Silent Hill games but just as well-crafted and adept at keeping one walking the thin rope between ease and wracked-nerves.I also recommend that anyone looking to this game play the other three - or, at least, Silent Hill 2 and 3. A good plot guide also does wonders in understanding just what is happening in this delightfully mixed-up game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail attempt of a silent hill game","review":"I've played all of the silent hill games. #1 and 2 to me were very good...not much for combat but the story lines can really hook you in..but to me from the 3rd one and on they went down hill. silent hill the room by far was the worst to me...i had to force myself to keep playing. course the monsters were nice but could have been better. story line didn't grab my attention..it even made me bored to play at times. honestly dont purchase this game..i understand if your a true fan and must play them all(like me) but if your new to silent hill get the second one thats worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weakest in the series...","review":"Like many reviewers I kept asking myself throughout the game: why the hell can't he just break out of his own apartment?

His musicality is never compromised by a lack of technique (since he seems not to lack anything in technique). The program performed here is very exciting, and shows Vieaux at an extremely high level, especially for someone who at the time was about 20 years old!!! While I implore everyone to acquire this recording, I also have followed Vieaux's career and seen him grow into a far more mature and accomplished player than the one heard in this recording. I highly, HIGHLY, recommend everyone to buy his recordings for the Azica label of the Ponce Guitar Sonatas and \\"Sevilla - the Music of Isaac Albeniz\\". If you were impressed with this recording, buy these two and you will experience one of the most musical performances by any classical musician on any instrument!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Technical Review","review":"I have exchanged this DVD twice and find that the quality of the transfer is unacceptable.

It's very well written, but it is a bit languid and literary in style. Although I read quite a bit, I generally do not enjoy \\"literature\\" -- or a well crafted book for its own sake. I am a fly fisherman and Wetherell's great love for the sport shines through this book. But I'm not sure I could have finished it if the book was about archery, or some sport that I do not share the author's enthusiasm, as the book's reverence for the sport and the river might seem maudlin for some. The book is very well written, and if you like that sort of thing, you will like the book regardless of topic.

In this novel Bolitho is newly promoted to Lieutenant. The ship to which he is assigned has a secret mission involving intrigue and treasure (no spoilers here). The best aspect of this novel is the continued maturation and development of Lieutenant Bolitho. There is plenty of action in this novel, and it is an excellent read.My favorite aspect of the \\"Bolitho\\" novels are the parts that deal with the American Revolution. This second Bolitho novel does not deal with that topic much. No matter; it is still an engrossing novel. Recommended.

I am a Hornblower devotee and after two readings of the series fifty years apart, was looking for more. The Bolitho series is like beef soup after having grown used to beef stew.Bolitho does not flesh out as Hornblower does, POV switches without warning. A lover is introduced and snatched away as though she were no more than a 3X5 note card. A spy is unmasked with no warning they had one in their midst. And the confusion of battle seems more like something I'm watching on television than actually involved in. Bolitho is always being overwhelmed and suddenly rescued from death by the same person.For all it's faults. The Bolitho series remains a fair to middling light read and I shall continue until I stumble on a better substitute for Hornblower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I've read most of the great Sci Fi authors.

Kent's writing style is easy to follow and this book can be knocked off pretty quickly. There is plenty of action and various plot twists that all come together at the end. I liked the fact that this book is neither a collection of various adventures nor one big long story, but somewhere in between. If you like a series that is easy to read and has lots of action, then this is the series for you.One blemish, though--there's a girl (and many a good war book or movie was ruined by a love interest.) I'd say this gal is totally unneeded, but I think the reader can relate to Bolitho's feelings. So, I won't take off a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not that good, either","review":"For those who enjoy naval fiction and are expecting something of quality (an O'Brian or Forester, perhaps) you are likely to be disappointed.

I kept expecting things to turn up a notch and finally seeing some big actions but nope.

I'm afraid this series might turn into another Wheel of Time. Better just skip the rest of the books in the series and get the final book if you've already bought the first two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Better","review":"I have to admit that this series is getting better. While the Saga of the Seven Suns is certainly not great science fiction, it is really good sci-fi with characters you grow to care for. The first two books were OK, but this one really ratchets up the suspense as the war with the Hydrogues continues. This time however, betrayals and political intrigue take on epic proportions: humanity is at war with humanity; civil war is brewing inside the Ildiran worlds. But we also have a greater understanding of the various alien entities: the Hydrogues, the Faeoros, Verdani (World Trees), and the interesting Wentals. Anderson has certainly created some original characters. My greatest complaint with this series has always been the drawn-out story. There are too many characters and the story could certainly use some better editing. That being said, Anderson has my attention and I look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THIS SERIES!","review":"Gods below! I can't imagine this series is still going on!

I tried to elicit their attention by giving some preliminary information; having a short preview and a sort of \\"what to watch for\\" information to direct students' attention to what was important in the film. This is essential for 8th graders especially and for educational reasons in particular.We found the film repeated the same information so much that it was wasting our precious class time. Much of the information was interesting; however, it could have been given in a more dynamic manner and in less time by not repeating the same thing about only a few people. Normally, PBS has motivating films that capture my students' attention. We were all disappointed. I will not show this film next year although I have not yet found a substitute that covers the same time span.

Everything fit together nicely and have it mounted on mobile base. I also ordered the fence and 6\\" riser block. One thing important to remember on any band saw is to use the right kind of blade for the type of sawing you are doing. For example, if you are cutting curves you will probably want to use a narrower blade (1/4\\" or 3/8\\") with 12 tpi. For resawing, I use a timberwolf 1/2\\" 3 tpi blade. This blade is about $30 but makes resawing a pleasure. It's gonna be a little slower cutting then a machine with a 2hp motor but then again the bandsaw is a lot less $ then a lot of the bandsaws out there. If you are a full time professional woodworker you are probably going to want something more robust, if you can afford it. However, for the basement shop(me) or garage shop woodworker it will work just fine. Note: I gave this saw a 5 star rating even though it only shows 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cannot stop listening to this cd","review":"After I heard my bassoon teacher playing a piece from this cd I went out and bought it.

Golosa left me wanting more, so I thought I'd try Nachalo. Big mistake. The dearth of logical, simple, and effective first-year Russian books is the main reason I am in the middle of writing my own first-year Russian text.This book is organized in a haphazard manner, the logic of which I have yet to discern. For example, some of the grammatical cases (genitive, accusative, etc.) are covered over 2-3 chapters - and not always consecutive chapters - and the information is given out piecemeal. This is frustrating for an experienced instructor and I know from my students' comments that it is even more confusing for them.Another problem is that this book is long on pictures and little cutsie-pie dialogues, but short on useful exercises. There are other problems as well, but the issues I outline here are enough to recommend to anyone considering this book to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo frustrating.","review":"I imagine that this book was once a clever, cohesive text. It was smartly combined with audio materials and a marginally competent artist. Then a large storm/animal crashed through the writers' office the night before the final copy was due. The authors threw together whatever pages they could find without severe damage in the morning and called it a wrap. And then they gave it a worthless index.The result? You're up at one in the morning searching for an thorough explanation/examples of the instrumental case and you have to dig through 300+ pages to find it, closely inspecting each page because new cases are introduced at random points in the book (and on the top, middle and bottom of pages and in similar black text) and \\"instrumental\\" isn't in the index. Oh, \\"chess\\" is in the index, \\"backward buildup, principle of\\" is in the index. But case forms? Not so much.I love languages (I'm a foreign languages major).

Her bent also drives her to make poorly reasoned arguments, causing one to question the validity of her better cases.For example, at one point she attempts to link blame on average Americans that buy wedding dresses to the economic slavery of East Indian islanders. While I agree that the purchasing choices we make have a greater impact on the world around us that we would like to admit, her argument suffers from gross oversimplification and deceptively focuses on this one issue of traditional Western wedding practices, when in reality it applies to many, if not all, purchasing decisions.I could not bring myself to finish this book as the irrationality of the arguments and obvious hating and blaming towards heterosexuals and traditional culture took precedence over genuine exploration of issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for sending this so quickly!","review":"I ordered this and received it in less than 3 days!

Setsuko Hara gives an outstanding performance as Yukie, the spoiled professor's daughter whose sufferings lead to self-discovery. Some have called this film a feminist drama, a rarity for Kurosawa. But it's also a movie about the choices we make in life. Yukie has two suitors, Itokawa and Noge. She knows she will have a safe but boring life if she marries Itokawa, and a stormy but exciting one if she chooses Noge. I won't give away any more of the plot.

Then there is the first published edition by Schalk which every scholar I've heard of dismisses as inauthentic. It is replete with wholesale cutting and reorchestration. Fortunately, it is rarely played. (Recently, another version from the 1880's, justifying a few - but by no means all - of the changes of the Schalk edition, has been found.)

An outsider will probably not understand what it is like to have those moments of losing oneself completely; of having a safe island to turn to when things get too rough; of having the comfort of being able to speak the language of goldfish; of being able to hold on to the familiar in a world of insanity and lies; the keeping up of appearances. This book is very recognizable for those who have once found themselves in a similar situation, perhaps not as drastic as for the protagonist of \\"Language of Goldfish\\". The theme of learning to deal with reality, having to come to terms with things and being able to lay aside that which is old and no longer of use, can offer a helping hand.A wonderful book of hope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book","review":"I first read \\"The Language of Goldfish\\" when I was in eighth grade. I liked it. I thought it was written in a unique way. One thing that I don't like about the book, however, is the way her family treats Carrie's problems. They're definitely no help. Her doctor dad dismisses Carrie's problem as anemia and all her mother cares about is having parties. And to make things worse, they're trying to force Carrie to do things she doesn't like to do, like go to school dances. When her mom says that Moira, her older and more social sister, loved the dances, Carrie insists that she's not like her. In other words, they want her to be like Moira, and she's just not. My belief is that if they talked and listened to Carrie more, she wouldn't have these problems and resort to attempting suicide.

After a horrible breakdown she tries to regain control over her life again.Personally I think many teenagers will enjoy reading this book as it deals with recognizable topics. Often teenagers struggle with radical changes in their lives and many of them experience feelings like being different and not fitting in. A must-read for every teacher (to be)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful novel by Oneal","review":"As teenager Carrie grows up, she recognizes that others around her change. Her slightly elder sister Moira, for instance, spends more time on her appearance and takes up an interest in boys. All that changes for Carrie, however, are these moments of fainting - feeling dizzy, almost like she is floating.Will Carrie find a way to regain the control over her life in time? Who can help her find her way into adolescence: her psychoatrist, her art teacher maybe?I liked reading this novel very much and, as a teacher, I can certainly see myself using this novel in class.Boudewijn, the Netherlands"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfactory","review":"I was very disappointed in \\"The Disney Songbook\\" by Jim Brickman.

Bad move. Ya gotta know when to quit, Larry. This is so awful it defies description. The six women who take part in this messy, unstructured, unplotted ramble are over-age juveniles, drunks, dopers,sexual obsessives, out-and-out bitches; the men merely sketchy unmentionables. I \\"read\\" this in only one morning, because I skipped more then half the pages in the hope I'd find something of interest. Vain hope!

The protagonist has a strange relationship with her three equally lacivious daughters, discusses her sex life with them, shares pot with them...maybe that's the norm in Hollywood?

It's well written, just not subject matter that interests me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Read Better","review":"i really have mixed feelings about this book....while I liked the part where Maggie and Connie were traveling, the rest of the book really was boring.

For most women, that ought to say it all. I don't think that this is just me. For most women, there is more to life than sex. Everything in this book is about sex.

We are a little more complicated than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I love so many of Larry McMurtry's books, but this one disappointed me. One thing I thought he had a special ability for doing was to make you feel something for the characters.

Everyone else was so shallow you wonder why anyone would write a book about them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"McMurtry obviously has given up","review":"If nothing else, this book shows what a wonderful and talented writer does when the well goes dry. This was horrible. The characters are all one dimensional, there's nothing particularly interesting about the plot, and who cares what happens to Maggie! The man who wrote Movin On, Terms of Endearment, and Lonesome Dove did not write this crap. Obviously Mr. McMurtry knows that his place in American literature is secure, so now he can throw out this type of drivel. Needless to say, I will not be buying this novel to add to my McMurtry collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reason to Read This Book","review":"How could an author capable of great works put out such drivel?

Save yourself this agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par","review":"Don't waste your money! This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I kept reading hoping it would get better but the ending was as bad as the rest. I normally love Larry McMurtry's writing, especially the historical novels - which is what he should stick to!

Like professional payback or something. When you get down to regular people telling what they think of the story of depressed Maggie taking her wacky best friend Connie on a fun filled trip across California to Texas, it hits the mark.If you had taken Larry McMurtry's name off of this book you would not have been able to convince me he actually wrote this drivel. You want to whack Maggie across the head and tell her to act her age or even like a mature 25 year old and get a life. Connie is so disagreeable I couldn't see how someone could be around her for two minutes much less be friends since sixth grade. This is a childish book about childish grown-ups and the only emotion it stirred up in me was the regret I wasted my time reading about two 60 year old wasting theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"So it wasn't just ME","review":"Thankfully this book came to me in a big cardboard box with lots of other loaners...

The review from Newsday \\"[McCurty]is one of the few male authors who can write convincingly from the woman's point of view.\\" RUBBISH!

I never cared about the characters and more importantly they didn't do anything interesting if I had. There is NOTHING at stake in this novel. I think this is primarily because the main character doesn't really care about ANYTHING. [...]. The clerk at Books-a-million warned me and said, \\"he just didn't seem to take his time with it\\".

I was able to install it by myself, and I'm an old guy. I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw, disconnected the bolt, and lowered it to the floor. After that, the installation goes very easy and straightforward. Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off, but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good. Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw.

Reluctantly, I trudged on in hopes that later books will instill in me the the wonder of Stan Sakai's fictional historical account of the ronin rabbit.I'm glad I stuck with it.This book presents the most psychologically and emotionally deep plot yet, and leaves readers with a great ending. The drawings are evident that Sakai improves his talent over the years, and the dialogue can be very quotable for some.I strongly recommend UY to any graphic novel fan, and urge beginners to \\"trudge,\\" as I have, through the initial stories so that they can come to appreciate the maturity and excellence of later samurai tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"It doesn't work very well, and i bought it 2 weeks ago and it is already broken!!don't buy it!!

This is an awful compilation, full of dull and unmemorable selections that would most likely repel anyone investigating Irish music for the first time. I hated every track on this album.

This thing is like a car headlight!","review":"I got this booklight yesterday and agree that it does make a hotspot in the center. This is due to the single LED. I found it to be blindingly bright, so much so that to disagree with that surely means I have a different version than what was reviewed here.I noticed that there was considerable light leakage out the top of the lamp as well as a harsh glare from the page. I did the following and now it is a perfect light.I took black tape and and covered the top of the light, leaving the switch free to move. I then took black tape and covered about 80% of the light leaving a small strip. I did this above the LED. This cut down the light output but what was output was harsh. I then took a few layers of clear tape and put them over the remaining lit area and this softened up the output quite nicely.Now it is a good light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bright enough only lights up small area","review":"I am so disappointed with this booklight.

I have even found myself moving the head over each line as I read to be able to see. That is just terrible! It's just not bright enough. I am going to make one attempt to remove the LED light bulb cover to see if that helps but if I can't do it without breaking it - I'll put it in the drawer until the next yard sale.

Second book - not so great","review":"The first book was a futuristic sci-fi detective story. I liked it. I really liked it a lot. The science in that book was internally consistent.This second book? Well, at least the main character has the same name. His characteristics are different. He acts differently. He even speaks differently. The science is all over the place. The brutality of the antagonists? Multiplied tenfold.Also, why the shift to a space operatic piece of garbage? We've all seen this sci-fi plot of the ancient alien civilization again and again and again. He thinks he's adding something new, but it's the same old \\"are we really ready to be here\\" tripe.Skip this book. Go read something that an entertainment and not an ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, lackluster style.","review":"I really wanted to like this novel. It's premise of a hard nosed, high tech protagonist in a future society layered with equally high tech and poly-moral antagonists (and aliens) promised a fun ride not unlike that of Neal Asher's Polity universe series. The great ideas and settings, however, did not make up for the disjointed writing style. Also, for some reason the punctuation in the kindle version seems completely messed up. There are way to many \\".\\" in any average sentence. If that was on purpose, then this author needs a punctuation lesson. If it is an error due to conversion to digital format, it needs to be fixed. Morgan needs to read a little Neal Asher to see how this kind of story is done right. However, I see tremendous potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could barely finish it ...","review":"A big disappointment after Altered Carbon. Some serious editing and re-writing was in order here. The writing style, which seemed consistent with the detective mystery plot of Carbon, gets down right annoying in this dragged-out treasure hunt. There are a few exciting & memorable chapters, but my main recollection of this book is the middle 50% spent at the archeological dig, during which the plot barely moves. The characters are not particularly appealing, and the setting is just dismal. Hopefully Morgan tightens things up considerably in the next Takeshi Kovacs novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"As amazing as the first effort","review":"The first novel in this series, Altered Carbon, set up the story in Broken Angels.

The story is basically a video game plot with lots of unimaginative 'war porn' set on a colonial world as a group of mercenaries try to figure out abandoned Martain technology. The characterizations are also video game like; the main protagonist is especially strange, as he's a genetically-modified warrior who is apparently a sociopathic killer, but he spends the entire novel having existential and emotional crises.If you like reading cliched descriptions of interstellar war, you'll like this, but you are probably better served playing Halo or Doom 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but detached","review":"I like space operas and even have time to read about futuristic dystopias, but this story was cold and couldn't decided if it wanted to revel in or condemn the violence that dripped from every page.There are some interesting ideas and if you like your science fiction hard and brutal you'd probably enjoy this though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex & violence for the \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" crowd","review":"Broken Angels is to \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" magazine what Altered Carbon was to the novels of Raymond Chandler. Our futuristic hard-guy, Takeshi Kovacs, having put his gumshoe career in San Francisco behind him, has been \\"re-sleeved\\" once again and is part of an elite corporate military strike-force fighting insurgents on a world called Sanction IV. But he has no qualms about going AWOL when offered a share of the profits in an archaelogical expediton on the same world. What's been found, it seems, is a \\"hyperlink\\" from Sanction IV to an actual Martian battlecruiser parked in space. Like the first Takeshi Kovacs novel, this tale has plenty of sex and violence; one scene of torture and execution is particularly brutal. But it's a page-turner with a satisfying ending, and good escapist science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed adventure","review":"This novel breaks no new ground in the science fiction world, but it is quite a worthwhile read if you want an afternoon of total escape. The hero is an \\"envoy,\\" that is a highly trained warrior, in a universe where what is important is the stored memories, not the wetware, so to speak. He can change bodies if he \\"dies.\\" That obviously makes for an interesting attitude toward danger. He and a group of other soldiers that he has resurrected go after a possible starship that has been abandoned by the ancient, dead civilization of the Martians. Lots of action follows, betrayals, loyalties, etc. This is a good adventure and I look foward to future offerings by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worthy second book","review":"The digitized world of Takeshi Kovacs continues in this very good second novel. Following Altered Carbon is not an easy task, but the author comes through nicely. Envoy trained and from a world surrounded by Martian death machines, Takeshi Kovacs is thrown into a search for a priceless Martian relic. Looking for mercenaries in a \\"stack\\" market where shovelfuls of minds are sold by the pail, and the grim business of nuking a city to cover a salvage job really push the boundaries of the Kovacs universe outward. I found a \\"darwinist\\" feel to the novel as multiple agencies fight for dominance during a bloody civil war. As a successor to Altered Carbon, Broken Angels twists how I feel about Takeshi, he is not simply a hard-boiled \\"detective\\" but a real product of his Quellist upbringing and Envoy military training. I greatly enjoyed the character development of this novel, especially the secondary characters that drive the plot.

The plot of this instalment is actually a tad more lucid -- if also a tad more broken -- than the first novel; and the shift from gritty urban detective Takeshi Kovacs to military space-opera mysterious alien archology Takeshi Kovacs makes for a novel with a rather different (and, to my personal tastes, at least, refreshingly so) feel. The plot lags a bit and snags on a few thorns, but never in a boring way; the writing is vivid and engaging throughout; and the characterizations are quite competent. Typographical errors and faux pas were few. In sum: a solid and thrilling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacrificed story to push personal beliefs","review":"Often lecturing, at times overbearing, this could have been a good story except for the excessive page count devoted to educating_ us, repeatedly, into the \\"Way Things Should Be\\".What was subtly done in Altered Carbon has become excessive here, often devolving into Socratic style lectures complete with chorus.

It is not so much the gratuitous violence, probably a marketing gimmick, as the cardboard characters which are anything but three-dimensional: I cannot help thinking I am actually reading a manga (and I am not very fond of manga, either)...Character seem to move about aimlessly, without any obvious drive. One wonders why do they act like they do.The plot is not that interesting either, with the usual devices:1. just in time;2. people are not what they seem to be;3. a hero will overcome most difficulties.I read it through with lots of effort, as if I just wanted to get done with it.No, this is not a masterpiece, nor is original, nor funny, nor anything one might possibly wish to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel","review":"Altered Carbon introduced some interesting ideas. It was gory, but there was some decent characterization. This one is just fight scene after fight scene. Characterization is poor, plotting is poor, and there are too many \\"twists\\".

Unfortunately, the card doesn't work properly. Once I write the music files to the card (a VERY slow process, taking about 10 minutes to write the entire card, given the turtle-like write speeds), my player doesn't see about half of the tracks/albums. I've tried emptying and rewriting the card multiple times, as well pulling all of the tracks out of their album directories and writing them to a single, top-level directory, all for naught. I can't discern any rhyme or reason as to what it recognizes and what it doesn't, which changes each time I rewrite the files. I also have twice run into mysterious errors (\\"Cannot create file or directory\\") while trying to write to the empty card. I'm stymied, and will be returning the card."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful of this one","review":"A friend gave me this card for free, when I travled to Arizona.

The title is just right: this is an IDEA book that goes beyond pretty pictures to give you valuable information about surface options, cabinets, pantries, appliances, and lighting.The pictures are beautifully produced and give unusually useful shots of a variety of styles of kitchen and living spaces. Detailed floor plans for many of the designs add to the value of thesepictures for the home improver. I found some of the most helpful sections those on cabinet accessories, pantry ideas, and the pros and cons of various countertops. There is also invormation on kitchen accessibility.I know that this book will change the way you think of your kitchen and what it could be. Knowing about all of the possible options can really help you to create the kitchen of your dreams (if you can afford it! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"many picture ideas, short on substance","review":"A book with a picture collection of ideas, but very dated if not outdated. Many kitchens appear based from the 1960s era. The book almost comes across as a gathering of many old pictures assembled to glean the final dollar profit in book publishing. Despite what the lead review suggests about \\"Its sharp photography\\" - photo reproduction is second rate. For those just starting the thought process and starting with minimal knowledge of kitchen building the book represents a possible starting point, but lacks true substance beyond that point. Those looking to build an upscale kitchen are well advised to look elsewhere; \\"At Home With America's Top (26) Chefs\\" is arguably the best of the best, a book with solid ideas and concepts applicable even to the more modest kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this skate board","review":"very poor quality skate board.

For example, the movie had three hunters, the book has five - The first drafts of the film started out with five hunters. Also, the first chapter is set in 2000 BC and the second in 1904, so the book lays more of a foundation for the plot than the movie.

That way, if I didn't like the book, then I could at least get my money back.I sure was happy I made this decision because, if the book is any indication, the movie will be horrible.

This book is a waste of paper. While the stories would be good, the obvious attempt at making a cheap zen photo copy of \\"Chicken soup for the soul\\" AND the childish commentary spoils the book. I had to wonder at times if the author had even read what he had written. The author claims to be a Catholic Zen? (Maybe he means Zen Catholic) The short index of further reading in the back is PROBABLY the extent of the authors knowledge of zen. I do not feel that the author is commited to his work!

Unwilling to give up on it, I had the best luthier in my area carve a compensated mandolin bridge for it, dress the frets (which were rough and not level), and adjust the neck. This work cost more than the instrument itself. The result: a wallhanger, except that the thing isn't attractive enough to be an ornament.

I once had the chance to listen to the \\"Costes 3\\" collection but I didn't like it then!I really don't know why I didn't like \\"Costes 3\\" then, because a few months ago, I listened it again at a friend's house and I loved it! So I decided to order it (from Amazon)! Now, after a couple of months since I bought it, I must say that I am quite pleased with it. As a matter of fact I like it a lot!

Well first there really aren't more than one or two songs I'd really want to listen to. Most of the music is good but rapidly forgettable. Second the placement of the songs doesn't make sense to my ears. This is, I think, a CD that is supposed to create a mood. It doesn't. I've heard HC 2 and it seems to be a better CD. In conclusion I wish I hadn't spent the money on a CD that is a third stringer.

If you want something that reads life-like check out Fred Seaman's - The Last Days Of John Lennon, or John Green's - Dakota Days, both hard to find. Much more real than anything Rosen writes, as I found his book fell far short of anything substantial. And If you'd read the other books, you wouldn't find anything illuminating in Rosen's. If a book could flatline, this would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Man? Nowhere Book!!","review":"I was disapointed with this lackluster attempt of a book!! The Last Days of John Lennon was much better at giving readers a glimpse of Lennon's final years. It seemed that Rosen was regurgitating what he remembered from some old diaries.Which wasn't much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Man-The Final Days Of John Lennon","review":"It makes me very sad to see some of the positive reviews that I've read about this book. The book completely contradicts everything that John Lennon was saying in interviews just before his death. It made me realize that this book is nothing but a fantasy, and the writer is just trying to make money off of John Lennon's name. The real sadness here is that a lot of people will probably believe what's written in it's pages, and John is not here to defend himself. If you want to really know what was going on in the last years of John Lennon's life. Then listen and believe the words from John Lennon himself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and interesting.","review":"First of all I am not a big reader but this book got to me. I could not put it down. I really felt close to Lennon and it made me realize that this guy is a lot more human than I ever thought.

I do recomend this book to music lovers and people just generally interested in a good man's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome demon movie!!!","review":"I have this little gem on vhs and would love to get it on dvd. This would be an instant horror classic if they would just release it on dvd. This movie is about an ancient demon who cuts off peoples heads. Kay Lenz is a seasoned actress and with her co actor make this one of the most entertaining horror movies of the 90's. I would say it's kind of a mix between Evil Dead and Army of Darkness but without the puppet animation of the latter.

This is a wrenching and honest and wonderful novel for all women and men who dare to explore the universe and their evolution of self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a scientist or female, but I loved this book!","review":"Excellent writing and riveting story. It was remarkable how easily I could feel the array of emotions her characters were experiencing. Thoroughly enjoyed Riddle's poetic style of the lighter first half until the dark clouds started moving in.

As such, this book tries to justify a war by hyping up all the bad things happening in North Korea. He is also trying to sell his book by sensationalizing North Korea like a cheap tabloid. He thinks that America can save the North Koreans by destroying their country. This book is almost a neocon propaganda - very biased, and one-sided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized, hard to follow","review":"Becker provides a relatively detailed exposition on the history of Korea and how the reign of Kim Jong Il came to be. Unfortunately, the book lacks a coherent organization and is, at times, difficult to follow. It's almost as if he had a set of anecdotes he wanted to include in the book and hastily organized them into chapters. One page he's talking about Italian chefs being flown in with pizza ovens to teach Italian cooking, then suddenly there is discussion of Stalin and Mao.It's unfortunate because there is good information in this book (I think) and it's an interesting read, but it could really benefit from being written chronologically and just having a better organization overall.Personally I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided and badly edited","review":"It is not the author's fault that the \\"victory in Iraq\\" which he often refers to turned out not to be that clear-cut. However, other shortcomings of the book are his responsibility. He is too much of a neo-con to write objectively. Furthermore, the book seems not to have been edited. His text is repetitive, his grammar is wrong at places, he refers to someone as Jong and then Yong three paragraphs later. Makes it hard to take its all-too-important points at face value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely recording well worth the small price tag","review":"I enjoyed this recording very much. I feel fortunate to live in an era when so much Baroque music is available in digital format and performed so well. Naxos is the label that has consistently made this era in music easily available to a growing audience by recording ensembles that might otherwise, unjustly, be known only to very localized audiences.This well made recording of Locatelli's music, at such a reasonable price too, is sure to be a welcome addition, often played, to the music library of Baroque music enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for baseball enthusiasts","review":"This book is a must have for anyone interested in baseball training.

Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Applying Science to Baseball","review":"Applying exercise science to a ritually traditional sport is what Dr. Coleman has done with 52 Week Baseball Training. Excellent sections on scouting and seasonal training methods. I enjoyed the division of training into 5 phases with gradual intensity and specificity of training during those phases.

Of interest is that the problem is the worst with my home movies but after I re-burn them using different burning S/W they seem to be okay. I could live with this but now when using the VCR side the picture started skipping (like my black and white TV did growing up). It's now gotten too bad to watch. I tried brand new high quality tapes and cleaning the heads with no luck. This has been the shortest lived VCR I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"VCR is OK but DVD is problematic","review":"I bought this unit a year ago, so I have used it extensively. The first one I received had to be sent right back because the DVD tray wouldnt open. The replacement arrived and it worked fine for most of the full year. However, over the last few weeks, the DVD had developed the skip, and skip-freeze problem that others have mentioned. It always had a little problem where the jump feature or skip ahead feature was used too many times the disk would start to click loudly in the player and the playback would freeze. Simply ejecting the DVD and re-inserting it would fix it, however, now it only provides a few minutes of good playback before it starts to freeze, stutter and click.It's just not a very good DVD player in terms of quality, but it was priced cheap. Only buy this unit if you plan on replacing it in a year or are more concerned with the VCR playback, otherwise get a dedicated DVD player and dedicated VCR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge piece of junk.","review":"I bought this on Amazon 6 months ago and wish I didn't. I didn't listen to the bad reviews. Now this DVD player is freezing up on the picture anywhere from every few seconds to every couple minutes. Sometimes you have to FF or stop it to get it to play again. Plus if you set the timer on the vcr then it automatically goes to the DVD screen and you can't watch any t.v. This is really bad for people who use timers a lot which I do because I have them set for every week so the timer is constantly on. Plus the unit is kind of loud which other reviewers wrote about. Now the DVD player is unwatchable because who wants the picture constantly freezing up (this was for both DVD rental movies, dvd's I own, and dvd recordings of home videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this unit!","review":"This is more of a love hate kinda thing. First I love the fact that it records and plays DVD's that the same time! The only other unit I have found that does that is an Apex. The picture is great both in tape and DVD. Now for the bad! The remote control, its white with black (with is OK) and orange thats right orange lettering with is hard to see when trying to use the unit at first. Also its not a smart remote, ot only works for the unit. Other than the remote it's a great unit, it has all the bells and whistles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but doesnt work well.","review":"I normally have had good experience with Toshiba products but this combo DVD/VCR has not performed well. DVDs often freeze up. I have a Phillips DVD in another room and it always seems to have little trouble playing DVDs that have be freezing up in the Toshiba. It is nice to have the combo player although you will not be able to copy dvds onto tape due to copy protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD player is terrible","review":"The DVD player won't play many DVD's, even freshly unwrapped new ones. Freezes and stutters. Simply the worst piece of electronic gear I've ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not the best","review":"This is my first DVD player. I bought it so that I could watch some old TV favorites on DVD. The only problem I have encountered so far is with the DVD portion of the machine. There are shadows on the screen whenever I watch a DVD. By that I mean that whatever channel my TV is on shows through on the DVD picture. You can actually see the outline (or shadows) on the DVD picture. It is like watching two shows at one time. I am not too upset because I did not pay a lot, but if I had it to over again, I would have bought a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I would strongly advise people not to buy this product. They are poorly made and the customer service is lousy. I'll be buying a different brand of electronics from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon shipping is the killer","review":"WHATEVER you do, if buying this or any other item from AMAZON, triple check your shipping information. If you've ordered before, they assume you want it shipped to the same address as the last time. And, once you've submitted the order, it WON'T be CHANGED... regardless of where it is being shipped. If the item was in-stock, AMAZON considers it shipped the moment you hit the \\"submit\\" button and will NOT change or cancel the order from that moment on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lines","review":"I was very disappointed with the quality of this VCR/DVD player. When playing a DVD and VCR tape, it had LINES through it. If the tape/DVD had words, you could not read them. This included new VCR tapes taped from TV, and store bought tapes/DVDs.The remote took some time to figure out how to tape TV shows.But maybe it's just a lemon, I've order a replacement and hope this one is better. By the way, amazon.com return process was simple and fast. The unit was picked up on Wednesday and my new unit arrived on Thursday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent customer service from Toshiba","review":"I had the V 391 model for a year. That model developed skipping and freezing when the DVD was playing. I called Toshiba customer service. They replaced the 391 with a 392 model. So far, the 392 is working perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little unit","review":"I was shopping around for a vcr and a dvd player and considered individual units, combination units, combination with home theatre system units. This Toshiba made the most sense in terms of bang for the buck. So far the unit works great. The switchover from DVD to VCR is a bit clumsy but it works fine. If you are expecting a high end unit, go elsewhere, and don't buy a combined machine. If you are expecting good quality with a great price from a brand you can trust, this is a good unit. It has av jacks on the front for camera/game system, and digital audio and standard jacks on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This unit would not play 90% of my DVD's. You would be watching the movie and all of a sudden it would just stop and freeze, then jump ahead anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes more into the movie. Other times all of a sudden the top half of the screen would go black and the bottom half would be a mumble, jumble of pixels. I tried hooking it up to two other different brands of TV's in my house and it did the same on all of them. I wouldn't recommend this combo to a dead dog. Needless to say I returned it and exchanged it for a different make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider another brand","review":"I wish I could get my money back! After the third use of the DVD, the rented dvd got stuck in the unit. I had to return the unit to the manufacturer (I had to insist that they pay for shipping), and was promised a new unit. During the one month I waited for a replacement, calls to customer service were fruitless. Timer recording on the vcr and ejecting a tape is a two-step process; too complicated compared to my other three VCRs. Buttons on the remote are too small and the lettering is even smaller! Will never buy another Toshiba product based on poor customer service performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this model and from the get-go VCR playback images were grainy and poor quality. Within three weeks, the VCR stopped recording properly. I am in the process of returning it directly to Toshiba. Btw, their customer service dept. was not very friendly or helpful. This is the last time I'll ever buy a Toshiba product."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor performer","review":"After reading a LOT of reviews, this combo sounded too good to be true. It was. Set up was EZ and instructions were simple. The remote was OK however the red lettering on tan made hard to read. Problem is the VCR recordings are awful. Used new tapes, still awful. The DVD also is not the best. Occational freeze and skips. Not happy, returning it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"One year later......","review":"While watching a movie in the VCR I can see the bleedthroughfrom the channel it happens to be on. Would never purchaseanother toshiba product, ever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just barely accptable","review":"I have waited several months to give using this unit a fair chance to prove itself, but there are just too many features that are not user-friendly to warrant anybody else getting stuck with this piece of junk. A few of my gripes:1. There is nothing intuitive about setting the timed recording features. One almost has to learn and remember a programming language to be sure to get it right given the bewildering array of all-too-small buttons.2. As some one else said too -- it won't record in LP; just standard and super long-play.3. It freezes up all too frequently in DVD. Not fatally, but annoyingly. Taping often have major \\"static\\" bursts recorded.4. For some reason it turns on DVD when it shuts off after recoding a TV program in VHS. If you try to record two sequential programs on different TV channels it won't do it while you're watching the TV.All-in-all, not something worth buying. Hardly worth bothering with as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"There is a class action suit for customers to get their money back. My previous Toshiba VCR had lasted 15 years, so I exkpect good results. I bought mine about a year ago. The controls are very complicated. About a month after I bought it the Video would only come out part way. The I would then have to push the eject again and pull the video out. Now it has completely stopped and I am looking for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD player can't get through a movie without skipping!","review":"The DVD player in this product will not get through a movie without freezing and skipping through the entire thing. I tried to play a 20 minute Pilates DVD and it wasn't finished until 35 minutes later because of all the stopping. It's infuriating! I wish I could get my money back, but now I'll just have to trash it and buy another. Don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for Short Term Use","review":"My husband won this VCR/DVD player at a trade show, so we got it for free. It worked fine for about 1 1/2 years with very light use (maybe playing one DVD every month to two months).Last night I watched a movie on it and it worked fine. This morning, it is completely dead for no reason. Basically it appears power is just not getting to the machine. I have read several other reviews to this effect on this product and other Toshiba products, so I don't think this is a freak occurrence.Basically, I think this is a fine product if you get it cheap and recognize that it is not a quality piece of equipment that will serve you for an extended length of time. I find it slightly extra annoying that there was no warning whatsoever that it was on its way out, but it is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long","review":"I bought this unit in September of 2004 and was very satisfied with it. Then, for no reason, it just died in January 2007. Seemed like a connection was loose and that electricity wasn't getting to it, but everything was hooked up tight. I had to use a butter knife to pry open the DVD player to get the DVD out that was in it. I think it should have lasted more than just a bit over 3 years with little to moderate use. I replaced it with a JVC that got great consumer reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a year and a half","review":"Very disappointing. I've been a loyal Toshiba customer and used the machine, but did not overuse it, and cleaned the heads regularly and one night, barely a year and a half after purchase it just died. The cost of repair was not worth the investment and it was well past the warranty so I discarded it. It's a shame, I liked Toshiba products but I don't plan to buy another one now."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP, and you sure get what you pay for!","review":"I've had mine all of 4 months. Oopps, that's not true, I had to send the first one back in Dec., DVD skipped. Two weeks LATER, another one arrives. Note, under the generous 90 day warranty, you have to ship them your unit, then they ship back another.Now, the VCR doesn't work, after playing probably 5 tapes in 4 months. I guess it just couldn't stand the heavy use.If you buy this dog, keep all the packaging and buy a back up, hopefully not a Toshiba!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Went bad before 90 day warranty was up","review":"Do not like the pause. After 5 minutes it starts playing again. Would rather it shut off or something other than playing. I have to rewind and find my spot again. After 2 months the tracking went South. Cannot track with ATS or manual. Am sending it in for service today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"I bought this combo unit for an office in Dec 2004. It literally has been used a handful of times. At exactly the one year mark, the dvd player started freezing up during movies, very annoying to have to restart a movie constantly. Now it sends only sound from the dvd player, no picture at all! I hesitated buying a combination unit, but I figured since it was going in an office for minimal use I was pretty safe. Save your money and go for separate components."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to please husband","review":"We are very happy with this purchase. Bought it for our bedroom. Now my husband wants one for both the guest room and the playroom.

Burlap to Cashmere is one of the best exceptions of the decade of angst ridden pop. The songs are deeply moving and stirring. The classical-nylon guitars are virtuosic in their performance and dynamic sensitivity. I haven't heard anything like it in recent years. The sheer passion of the music comes through the CD with great clarity. The world beats and complicated rhythmic meters are stunning in their execution. The desperation and simultaneous hope of the lyrics come through. I have no idea why we haven't heard more from these guys. They easily are one of the best bands to have come in the modern era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"Must say I'm sorry that burlap is no longer... Maybe one of best bands ever...

The album stinks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Group is a Force!","review":"I just read most of the reviews posted here and I couldn't be in more agreement. It seems the general feeling is Burlap to Cashmere is having a significant impact on anyone who listens. I've listened to Christian music now for 15 years and I can honestly say the future of this genre is B to C. No longer are artists afraid to combine their talents with their faith. I predict this group will make their way into popular music and soon. I look forward to their next release. To all listeners who don't know Jesus now you may have some insight why a belief in Him is worth singing about and why a talented group like B to C would have it no other way. Thanks be to God and Burlap to Cashmere for your witness and courage. I think I'll play this CD right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Here a note from a music-fan from the Netherlands (or Holland, as most Americans say). I saw Burlap To Cashmere several times when they were touring in the Netherlands (also on the Flevo-festival) in august 1999. I was surprised; it was one of the best bands I ever heard! I bought both their cd's and Anybody Out There is really fabulous. I put a tape in my carstereo and it has not been out there since! What a music, greek, italian, latin, american, a perfect mix with an excellent percussionplayer and acoustic guitarist. You must buy this cd, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Anybody Out There\\" a must have!!!","review":"Imagine Jars of Clay or Toad The Wet Sprocket with a Greek/Spanish flair, and you have an idea how good Burlap To Cashmere is. BTC is probably the most creative, energetic, and passionate Christian band I have ever heard, even more so than my longtime favorite, Jars of Clay. And if you can't get over the fact that they are a Christian band, then you're missing out on some great music! The lyrics are very spritual and inspirational without sounding cheesy or cliche'. The music also has some interesting guitar work and infectious conga rhythms. You won't be able to keep yourself from dancing to \\"Basic Instructions\\". I have not heard one bad review about this band's music, and if anybody out there doesn't like this music, then there is something wrong with them! Bottom line is, do yourself a favor and buy this album! It is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is my first Burlap to Cashmere exposure.

I love and listen to each song, I think there is only one half of a song that I don't 100% love on this cd. If you like the guitars of Dave Matthew's Band then this cd will make you pee your pants; it's very up-tempo and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish rhythms meet CCM","review":"It is the mixture of this album, which makes it so interesting and valuable. Mediterranian tunes, like \\"Basic Instructions\\", \\"Skin is Burning\\", \\"Divorce\\", and \\"Scenes\\", are combined with the finest accoustic rock sounds. The strongest songs on the CD are: \\"Eileen's Song\\" and \\"Anybody Out There\\"; both worlds are represented there. The spanish guitars throughout the album are excellent! There is no other band that dares to mix sounds like Burlap To Cashmere and very few play on such a high standard, thus I think they are worthy of being at the top of the Christian music scene. I hope they make another great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great albumn","review":"I first heard Burlap to Cashmere at Big Spring Jam (Huntsville Alabama) back in Sept. '99.

I own I-Pod docking stations that are far more expensive, yet inferior to this product overall.

However, it wouldn't play DVD-Rs so I decided to upgrade to this model. I was shocked to find that this newer model was severely lacking in comparison: You can't change discs while you're watching, the simple and great joystick-type remote was gone, the player was buggy and slower to respond, the optical audio output was gone, and you can't select a disc by number. I returned it, had the firmware upgraded on my old (but high-quality) SD-3205, and enjoy watching DVDs (and DVD-Rs) again. Sad to say it, but Toshiba really dropped the ball on this product line, especially since it started out so right."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"I discounted the bad reviews on this site and bought this DVD/CD player in July. We have been using a sub fifty dollar model for a couple of years and I wanted to replace that and our CD changer with one unit. I wanted to go with Toshiba because we have a Toshiba TV, I thought we could use the new remote with the our old TV and consolidate some remotes.The first disappointment is the remote control's layout, it is the worst. It's all most unusable.Then 4 out of 5 DVDs played will freeze. I thought that the rented DVDs were dirty or scratched so I have taken to cleaning them before playing, but the sub fifty dollar DVD has had no problems playing the same DVDs that this player freezes.Audio CDs play fine, CDRs will skip and pop, the same CDRs will play fine on other systems.This is the worst purchase I have ever made. Avoid this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap price buys cheap performance","review":"I got this to stop getting up all the time to change disks in my single DVD player. Now I'm getting up lots more trying to get this to work. Other reviews say it's slow to respond - they aren't kidding. Push \\"open\\" to access the tray and it grinds away for ten seconds deciding what to do. More often than not it'll stay closed and go back to the movie. Sometimes (not often) it freezes completely and has to restarted. Being cheap, it doesn't remember where it was and you have to scan through the movie to find your place. Also ultra susceptible to scratches/fingerprints so the picture stops and jumps frequently. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointing","review":"I purchased this 5 Disc DVD player to eliminate two of my console pieces from my audio/video rack. I was hoping that this item would replace my current DVD player & my 5 disc CD player as well.After about a month or so, I realized you are definitely getting what you pay for. When I purchased this, it was under $100. And that's exactly what it is...a $100 piece of useless electronics.It ruined 1 of my child's favorite DVD's because the DVD somehow jumped off the spinner and got scratched while spinning on the player's inner electronics. The only way was I was able to get the DVD out of the player was to unscrew the top and remove most the of pieces to remove the DVD.I've also had problems with skipping & many movies become \\"pixelated\\".

Anyway, this essentially neoclassical program is performed in what I think is fine style by the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Indeed, the selections on this disc fit together so well that success would virtually be guaranteed even with a somewhat average ensemble, but the Orpheus players ratchet it up at least a couple notches more. I think these are among the best recordings of Pulcinella and the Divertimento, and when you put them together with the other two, you have gold, period. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Thematic Content","review":"(1.) The DVD needs a warning, particularly to non-German audiences, because this abstract (meaning - it's so obscure you can read whatever you want into it) parable has allusions embedded in German history and economics.(2.) Filmed largely in a car being driven from one room to another (total of about four rooms). A woman (Yella) is looking for a job, has had a bad marriage, stole some money, died in a car accident.(3.) Acting - hard to say since half of the movie focused on Yella sitting and essentially not doing much. Except close-ups suggest that the audience should look for deep subtle facial expressions.(4.)

It's great to get the resistance bands, but she does not use them enough to provide any real firming. There are very few exercises using them. When they are used, there aren't enough reps to train muscles.The one-mile segment begins with an endless intro to walking by Dr. Ken Cooper. This is clearly filler material that provides no new information. I mean, if we didn't know that walking is good exercise, we wouldn't have purchased the video. The actual walk, for \\"Active Adults\\", is very easy and boring. It ends abruptly--Leslie is in the middle of a sentence!

Only to be thoroughly disappointed with it. I was expecting something along the lines of a knight telling of his own experiences in the Crusades. Unfortunately, the author attempted to novelize the entire era without giving the reader a character to center his/her attention. I got extremely bored and had to quit reading it.I Set Before You This Daymakes better recreational reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unneccesarily complex","review":"This has great anecdotes in it, but I keep getting bogged down in the syntax of the telling and the enormous cast of characters.

Instead, I keep reading, since I've (possibly foolishly) gotten the impression that, while fictitious, this gives a good account of the history of the crusades and its cast of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights! Camera! Action! Blood! Yummy!","review":"Essentially a yawner. I couldn't believe this was the same Evan S. Connell who had me spellbound with Son of the Morning Star. If you buy into the book's conceit -- an authentic diary/tale of sorts from some chap about whom I could care less -- well and good. But look for a real slog a la Cold Mountain. I found myself thinking several times, Hey! Didn't I read about this (or these) particular slaughter(s) ten pages ago? Nope, brand new atrocities. One or two per page. And if you can keep track of more than two or three characters throughout this book, you're a better mental juggler than I am. I counted eleven new historical figures in the space of two pages! Was I to remember them? Would they be coming back later in the book? I guess Connell gets some credit for unearthing all this historical jacalap but it just rolls off the pages, word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, page after page until you say to yourself, Enough! Deus lo volt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a great fan of Evan S. Connell's Son of the Morning Star, which I consider the finest work of American Military History ever written. This led me to read this book (historical novel?) on the panorama of the 12th century crusades. The tone and scope take the view of a medieval narrator, which may have been an intriguing literary device, but the complexity of events, broad scope of characters, and multiplicity of details do not lend them selves well to this approach. Despite my moderate interest in this era and events, I bogged down at somewhere between 250 to 300 pages and I'm unlikely to move beyond this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring for Me","review":"One of the amusing conceits of this novel is that it is written from the point of view of a real Crusader, and expresses all the prejudices, religious dogma, and ethnic hatred of such a compaigner. All infidels' souls fall \\"screaming into the pit of eternal fire\\" as the Saracens die. But Christians, even when they die while doing a little of their own raping and pillaging, ascend straight to the arms of God. But once you get past this, there isn't much else there. I seldom give up on a book once I start it, but if anything happened past page 150, someone else will have to tell me about it, because that's where I stopped. This story is boring, boring, boring. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Tedious than a Textbook","review":"I have some background knoweldge of this era, and what I thought was sufficient interest to overlook the flaws pointed out by other reviewers. I was wrong. In all fairness, I could not finish the book and after three attempted starts in one week I determined life was too short to waste time on this sort of \\"fiction\\". I tried skipping ahead, I tried reading the sections involving historic sites I have visited previously, and I tried starting over again. I failed. Deus lo volt indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Writing a book in the \\"voice\\" of a medieval writer is an interesting but flawed idea. As a result, the book provides neither the context, sweep and intrepretation that a modern history would provide nor the personalization and immediacy that a novel would yield. The book becomes an endless repetition of gory barbaric acts interspersed with religous exhortations appropriate for the time. Save your money-it get two stars for the ingenuity of the concept and admiration for the research involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable historical fiction","review":"I liked it, and it kept my interest throughout. I was on a Crusades reading binge, and found this one of the more interesting books on that important two centuries of turmoil. If you like historical fiction, this is worth the read. Connell, I read somewhere, said that virtually the whole book is excerpts from translated accounts of crusaders and others of the period, so that he does not himself regard it as a volume of fiction; but it reads that way, and is quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker!","review":"I read approximately one book each day and tend to be forgiving of authors' faults but this one...what a stinker! It seems like one long run-on sentence. And frankly, a lot of what it says is just plain offensive.

For that matter, I am not a cannibal either, and even cannibals would be offended by this author's claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Sorry folks, I could only make it through the first 50 pages before I found that reading the ads posted on the walls of the train were more exciting than this book.

But within a month it just stopped, and no amount of tightening, checking or prodding will get it going again. If I had the time or inclination to babysit a sprinkler, I would have bought one for $20, not $60. You're paying for the convenience it supposedly offers -- to set it and leave it to do its thing.To make things worse, Melnor's customer service response was to ask me to send the mechanism back (at my expense of course.)

That's fabulous. The Kindle version, however, gives the reader a couple verses, a page or two of blank space (but for a vertical line down the screen) and then some of the definitions, effectively removing the definitions from their context and making comprehension prohibitively difficult.I have no qualms with the hard-copy version. It's just the Kindle adaptation that frustrates me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is not the same as the print version","review":"I bought the Kindle version of this book to use in a small group Bible study; the rest of the group is using the printed version. I have done this previously when we used a MacArthur Bible Study, and it worked well. Based on that experience, I bought the James study book. I found out while meeting to discuss the first lesson that the Kindle version is very different from the rest of the class. That is because the Kindle version is from the 1998 print version; the book was revised and re-released in 2007.I don't know why the Kindle version of James is not the 2007 edition, especially when other books in the series have released the newer versions for Kindle. It's very disappointing to have to write a bad review because of something like this, but I can't give it good marks.

Certainly for Me.","review":"This is a quiet collection of short stories which transport you to the border between Russia and China in the 70s. The author does not insult the reader's intelligence by leading him to judgment of the protagonist or secondary characters, rather paints a picture of life on this border as experienced by Chinese soldiers raised and living in an environment which offered/tolerated little, if any, discension or independent thought.

I especially like the way Ha Jin chose to tell the story of two young lovers running off in \\"Too Late\\"; the joyous scene of camaraderie at the end of \\"Uncle Piao's Birthday Dinners\\"; and the complex motivations of the narrator of \\"The Fellow Townsmen,\\" who does the right thing against his own instincts and his own best interests.

It is ok in giving strategies for the test, but I would recommend that you do as much reading and essay writing as you can during the summer prior to taking the exam. Like any other AP test, this is not an easy test unless you have a greater understanding in English, which is developed through many years of experience and practice. Although this was my first AP exam in English as a junior in high school, this book somewhat did help me during the months before the exam. I would recommend this book if you have enough time for preparation.

But either it's intended for kids (despite it's length) or it needs a more adult writer to make it work.It's not a bad book but if you are above a certain age and have read a fair bit of science fiction you're probably not going to want to buy book 2. Read yes, but not buy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with the sequel","review":"Easy-to-read (short chapters), but simplistically-drawn story (author is a screenwriter?). Some interesting concepts, but not worth reading the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good soft-core Sci-Fi!","review":"I found 'Hidden Empire' to be a brilliant and entertaining beginning to a space opera epic! After having read the first few chapters I was honestly expecting a series with a more 'hardcore' science-fiction theme, but I was soon surprised (and delighted) when I discovered that in fact it has a more character/plot-centered theme. I found the pace steady and enjoyable, the chapters were bite-sized and often left me on-edge, the characters were well portrayed, yet Kevin left a certain ora of mystery about each one which I am sure will be developed and revealed in subsequent novels.I recommended this book to more soft-core science fiction fans who want high science fiction adventure without the scientific jargon. I look forward to the second installment 'A Forest of Stars', and to finding out what becomes of the characters I began to love reading about, each in their own story, and each in their own corner of the galaxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid","review":"This is turgid stuff. And the more you read it the worse it seems to get. Anderson has written a science fiction that is more like a 1960s space opera than the true science fiction works of Asimov, Clark and Heinlein. In this world the English speaking interbreeding aliens sometimes have some special force integrating them, but not always.The writing is dreadful and monotonous and character development is so inconsequential that I now, mere months after reading this book, cannot think of any important character name, nor anything worth bothering about them. I simply lacked any involvement in this work.How this should be spun out to 7 books, I do not know. I think the author should concentrate on one good book before attempting such a long series.This is a book to make you embarrassed to read science fiction. Needless to say I will not be bothering with the sequels (despite the shameless way this book stops mid story in an attempt to force you on)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story - no meat","review":"I had high hopes for this series, so I bought the first book and after reading it I'm glad I didn't buy any others. While the story is excellent, the individual characters become lost. I found myself rooting for the hydrogues. The book spends far too much time on the leaders and their political motives then on the more interesting characters who, as I said, are severely lacking. There were only a few characters that I found interesting and they only had minor parts in the book, and after looking up what happens to those specific characters in the later books I discovered I don't want to continue the series. I would recommend getting this title from your local library to try it out before making any purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"It's depressing that a writer with the obvious lack of talent of Kevin Anderson is obviously making a mint of money. It's also depressing that the hard science fiction scene is at such a low ebb that I, a sci-fi fan for more than 40 years, picked up this book to satisfy my habit although being well aware of the level of Mr. Anderson's talents from the abominable Dune sequels.Despite some interesting plot concepts, this novel is truly awful. The numerous faults of this novel have been previously mentioned: dialogue that could be bettered by Doc Smith, characters that are (almost to a man, woman, or alien) denser than Forrest Gump, and chapters that cut faster than an MTV video. And while I have never required (and actually tend to dislike) the elaborate scientific explanations for future technology that often accompanied Golden Age sci-fi (when many authors were moonlighting scientists), the utter ridiculousness of an open decked ship in the atmosphere of a gas giant made my eyes goggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Waste of Time","review":"Where do I begin? This has to be one of the worst written books I have ever read. I love science fiction, particularly hard sf and space opera, so I was really looking forward to this series. Instead, I struggled to finish the first book. I kept waiting for the story line to hook me in, but it never happened. There are way too many characters, and they all make cardboard look like it has a vivid personality. If publishers wonder why they are inundated with half-baked manuscripts, publishing garbage like this is the reason why. It just leaves the average reader thinking \\"Hey, I could have written something better than this!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy in disguise","review":"The writing is so-so, with most characters staying flat and no real suspense building. There are frequent major logic goofs. Example: The author has the captain of a war vessel comment that sacrificing a single man to obtain fuel that could power the whole fleet for weeks was not worth it, with the fleet being starved for fuel. This is completely unrealistic and stupid.The other thing, and this is the one I really cannot forgive, is that these books are fantasy masking as SF and only showing its true flag in later books. It has elementals fighting each others. It has less and less technology. By book 3, I am ready to leave this unfinished and will mark it down as a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start to good story","review":"I can understand why this has a somewhat low rating, the fact is the story doesn't really pick up until about half-way through the second book. Undoubtedly, some people will never make it that far.Probably the best thing about this series is that I can't predict what will happen and have actually been surprised a few times.Let me cut to the chase: There are certainly flaws in these books but I've kept reading, and I'm someone that will quit a poor-quality book without hesitation. In other words, the fact that I've continued reading the series means it can't be too darn bad.To me 3 stars is average and this is better than average so it gets 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good storytelling... but sadly overshadowed.","review":"I think the author was overly ambitious, trying to hold and synchronize too many story threads simultaneously. As a result you get to enjoy some solid storytelling but then have to wade through entire chapters of frustratingly bad story. Character decision making is schizophrenic - an artifact of characters being forced along a predetermined plot line I suspect. Not only do you see what's going to happen - because the predictable plot makes it obvious - but the author then makes you suffer through pages of characters trying to justify their inconsistent decisions. I think the author realized he was ruining his characters for the sake of an overly complex plot... but he did it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Story in Novel Form","review":"Seriously over-written book.

Many of them don't know each other and there is very little interaction, most of them are doing unintresting things. The action doesn't even begin until vary far into the book. Unfortunately, when it does finally begin, you're still trying to sort out all the characters. Who they are, how they feel about their fathers, where they like to frolic in the forest without shoes...etc...etc...etcThis book has an audience, I'm just not part of it. You may or may not be. If you like a very detailed story with many detailed characters, and you want to know every detail then you might like this book.

Those are some of the best SF I've ever read, but Hidden Empire is so bad I will not be reading any of the rest of the Saga of Seven Suns series. Too bad, I really like space opera as a sub genre in SF, but this book was so bad I had to force my self to finish it because MAYBE something really great will happen and the story will take off. Well...nothing great happened. I would say don't waste your time with the rest of the series, but since I haven't actually read the rest of the book, I don't know, go ahead if you want to...wait! It is a waste of time to read the rest of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple-minded characters, needless detail, badly edited","review":"The Saga of Seven Suns series starts off with a the bold promise of delivering an epic space opera but instead delivers a meandering plot bogged down with pointless descriptions. The series was a gift...I would never have read beyond the first book otherwise. It is tolerable of you skim or skip over chapters. Through the many predictable plot twists and turns, Anderson creates unrealistically dumb characters. Anderson fails to make their various errors believable and instead invests too heavily in over-detailed descriptions of the setting. This series is also the victim of poor editing. The entire story could have been effectively told in three books instead of seven...the rest is pointless fluff and tedious plot manipulation. A tighter story would have been more entertaining and gripping (though perhaps less profitable with fewer books to sell). I will be very cautious about purchasing from this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Executed","review":"An interesting premise, but I found it difficult to plough on through the badly paced narrative, poor dialogue and one-dimensional characters who I didn't believe in behaving as if their IQ is negative.

Paragraphs are awkwardly structured, the pacing stumbles, aspects of the future-society are introduced in spurts, the descriptions are robotic, cliche's of plot and sentence abound, and the characters are a bit bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not the books you are looking for ...","review":"I read the first 2 books of the series and finally quit 1/3 of the way through the third book because I couldn't respect myself if I read any more. The story is good, it's a fun space-opera, but the writing is horrible. The author would receive a C in any lit class on earth for the lack of narrative skills and it upsets me that a publisher would print these books over others that can't possibly be less deserving. There are so many great masters of Sci-Fi out there in the world, please look for them and don't waste time on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak dialogue and characters, But great World Design","review":"Anderson has a good knack for world building -- creating interesting political structures, cultures, social dynamics, and so on.However, he's weak, at least in this book, at creating characters that you want to empathize with and/or which feel real. He is similarly poor at writing dialog, and most of his characters seem to speak in one of two or three modes -- very little distinct personality is shown.The mortal sin of writing he commits repeatedly is to \\"Tell\\" you what someone is about, or what a situation is as opposed to \\"Show\\" you. His characters frequently say what they are about with technical terminology.. it's very odd. It's a damn shame too because his world is pretty cool and have a lot of promise.First book I've been unable to finish in a long time... and I really tried -- 100 pages from the end.Maybe his next series will be better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Crap","review":"I hate this book so much I wish I could erase the time it took me to read it. I actually want that time back.The author steals his ideas pretty blatantly from other authors, most notably Dan Simmons, who does space opera WAY better.

And there are birds that never land anywhere except on this deck. Yes you can find a level in the atmosphere where the pressure is earth sea level, but it won't be breathable air! You're mining hydrogen at that level! You think there would be oxygen in a human usable concentration?

It's a delightful story of a beloved teddy bear, belonging to a little girl named Lucy, who accidentally gets put inside a pile of laundry, and is taken to the Laundromat, where he finds himself, to his dismay, going through a washing machine and dryer. Afterwards, he doesn't feel right being so clean, but fortunately he falls out of the wagon on the way home, and with the help of a dog, two fighting cats, and a little boy with a lollipop, he is soon back to his comfortably smudgy, bearish self, after which Lucy finds him and takes him home.

Theodore is the beloved stuffed bear of a young girl named Lucy, who is not overly fond of neatness. Anyway, the bear accidentally gets into the laundry pile and Lucy's dad unknowingly loads him into a washer at the Laundromat and then the dryer! Theodore faints at one point, and this might distress some young children who are very fond of their stuffed animals (luckily my 5-year-old realized that it was only make believe, otherwise I might never get her stuffed bunny washed ever again!).Theodore's adventures do not end here - he is uncomfortable in his 'new', clean fur and is distressed when Lucy (frantic at not knowing where he is) does not recognize the clean bear sitting in front of her.

I think its great for anyone that works with individuals who have autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information for an old condition.","review":"I have watched Temple Grandin a number of times, will watch it several more, and we have purchased copies to share. The information is more than can be digested or even recognized in one viewing. Recommended for everyone with even the slightest interest or exposure to Autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Where'd it Go!!\\"","review":"I caught this movie in a hotel room while on a business trip. I had never heard of the movie or Temple Grandin. First off let me say, THIS is the type of actor's role that should win an Academy Award for best actress. Claire Danes WAS Temple Grandin in this movie. If acting is the \\"Suspension of Disbelief\\" Claire nailed it.Now for Dr. Grandin, WOW! That is all I can think of to say about such and extraordinary person! She is the type of person our schools should be holding up as a hero, a role model and a great example. If Temple did not have people around her who loved her and who encouraged her to try new things we would not even know who she is. Instead of being looked at as disabled or defective she was looked at as unique and inventive. God only knows how many Temple Grandins have been relegated to mental institutions where they have wasted away or worse yet were aborted and were never given the chance to enhance mankind. Thank you Temple Grandin for being who you are!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THAT DANES WOMAN","review":"SAW THIS ON SKY. PURCHASED COPY. NOT PLAYABLE ON MY MACHINE. NEED RETURN ADDRESS AS END OF DAYS. SAME REASONS ETC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable film","review":"This movie had so much to offer, especially to mothers: watching/helping a child overcome disability and discrimination, letting go of one's child, reward for good parenting, the impact of good mentors, repeatedly bouncing back from discrimination and not giving up, taking on a macho industry and winning, gaining a better understanding and appreciation for autism, the unique perspective every individual brings, etc. Claire Danes did a fantastic job with her role, as did the actresses playing her mother and aunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"The acting was superb and showed great depth. Temple Grandin is a great reminder to keep searching for ways to reach those who think in different ways to help them contribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I viewed this HBO movie with my wife, a speech and language therapist,who has read Dr. Grandin's books and has worked with children in school settings who have aspects of autism. We thoroughly enjoyed the acting of all in the production, but we especially appreciated Temple Grandin's commentary along with the director's and writer's as we watched the movie a second time. Seeing the movie again as she described the scenes, what lead to her behavior, comments as she watched Ms. Danes portray her was truly an insight into Temple Grandin and what an extraordinary person she is. Two nights ago we were fortunate to hear Dr. Grandin lecture a standing room crowd of over 500 people at Colorado State University on her visual learning, on animal behavior and ,basically, on her view of her work and life. The movie is an extraordinary introduction into a life well-lived then and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temple Grandin is a winner","review":"Excellent performance by Clare Danes and ensemble and a solid script make this a great experience for almost any audience over 18."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temple Grandin - The movie","review":"My sister recommended that I see this movie the next time it was shown on tv, but I decided to purchase the movie instead. I was not disappointed. I didn't know that much about autism, but in ads and write ups about autistic children, they didn't appear to be able to do very much, which led me to believe all autistic people were like that. This woman is very different. She is smart, educated, and isn't afraid to lay her condition out for everyone to see. She has made such a difference in the way prey animals are treated and conveys a deep respect for them. I have a completely different perception of an autistic individual now that I know more about her life. I highly recommend this movie. I also purchased her book, \\"Animals in Translation:....\\" Claire Danes did an excellent job portraying Ms Grandin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Somewhat daunting subject matter but an outstanding film with great acting by all.

It is a \\"must see\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I do not know why I waited so long to see this movie; maybe because I am a horror/action flick kind of guy who wants nothing to do with a G rated movie.

Not a good deal at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Movie","review":"Temple Grandin is a biographical movie which features great story telling, great acting, and an important message-we are all different and we all have gifts! The subject of this film is an autistic person who grows up and even thrives despite the challenges and misunderstandings she must overcome. Claire Danes does a great job of acting in this film. And let me also add that unless you are already familiar with Temple Grandin's story, there are some very interesting issues which will likely surprise you and educate you about several topics.I highly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone who enjoys biographic dramas, likes to see people overcome the odds, or wants to learn or teach about autism. Not recommended for young children due to slaughter house scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and good service","review":"Very fast delivery, several days before I expected it.One little problem, when I try to watch this DVD on some computers, I have to change some kind of a country spesific zone ID to be allowed to play it.

I have read several books by Temple Grandin, including Thinking In Pictures. This is by far the most honest portrayal of a person like Ms. Grandin who is diagnosed with ASD. I'm blessed to have a child with ASD and am constantly seeking positive stories of people who live with ASD. Bravo, to Claire Danes who played Ms. Grandin and Julia Ormond who portrayed her \\"warrior\\" mother. I so identifed with Ormond's honest portrayal of a mother who strived for help for her daughter; leaving no stone unturned! I laughed and cried. Thank you to all the educators as portrayed by David Strathairn who work to \\"unlock\\" the true potential of these students. Catherine O'Hara's (Grandin's aunt in the movie) shows how trying yet rewarding it is for family to support and participate in their lives. I bought an extra copy to share with school, family, and friends. God Bless Temple Grandin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars for a well acted bio flick","review":"Sometimes I forget, HBO makes some of the best entertainment available anywhere. This is one of those. Claire Danes gives a remarkable performance as Temple, an autistic woman who has become a professor of animal husbandry at the University of Colorado (I think). Her journey which starts here in high school, shows how determination, a unique intelligence and a mother's refusal to let her daughter be minimized has been an inspiration for many with similar afflictions. Granted, there are scenes difficult to watch, but for the most part this is an uplifting story of some special people and certainly worthy of the Emmy awards the movie received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie","review":"Temple Grandin is an amazing woman. This film is so interesting and inspiring. I have seen it four times and have decided it is my new favorite movie. The acting is convincing, and the insight into Temple Grandin's mind is exceptional. I was equally inspired by the story of Temple's mother and teacher. They saw much deeper than the surface, and recognized her unique and brilliant mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightfull","review":"Good acting to help understand in a small way the way an autistic person's thought and perception process is different from a non-autisitic person's.Rounds out the understanding I got from the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I've shared this movie with my daughter grandchildern and many close friends...it's a wonderful story and life learning lessons..when life is down for me I watch this movie and count my blessings ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Fun movie, and great for gaining insight into autism... at least from one person's perspective.

You will just marvel over her work and passions in this movie about her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temple Grandin","review":"For those of us with a child on the Autism Spectrum, this movie gives us hope. I am amazed at her accomplishments and can only hope that our son does half as well. There are days I think about giving up, but if there is anything that he can do to support himself in the future, I want to help him reach that goal. I want to be like Temple's mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and important","review":"This review may never be read, among so many others, but I must get in my 5 stars. Claire Danes is nothing short of magnificent in her portrayal of this very complicated, very misunderstood person, who was treated so badly by many and had only the best intentions. Excellent support from Julia Ormond, David Straitairn and Catherine O'Hara. Temple's amazing insight is well-examined, and I can't believe that designing a cattle slaughterhouse could be so very entertaining. Her concept of death was so complete, but the concept of living was so confusing to her. I can relate..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie!","review":"This movie is one of the all time classics.

Is that how Amazon does business now? Very disappointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG!","review":"While the acting was amazing the story was not accurate and even the true story is hideous. This is about a woman who in her heart and mind wanted to ease the suffering of factory farm animals. She could not bare the what they were going through, what she ended up doing was making it easier on the workers and making it easier to slaughter an innocent life. This woman is being made out to be a hero this she is not. I gave it one star for the actors the lack of other stars was for the lack of truth and heart in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temple Grandin","review":"Started off as a really good movie, but near the end there was a defect on the DVD, so, we were not able to finish watching the movie.

Watching this movie reinforced the ideas I have had since he was 6 that he was going to do some really remarkable things. He doesn't have the genius that Temple has but his creativity and imagination creates some really remarkable stories which I hope to help put to print some day.

I thought it would make a nice gift because it is creative and active, and unlike some other bead jewelry sets for kids, the relatively large wooden beads made it appropriate for younger children. Unfortunately, upon arrival I noticed the colors were ugly and also the box had a very strong smell of paint fumes. The colors were dark in tone-- dark goldenrod instead of bright cherry yellow, mossy green instead of bright green--and I didn't think they looked very pretty. And if that wasn't discouraging enough, the overpowering smell bothered me enough to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and reusable","review":"I've looked at different kinds of bead sets and tried a few, but this is the one that's actually considered a toy and not just a fashion accessory. Unlike other bead sets that create wearable necklaces but are rather frustrating to put together, this one is easy to thread even for little kids all by themselves and once they're done wearing it and playing with it, we dump the beads back in the box to play with again and again. There is a nice variety of colors (though not precisely what you see in the picture) and plenty of \\"pendants\\" and strings for multiple kids to play with at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Melissa & Doug!","review":"Not suprisingly, this is an adorable product. My daughter owns the heart version and my niece has these butterfly ones. I didn't experience any strange paint smells out of either one of these, and I would highly recommend them to anyone. The only thing that could make these kits better is if they added a handful of letter beads, as I bought some seperately. -Nevertheless, a great toy for crafty kids. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed...the butterfly beads are too wide to go onto the string!","review":"My daughter is really enjoying stringing things these days and I thought this would be a great next step for her. The reviews were all great except about the paint smell, which I wasn't worried about.My daughter was so excited to try these and I thought what great string it has plastic ends which will make it very durable and easy to string...until I tried one of the butterfly beads. The string goes in fine, but there doesn't seem to be anyway to get it all the way through the bead. Once you don't have the plastic to push on it get stuck 3/4 of the way through! So frustrating!!! Now I have to go through the trouble and expense of returning it...maybe I'll just throw it away!Very disappointed and especially in Melissa & Doug products not being cheap to begin with I expect better design and quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but poorly designed","review":"This is a pretty good toy, and lots of fun for a three-year old, but the showcase items, the butterflies, are too wide for the string! What this means is that the string to put through the beads has a stiff plastic coating on the ends about an inch long to help push through the beads. However, the butterflies are longer than the plastic segment, meaning you cannot push the string through. The solution is to find something small and pointed, such as a jewelers screwdriver or a safety pin, to get it all the way through. Needless to say, this is a little time-consuming for both parent and kid, as well as meaning that kids cannot solve this safely on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gift that keeps on giving","review":"My daughter's love this bead set they love making necklaces for each other and for their friends at school.

Plainly said it was a tough year to release a album. But, nonetheless this was well received down SOUTH. You could hardly walk around a corner and not have a car sitting at a \\"RED LIGHT\\" not bumping this. This album was particularly popular with local GANG Members during this time especially the Gangsta Disciples.

I hate it. This could possibly be the most disappointing CD I've ever heard. Why does Raymond want to sound like a robot version of the guy from the B-52s? If you want my honest opinion, Theatre of Tragedy need to get off their high horses. Their sell-out may have even surpassed Metallica's. Has anyone been to their website lately? Talk about a bunch of ego-driven jerks! I'm into metal that has a groove, but I'd still like it to be intelligent. I also like it when people play instruments. Why aren't the guitar players in this band bored?? There's more programming in this CD than there is in Windows 2000! I don't know what possessed them to make an album like this, but they need an exorcist badly. It's sad when a hard core Theatre of Tragedy fan like me just doesn't care anymore. I don't know what they're up to these days (probably playing dance clubs) and sadly I don't care.

If you already know you like some songs off this album, or you are just experimenting with industrial music, I would suggest ToTs 'Aegis', which is overall more consistently good. There are a couple songs on this album that I have to listen to now and then, just for the singer. The bonus track \\"The New Man\\" is strangely the best song on this album, but only because of the vocals, the music itself is uninspiring 3 second loops of palm-muted guitars and some off-pitch synth seemingly thrown in just to make the album sound somewhat interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do bands do this?","review":"Why do bands change their style, trying to gain popular recognition, when history has proven that IT DOESN'T WORK??? Why throw away all the talent they had to make this techno-dung? Anyone who thinks this is more creative and intelligent than their old albums should be shot for ignorance. VDTF and Aegis are still selling better than this. And Raymond can't sing. This is borderline hip-hop and hip-hop is stupid. Well fortunately Liv Kristine left them and is in a band where they'll let her explore the vast reaches of her vocal talents and not robo-talk like that... Rohonyi did with this load of pig ...

I was expecting more of a symphonic experience like Tristania's \\"Beyond the Veil.\\" I am disappointed with the premise that this album is listed in the black metal genre. It belongs somewhere else, preferrably electronica. However, I've heard that TOT's earlier work holds truer to the genre, so I'll probably pick up an earlier TOT album.If you like synth-based music with a Gothic twist, the album is palatable. I rated it two stars mainly for the disappointment of my own expectations, not necessarily for the album itself. I must now deal with the sadness of my own disappointment. Of course, it could have been worse. I could have actually picked up an A-ha cd...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit!!","review":"This is herendous!! What the f*** happened to T.O.T. By far the biggest sell out move ever experienced by these gothic ears. If you hate Goth and like pop and techno than this is for you. If not then avoid immediately and grab their earlier titles.

Its all just a bad dream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"Ok, most hardore fans of TOT would think this album is not as good as the previous ones. Why? Because people are nostalgic about the past. They also don't like changes. They like to keep listening to the same albuns over and over again. TOT decided to move on, to experiment, to try something new and they ended up with an excellent well-produced album. I highly reccomend MUSIQUE, it is definitely differnt from the previous ones - TOT sounds almost like a new band. If you are new to TOT buy Musique and Aegis. Then judge for yourself, or enjoy both phases of this outstanding band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open mind or not just not the same.","review":"I must say as a huge fan of this group I was immensly dissappointed with this new disc.This is not the GOOD ToT it is some attempt at something from out of clear left field. If you liked the old ToT do not by this disc. If you like techno/electronica (lets play the same mundane beat over & over again) then this disc may be for you. For those of you who need to fill the void for this lackluster performance try the new release Oracle Moon by Garden of Shadows killer riffs tons of time changes, beautiful keyboards just downright good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theatre of Tragedy is dead.","review":"A longtime fan of this group, I was elated to see that they had finally released a new album. Elated, that is, until I tried listening to it. I am not a purist and do not insist that everything I listen to be \\"true metal\\", but this is simply inexcusable. This once great band has degenerated into yet another factory for watered down euro-pop trash, causing them, in my mind, to have ceased to exist. Do not buy this album. Instead, I highly recommend that you purchase any other album by this band, or perhaps something by Tristania or The Sins of Thy Beloved, assuming goth metal is what you are after. I mourn the loss of this band, and hope that others like it do not follow the same path to utter corruption."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable techno - gothic rock","review":"When I first listened to this album I was somewhat shocked at the sudden change of style but after listening to it several times I've come to really enjoy it - at least better than their other albums. Even trash - death rock bands like Cradle Of Filth have a couple of techno, beaty songs in their 'From the Cradle to Enslave EP' which is in fact much more gothic and enjoyable than their other songs. TOT have done a good job here, they even surpass industrial leaders like Frontline Assembly which is much more monotone, full of mindless beats and repeating vocals. Liv's vocals, the electric guitars and keyboards make an excellent electro-pop album without losing their 'gothic'-ness. Definitely worth a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick up one of their other albums instead","review":"Compared to their other work, this just doesn't make the cut. It's full of techno-space-pop tunes that don't hold true to the gothic metal/opera genre. Oh well.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT the same band!","review":"Terrible! Once a superior death/goth-metal band, TOT is now nothing more than synthesized techno-pop! And what's with the guy's voice? Personally, I find the exagerated british accent a bit annoying; i repeat, the EXAGERATED british accent.The only reason I give this CD 2 stars is for the female vocals, which are still great, despite the noise in the background.Oh how the mighty have fallen....."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of God!! (and goth music)...","review":"DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!I couldn't believe my ears - is this really ToT? How could they go from forefront leader in Goth metal to bottom class techno pop crap? How? Why??

But ToT is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If pigs could fly and hell froze over...","review":"...then Theatre of Tragedy's \\"Musique\\" would be a good listen. But it's not. Not unless you like electronica and trance-club music. Why the hell would they go from making good, thoughtful metal music to this no-talent-required electronic sludge? They cut most of the guitar parts out and replaced them with programming. I guess if you like stuff like Switchblade Symphony, you might like this, but old fans stay away. Raymond ought to give it up; where did he come up with the notion that he could sing in the first place? And what kind of IDIOT would take a talented vocalist (Liv Kristine) and make her sing stupid pop lines with a dorky robotic voice? Well, at least she did the right thing and left and sounds lots better in Leaves' Eyes.If you're a longtime TOT fan, stay far, far away.

For example, a woman trembles with \\"fear\\" as a rubber spider is pulled across a blanket as she lies in bed. I've seen more realistic scenes (and better actors) in 1950s era 3-D movies! This video/DVD is far worse than any of the old 16mm health education films that I suffered through as a high school student.

Silly me thought perhaps it was in the quality of the tool, so I went and spent about $150 on this iron.

This stroller was a godsend, you can attach two seats and one car seat; two car seats and one seat; three seats; three car seats; or just three seats.

I am back searching for another stoller and I'll admit this stoller is a great concept but it is a Poor Design. My children's combined weight is probably less than 80lbs. With the cost of this stroller, it should last much longer. Peg Perego go back to the drawing board because once you have survived twins or lord bless, tripletts we do deserve much better than this product.

Ricky has kept the same formula he used that made him a smash last year, yet this album is by far superior, especially the ballads, that's where I thought Ricky lacked on his last album.

I thought he veered too much into adult contemporary treacle.But here, the Ricky of old is back with a bang. The Latin beats keep coming and barely stop for breath. \\"She Bangs\\" is a great track but my vote for the best cut on the album is \\"Loaded\\". This has got to be one of - if not the - catchiest songs of the year. I have it programmed on repeat in my CD player.Other highlights - \\"Saint Tropez\\", \\"Amor\\" (great tango), \\"Jezebel\\", \\"One Night Man\\", \\"Are You in It for Love\\".A couple of the ballads are nice too, particularly \\"Come to Me\\" and \\"Nobody Wants to Be Lonely\\" though I prefer Ricky in uptempo mode.For Ricky fans young and old (and new converts) there's something here for everyone.

This album tries valliantly to mimic the sonics delivered last time around and fails terribly. I feel that his best work is shown on his Latin recordings.

The Touch is a cool ballad and One night man has those beats n voice which spell unlike Ricky!

Arriba!","review":"This is the follow-up to Martin's eponymous English debut last year, and it is even better than that initial effort. Much more confident and playful, creative and sincere. The first single, \\"She Bangs\\" is a knockout dance tune that defies you not to move, and there are similar tracks that, if not quite as good as that one, at least set your feet to tapping. The ballads are also outstanding, especially \\"Come to Me,\\" erotic and full of yearning , and \\"Nobody Wants to be Lonely.\\"The inclusion of Spanish versions of the same songs seems unnecessary but they are no flaw in the overall production.

Title track is amazing & could easily be used in some American Movie car-chase. It raises my spirits & goes the whole Latin-Amercian hoopla. The searing ballad Nobody Wants To Be Lonely works better without Miss Diva Aguilera, but in no way parodies Private Emotion from the previous album. Nevertheless, a solid work by Mr Martin, only to be appreciated by much less than last time round. Shame, 'cos he still does get your bon-bon shakin occasionally.

The fast songs are the best part of the album. St.Tropez is a great song, Loaded is one of those songs where when you hear it you have to dance, If You Ever Saw Her and Amor are fun songs to sing along to. The only major flaw with this CD is that Ricky doesn't have a great voice. While this doesn't matter on the action packed fast songs, it sounds very weak on the slow songs.

That's why there are only four stars instead of five. It benefits from the same wild imagination, though, and that's why I was tempted to go for all five stars.Who else but Jasper Fforde would imagine Humpty Dumpty, the egg wearing the cummerbund (\\"or is it a necktie?\\") as the ultimate ladies' man?Who else would plant a clue in the deceased egg's home, and make it a single hair... but one that is 23 feet long.If you have ever suspected that nursery rhymes are just a teeny bit violent, and wondered about the back-stories of those strange characters, then maybe you, too, will enjoy getting lost in a good nursery rhyme/crime.As a Thursday Next fan, it took me a couple of chapters to warm up to Humpty-Over-Easy, but the bursts of wild laughter induced by the egg's (and others) over-the-wall antics more than repay the initial patience.Celine Nisaragi"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed....","review":"This book in no way stands up to the Thursday Next series.

In any case, this is a very clever story. While it has all the ingredients of a good murder mystery, Fford integrates the zany element with his use of nursery rhyme characters, mythological figures, and fairytale icons that partake in the story as though it's the most normal thing in the world.I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish!Rating: 5 out of 5 StarsSuggested With: A good memory of your favorite childhood stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over Easy is Hard to Forget","review":"You have to admire someone who thinks (and writes) outside the box. Jasper Fforde takes the realm of children's nursery rhymes and transforms it into a world of mystery and mayhem that's definitely for adults. The list of suspects who could have offed the womanizing drunkard Humpty Dumpty is as colorful as the folks trying to crack the case, so to speak. Though I found some sections a bit hard to plow through (I can't stick with a page- long paragraph)the humor and downright cleverness of the book kept me turning pages. I loved the fact that in Detective Jack Spratt's world, the fictionalization of the investigation for the local rag is more important than the quest for justice. Straight from the newspaper comes the sizzling headline, \\"Nursery Favorite Dies in Wall-Death Drama.\\" The wildly nutty ending was way over the top in a perfectly wonderful way. A well seasoned story that will really hit the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good, funny mystery!","review":"I first became enthralled with Jasper Fforde through \\"The Eyre Affair\\" and have read all of this books.

It seems that this town in England is plagued by crimes committed by or on nursery tale characters, yet the story proceeds smoothly as a well-thought-out whodunit. The character development is well done with a consistent voice and after a while I started thinking of Humpty Dumpty as a victim of a heinous crime, forgetting that he was a giant egg, and so it goes for all the nursery tales characters that Fforde brings to life and then kills off. Although the crimes can be gruesome, there is a certain lightness to be found in Fforde's style and the book was a pleasure to read. I strongly recommend it for fans of fantasy, but real fans of crime stories might find Fford's eccentricities hard to handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy and Clever","review":"Opening this book is like opening a toychest stuffed with wild and wonderful toys. Perhaps overstuffed, for the only drawback I found was that there was almost too many crazy and clever ideas. However far be it from me to complain that a book is too full of fun.The mystery of the broken Humpty serves as the vehicle for a wide assortment of side-stories. My favorites among them are the \\"Giorgio Porgia\\" crime syndicate, Ashley the Alien, and the love of the immortal fallen Titan Prometheus for young Pandora. That latter subplot yielding the line about Pandora's father being worried about the age difference, Pandora being 20 years old while Prometheus is \\"somewhat over 4000\\".A very quick and enjoyable read for someone new to Jasper Fforde's wackiness, or for a seasoned veteran of the Thursday Next series.

I don't even know Portuguese and this is one of my favorite world music albums. A Brit whose name I can't recall followed up his Nu Brazil compilation with this sequel. I can say with complete sincerity that this album has spawned a huge interest in Brazilian music for me, largely because it doesn't limit itself to just one style but tries to show listeners the incredible range and quality of music that the country's artists produce. If you don't like a certain track, skip it: the next one is almost guaranteed to please. My favorites are track 3 on disc 1, track 9 on disc 1, 6, 8, and 9 on disc 2, and the fantastic closer by Tuze de Abreu, a haunting tune that recalls Portuguese fado at its best. A must buy. I usually don't go in for compilations, but this is a notable exception - all in all, a fantastic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP 23 Ink Cartridge","review":"The HP 23 printer cartridge is defective.

His music sounds very much of the late 19th-century Russian Nationalists: folk-like melodies, rich harmonic treatment, brilliant orchestrations, but perhaps with more counterpoint used to develop his thematic material than is typical of his compatriots. There is a lot of the ballet here. None of the brooding introspection and melancholy, though--surprising, especially since the impoverished composer was dying of tuberculosis when both symphonies were composed.The orchestral playing is polished and brilliant, just as is the recording. (I haven't heard the Jarvi recording, but it's hard to imagine that it could be much better, or that his performance could be more idiomatic.

There doesn't seem to be any way to correct this.There is obviously no quality control on these helicopters (one of the two has a main motor \\"stuttering\\" problem and the other's tail motor doesn't stop when the controller is in the zero position).

After the tail rotor started working controls were just about the same as the RS brand, hoverver i could get this one to litterly FLY across the room in the forward direction (try that with the other one out there), great fun trying to control that speed. It does take some practice to get this speed out of it but if you accelerate slowly you will have an easier time keeping it straight. Flight times have reached 10 minutes, recharged in half an hour. Couple of crashes and no sighns of damage. Hopefuly motors will hold up but so far great piece of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be suckered - even one star is too many","review":"If you're looking for the 2003 version starring Ed O'Neill, don't be suckered into buying this product, because you'll be very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"10x25 binoculars","review":"these are cheap binoculars. for the price, i wasn't expecting much. that's what i got, not much. i was hoping the eye correction would work and you can focus both sides equally, but the left eye piece was off and couldn't be spun enough to work with the right eye. so, both eyes aren't in focus together. not bad, for the price, but i was hoping to have them work a bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information, though a little outdated","review":"Writen and printed in the 70's, it's no wonder that the decorating in this book is completely out of fashion.

For die hard fans who only like traditional R.E. style then pick this up for rent and watch a friend play so you don't miss out on the story. The new gameplay style is only hard if you make it hard. For example if you decide to play with out the Guncon then you are in for a tough time. This game is made for it, use it. And yes you can walk around in First Person view. It is tricky to get used to but invaluable when rounding corners and opening doors. I feel the other aspects (story, graphics, etc.) of this game live up to R.E. standards.

I went ahead and bought it but when i took it out for a run it didn't give me what i expected. I live on the north shore of long island and experienced a lot of static and fading in and out of the stations. I've used other products like the sony ones and didn't experience any of the fading in and out. What really attracted me to the item was its price. I do recomend this product if you exercize at home but if you run in the out doors spend the extra money and get yourself another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koss PP257 - poor reception!","review":"I had trouble with this product, it simply does not receive most radio stations clearly.

A major bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"Although this product had a 3.5 to 4 star rating when I bought it, I do not agree. I found the reception to be poor and inconsistent and the quality to be lacking. At high volume levels, needed when you are trying to do yard work, the sound quality is extremely distorted. I also find that I often accidentally change the volume level by inadvertently touching the control.

I was so excited when it arrived, but my excitement quickly changed to disappointment the first time I tried to use it and didn't get any reception. I know there is great reception at Green Lake because I have a larger Walkman that works just fine. My advice to potential buyers would be... Don't waste your time, you will likely be as disappointed as I am!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception in and out of the city","review":"I bought this radio to use on the walking portions of my daily commute from downtown Chicago to the suburbs (I take the train in between).

The controls were a little confusing, and the signal was sometimes poor. My main complaint is that it stopped working three days after the warrenty expired. Only three month after I bought it. The funny thing is that I bought a similar Sony radio for a friend several months before I got this, and his is still working great at this point, a year after I originaly bought this item. My general suggestion is for you not to buy Koss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...","review":"This radio has generally poor reception.

This product wants you to be either in timing mode or radio mode.

If you just want to use the radio then the product is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good radio for the money","review":"I'm glad I purchased this product. I use it while walking to and from my van pool meeting place each day and it works great. When the second set of headphones for my little Radio Shack am/fm radio went out, I decided to purchase the Koss. The price for the Koss was equivalent to what I paid for the Radio Shack and not far from what a decent pair of new headphones would cost. The sound and reception is better than what I had and the digital tuning makes it easy to find and switch between stations.It was a little difficult to use the first few days in the darkness before sunrise, but now that I'm familiar with the buttons it's not a problem to change the volume, switch station presets or find new stations. It would be nice if the display was illuminated but that would just use more battery power.Also, it seems to be pretty substantial in construction. All in all, a good radio for a reasonable amount of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Koss","review":"I have tried Sony. I have tried another generic brand. Neither one of them received the great reception that I received from my brand new Koss PP257B that I just bought.

My Sony was stolen from the gym (because I made a mistake and left it on a machine), and I didn't even care.

It's light, it will mount easily on anything, and reception is good enough in both bands indoors and out. I used to live close to Green Lake - this radio WILL pick up local AM and FM stations there. If you want to receive distant stations, pick a more powerful radio and deal with the bulk and weight penalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I got this radio so I can listen to the radio while working out.

We replaced the batteries (my husband even checked the batteries with a voltage meter and they're fully functioning) and it still doesn't work. Very disappointing.

This CD encompasses many brilliant work by well known composers in this unique brand of music. Light Music places itself in between classics and popular music.

For example, 'Coronation Scot' is a name of a train/locomotive and the music clearly gives th emotion of a train trudging along the tracks and it is simply magnificent. Incidently, this particular piece was as a theme/signature theme to 'Paul Temple', a popular radio detective show that ran for 4 decades on the BBC Radio.Do give this CD a listen and the compilation doesn't dissapoint and it features music by the King of British Light Music, Eric Coates.Enjoy. This type of music holds a special signficant place in the wide and wonderful world of popular music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation","review":"This album has an excellent selection of light classical works; some of them are still heard often and others should be.

Because these saws have a lot of vibration and are loud I noticed the difference in noise reduction as well as smoother cuts. You do have to keep in mind that the added weight can place added stress on the motor which is a concern in underpowered saws. Also, if you use both at the same time it moves the blade towards the right which might be a problem if you already have a sliding crosscut table or an already cut zero clearance insert. I would recommend only using one on the right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useable for a Delta table saw.","review":"This product was not usable on my saw. If you use both left and right discs, the table insert will not fit. If you use the left disc, it warps the blade and makes it tilt to the right. It had no effect on vibration when using only one disc. I returned the discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I wanted it to do","review":"I mainly purchased these to replace the standard thrust washer that came with my tablesaw. So with that in mind, they work great. As for the stabilizer part, I don't think they add much for standard kerf blades, or at least I don't notice any appreciable difference. I don't use thin kerf blades as a general rule so I can't speak to their usefulness while using thin kerf blades.I hadn't really intended on using both pieces when I ordered them, again intended to replace the thrust washer. One added benefit that I didn't think about is that it shifts the blade over, in my case, to the right. Now I can reuse some of my old chewed up zero clearance inserts!I do only use the outside stabilizer with my dado set."},{"rating":"1","title":"To thick","review":"I have an older table saw and when I tried to install them along with the blade & a required shaft spacer, I could not put on the retaining nut.

I didn't have room to install both on my Bosch 4000 bench saw so I installed one on the outside. Although Freud literature doesn't point this out, these are made to be used only as a pair. If you install only one your blade gets retensioned away from being flat. I noticed this because after installing one, my splitter no longer lined up and I had to adjust the blade 1/2 a degree to get it back to being perpendicular to the table. Perhaps they improve the quality of the cut when used as a pair with a thin kerf blade. I wasn't able to test that. I give them only 1 star because Freud doesn't make it clear that both need to be used. The Forrest stabilizer is made to work as a single unit on one side of the blade. Probably a better choice for most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"I love the old 80's Swatches like this, plastic band, waterproof. The only thing I dislike is that it TICS loud.

The performances by Ensemble Accentus do full justice to this music - largely because it and its director, Thomas Wimmer, have delved into and brilliantly performed the Jewish Sephardic music of old Spain. My only complaints are that there is not enough music here by Juan del Encina; and the singers do not understand the texture of old music. Most singers strive for purity and smoothness of voice and register, but the Renaissance loved loud, deep, rich, overtoned and raspy voices: voices with the sting of crumhorns and hurdy-gurdies. Here we hear some of the instruments played well, but not the larynxes which should accompany them. Nonetheless, a valuable and enjoyable CD for any fan of this era.

I don't think it applies.The tube popped on me half way through our adventure at Harpers Ferry on the Potomac. Not sure if the tube is really to blame, the water was fairly low and I did hit a few large rocks. These tubes also deform fairly easily, and are not very comfortable to ride. This was my first tubing trip on an auto inner tube and we all got fairly bad arm rashes from paddling.If I had a chance, I would definitely \\"splurge\\" and spend the extra $8 for one designed for water tubing exclusively, and maybe also purchase a cheap canoe paddle.

The price has gone up, but it is still worth every penny. Unlike vinyl tubes, they can be patched in the event of a poke or even a large rip and still perform. these tubes have survived briars, sub zero temps and over 200 hundred pounds of rough riding adults.

Instead, the author takes the readers on a very long journey through some 20 years of the XVI century as seen through the eyes of several extremely uncommon people: a noble knight who would rather be a surgeon, a peasant girl who can read and a peasant boy who never forgets a thing. All their misadventures and perceptions are affected by their extraordinary skills and aspirations, therefore making the entire account of their life seem quite artificial. The author never draws any parallels between past and present, never offers any analysis or judgement, and never makes any points.The rest of the characters and events seem like a backdrop for the story of the love affair of the poor girl and her knight in shining armor, and of her brother's inability to define his loyalties.Avoid this book if you value your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less history, more lust","review":"Ironfire by David Ball was a horrible book. It spent entirely too much time on love and sex than it did on the actual story of Malta. Not only that, but it made the Knights out to look like the bad guys, which is completely untrue.

Real people are not evil or good, deceitful or arrogant, brave or cowardly. Real humans are a complicated mix between many things.

The period details are good, but the characters are frequently armed with 21st century sensibilities that did not ring true.Some important historical characters are treated shoddily--poor La Valette--and others given only the most cursory glance.

So I bought her a copy of Ironfire, which I also read. I have to say that, although I finished this book, I was shocked that it was so much worse than Empires. The book is more about love lost and found than the battle for Malta - fully three-quarters of the book passes before the battle starts. But when it does, it goes on, and on, and on. Every day the assaults are more horrible than before (or so says the author). How could the Knights Hospitaler and the people of Malta possibly last another day?

Not a lot of digitally rendered battles or anything either. Visually, this is a fairly dull documentary.It is very informative, however, and I thought the pace and narration was good. It covers a swath of time, from the origins of Spartan civilization to their decline. It is not simply a description of various battles and wars and I think it offers you an interesting and rounded understanding of Spartan society and culture.This is probably interesting to someone very curious about the Spartan with little to intermediate knowledge or someone happy to hear what they may already know from a slightly different persepctive. I enjoyed it and will watch it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better documentaries on the Spartans","review":"This documentary covered what I had seen in other documentaries without anything really new. The only new thing I really couldn't stand was Bettany Hughes comparing the Spartans to the Nazis. This was so juvenile. It was a cheap sensationalist way to fill her narrative. She did it on more than one occasion. Comparing everything militant to the Nazis is old and out of date. Yes, the Nazis would have liked to imitate the Spartans is many ways, but the two cannot be compared. Please skip the cheap sensationalism when dealing with a very interesting ancient Greek society.

For today's standards it's really very small capacity, but I use it to transfer small files, music and pictures/videos I want on my laptop. Transfer rates are acceptable and never an error occurred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small rocks","review":"Just the size of this USB drive is enough to give it 5 stars. I know there are smaller ones out there, but this one is only a tad larger and much more securely built. I've owned a few lexar and SanDisk USB drives, and all of their USB plugs get loose within a month of use. I loved the oversized covering for the drive that covered the whole unit--not just the usb plug. However, I don't think it is offered any more since they have moved to rubber skins for the new models. This is probably for the best since those old plastic protectors would get worn down from use and fall off the drive in transport. As for speed, this thing is definetly USB 2.0 and fast. If you've used a USB 1x drive, you'll notice a huge difference. I have seen some USB drives that perform faster (the Corsair models) but this one is still fast enough. Highly recommended, especially if you can score the rebates. Mine came in almost exactly 6 weeks after purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping is a joke","review":"Shipping on this product is a joke. They advertise the unit for .05 cents each. If you buy one of them the shipping is around $8.00. I thought at .05 I'd order 100 of them. Shipping came to $600.00! Guess they really don't want to get rid of these. C'mon...stick 100 in a box and ship them to me for the $8.00. Stupid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruzer Micro: plastic snail","review":"Pros: The design is perfect. Small, very sturdy, nice LED, keychain ring, nice price.Cons: Being an usb2.0, it is nearly unusably slow. Writing lot of small files takes FOREVER, meanwhile you can have your dinner comfortably (half an hour or more!). Average USB 2.0 drives do this about 3-4 times faster. Dealing with large files is better, but also much slower than competition. I absolutely NOT RECOMMEND it if you regularly want to move lot of data in a copy'n'go style."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware!!!","review":"This seems like a good buy until you go through the checkout and find out they charge more per piece for shipping and handling than the item costs!!! $3.99 for the flash drive $4.00 for the shipping.

The advertisement of this SanDisc drive for .51 cents with a shipping charge of almost 6 dollars on EACH one of them is disingenuous and borders on hucksterism. I would not want to see Amazon head down that road. FYI, I initially ordered 10 of these drives, the charge would have been $5.10 plus reasonable shipping. However, with shipping it was over $65.

I copied a 105 MB file in 70 seconds. This is a bit faster than USB 1.1 but is less than I thought I would get. By comparison my USB2 hard disk, an IBM travelstar in a generic BAFO enclosure, copied the same 105 MB file in 7 seconds. There are no product specifications on the company web site so it is not as if they are not meeting spec I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing Product","review":"This is the third portable USB drive that I have purchased. Each purchase was driven by the fact that I constantly needed to upgrade to one with more memory. At first this seems like something that had been well-designed, but within the first use I clearly saw that their product designers/engineers no nothing about what a consumer looks for in this type of product. They were too busy putting the blue light up feature in that they completely ignored everything else. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SANDISK PRODUCT AGAIN.CONS: LID IS LOOSE, COMES WITH AN ADDITIONAL PLASTIC THING THAT HAS NO DESCRIPTION FOR WHAT IT IS FOR, DESIGNED THE KEY LOOP ON THE WRONG END OF THE PRODUCT (My previous Sony had an option to add the key attachment to either end, which is helpful so your keys aren't hanging off your computer), AND WORST OF ALL - THEY MARKET THIS PRODUCT TO BE FAST (HI-SPEED USB 2.0) Well my Sony USB was 2.0 as well and it was 4X's faster!

It performs far slower than my old Lexar JumpDrive which is only USB 1.1. I have read the Cruzer titanium is the fastest on the market. Well, after owning the Cruzer micro I can say it must be the slowest on the market.I have tried every type of file system when I format it. I have tried to optimize for performance.

Consequently, I will be returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent device, though different from the one pictured","review":"I had purchased this model in the 256 MB size and wanted the small capacity in a 512 MB model. What I got was apparently a newly designed, slimmer model than the previous cruzer micro. The rubber is gone, making the device extra slim, the thickness of a USB connector and as long as two quarters placed side by side. It's small enough to fit in one's wallet, and very nice. If you liked the rubber grip of the old model, this one still comes with 3 rubber \\"skins\\" of different colors to customize your micro. The blue light is now green.The transfer speed is much better than older flash drives (64 megs) and saving small files like word documents or a few music files is basically instantaneous, though large files (>10 MB) take a while to save. The Sandisk Cruzer titanium has a better transfer rate if speed is critical, however it is about 4 times the volume and costs twice as much. It just depends what is important to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This product is great!

The graphics aren't terrible, but they are certainly outmoded. The physics in this game are simply terrible. The hook is not realistic, and the pins may as well be made out of lead for all the action generated by hitting them. Either that or the ball is made of sponge.

Born out of mischieviousness, their songs can be enjoyed by young and old alike. They don't swear or make jokes about sex and drugs. They're just having fun, and Tommy's dumb, child-like character is a perfect platform for jokes.The great thing about these guys, aside from the fact that they're hilarious and have great timing, is that they're good singers. Their voices blend extremely well and the serious moments can be quite moving.This CD is great for new fans to the brothers who don't have access to a record player. Now, you don't have to buy the records to hear their performances.If you've never heard the Smothers Brothers before, this is a great place to start.

So, more than an hour's worth of the Smothers Brothers, who were TV trail blazers with their own network variety show, can have some dated moments. But Tom and Dick were actually good singers and pickers and good comic writers and performers, and this product shows them off well. There are a lot of laughs here, and it holds up for two or three repeat plays before one can remember most of the punchlines. It's a bargain if you are old enough to remember them when they were a hot act, and a worthy introduction if you like the folk sound and clean comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sibling Revelry: The Best of the Smothers Brothers","review":"A delightful collection of song and humor that brings back many found memories of my youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Funny After All These Years","review":"I had forgotten how genuinely funny the Smothers Brothers were/are.

When I first saw what he did with elves I was just digging it from there on out.I love elves and always had a way I thought they should be in my head but now I think I'll always think of them as he had them in his book. Not to mention what he did with the other races to some degree and even humans.Just a real fun read all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story line, very distracting lack of editing.","review":"While I enjoy the story line the unbelievable lack of proof reading of this book and the next book will probably keep me from buying book three in the series. On seemingly every page I found run-on sentences, incorrect punctuation, or extra words. It becomes very distracting and I've found myself searching for the next screw up instead of trying to enjoy the story.

There are even lines I have quoted for the last 45 years. Alas, the memories of youth DO NOT always stand the test of time.Some scenes were just as I remember but, overall, this was a rather poor movie. This is an example of some of the mediocre Disney \\"comedies\\" produced at the time. I did not remember the face color overs that were superinposed to depict emontions. Way too much of what made the Bad 60's comedies BAD! I wish now that I had left my childhood rememberance of this movie intact and had never seen it again.

This silly film isn't worth watching once, let alone owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"The selection of cross stitch was definately not what I had expected. When I read the title I assumed there would be a selection of cross stitch charts to choose from but there is only 1 for wedding and 1 for anniversary. The charts are hard to read due to no color used in the codes and it is printed very lightly and on small graphs. I wasn't impressed with the selection of stitchery.

I use the fein tool to sand inside corners--remove old finish, etc. In less than one minute the whole system breaks down because of excess heat. The pad heats up really fast (no, I am not bearing down on the tool), and causes the Velcro pad to literally melt in seconds. When the pad melts the Velcro system breaks down, and the back side of the paper melts away as well. Consequently, the paper no longer sticks to the Velcro pad and the whole thing is useless. Seriously, I can't believe fein even has these on the market. Never in decades of experience have I had a tool break down so quickly and so completely. Total waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this to your Fein Multi-Master","review":"You've got to have this if you've ordered the Fein MSXE-636-2 Multi-Master Electric Variable Speed Kit - it makes the tool even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 5 minutes","review":"I use my Fein Multitool for detail sanding for the most part so these sanding pads are indespensible. I love everything about the tool save for these. They wear out almost imediately. The problem is heat build-up at the corners. The hooks and substrate are plastic, with little resistance to heat. I've tried using less pressure and frequent paper changes (which does help a little) but the fact remains that these velco sanding pads are the weak link in an otherwise stellar system. I'll still use the tool because it's great, and I'll still buy these pads because there's no alternative, but I'll piss and moan about the fact that one must buy about as many of these expensive things as the paper that goes on them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It needs better design","review":"The velcrow pad overheats on the corners and outer edges.

I have had the sandpaper/pads melt in sanding just a 3/4\\" X 2\\" area. Both the felt on the paper and the Velcro on the pad melted. I went through 20 sheets of paper to sand a close-quartered area. Whereas my B & D Megamouse did a 4-foot X 4-foot area with just one sheet. Both on the same project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fein H/L pad is a very poor product","review":"As others have said here, these pads are P*ss poor.

In this particular book, the guards that keep an eye on Coffey have come to the conclusion that he did not kill the little girls he was accused of killing. The guards wanted to not see Coffey escape the prison because Coffey has a power that none of them have ever seen before and he uses this power to heal a friend of one of the guards.

I guess a good political hush job makes this event merely a myth if the only surviving record source is the Bible (a very good document by any standard).

The story excessively convoluted without reason with far too many characters to keep track of and with no characters who I could ever care about.Save your money and your time...don't buy it or watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, funny, and sweet","review":"We stumbled across Doc Martin on Vision TV here in Canada...what a treat!

Hope they keep up the good work.Well worth a DVD purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"I saw this after watching much of the series (the character is taken a different way there) and the first movie (again, not like the eventual t.v. series) and liking both. I also later saw his character in \\"Saving Grace,\\" an amusing term. This movie however was silly and overall rather disappointing. It is akin to the double episode of Doc Martin actually -- you want to like it because you like the characters (or main character), but it is actually pretty lame.

It is essentially a survey of the various viewpoints on Religion vs. Science. It certainly won't help anyone looking for reasons to lend credence to religion. All it accomplishes is showing that the existence of God is not disproven by Science; doesn't come close to showing that God exists. There was no new science, and no new theology.

Oxidative damage of using it is not discussed enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful","review":"Oxygen is a very volatile molecule and i would be very suspicous of ingesting over a period of time. The ability to make something sound miraculous is a gift of rhetoric and not necessarily substantiated. Even if it is effective in the short term for certain ailments, what are the long term consequences? Without well financed medical research, there is no factual data available and anyone can say anything. I don't trust the medical establishment as far as I can throw it, but I respect independent long term research. This is just too sketchy for me to feel good about.

It is a strong oxidizing agent and kills good cells along w/ bad cells, i.e. bacteria. It can delay uninfected wound healing if used routinely. If it were not for hydrogen peroxidases breaking down the H2O2 the moment it got insidee our bodies it would kill you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoscience","review":"This is yet another example of pseudoscience presenting as fact things that just can't be shown. Hydrogen peroxide, or free oxygen radicals, are intracellular poisons. If you possess a mutation preventing its enzymatic degredation, you DIE. Free radicals have been linked to all sorts of things, from aging, to the DNA damage that causes cancer.If you want to try H2O2 therapy, be my guest, but other than its usage as a cleaning agent for cuts and abrasians (for which I've used it often myself), it's magical medicinal properties are somewhat nonexistent.

The USA is about to transform into a overcrowded hell hole because corporate leaders want a larger consumer market each year. The biggest consumer product and service being sold is medical.

This one I could notmake heads or tails of. I have never seen so many plot changes inmy life. First of all, when different characters are talking initalics, I have no idea who each one is; I have to skip aroundand figure out who is the speaker. And trying to keep up with allthe different characters is like roaming around in a zoo. Some ofthe characters seem without an iota of intelligence or they couldfigure out things more quickly. I can honestly see why Constance'husband, William was ready for the looney bin; I would be too if Ihad to go through all the craziness he was subjected to. In theend I really didnt give a hang who James really was. this book isso different from other Goddard novels that it is hard to believe the same man wrote t his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"i wish i could give this book more than 5 stars","review":"this is simply the best book i have ever read and could ever imagine reading. painting the darkness was my first Goddard book and now i am in love with the author.don't let anything in this world stop you from reading this book. and once you start, NEVER put it down. don't even try, you wont be able to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carpenter fans, stay away from this CD!","review":"I made the unfortunate mistake of buying this CD, thinking it might contain some credible tributes to some of John Carpenter's film scores. Boy, was I wrong! All of the tracks sound like they were produced in someone's basement, using a keyboard bought at Radio Shack. The Splash Band has even managed to make most of the songs sound like background music to a porno flick. If you enjoy Carpenter's scores, you would be sickened by what you heard on this disc. I'm throwing my copy away, as I could never sell this disc in good faith to another Carpenter fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT John Carpenter","review":"It's bad enough that they put John Carpenter's name in the title of this CD but Amazon should not have it listed as BY John Carpenter when it is clearly not. It is his music but butchered by some hacks in a garage (or cave) somewhere in some third world country with sporadic electricity and no running water. That's what it sounds like anyway. It should be listed as by the Splash Band where i'm sure it would sell millions of copies to their fans (you know who you are.)

At our gym the audio for the televisions is broadcast over a few select radio frequencies, so we needed an inexpensive way to listen while on the cardio machines. Within a matter of days the first set started going out. At first there was a low hum in the background. It got steadily louder until it was impossible to hear anything over it.The second pair's problem is with the tuner. When switched on, the tuner automatically jumps to 106 fm. It takes five or so minutes of constantly pressing the preset buttons to get it to change. Most of the time, as soon as I tune in the station I want, it instantly jumps back to 106 fm. If I am fast enough, I can switch the station lock toggle and begin my workout.

The book is more about friendship and a description about mental hospitals in the 1920's. It is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenience but no Quality","review":"I love/hate this blade along with the Fein sander. The tool and blades like this are so convenient; they get you in tight places, allowing a lot of control, but this blade, along with the e-cut blades are...poor value for the money. They are not bi-metal like good recip blades, or carbide, like good saw blades, they're just plain steel, and they don't last. I have a table saw blade, I paid [$$$] for, but it'll last a lifetime, because it's good quality carbide, and it can be sharpened. As for blades like this one, if you're a contractor like me, you better have a big markup for overhead, because these babies are going to cost you. I actually took my complaint to the company; the rep I emailed said they pleaded with the manufacturers in Germany to make the price more reasonable, but to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH PLEASE!","review":"You might think this blade is made of solid gold for the price Fien wants for it, but it's not. If it was solid gold it would be cheaper! Go on E-Bay and search for Fein blades at a reasonable price and don't waste your money here."},{"rating":"2","title":"High price, unique capabilities","review":"All the reviews of this and similar Fein blades are true; they cost a lot and they are fragile and easy to break. I am now faced with the prospect of replacing some of my broken and dull blades and I am willing to pay the price because I must. I have invested over a thousand dollars in blades and sandpaper for the Multimaster and the capabilities that having this kit gives me are too numerous to mention. My advice is to use this particular blade as a last resort, those few instances when no other method can perform the task without risk of peripheral damage to the valuable stuff that we tradesmen and tradeswomen have to cut into. Fein blades are like auto insurance; they are an expensive burden when you don't need them but when you do, you will be very glad that you have them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, this as fragile as a potatoe chip","review":"I bought this blade to replace the one that came with the kit. When I tried to install it the blade must have been just a little off center. As soon as I put pressure on it, the blade shattered into a dozen pieces. I haven't used the new one yet, I am afraid of breaking it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the generic?","review":"This blade came with the FMM 250Q Multimaster I purchased. It lasted for about 2 months and then crack while I was using it to cut a thin sheet of fiberglass. Prior to that it had been primarily used to cut small pieces of wood. When I went to replace it I ended up with sticker shock. From my perspective, all of Fein's accessories are WAY over priced. More and more I have been able to source these accessory items from third party manufacturers at more than half of Fein's price and have found the quality to be as good, if not better than Fein's. Even Fein distributors have started to complain about their pricing and have \\"covertly\\" started carrying and offering non OEM replacement options to their customers. The FMM 250Q is by far the best tool in its category. But from an accessory replacement perspective, its low priced competitors are starting and will continue to errod its market share."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a book you have to read over again!","review":"I love all of the Seasons of the Heart, but this one is my favorite.Springs Gentle Promise is funny,filled with information, and very touching.I laughed and cried and fell in love with the great story that was so beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean Read","review":"Joshua's life is full, with the responsibilities of manhood and a family that cares for him, but is there love in his future?Spring's Gentle Promise brings an end to the Seasons of the Heart series.

I have had no problems with either the watch or the GPS. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that you need the instruction book to use all of the features of the system. It is not user friendly, but when instructions are followed, it works as promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"Ugh. I have been using this watch for over a month and have yet to have it work correctly. I have already had to glue the transmitter piece back together. If I do manage to find a connection I had better be careful not to run within 10 miles of the nearest ground projection or the satellite connection will be broken. Any stray wispy cloud or piece of floating cottonwood can cause the satellite connection to be lost. I love how the literature says it is great for hiking. Maybe above the treeline and cloud cover.

As I read this book I suddenly began to understand a lot of my father's personality. I felt like my father was talking to me as Bob Greene's father talked to him. It was like reading two books in one as it told the story of Paul Tibbets, the man who ended the war. I realized how fortunate we were to have men like him to guide us through the terrible ordeal of world war. The book is outstanding in its prose and its structure. It delivers the goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I am afraid I really could not suggest this book to anyone above the age of 40 who knew their father. I read this book looking for some insight into the bombing of Hiroshima and what Bob Greene discovered about his father by talking with Tibbets. I was disappointed because it seems that Bob went into this not knowing anything about WW2 or the military. Unfortunately it also seems that he and his father never really talked at all, so he had to go to a stranger to find out what his father was like. That is sad. He brings this book off lauding Tibbets for the great hero he was. I don't mean to demean what Tibbets did. He was a hero. But if you read between the lines of his,(Bob's), fathers reminices you begin to realize that he was probably a real hero also.

What is heroic about fliying over a city and dropping an atomic bomb, on defenseless civilians. According to this type of logic Hitler, Stalin, and Reagan (responsible for the carnage of the 80's against the people of central and south America) , were also heroes. This is simply a case of mindless slaughter, and dispect for life. Why not read John Hersey's Hiroshima, or Masuji Ibuse's Black Rain if you want to see the real results of Tibbet's cowardly act of moral blindness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must read\\"","review":"After seeing Bob Greene discussing his book on BookNotes, I ordered it, expecting a good read, but nothing more. It turns out to be a fantastic read, however. Greene's efforts to understand his father through Paul Tibbets does not make his father any less inscrutable, but it does make us wonder if his father, and other men who went to war, lived those war years over and over again, but only in their own minds. It doesn't appear that Greene was genuinely close to either of his parents, often rushing through a dinner with his mother to meet Paul Tibbets. And he clearly was enamored with Tibbets. This book is about Duty, but whose duty? Greene's father's war year duty? Paul Tibbets duty? or Greene's own duty to understand his parent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a contemporary genius","review":"I have had the pleasure to perform many of Malcolm Arnold's dance suites during my college band days (in concert bands, arrangements by Percy Grainger).

Season 5 of Nip Tuck wasn't that great. Too many topics were a reach....a big time reach that made the show unwatchable at times.

This unit has one of those connectors. Once you do get it connected (after quite a while of trying) the picture is barely OK. Secondly, the cable portion doesn't \\"stow\\" in the groove and that makes the unit very unstable and prone to tipping.In fact I switched back to my old antenna and find I get more channels than with this one.

Surprisingly this one passed the grade and I'm now getting 80 percent signal strength on all channels with \\"no\\" rotating needed.

All of this in spite of the Terk not being amplified and I have to connect the antennae( up in my loft) to my TV downstairs via 50 feet of coaxial cable.The HDTV antennae is really just a higher performance UHF antennae if you don't want to do any research about it.

In short unless you have a clear shot toward the tower you want reception from, do not rely on this antenna to do you the favor of finding the signal.

OK, that gives me 2 channels on one of my TVs. Not acceptable. I get the same results with a set of old rabbit ears! I returned it because it was useless.

Make sure tail piece is fully inserted past the marking to receive HD broadcasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for what it is","review":"Like all antennas to get the best picture on a particular station this antenna requires that it be adjusted or moved, so you will need a large flat surface with good clearance to allow for the telescoping antennas to extend or be relocated. This antenna does a reasonably good job of picking up standard definition stations over the air. It does an outstanding job of picking up High Definition signals. My biggest complaint is the extremely small support base of the product.

I live in a rural area that is 25+ miles from two large metro areas, one to the west and one to the east, that have a number of tv stations broadcasting digital signals. This antenna has added about 30 more stations, all digital, to my lineup. I'm now getting pristine HD for all the local channels that DirecTV wasn't giving me. Full disclosure: I'm at a high point in the county where I live, so I'm not fighting very much terrain to get these signals. I also have to occasionally get my rear end off the couch to move the antenna a tiny bit to pick up a channel for which the antenna is searching for the signal. This might have more to do with where I have placed the antenna.

So now I'm going to purchase a second one for the tv downstairs. i would say that the only downfall is that if I am standing in front of the antenna the reception misses a little, but rarely am I standing directly in front of the tv for more than a second or two. Overall I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!!!","review":"SUCKS!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!! HD? Why dun you get yourself a cable!!! Bad Reception... It doesn't stand... once you extend the antenna, it loses its balance, and tips over... this sucks... I threw it away... looking for something besides this... This is made in China so it's very crap!!! DO NOT WASTE MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked with DirecTv HDtv receiver : read how","review":"At first I was frustrated, I thought this would be as simple as pluging it into my box, I was wrong. After I read my digital antenna installation instuctions for my receiver I found out what to do and boom it worked. Now not all the HD channels were perfect but 3 major networks are perfect, not ABC. With my reciever you need to go into menu setup/ installation/ make local in 1 antenna/ then scan. The Terk will find all antenna channels and then you need to add them to your fav guide. Also after scanning it will tell you if the channel is digital or analog. Takes about 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Engineered Product","review":"In short-don't buy this antenna, and here's why: the unit literally has no base other than a small piece of flimsy rubber-it's impossible to keep the thing balanced and stable. Since positioning an indoor antenna around for most precise reception is what it's all about, this unit fails miserably. Even proping something next to it to hold it's balance (which is very klugy) really does not do the trick. While this unit looks good, trust all of the reviews herein which reference this poorly designed base. And, while reception really is based on location in reference to broadcast towers, I replaced this unit with a very inexpensive RCA basic unit and not only pulled in significantly more HD stations but had ease of positioning in regards to balance. My strong recommendation is not to purchase this product-if you do you'll instantly see what I mean in regards to this serious base balancing issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"Ever since I gave up cable TV due to higher cost and poor program choices, I've been looking for a better set of 'rabbit ears' to get free over the air broadcasts. I mostly just enjoy and watch PBS and educational programming these days, the rest is just so much posturing and nonsense, not to mention the commercials on most cable channels that do nothing but insult the intelligence of American viewers.Design issueIf you extend the rabbit ears fully the unit falls over, really stupid (read moronic) design and the engineer(s) that designed it need to go back to school and get a real degree.I immediately returned it to BestBuy and got another design that does not fall over when trying to actually put the device in standard use."},{"rating":"2","title":"This works","review":"I moved and my patio is facing the wrong direction. Bye bye DISH. I read a few reviews and decided to try this antenna. The setup is super simple. Basically take it out the box, attach it to the back of you tv and point it towards a window. The first time I did a scan it picked up 42 channels! I was hoping to get a few of the local channels so anything over that I consider a bonus. Most of the additional channels are in Spanish or are church channels but three of them show old tv shows and movies so I cannot complain.The reception is super clear. I am happy with my purchase.4/5 - It is kinda bulky takes up more room than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well enough for me!","review":"I first bought a very basic antenna -- it got a few stations typical stations - ABC, CBS, FOX, but not enough to make it worthwhile. I then purchased this one and was able to also get PBS -- but still no NBC. I currently live in a downstairs apartment in a small city in eastern TN, so I suspect that part of the issue with NBC is the height of the trees and buildings around me. For the price and the fact that it's an indoor antenna, it does well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works okay","review":"For an \\"amplified\\" antenna, it works okay. The local stations are picked up in great HD quality. I really can't jump on giving this antenna a 5 because I live less than 6 miles from any of the broadcasting towers.

The lid will not stay attached to the base without extra weight. There is a very weak design to the lid closure that releases as you screw down the top. Basically the lid catches on the two short sides with a small 2 mm lip, one side having a press to push out release and the other acting as a hinge until the top is lifted or it is pressed towards the side engaged. The problem is the the top, when screwing the press down also bows out the lid and releases one or the other of these catches. It was very frustrating to screw the press and have the side release. My wife was thinking that I was too aggressive, so she operated it and the lid popped again for her as well. Finally held it down with a thick cookbook:(Joy of Cooking: 75th Anniversary Edition - 2006). Pickles were successfully produced, but not useful enough to use again. I would recommend a lid that itself screws down, then you can screw the press down."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun.","review":"Instructions are not in English, though.

If you are making a large batch of tsukemono, then it works okay. Not great, just okay. However, if you're making a smaller batch, you can forget using this press. The cylinder that applies pressure to the base of the press isn't long enough to reach near the bottom of the press.

My angel and the gourami grew up together. When they both got to be the same size. She beat him with her nose. But to be fair he chased her also. Fish I would put with angels are catfish, clown loaches and red barbs or mollies. These fish don't try to occupy the same tank depth as angels. They congregate on the bottom to mid tank. Angels like mid to top, but you may find them resting on the bottom when they are not feeling well.

I first noticed that the fence 'slipped' when I was doing some fine work. The fence slips when you rest it upon your work (when you measure the biscuit slot from the top of the fence plate). This happens no matter how hard I tighten the fence. The solution for this tool is to only use it resting flat and then to only use the fence as a guide. Since I do the kind of work that requires more precision, I will be moving up to the Porter Cable 557 in a few months.

The fence adjustment mechanism seems poorly designed and engineered. The amount of discrepancy is small, but when joining surfaces that can accomodate only one biscuit, the joined pieces will be totally misaligned.It's too bad because in other respects, it seems like a fairly decent tool.

He makes you feel the passion in Paul's letters (especially the eighth chapter of Romans). You will find yourself rewinding your tape frequently because you will be hearing things that you missed in your reading. McLean's unique, dramatic style is very helpful for scripture memorization as well. This is one of my most prized biblical resources. GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mao Zedong","review":"Jonathan Spence's MAO feels like it's one of his three hour lectures on Chinese history. It's so incredibly even that it's bland. Spence presents each detail of Mao's life with the same monotnous detail (or lack of) that you can't seem to seperate what's big and what's not. It's as if the author doesn't have an identity, he takes an incredibly unstable life and packages it with a very matter-of-fact attitude. When the events of Mao's life reach a peak, the writing doesn't.It's emotionless, but not boring. It's a quick read, and it may very well peak an interest, but how slight or large is probably a measure of the style you feel most comfortable with. The PENGUIN LIVES series is like an extended Strathern 90 Minutes course: they're too short and pretty for you to avoid for long, and I suppose it's probably good to prescribe to the philosophy that it was worth reading if you learned something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked focus on importance","review":"If you going to attempt a 180 page biography of someone of this stature, one must sift thru and present only the most relevent and important details. This did not happen. A decent book, but lacked details on some very important areas, while giving too much time to unrealted topics. Example: Mao becomes the head of a small, isolated band of communist guerilla fighters. Very well, now how does he transform from that, into the head of state for a billion people? the book doesnt say. In this biogarphy, Mao goes from that cave-living nobody into meeting Stalin and ruling China in about 2 paragraphs. From cave-dweller to world leader in 6 sentences. We get more than 6 sentences about his last secretary's personal life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the sample","review":"This was one of my favorite biographies. Rich in details and suspense.

This is a short book that is in no way a complete biography, but serves as a great introduction to Mao and the state of China throughout his life. Given the space of 178 pages, Jonathan Spence selectively designs a narrative that emphasizes the influences that shaped Mao's early life. Less insightful than informative, Spence's book is one you can learn from if communism in China arouses your curiousity. And you can read it in a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mao","review":"This book is vague in it's detail on the cultural revolution, and seems to be towing the line with the communist Parties line on the subject, Mao, and the cultural revolution, is an accepted topic to talk about roughly but you must not talk about it in detail.

Worse, the extent of Chinese history is interpreted around Mao, and the book leaves you wondering how China managed to survive after his death. That China is still on the map - and in the UN - is a strong rebuttal of the inferred conclusion that Mao was the highest point in Chinese history - if not the extent of Chinese history itself.A weak, narrative book that preoccupies itself with merely restating commonly known facts, this may be the kind of book you want on an eight-hour plane trip, but certainly not the kind a serious reader or scholar would want to come close to.- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Biography on Mao","review":"This book, by Spence, lacks the details that a reader needs to know about Mao.

I don't know the play is about entirely, but it's very obvious that it's about the life of Jesus Christ. Glazunov may be considered unoriginal in certain parts of his music, but I don't seem to mind when I listen to it. This is a purely Russian work that follows Biblical text. Igor Golovschin may not be as great as Valery Polyansky or the late Evgeny Svetlanov, but he moves it all along very nicely. The Moscow Symphony Orchestra and the Moscow Cappella also do a very good job, though I would have expected more emotion from certain points of the piece. All in all, this is one of the finest compositions that Glazunov has created. I just wish that people have the chance to recognize it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for another alternative","review":"Nothing is really wrong here, but somehow this reading, of what can almost be described as a cantata, fails to ignite.

I will put in brand new lithium batteries and within minutes the battery icon is flashing and the camera is performing badly.

Secondly, I have heard of changing from first person to third person in a novel, probably from chapter to chapter; who changes it from paragraph to paragraph and sometimes from sentence to sentence?? I couldn't get into the story for a lot of reasons--trying to figure out what should have been written took away from my enjoying the story. Also, there was too much going on and too many people.

From Black & Decker to Bosch. Have to say that the Freud FJ85 was one of the worst I've ever used.Fairly well made? Yes. That's probably the only reason I gave it two stars. Trigger was mushy, didn't have the \\"crisp\\" feel of a good trigger switch. Didn't like the blade retention system at all. Bosch and Morse blades both hard to get inserted all the way in the barrel. Cutting guide was so far off it was pathetic.Last of all, during cuts the saw tracked somewhat sideways like a car with a bent frame! Really skimpy manual, too.I've used several Freud tools over the years with good results, but this saw is not a \\"keeper\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade change mechanism","review":"I purchased this jigsaw only about a month ago, and so far I am very pleased. It feels solid, with smooth cutting action, and goes through a variety of materials with ease. I have to agree with other reviewers regarding the manual, which I too find extremely spartan. However, there has been much reference made regarding the \\"quick change\\" blade mechanism, and this is what has compelled me to write this review. I too, initially could not lock in the blade, but after a couple of attempts I managed to figure it out (useless manual). Pull back the sliding mechanism, insert the blade to the point of resistance, now you can release the sliding mechanism, and then push the blade harder until you hear a click. The blade is now secure. It may in fact be that some got a bad machine. But give these instructions a try. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad blade lock mechanism","review":"I just returned my Freud FJ85. Sad to do since it was truly a bargain and had a good motor and smooth gearbox. But all of that isn't of much use if you can't get blades to lock properly. I had trouble with the supplied Freud blade, but eventually was able to lock it in. I also bought a variety of Bosch blades. I could lock in some after great effort, but some simply never would fit in. In the end, my fingers were completely cut up. I also didn't care for the lack of dust blower. The Freud comes with a vacuum attachment, but that seemed too awkward for most uses I had planned for the saw. The sight line also left a lot to be desired. I ended up paying more for the Porter Cable jigsaw, but I'm so much happier with it and glad I made the decision quick enough to get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workhorse","review":"Not the prettiest, nor the nicest, but it does a great job. I use this for making furniture in my home workshop, we use bosch jigsaws at work everyday, (cabinetry and millwork), and my freud does just as good a job. With the blade guards in place, it does have very poor visibility, but i've never used a jigsaw which didn't have some visibility problems, and with the guards off, it's much improved. don't think i could have gotten a better jigsaw for twice as much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Paperweight","review":"I probably should have read the reviews first but I couldn't resist the clearance price... I bought my first one 3 weeks ago but found that it wouldn't hold the universal blades so I returned it. I bought another one at a different outlet...yesterday assuming that the more expensive Bosch blades would work. Same problem...the blades won't lock in. You can remove the blade by gently pulling on it. While the price is great, the saw is useless if it can't keep the blade in. After reading more reviews, it looks like Bosch is the best alternative. I'm returning this one today so there will be at least 4 in stock if anyone is interested. Just buy some duct tape to hold the blade in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 2 minutes...","review":"I cut one 1\\"x3\\" piece of pine and it quit.

I have worn out three jigsaws prior to this one.I wanted to get a saw that started out at zero RPM's, had orbital action, good power, a quick change blade, a good blade guide system, and used the \\"T\\" shank blades.I was going to buy a Bosch, but decided on this one instead. It has a better blade change system, very precise switch, and a very strong motor. It has a removable plastic shoe, anti splinter insert, and an allen wrench on board. It doesn't come with a case. I usually chuck them anyway, because they take up too much room in my van. I gave it four stars instead of five, only because it doesn't blow the dust off the cut line very well.Overall, a very good buy at fifty bucks less than the Bosch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricardo","review":"This is a top of the line tool that has no comparison. This isa product I have wished for years to buy, but could never justify paying the retail price; until I saw the product advertised in your magazine at such an affordable price.

Despite using top quality Bosch blades, the saw threw out every blade I was using.

FYI- Lowes appears to have dropped them from their inventory."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality - Great Price!","review":"We purchased this when it was a gold box feature and got an amazing price for this quality jig saw.

It mostly remained intact after I smashed it into the concrete a few times by swinging it by the cord. The foot broke off but I'll leave the last star for it's durability under adverse conditions. It won't be ruining any more of my work.This is hands down the worst tool I've ever bought. The blade wanders left and right as well as at an angle from 90 degrees. It can't track a straight line and definitely can't cut a circle.Don't waste your money on this sub par knock off of a jig saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyday use","review":"If you need a jigsaw every once in awhile, this is the saw for you. If you need to use it quite a bit, this is not the saw for you. The fact that there is only 1 speed when you pull the trigger is so incredibly stupid. Yes, you can move the stupid little wheel at the top and it does work, but why not have a variable speed trigger? That way when you need to make sure that your cut is going to be exactly where you want it to be, you can make the initial start slow, then speed up. I bought it because it was a Freud, it now sits idle in my garage while I use the Bosch at work simply because it sucks. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. Ah yes, and I almost forgot, it comes with the dust port with a guard that is supposed to help with the dust. If you need to use it without a vac, say outside, the stupid little thing keeps falling down, holding dust ON your line which is so incredibly moronic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be better ones","review":"I have had mine intalled for less than a year, and during the cold weather it will not rotate.

By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit.\\" Secret #1: If your life consistently bears no fruit, God will intervene to discipline you. Secret #2: If your life bears some fruit, God will intervene to prune you. Secret #3: If your life bears a lot of fruit, God will invite you to abide more deeply with Him.

When in the midst of crisis, turmoil and etc. we easy say \\"Why Me?\\" This is a clear and concise approach to the famous question \`why bad things happen to good people'. As with the Prayer of Jebez, Wilkinson uses a methodological approach to understanding life's struggles.Bruce Wilkinson eloquently, explained punishment versus pruning. Knowing this now, before questioning \\"Why me\\", I stop to ask am I being punished for not being obedient or am I being pruned for improvements.I enjoyed this book more than Wilkinson's \\"Prayer of Jebez\\". However I feel the Prayer of Jebez fans will also find this book useful.This is an excellent book! I occasionally review view for guidance and reassurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, an encouragement in your Christian walk","review":"Secrets of the Vine was a great encouragement to me in my walk with God. Bruce Wilkinson provides his insight on an extremely important conversation Jesus had with His disciples. Because the Bible transcends time, I am able to apply the principals Jesus taught to my life today in amazing ways. This book has inspired me to look at my walk with God in many different lights. Even those who are in the gutter (and we all have been there and will be back in there at several points in our lives-none of us are immune) have the most immense hope, all because Jesus loves us so much. If you feel your faith has stagnated, or you are talking to the ceiling when you pray, pick up this book.

It really cleared up some things that i could never quite grasp because to me they just seemed a little out-of-synch with the rest of scripture.

In this book he uses grapes and vineyards as analogies for our lives and the fruit we are called upon to produce. He tells about 3 \\"secrets\\" or stages in life where God can intervene and help us to bear more fruit. He details the stumbling blocks we can come across in our Christian life and shows us how God can rescue us in any stage of despair or period of life when we are not bearing fruit.

I have just recently watched the video of him on Larry King Live, along with Pastor John MacArthur, and other religious leaders, and was extremely upset about the way that he did not stand up for his faith, and his very vague and wishy washy comments. Honestly, I was expecting a more clear testimony from such a well known Christian man. His lack of defense of the Christian faith has made me very suspicious towards his books.

One of the greatest weaknesses of both books is their faulty exegesis or reading meaning into a passage of Scripture that isn't specifically stated in the text.In Revelation 20:10 & 14-15 we see that Hell with its lake of fire is most certainly a real place. Bruce Wilkinson's graphic description of hell adds much speculative detail to the several verses the Bible shares with us about this place. As revolting as Mary Baxter's description of Hell is in her book \\"A Divine Revelation of Hell,\\" Wilkinson's isn't much better. I contend we should stick with what is specifically stated in the text of any Scripture and not add to it. Especially when quoting from a passage in Revelation. Revelation 22:19 warns us, \\"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Well intentioned but sells selfish message","review":"I'm just afraid the author is exploiting readers' desire to be rewarded by faith, when faith is its own reward. A relationship with our God is so precious - even for those of us who (for reasons only he understands) are helpless and hurt. For this to be a bestseller tells me we are hungry for a message of gratification. At bottom we still want our works to be rewarded.

Still it is only grace that saves us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pruned by the Word of God","review":"John 15:3 clearly says we are already cleansed by the Word! Cleansed and pruned come from the same Greek root word. So John 15:3 is basically saying you are pruned by the Word of God!

Read John 15 with Psalms 1 for a better understanding and ask the Holy Spirit to reveal His truth to you.

I'm not sure if there are various artists, but the woman's voice I hear most often is almost annoying. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and out of tune singers.....","review":"I was disappointed in this CD. I personally can't listen to it for very long. If you have a music or singing background, you might want to think twice. I love all the song selections, all my favorites when I was a kid. But, the songs are sung by adults (trained singers, all of which have GREAT voices) and then the children start singing in the middle of each one. The children sing out of tune, off the beat and very badly. It's cute for the first couple of songs, but after a while, to the trained ear, it gets REALLY annoying. Babies and Toddlers might like it, because they don't really know or care about musicality. But to me, it was like someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard! eeeek!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old loves it!","review":"This CD is not what I would consider quality music but my 2 year old absolutely loves it!

The songs in the middle (about 5-6 songs) are just terrible and I had to skip over them. I would not recommend this or buy it again.

These renditions of toddler favorites are truly annoying. It sounds like a bunch of parents and children went into a studio and sang whatever they liked.

It is so hard on my ears that I may throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cutesy , Very Annoying","review":"I was very unhappy with this tape. The woman singing most of the songs can barely carry a tune. Way too cutesy and fake happy, it just ends up coming across as obnoxiously annoying.

Thank goodness, because I can't stand it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone","review":"I had this cd in my shopping cart and before processing the order I decided to hear some of the song samples they have on the cd. Boy was I happy I did. I will not be purchasing it after hearing clips of the songs. My 2 and 4 year old boys wouldn't sing along to these songs. The way some of the people are singing the songs, it almost sounds like they are making fun of the song by over exaggerating some of the lerricks. Before purchasing, scroll down past the item description to the song samples and listen to some of them before you make a decision since cd's can't be returned after being opened.

It is absolutely awful!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD ever!","review":"If you have any music training or musical ability, do NOT buy this CD! The woman on the tape has a very harsh, annoying voice...almost like a washed up lounge singer who needed to make a quick buck by singing on a kids' CD. The children on this CD are AWFUl...completely out of tune...I don't expect perfection, but it is possible for children to sing on pitch! The instrumental music sounds like a really bad high school band. This is the worst kids' CD I have ever heard, and I have 3 children who have had dozens of CDs between the three of them. This one is going in the garbage -- I wouldn't even give it to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tone Deaf","review":"From the moment I turned on this CD, I thought my daughter would learn to be tone deaf. She did seem to like it, but I just couldn't stand it and had to confiscate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"toddler favorites","review":"Of all the CDs I bought this is by far her favorite. And it doesn't annoy me either. It has some very old children's songs and some traditional ones. The singing is great. It has really helped my daughter to improve her language skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it at first, but gets old fast","review":"It's a decent CD, especially for the money. I'm just sick of listening to it. My daughter still seems to like it, but she's only 21 months, so it's hard to tell what her true thoughts are. She's really into kitties and puppies, so she enjoys all the meowing and barking on the CD. She also likes to make train whistle noises, so she likes the song with the train in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard on Mommy's ears!","review":"I bought this CD because it was a good price. Ugh, do I regret it. As someone with musical training, it's hard to listen the first song, \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\". The female singer is so out of tune. Fortunately, she is not the only adult singer on this recording. The kids on the recording, however, also sing poorly. I guess some people would find it cute. I only own one other recording of children's songs, Wee Sing for Baby, and I can listen to that one fine (I play it in the car for my son). My son (15 months old) seems to like Toddler Favorites, but as one other reviewer said, if you, the parent, will be listening along with your child, you may not be able to tolerate it. I've listened to samples of the Disney Children's Favorite Songs series, which has been highly recommended by Amazon reviewers, and have added those to my sons' wish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible singing will give your child nightmares","review":"I bought this for my toddler because of the great variety of songs. After trying to get through a few minutes of it, our ears hurt from the horrible off key noise they call singing. My daughter refuses to listen to it, and I can't blame her. The one song she loves that is listed on the cover (Skip to My Lou) isn't even on the tape! Do not waste your money- this is by far thee worst \\"music\\" for toddlers I have found so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful for Adults","review":"If any kid music annoys you, this CD is NOT for you. These are good old classic songs, but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs. I'm throwing it away. I want my two-year-old to know the songs I know and love, but this was a bad buy on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"good songs with bad singing","review":"The selection of songs is very good. Most are popular and great children's songs that my 2.3-year-old loves. But the singing is mediocre. What's worse is that too many songs are partly sung by children who apparently don't have a sense of tune yet, which means that too many songs were out of tune. If my son sings a song out of tune, I'd probably think it's cute. But listening to other kids sing out of tune over and over again is not fun, it's torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"After reading several positive reviews, I bought this CD with the highest hopes of having a definitive collection of children's classics. Upon listening for the first time, my hopeful anticipation turned to disgust. The only thing this CD is a collection of is a cacophonous chorus of out of tune children and a woman trying way too hard to sound like she's having fun. The only redeeming quality of this CD is that our 15 month old enjoys playing with it and tossing it about. There may be other uses for it; however be careful not to let it anywhere near your cd player. I own over 700 cd's; this has the distinction of being the worst.A nice alternative to this kind of music is World Playground. It has children's music from around the world, but sung by professionals. Every song has infectious beats, nice messages, and is very pleasing to everyone's ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandsons love this.","review":"I bought this for my grandsons, aged 3 and 4.

Some of the songs were already familiar to them, but they enjoyed the new ones, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Both of my kids (and my wife and I) can't stand this CD. The singing is horrible. The versions of the songs aren't fun at all. We have many children's CDs, and my kids (and my wife and I) love the Little People CDs the best (by far). My kids cry for the Little People CD when we put this one in. It's going in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cute CD for little ones and even grown ups","review":"I bought this, 'Toddler Favorites' CD for my soon- to- be 2 year- old nephew.

His personal favorites seem to be; 'The Wheels On The Bus', 'Monkeys On The Bed', 'If Your Happy And You Know It', and 'Old McDonald'. While Auntie's Favorites are; 'Where Is Thumbkin', Down By The Station/ Little Red Caboose Medley', and 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'.

Music should be enjoyable for both the parent and child, and this most certainly is not. The songs are covers of basic favorites which are available on many cds, so DO NOT pick this one.

Be warned that this CD contains lots of songs actually song by toddlers, i.e. you get off-tune versions of \\"the wheels on the bus go wound and wound\\" etc. Too bad, because the artist has some funny ideas for several songs. In my opinion, the singing toddlers makes this CD almost unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 10 year old son loves these nuts!","review":"I bought these nuts for myself when my family was on vacation at Virginia Beach. I'm a raw foodist and I bought this along with other raw food at the Heritage health food store near the beach. My son asked if he could try them and he absolutely loved them! I did too.

When I finally got a bit in (w/o the collet nut in place) the bit was so tight I couldn't get it out (Yes I read all the mediocre directions before doing this). After working on it for a couple hours, I finally got the bit out. I ended up scarring up both the bit and the collet. Figuring I must be doing something moronic I took a new Freud bit and the router into a Freud distributor, the distributor ended up getting the bit stuck and had to use channel locks to remove it (yes he scarred up the bit). I returned it ... to get a replacement. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!","review":"I own many Freud router blades and saw blades which I am very happy with. However, I would recommend that you AVOID this router. If you are mounting the router in a table or using it at a fixed depth (such as along an edge), it works fine. However, it is impossible to make an accurate plunge cut with this router. As you plunge the router you will find that the motor housing and bit will rock sideways relative to the base. This will throw your cut off to one side. The deeper your cut, the greater the error.I assumed my router was defective and returned it to Freud for service -- twice. Both times, however, they sent it back to me and said it was within the tolerances acceptable to Freud. However, these tolerances are not acceptable for good woodworking. I now leave this router mounted in a table and have bought another brand for plunge cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Table Mount","review":"I bought this baby primarily for use in a router table. Has all the power you need. (Drives my 3/4 roundover @ 12,500 without a wimper. Doesn't accept Porter Cable style inserts without an adapter. A bit crude looking, but the microfeed makes it a snap to use on a table. The sticky collet is an issue with some bits, but seems to loosen up a bit over time. I had no problem finding the metric screws at Ace Hardware. Not a great \\"only router\\" but hard to beat the power for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"inexpensive but problematic","review":"The main problem I found with the router was the poorly fitting 1/2 inch and 1/4 inch collet. Both were too large to fit standard router bits when the compression nut was in place. I had grind the hardened steel collets on a lathe ( to avoid unbalancing the rapidly turning bits) to fit. The second problem I found was that the system that controls the depth of bits is sprung to high. This makes it difficult to extend the bits without using excessive force to compress the springs. The adjustment knob, usefull for fine adjustments, also requires excessive force to turn when the springs are near full compression. Because the knob compresses only one side it will jam pulling the router out of alignment. This makes it difficult to use in a table. The final major complaint is the collet doesnot extend far enough for some short router bits. In summary inexpesive but beware of its limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I put a tongue and groove edge on 1500 linear feet of eastern red cedar to make random width panel boards for my sunroom walls and trim. I purchased the Freud router since I presumed it to be heavy duty. (The work took place over several months time. I rarely ran the router more than a couple of hours a weekend.) The cedar, being very soft, surrendered to the router bits like butter to a hot knife. However, the Freud sputtered and died after about 1100 feet. It would either not hold speed against a load, or not run at all. I finished the job with a $39 ebay chinese import. I originally avoided the cheapie in favor of getting one that I thought would last, and I guess any thing can happen, but at least for me this unit did not make the grade. I like the layout and the controls, and the depth gauge, which is why I gave it a couple of stars. But durable? Nah! I'll go for another brand if I get serious again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped base!","review":"Right out of the box it rocked like a chair. I sent it right back.

Not only is the fit and finish of this product substandard, but I had the same problem as another reviewer in that my 1/2\\" bits won't fit into the collet. I assumed that the other reviewer simply received a \\"one of a kind\\" defective router from Freud, but it looks like this problem isn't so unique. My recommendation: For an extra $40.00 why not buy a router that you can count on working the first time and every time. Its a shame that a company that makes such great bits produces such a substandard router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Junk","review":"This router is without a doubt the worst piece of junk on the market. The screws provided with the router to mount to a router table are a metric size not available anywhere and they are very short. Eventually I got screws from a foreign auto part store after looking for 3 weeks. Much worse, the collet is not actually a 1/2 inch, it is metric in size. This causes the bit not to sit as securely as it should, which can damage the bit and certainly is not safe. I have been working with tools for more than 25 years and this is the worst tool of any type that I have ever used.

The opera was composed during the last days of Schubert's short life and was not finished before his death. Therfore, Der Graf had never been staged let alone recorded by any arts organization of significance. Enter CCM. The singers and orchestra bring to life a work that history has set aside. Schubert's compositional strengths are evident in his hundreds of song treatments, and the arias in this opera reflect those strengths. For instance, the role of Suleika, gorgeously sung by the warm yet innocent soprano of Gwendolyn Coleman, is highlighted by arias resembling the Schubertlieder for which she is named. Ms. Coleman, by the way, is just one of numerous talented singers on this recording who are gracing the concert halls of the world.

If you did not like Worlds Apart then this album is not for you. So Divided continues in the direction that they started on with The Secret Of Elena's Tombs. I have to disagree with one part of the other review on here that actually I hear a kind of return to Source Tags & Codes. Most of the noise is gone but some of the psychadelic sounds that were underneath all the noise is more upfront now. This album is really more a long the lines of 4 stars. And yes there are rumours that this may be the last album by this band. I hope not but a band like this is always underappreciated at the time of their existence and when they are gone people long for them to get back together. The band does have a more prog rock sound but I don't here the emo reference here. Trail of Dead have always been about exploring their darker emotions in song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda boring","review":"Call me immature or whatever but I prefer my Trail of Dead loud and dangerous. This is my least favorite of their albums. The songs Stand in Silence, Wasted State of Mind and So Divided are good, but still didnt rock me like their older songs: Another morning stoner, caterwaul, relative ways and a ton of others did. Maybe it'll grow on me the way Pretty Girls Make Graves latest Elan Vital did...But their tour with The Blood Brothers should rock me. Both those bands kill it live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dividing, but not conquested.","review":"I had really liked Source Codes/tags whatever its called, and love World Apart, and was expecting more of the same from ...Trail of Dead for So Divided. I was sadly mistaken. Its just so popish. The last two albums were dark and heavy and full of screams and guitar riffs and well good stuff.This, not so much, to borrow the phrase. It seems like somethig a 14 year old girl would listen to whenshe decides that divorce Britney is no longer cool. Fells like something that would play at a prom, or maybe it is meant for regular airplay, but not thier live shows. Im not saying its BAD, but if you wanted a similar feel, its just not here. Fans may want to sample the tracks to decide for themselves before plunking down the $$$, and new listeners should consider some of the earlier, and BETTER works.I can only wonder if the title is intentional, as this disc will alienate some fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"sub-par effort","review":"I've been a huge fan of the trail of dead since their beginnings, and yes, i really enjoyed Worlds Apart, which was original and managed to inventively depart from their signature sound while remaining a real musical achievement. Guess i started thinking that they wouldn't ever deceive me ... but this album is a real let-down -- feels almost like a sell-out ... I mean what's with the Oasis impression? Overall this album features feeble lyrics, uninspiring music and awful production, as exemplified by comparing the official version of Witches to the original version provided as a \\"bonus\\" track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are they doing this to me?","review":"Ugh, this album sucks. What happened? When I first heard this band, I thought: Great, here's a talented new band that rocks out but keeps it melodic and creative.

First At The Drive-In turns into Mars Volta and now this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"Loved Source/Tags.Loved Worlds Apart.Not everybody else loved the latter, though. And it seems that rejection has caused TOD to wildly overreact, by doing a middle finger flip to its critics and embracing the theatrical tics and less rockin' moments some disliked on Worlds Apart, and using such tics and moments to populate an entire album. The result sounds like a Roger Waters solo effort (not a compliment).TOD made a fatal error here: Changing their band's sound and then writing mediocre songs. You can't do both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Synchronicity","review":"I heard this entire album in a record store while waiting for the band to show up for an in-store appearance. It took a handful of songs for me to realize it was in fact Trail of Dead. Ask yourself why the band only played one song from this album live (Detroit show anyway). One song? Everything else was old stuff. Literally. It's the So Divided tour isn't it? Makes you wonder. Love the 1st album, love Madonna, love Source Tags, Love Elana's Tomb, liked World's Apart. Hated this. See Conrad's Pitchfork interview where he talks of becoming a graphic designer because he knows his band is doomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's all the fuss?","review":"This is unmistakably a TOD work. There's a little \\"Source\\", there's a little of the last CD, there's a radio-friendly pop tart, there's a GBV cover, and there's even a song that sounds like it escaped from a Shins CD. Taken as a whole, it's TOD going where they want to go, experimenting a little, enhancing a little, making all kinds of noise over here, being a little softer over there. I think it's a nice CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Feel like I've wasted all this time.\\"","review":"Trail of Dead fell out of the cushy position they had as a critical darling with Worlds Apart, which I thought was completely great (and introduced me to the band), and I couldn't really figure out why. I can see why someone would prefer Source Tags and Codes, but to say it's great and Worlds is bad... I just don't understand it. They're the same band. A little different, with less focus on songwriting and more on loudness and a bit of oddness, but still the same. So Divided was received a little better, though they still are far from where they were publicly in 2002. I just hear a really good rock album, but I guess that's just me.\\"Wasted State of Mind\\" is great with its frantic drumming and anthemic chorus, \\"So Divided\\" is like two different good songs in one, and the album as a whole has a good groove going with nice harmonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trail of Dead: \\"So Divided\\"","review":"I like ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, and I have been following them since the release of their \\"Madonna\\" album. They're consistent with their sound, and always sound like they're just having a good time in the recording process of their albums--which, in turn, makes me enjoy their album even more. I love the fact that they just rock out. Trail of Dead has a newage sound, but still sounds almost classic rock sometimes. This album is no different. Although not as good as \\"Worlds Apart,\\" it is still an excellent buy, and a good addition to the Trail of Dead anthology."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a two person job with this contraption.","review":"I agree with the other reviewer: the connection tube does not fit the receptacle on the spray-can securely enough for this to work.

Second unit lasted exactly 5 uses, when the hinge snapped as it was being closed, (very gently I might add, since these things feel like they will fall apart in your hands.)The cheap plastic facing surrounding the screen also split in two when the hinge broke. Polaroid units may possible be rebranded Malata's as I saw the exact same models in Shanghai in December sold as Malata's.If you are willing to live with the risk of it breaking on you, on the plus side, battery life really was excellent (altho the battery is very large,) and the screen quality was very good compared to more expensive models.Your mileage may vary of course, but if you are making the investment, consider spending a bit more for a real name brand, and avoid Polaroids.Got myself a Samsung, which is just awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same bad experience as other reviewers","review":"I did like the product in the beginning.

This CD contains music from two early Spanish composers where the vihuela was all the rage in court circles. Both cmposers wrote in the traditional fantasia, but their styles are completely different. The liner notes state that Milan who was a professional musician wrote in a style which seemed to be improvisational but was in fact well planned while Narvaes seemed to stretch the range of the instrument taking it to new levels.To my ears without even a hint of knowledge of music, both composers have created equally fascinating and beautiful works.

Although the finish appeared fair, the fence would not seat in the slot, it was riding on top of the slot. The fence is stamped steel, and does not contain the black attachment on the fence shown in the picture. I ground down the edges of the fence until it fit and slid easily in the guide slot. While it works well enough now, the defect does indicate poor quality control by Freud. If I had bought it locally I would have taken it back to the store but it would have been more trouble than it was worth to send it back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"power/eg 240voltags or110voltage.pin type.","review":"please,informe the buyer,the type of pin ,and the voltage in put on all powertoos usable in diffent part of the world. thanks.

I think its without a doubt the creepiest doll movie ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Living Dead Dolls...","review":"I am a collector of Living Dead Dolls. If you aren't familar with them they are these creepy dolls that are made to look like demonic children. Go to a search engine if you want to learn more.Anyhow, the movie \\"Dolls\\" really reminds me of my collection. The dolls in this movie are made from the dead, after all. They are also very eery. The special effects in this movie are unbelievable. You HAVE to see this film if you love collecting Living Dead Dolls. Oh, and watch out for the two girls in this movie that are dressed up like Madonna--very 1980's indeed!I just hope this movie gets re-released soon. It deserves another shot at immortality with horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible acting","review":"This film should've been a tales from the crypt episode, As a full length film it fails. The acting is horrible, there is no nudity or gore and the dolls themselves are un-interesting and un-scary.If you must see this film, Do yourself a favour and rent it like i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who love good old 80's horror!","review":"If you're looking for a serious scary movie that will leave you wanting to leave the lights on this is not for you. On the other hand if your looking for some funny but extremely cheesy ..entertaining 80's horror then this is a great movie. There's not too much gore and the acting is bad but its the 80s horror you gotta love. If you like movies like \\"Return of the Living Dead\\", \\"Creep Show\\", or \\"Ghoulies\\" then you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"dead flat","review":"Couldn't be happier. Dead flat bottom dados, well made components, great price. Recommend with reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for my Dewalt DW744X table saw","review":"Bought this set of cutters mainly because of the name Freud. I've purchased a few freud products and have been pleased. I'm equally pleased with this setup. I installed these on my Dewalt DW744X table saw and also picked up a DW7444 dado throat plate. Everything fit fine for me. When you install these blades you have to remove the inside washer on the table saw I used the outside washer to replace it. I replaced the outside washer with a thinner one. Not a big deal for me because I had one in the shop. You could go to the hardware store and pick one up.The first thing I built with the cutters was a set of wood racks out of 2 X 4's. Basically I used the cutters to shave slots 3/4\\" deep into the 1.5\\" thick 2x4. I made some pretty aggressive cuts b/c I was in a hurry. I was happy with the finished product especially with the deep shaving I was doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Dado Set!!","review":"I have wanted this dado set for a long time now and finally saved up enough to make the purchase a few weeks ago.

I gave it 2 stars because it cuts very good. The problem is that it advertises itself as a 5/8's arbor. It is so tight that it ruined the threads on my Delta Professional table saw. I now have to buy a new arbor ($65 from Delta), plus I have to take my table saw down to fix it + plus I have to buy another dado blade. Don't buy it.--S"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy the Super Dado!","review":"I was very dissatisfied with this dado set. I bought mine at a local home improvement store. It claims it cuts square dadoes but it does not. The outside cutters make deeper cuts on the outside. I took it back and I am saving to buy the Super Dado or Forrest's Dado King. Until the I will use my router with a straight bit for my dadoing needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I recently bought this dado set for a cabinet project. I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the cuts. The sides of the cuts were very smooth and accurate, but the bottoms of the cuts were very uneven - even worse than simply using a 1/8\\" saw blade to make repeated passes. I'm using this set on a new Ridgid 10\\" table saw and the fit on the arbor is extremely snug, so a loose arbor fit isn't the problem.For hidden dados where appearance or flatness isn't critical, this set is fine. But if you need smooth, even bottom cuts, like for tenon shoulders or exposed rabbets, this blade set isn't up to the task... you're better off using a router or tenoning jig."},{"rating":"2","title":"In search of flat bottom dadoes...","review":"Regardless of the precision of the blades/chippers, you are still at the mercy of the arbor threads (the threaded portion of the arbor can be a lesser diameter than the nonthreaded portion allowing most of the blades to be off center). A blade or chipper that is not perfectly centered on the arbor will cut a little deeper than a centered blade (think about it). You will notice a vibration increase as well. In my limited woodworking experience, I have seen some arbors with flat top threads...anyway, I would not blame the blades until I measured all diameters and had some data behind me. 5 stars until I have a Freud dado set to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dado set.","review":"I might have given this just 4.5 stars, if that option was possible, as the spacers could be better identified/marked. Apart from that, an excellent dado set. Cuts really clean dados fast. What more do you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"performed as advertised","review":"I have recently purchased and used this Freud Dado set with very good results. My concern was over my underpowered Craftsman table saw. The blade performed well and made crisp accurate cuts with no sign of bogging down my saw when cutting hardwoods. The case is of surprisingly high quality. Along with other reviewers, I found some cuts to measure small, but easily corrected with the included shims. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacer Confusion","review":"This is an update to my prior review. After tracking down someone with a micrometer, I determined that the shim set I recieved had: 5 shims at .004\\", 1 shim at .009, 1 shim at .012 and 1 shim at .020. To get 1/32\\" you have to use the .020 and .012. Hope this saves someone some time!FYI, Freud said that starting next year they will be marking their shims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I have put many of miles on this set and for the price it can not be beat.

It has never cut very well, leaving rough bottoms with a lot of chip out. It got to the point that I used my router or router table for most dado operations, avoiding the Freud dado set altogether. I have owned other Freud blades for my table, miter, and skil saw. These blades have done a good job at a reasonable price, but this dado set has been very disappointing. I would not buy recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No issues, just wish things were labled a little better...","review":"I found the dado's made with this blade were great and square enough for this woodworker. The only issue I have is with the non lableling of the different spacers...I should lable them myself, but...but...but...I procrastinate! Otherwise, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Spurgeon, Can't Go Wrong.","review":"Never dissapointed by Spurgeon. He gives concise, detailed exposition on each verse.
