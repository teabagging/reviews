I bought these as Christmas gifts to give to different dogs in our family and was very embarrassed to almost immediately find the toy's stuffing on the floor. The bees both came apart at the seems, and when you see how far apart the stitches are it makes sense why. I guess that is why these are replacements for the hive toy and they are really not made to be played with separately. Overall, even though these are very cute, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"We had the original bees and our dog loved them as a puppy.

Unfortunately, house finches (who have their own feeder) seem to prefer the thistle seed and are quite capable of standing on a perch and stretching up to the the feeder hole above it. Each finch that does this essentially takes away TWO feeding stations from the goldfinches - the hole above the perch and the one below - so two house finches take up four stations, leaving only two available for the smaller and more timid goldfinches. And yes, there is a small platform under the feeder, just big enough for an ambitious house finch to brace against while it holds on to the metal frame above. This feeder empties out in just one day ....... and the goldfinches get very little of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"REMOVE THE BOTTOM PLATFORM","review":"Remove the three Philips-head screws beneath the bottom platform that hold the bottom platform to the tube and then the (Colibri) feeder looks like its picture, and larger birds that could perch on it can no longer feed from it. With the bottom platform removed, the only birds I noticed on the feeder today were goldfinches, and they ate from it voraciously throughout the day. There may be other small birds that will come to it and manage to feed from it, but the goldfinches I had rarely spotted before on the feeder were abundant today."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"It was fun watching the goldfinches feed upside down.They however prefer to eat upright and would pass up this feeder for the normal feeder most of the time.But then after a rain...the seed got wet and spoiled immediately.

I have a ton of yellow finches in my back yard and decided to upgrade from the cheapo upside down tube finch feeders to this one.The disc at the bottom of this feeder is pretty useless. It seems to be more of a bird poop collector. It also helps stabilize the feeder when filling it up.Every time I glanced out the window I found the cheapo upside down tube feeder loaded with finches. I looked at my new feeder and found it was totally empty.A few finches tried the new feeder only to give up and go to the older feeder. I compared the two feeders and found that the pegs to the new feeder were considerably thinner.I am going to try adding some tubing to the pegs to thicken them up a little. Either way; save your money on this feeder. It may look sharp; but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the picture","review":"The picture for this product did not show the platform bottom that the larger birds are able to stand on and feed. It makes the feeder not practical for the purpose advertised. I will probably discard this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor design.","review":"Yes, the Gold Finch's can hang upside down to feed but the vertical separation of the feed holes are to close together and this allows other birds to sit on a perch and reach the feed hole above it.I will soon be looking for a different upside down feeder as this one allows any small bird to sit on it and feed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought it","review":"The feeder looks nice still after some seasons - mostly sun and some rain. I use a clip to attach it to a tree branch.Take the bottom plate off. I think the only use for this would be if you are mounting it on top of a post? Not sure.There are holes in the bottom of it regardless, not sure why. Air? Air already gets in through the feeding holes. I ended up taking my caulking gun and filling them in with silicone (Entirely out of site). But before I did this, any movement by the wind or heavy finch and seeds would fall out to the ground? Still happy with the product though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope...Bad Design","review":"There needs to be more space vertically between the stations, as the pesky house finches can easily stretch and reach the port above a perch.

A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not only for goldfinches","review":"The qualaity of this feeder seemed very good. But I wanted a feeder that the house finches couldn't use. They figured out they could reach a feeding port from a perch below. So they kept the smaller gold finches and pine siskins off the feeder. As a result I returned this feeder. If you don't mind the house finches eating all the food, then this would be a good feeder"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black finch feeder","review":"The feeder is all black and doesn't attract finches.

Then she says \\"I went over to my sister's house and I'm jealous because she's getting all kinds of finches at her feeder and I'm getting none!\\" I am giving this feeder a bad rating because my Mom does know what she is doing and this feeder is not attracting birds despite her expertise.

You put the slightly course granite structure up against wood or marble and you'll wonder why it took you so long to realize that granite just crushes better. The 8\\" size is perfect for my wife and I but my mother-in-law likes the 6\\" better since the weight can be a little tricky to handle going into the sink for a quick wash.Pound as hard as you like and if it involves peppercorns the fine dust will eminate throughout the area causing many to sneeze. It's that efficient. (Never happened with the wood unit.)It looks very impressive and almost imposing depending upon the size of your counter. The inner surface is slightly polished with the exterior unpolished and looking like it was carved out of a piece of solid granite (which it was).

Interestingly, \\"Silent Night\\" was eliminated from the album - perhaps another secular move to get rid of any reference to God. Be careful and check further on things you purchase over the Internet. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to exchange this for what I really want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Upon A Christmas","review":"This CD could have been much better because of the talents of Kenny Rogers and Dolly Pardon. Most of the songs were \\"HO HUM\\" not \\"HO, HO, HO\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Once Upon a Christmas","review":"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I know the holiday music is great but the CD cracked when I removed it from the case. I never got to play the CD. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like the \\"original\\" album","review":"I was so excited to find \\"Once Upon a Christmas\\" as a CD because somehow I let the my cassette version get away from me. One of my favorite tracks on the album is the solo of Kenny Rogers singing \\"Silent Night\\", which is one of the tracks listed on the CD online, for a total of ten tracks. When I got the album though, there are only nine tracks and \\"Silent Night\\" is not one of them. And I don't remember track #7, \\"Hard Candy Christmas\\" at all. Regardless, there should be a picture of Kenny and Dolly in the dictionary next to the word \\"duet\\". They blend PERFECTLY together! It's not exactly like my original cassette, but it's definately a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Music","review":"I had a copy of this recordings for years!!! Just think this is one of the best Christmas albums ever. My family knows I'm in the Christmas mode when they come in the door and they hear my music going. Usually too loud but I love it.....Once Upon a Christmas with Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers is the best!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CHRISTMAS CD EVER!","review":"We've been listening to this cd for 25+ years - it brings back fond memories for me, but is still an album my children enjoy at Christmastime too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie","review":"Glad to have found this oldie but goodie Christmas CD. I misplaced this one in a move several years back and was happy to hear Kenny and Dolly singing together again."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice bench but I need to drill one hole more","review":"quality control is an issue. I don't have a drill so haven't fixed the problem yet, but one of the screw holes is very shallow. Not being a tool handy kind of person, I haven't fixed it yet, so the bench is sitting in a corner, unused. but I'm sure it would be a great bench if I could finish putting it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for breastfeeding moms","review":"This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn. Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful. The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I didn't end my sessions with a backache. However, I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs (same benefits) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well. An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together (5-10 minutes tops) and comes with it's own allen wrench tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend to anyone with newborn!","review":"Purchased this item for use with my glider and love it! It eases the pressure on your hips and knees because you're not stretching on tippy-toes to rock. I would definetly recommend this to anyone who has a newborn and will be spending A LOT of time nursing or feeding. The quality is good...very durable. I have a three year old that has given it quite a few durability tests!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver","review":"Within a couple of weeks of breastfeeding, my back was shot. This stool provided so much relief. It also helps my husband, who has a bad back and chronic pain, sit more comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessity!","review":"I highly recommend this stool if you breast feed (and have it before you get home from the hospital!). I borrowed a glider that did not come with a stool and my back was killing me when breast feeding. You can easily take the stool with you from room to room and use with any chair. Now all you need is a Boppy and you're all set to feed!*****December 1st 2007, It's now over two years later and we still use the stool but now it's under our computer desk. it relieves back pain when sitting for long periods of time. I am now expecting my 2nd child and will move it back to the rocking chair when the time comes. Even if you don't nurse it's still prefect for sitting with the baby and rocking it to sleep or bottle feeding it. The stool is also washable. It got very dirty while under the computer desk from our shoes and dirty feet so I put it in the shower and with a sponge rubbed off the dirt. I love this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to put your feet!","review":"The stool makes nursing much more comfortable for mom -- especially those middle of the night feedings! I strongly recommend that the company consider making a darker stain and perhaps white. Of course you can always paint or stain your own to match your decor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nursing stool","review":"I nursed my baby in a glider without a stool for a few weeks. I didn't think I needed to spend money on a stool. However, after enduring the lower back pain that ensued as a result, I caved in & bought this stool. It's been well worth the buy! No more back pain. I now nurse my baby comfortably. The stool was easy to assemble & is the perfect height for me (I'm 5'2\\"). I am very happy with this stool."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I used this stool during my baby's first month. It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable. But after the first month, it became more of a hindrance. You don't need it if you are using a nursing pillow, like \\"Boppy\\". Pricey. Better to borrow one from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"A must have. You may be able to go without the ottoman if you are in a money crunch. I fed my son with this exclusively in my rocker for at least the first 8 months. The ottoman was too high for me and I am 5'6\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Although this is a very nice wooden stool, it has been worthless for me. It adds nothing to my comfort during nursing, and I trip over it every time I get up from my chair! For me, it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"This stool is great! It is the perfect height for me to nurse my baby comfortably. I use it with a boppy pillow. The only problem is I get so spoiled at home, its hard to feed my son while we're out! My husband put it together easily in a few minutes. Slightly slante but I guess we can still use it later as a step stool. I also use it while pumping for comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little stool","review":"Purchased this as a nursing stool for my wife and it works great. It's strong and easy to put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, good height. Could be wider.","review":"I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his \\"chair\\" and uses it when we read books before bed time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"OK\\"","review":"I should have purchased the adjustable nursing stool, then it would be useful with all my chairs. Easy to assemble, I did not find grip ridges to be uncomfortable, and the finish isn't bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced under-performer won't live in my house","review":"A wooden stool of this price needs to be well-made. The holes were poorly aligned, causing the thing to wobble. I sent it back and got to eat the original shipping price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the height, hate the ribbing","review":"This is a great stool. It make my legs the perfect height to nurse my son in his boppy.My only con is that there are ribs on the top of the stool and if you don't wear socks or something to cover your feet it tends to hurt them.Maybe I just have sensitive feet...but that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancel My Appointment","review":"Seems no one cared to review for a couple years. This author is new to me and my opinion of this book does not match the other reviews. I found it hard to buy the events in this story. The gulliblity of Steve was just too much. I could hardly finish the story. Why did it take him so long and need for eavesdropping equipment to realize his lover's involvement. I'm sorry but I'll take Robin Cook's thrillers any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Watch!","review":"This is the second Omega watch that I own and I absolutely love it! It has become my almost everyday watch for work. The image really doesn't do it any justice. The dial colors, the marker and the bracelet are just beautiful. You have to wear it and hold it to really appreciate it. I find that it keeps fairly accurate time and will hold enough energy for about 24-32 hours if not worn each day. I highly recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterling silver cartouche jewelry","review":"This is amazing. Love it. Exactly as described......probably better. Customer service, via email for word to be inscribed was prompt & efficient. I couldn't believe how quickly this came from Egypt. I bought the matching pendant chain, and it was a wonderful decision for both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly good","review":"I admit I wasn't expecting much, I bought the movie used from Amazon because it looked interesting. It turned out to be a good story, very well acted. Glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, but somewhat repetitive, exposition of Revelation","review":"The text consists of material from sermons and,therefore, has quite a bit of repetitive material.It is very complete, though, and serves as anexcellent exposition for anyone needing commentaryon the Book of Revelation. In almost all cases,the author takes the fundamentalist view. He isalso of the futurist school. These two positionsagree with my leanings, so they were not a problemfor me. Others, though, may want to take his stand into consideration before purchasing the book. I would recommend it as a reference, but perhaps would not as general reading since itis quite large and (as I have mentioned) somewhatrepetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sarabandes","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer (banjoboomer), these are wonderful performances, and, as he points out, Leonhardt does play the repeats in the sarabandes. And how beautifully he plays those sarabandes! In fact I fell in love with how Leonhardt plays the sarabande of partita no. 4; he plays it so naturally and with such a sense of timing that one does not easily realize how magnificently it is actually played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual correction regarding the instrument used in the English Suites","review":"The instrument Leonhardt plays in his recording of the English Suites is not a genuine antique, but rather a forgery made by Skowroneck and passed off by GL for a decade or so as a harpsichord made in 1755 by Nicolas Lefebvre of Rouen. Lebvre was a real organbuilder and instrument maker in Rouen in the middle of 18th century, but none of his harpsichords actually survive. All was revealed by Skowroneck in a fascinating article in the Galpin Society journal in 2002. The instrument, incidentally, is really fine and sounds as good as many antiques"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the praise","review":"My decision to buy 'The Conversation Piece' was swayed by the previous review that I had read which described the book in such glowing terms. However, after having received this book, I couldn't have been more disappointed. I was expecting to find clever conversation pieces that I could apply in talking with others. What I got was a little book containing many useless questions such as \\"In your opinion, which animal is the most beautiful?\\" and \\"What's the longest line you've ever stood in?\\" These 'conversation pieces' have very low applicability in 'real' conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy The Book of Questions instead...","review":"not very \\"thought-provoking\\" as the book claims, just get Gregory Stock's Book of Question's instead if you ARE looking for a true \\"conversation piece\\".."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"Sorry, but I bought this book because I love the \\"if\\" books and I thought this would be cool too. Basically it's a pretty lame imitation of those books. Yes there are some good questions, but most of them are pretty standard. And it seems sometimes like the writers treat you like a little kid. Shoulda saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"I didn't enjoy anything about this cd.It cannot compare in the slightest to the other I found here, the croat zagreb ansamble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This product is fine. I already have several pairs from another vendor. I like them and wanted more. My original vendor dropped the product. I ordered over the calf and got midcalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid date","review":"Johnny Rae was a drummer/vibes player from Boston (he's on only vibes here) who shows a strong Milt Jackson influence. He played with George Shearing for a while in the mid-fifties, and then made this album for Savoy in 1960. It's a solid outing all around. POTLIKKER BLUES is a swinging blues waltz in 6/8; ROLL ON DOWN is another blues, taken up-tempo, and both feature excellent Rae solos. Bobby Jaspar is on flute and plays well throughout, while a 22-year-old Steve Kuhn is on piano. Four of the seven tunes are Rae originals and are tasty and interesting.It's a good CD, somewhat on the hard-to-find side now, but worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and innovative!","review":"The price is a little steep-- the book is child-sized, meaning it's about seven square inches big-- but boy does it make up for its size in presentation! The flip-transparencies are ingenious, as well as the method for viewing it. My 5 1/2 year old son couldn't put it down. Its language is clear but not dumbed-down. There may be a few vocabulary words that the younger readers will ask about. But honestly, this is a GREAT introduction to human anatomy for this age group-- by far the best one I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing part","review":"I was disappointed that this book was sold with a missing piece. In order to look at the pictures on some pages there was a pull out \\"viewer\\" in the back. That viewer was missing from the space it was suppose to be in. The book is not usable without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"oH MY GOSH!","review":"I love Oshii's anime work. I was expecting Jin Roh the live action movie...I got it for about five minutes at the beginning of the movie(The suits looked awesome..very WW2 super soldier.) Then the bottem fell out. A drudging crawl of a satire about fascism and the... oh whatever... Buy the poster instead and you won't be disappointed. I'm a little biased in that I really wanted a cool Jin Roh live action movie following the actions of the Kerboros...it is not here. If you are a film student studying Oshii...go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the trick","review":"I purchased this digital scale to replace the \\"manual\\" one I had at home. It seems to be pretty accurate and works well. The only thing that bugs me is you must calibrate the scale by pressing the bottom corner every time you want to weigh yourself. It takes 2-3 seconds, but still, EVERY time I have to do this? Then wait another 2-3 seconds for the weight to show. Also, this has only happened twice in the past month (I weigh in every day since I'm on a diet) but I stepped on the scale and weighed in 30 lbs less. Yea, I wish. When I stepped off, re-calibrated and stepped back on it was back to the old weight again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor","review":"Health-o-Meter's proprietary random number generator in a cheap plastic case.

Absolute junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Health-meter scale","review":"I was looking for a \\"no-frills\\" but modern scale. This is the one!

Having watched all the different releases of Neon Genesis over the years, Rei has always been the 14 year old \\"First Child\\" of the series. Now, Rei has grown up and looks fantastic as a Japanese \\"Race Queen\\", in her duo-tone swimsuit and required umbrella.

Most of the stories in this collection center on Bertie's old school chum Bingo Little and his extraordinary propensity for falling in love with \`every second woman he meets.' Notable in this book is Jeeves's constant displeasure at some ill-chosen article of clothing belonging to the young master, and his haughty way of expressing his disapproval - and, of course, Bertie's constant giving in to Jeeves's wishes. Although not the funniest or wittiest of Wodehouse's books, it is a wonderful introduction to the characters and the unique humor and style of Wodehouse. The story that stands out to me in this collection, on the strength of its purely ingenious premise, is The Great Sermon Handicap, followed by The Purity of the Turf.See next: Carry On, Jeeves"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Cecil has extensive theatre experience and it shows","review":"Jonathan Cecil has extensive theatre experience and it shows in his narration of another funny and pointed Jeeves classic in THE INIMITABLE JEEVES.

Wodehouse ever wrote.\\" I am in the process of reading Wodehouse books. On a second reading of this book, it pains me to write that this (same goes for Thank you, Jeeves) is not best in the Jeeves series. Inimitable Jeeves is pretty good till chapter 13 but then it seems the great PG just phoned the rest in - all the betting on sermons, village fair races, oye ve!By wodehousian standards, I gave only two stars but if the author was someone else, say Tom Sharp, I would have given 3 or 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny In A Typically British Way","review":"P.G. Wodehouse was a master satirist of the British upper class and his series of Jeeves novels are his most popular and well known works. This particular edition is one of the earliest Jeeves novels as I understand it and it is very funny. Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves find themselves in numerous sticky situations surrounding Berties friends and relatives. Usually just as there seems no way out the reader learns that Jeeves somehow has done something behind the scenes to manipulate circumstances to a positive outcome. A collection of characters including a cranky old Aunt, two incorrigible cousins and a few young ladies who are the love interests of Bertie's friend round out the cast. All in all a light hearted and amusing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This is one of the best Jeeves and Wooster books (and there are more than one that rate: 'best'), full of ripe Wodehouse wit and colorful characters. If you can't buy one, at least pick it up at a local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have a lot of room?","review":"I thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in, but really, it took up too much counter space.

(I'm only using the book as reference not collection.) Still, the book reeks of cigarette smoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth or ...... ?","review":"I always admired Mickey Rooney as a performer. He had tremendous talent. What a shame he lived his personal life the way he did. Even though I wasn't born until 1947, I grew up watching his movies on TV. I obtained a copy of the book recently and it is a quick and easy read. Yet I was astounded to read about his sexual exploits written in such a way that they belonged more in in a porn manner than in a book about his life. Obviously, Mickey isn't a gentleman and yet this book was supposedly written *after* he found God. About halfway through the book, when he related another startling episode about his life, I said to myself, \\"He's making that up.\\" While most of the book is probably based on truth, I think Mickey also created some events out of his wise-cracking mind and then came to believe them himself, especially since those who could call him on them are now dead. While disappointed in him I will still watch his movies whenever I get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I never grew up.\\"","review":"Mickey Rooney's 1993 autobiography is equally divided between his show biz memories and tales of his romantic exploits. He love of performing began when he first performed in vaudeville at the age of two. On to Hollywood, where he found steady work in silent pictures and became a box-office hit with theAndy Hardymovies and his musicals with Judy Garland. In the fifties, his star dimmed, but he has kept working and says he'll never retire.Rooney writes with surprisingly little hubris and is honest about his addictions to drugs, gambling, and women. He married eight times but also romanced just about every beautiful woman he met. The book is chatty and energetic and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. There are many movie and personal photos. Fans of Mickey and those interested in the golden age of Hollywood will enjoy this upbeat memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Treat","review":"Coming as it does from one of Hollywood's finest, this is one of the best classic Hollywood books ever written. What I like especially is that Mickey doesn't feel it necessary to trash anyone. Mickey truly believes that his life has been a blessing & is still enormously grateful for his opportunities & the fabulous people he's worked with.A great read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Revealing!","review":"Mickey definitely doesn't hold back!

If you like old Hollywood, you'll like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"He tells it like it was.","review":"I've always liked Mickey Rooney. In this book, Mickey pulls no punches and tells it like it was. This was an excellent read and he gives tidbits of info that outside of Hollywierd Circles, you would not know about. Like Marlyn Monroe was known through out Hollywood as having a certain talent she liked to do/was known for as \\"the best in Hollywood.\\"The book was very informative and he talks about the way it was back then... no holds bared. I respect Mickey for that. He is a real man, a great talent, not afraid to disclose when he got hurt, and the fun times he had. Thanks Mickey!Your a Man's Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"This is a great book to learn about Mickey Rooney. I grew up watching this actor grow in skill and spirit. He had a marvelous skill of learning his trade and managed to keep his humanity.

All-star cast of \\"old guys\\" who seem surprisingly up to their assigned task. Conveniently, many of the bad guys seem to be a little older, as well, so the heroes aren't as mismatched in this conflict as they might have been. I would have thought it just a nice yarn, but for the comments on the box about it being based on a true story, only declassified in 1978."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sea Wolves","review":"I love the actors in this movie, plus the story, so much went on during WW2 that we are just now finding out. David Niven always seems to play for the most part a tongue in cheek character. The story moves, has tension, action and no foul language, holy smoke batman, they made it thru a movie without filth or porn. Its a war story, a good one, entertaining enough I bought it. I only buy what I know I will watch again and again over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story good -- art direction terrible","review":"Story and acting were great. Loved the development of the plot.Art direction: costumes, hair, make-up were all late 70's/early 80's in style. In the opening shot, I was wondering if this would be a flashback movie with the big-named actors only bookending the real movie--I was wrong. Every lapel was the wrong size. Dresses were not 40's, but 80's. Men's haircuts were wrong. They were blow-dried--how anachronistic. Even the mustaches were the wrong size for the era. It sort of felt like a Magnum PI or the A-Team episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This movie has a great cast (all of my favorites), but you can tell from the long hair styles and 70's coloring of the filming that it is a more modern film. It had great potential. Gregory Peck is Gregory Peck. It is hard to not get a great performance out of him, but even he can't hold this film up. Roger Moore looks aged, as well as David Niven and Gregory Peck. It fails to capture the same drama of \\"The Guns of Navarone.\\" The sea attack on the anchored German freighter was hokey and not very believable. Not a bad B-movie, just not really worth more than $5.00 to see it. For free, go ahead and see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover Art A Bit Deceptive","review":"The old addage \\"dont judge a book by its cover\\" applies to the DVD.

And the modern sub on the back is not in this film......"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sea Wolves","review":"I could not wait to receive this movie. I am a classic film lover; especially a good World War II movie. However, this movie left me wanting a whole lot more from it. It had a stellar cast, but the sound track was difficult to hear the actors speaking. The plot really dragged on in the beginning and I was wondering when the movie action would pick up. . . . . and sorry to say, it really did NOT. This could have been a fantastic movie as it is based on a true story. It was sadly dissatisfying for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"dougv","review":"Slow moving and the plot is boring.

I was lost at the very beginning. I would throw this in the trash but I would hate to be throwing away money. I hate that I bought this new. Maybe used for a dollar would have been better. I have watched a lot, alot of War Films. Old and new. And this movie is not what you would expect from the Top Notch names that are in it. Gregory Pecks is not at his best in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plaid - Spokes","review":"Curious album, this. SPOKES does suggest a return to their Black Dog days, as you're lulled by the vocal ambience of \\"Even Spring\\" before the rhythm comes in. But what made the Black Dog unique is the way their songs constantly morphed and took on new shapes. \\"Crumax Bins\\" is hypnotic but doesn't develop as much. Same with \\"Upona\\" -- beautiful set-up, not much of a conclusion. There's a certain density to other tracks: \\"Zeal\\" and \\"Cedar City\\" are full of sound and texture. It's all mesmerizing and harmonious, but oftentimes disappears into the ether. The jaunty \\"Get What You Give\\" does make a strong impression, however, with its instrumentation. \\"Quick Emix\\" closes the album with the same weaknesses and strengths that appear elsewhere. Still a worthwhile album, even if it fails to scale the heights that it should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Let down AT ALL! I'm PUMPED!","review":"This record is different than most the Plaid I have heard. This record is somewhat more progressive, yet they are not doing as much of the uneven beat sound. Something I read somewhere states that this record is more like the stuff they did as Black Dog. I have never heard them as Black Dog, but this record is much more hard-edged than Double Figure or Not For Threes. The openning track did remind me of Rest Proof Clock's last track, but it deviates from there and gets rowdier. This still has the signature Warp sound, but it is a very exciting release to me. More guts, more ba??s... you know what I mean. EXCELLENT spin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not them","review":"I am very disappointed with this album. It's noisy, no melody, not diverse, the worst Plaid album. If you want to hear good electronica you'd better buy Not for threes or Rest proof clockwork, those are masterpieces. Spokes is monotonous, it tries to be very different from their latest works, but unfortunately it became nothing but noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"This DVD is great. There's not a lot that I can say about it or Ween that hasn'y already been said here, but wow. The bonus CD clocks in at 17 tracks, which is much longer than I expected.

Off the wall plot. Just a little bit far-fetched. The camera man forgot to come in when they filmed this. Seems like they threw up a camera and hoped to catch as much of the movie as possible.

However, I did miss the fact that DL Hughley opted to not hit the concert circuit again. I guess once was enough. Anyhow, listening to this CD, you can just imagine the type of antics that they were showing on stage. I highly recommend this CD, especially for fans of Bernie Mac.

The casting was superb and the drama that ensued throughout the race was addicting. There was one scene where a team threatened to slash another team's tires and there were two car crashes in back-to-back episodes. Some of the phrases uttered were laughably memorable and the places ventured were absolutely gorgeous and full of history. The breadth of the season is quite expansive and I absolutely adored every minute of it. I will have to say that Chip and Reichen are my favorite team to have ever run the race (paired with Colin & Christie, Jonathan & Victoria, Jet & Cord, and Bopper & Mark).

Tracks range from funky, horn-driven jams like \\"Bootyopolis\\" to reggee-influenced political commentary on \\"Campaign Trail.\\" The styles are vast, the attitude is loose, and the messages cover everything from AIDS and unemployed vets to eternal mysteries like \\"work or beer?\\".

So after playing a few rounds, here is the main thing to keep in mind if you decide to purchase these toys: The shock is real. I found that the more you get into the game and increase your adrenaline, the less painful and noticeable the shock. But you will feel it, and the high-shock setting can be a little painful. The initial shock, when set on low, isn't exactly the most pleasant feeling in the world, but it is bearable. I'd describe it as the feeling of your arm falling asleep, and then hitting it against something. It should be alright for teenagers (around 15) and older.

Most Christians are aware that the Catholic and Orthodox Churches adapted a lot of early pagan holidays and holiday rituals to help the people transition from pagan religions to christianity. They advise rejecting any such practices in the Church today.They base their own ideas of what our church services should be on a very peculiar interpretation of a few verses in 1 Corinthians, chapter 14. And yet this practice, they call \\"proof texting\\", which they roundly condemn in others, is exactly what the authors are doing themselves. Taking a few verses from the New Testament out of context, and fleshing out their entire theology.

Perhaps I expected something more than what this author could give on the subject, but when it was all said and done, it spoke volumes to me about the author's biased toward the home church and the evil of the modern church.It's unfortunate that George Barna attached his name to this revision, I will not be able to look at his surveys in the objective light that I once did.Blessings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"This is one of the worst written, agenda driven, criticisms of the Body of Christ I have seen.

This is a great, easy to read compilation of how we (the church) got to where we are these days. The fundamental point that I got from reading is this: Church is WHO WE ARE, not a place we go or a thing we do. This book is eye opening and revolutionary because it confronts so many of the traditions many believers take part in on a weekly basis. I, like many of you, grew up \\"going to church\\" and never even thought to ask why is it that we all do things almost the same way, despite denomination or whether we're protestant or Catholic.

Practices is the key word. If u were looking for a history of how one ancient religion morphed into the next, this isn't it. This is a very narrow look at how the modern church strayed from it's organic roots and adopted practices such as: buildings, alters, vestments, and a professional priest/preacher class from earlier non-christian cultures. It is not much more than an argument for returning to these aforementioned organic roots. Read the Gnostic Gospels it is way more interesting and makes the same point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book. Informative and challenging","review":"For the Christian seeking more than the status quo in their spiritual life. It's not a devotional, nor easy reading.This will challenge your core beliefs. Not about God or the person of Jesus, but the church. The church of the 21st century has moved away from its founders roots. Jesus still stands as the cornerstone of the church, but the institution of todays church does not even remotely resemble its radical, dynamic, and transformational beginnings. Only read this book if you are seeking for something more in your understanding of His church and your spiritual journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"not at Dallas Seminary!","review":"This is one of those books crammed with facts that may not change anyone's mind about how they practice making a life in the way of Jesus. In my case, it was a convincing argument about how bad things are and why they will not change as long as the vast majority of branches remain too distanced from the vine to get the nourishment they need. I cannot go back to warming a pew and faking it. So if you are enrolled at Dallas Theological Seminary, and expect to make a good living providing pastoring to a flock... good luck!

Look at God's word! It's obvious what need to happen. Th Living Christ needs His rightful place in our midst. His complete headship. Why do so many local bodies of believers look crippled spiritually? They are not crippled, they just think we are a small business and those concepts will apply to us. So many people have so many gifts and we accept the way we do it on Sunday and it has no New Testament basis. Christ The Revolutionary wants His bride to himself. A new believer as of 2000 I am. A heart for orphans and widows. A heart for my wife and sons. A heart for The Living God. This book has shown me how to pursue God, show others to pursue Him and to never settle for man's tradition over The Manifested Jesus Christ.

The authors could have said it all in one paragraph, we believe house churches are the real way to do church and everything else is wrong. And I don't really touch the arrogant way it is written. Writers that write about topics like this and then show no humility make it difficult to read or hear what they have to say. I mean for crying it loud the last I knew Barna was a member at Saddle Back or one of the other mega-churches and here he is now pushing house churches. Dressing up for church, pulpits, tithing, buildings, preaching etc. You name it they are the experts. I mean most mainline churches don't demand anyone dress up anymore. This was some great example of being in touch with reality. I have read lots of historical writers and if I had to say read something to explain history I would recommend N.T Wright or someone like that.

However, he offers no viable alternative. The model he does suggest offers more problems than in the church.

When I would ask, I usually got rolled eye balls and never a real answer. e.g. In the Church I was a part of for years, there was what was called 'After Glow' and a time for The Holy Spirit to manifest to and thru the Brethren there assembled. Why do you turn the lights down? I thought we were Children of light! (Luke 16:8; John 12:36; Ephes. 5:8; 1 Thes. 5:5;) No answer with the eye rolls.

However, a poor conclusion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with \\"home churches,\\" but unless Frank and George walk to the home church (or ride a mule), in sandles (or barefoot) wear one-piece togas, draw their water from a well, sip a bit of homemade wine during the meal of lentels and fava beans, they are no closer to emulating Jesus, St.Paul, the Corinthians, Galatians, and other early churches than those of us in structured churches. So what is their point? George Barna did his organization a disservice by signing on to this diatribe of modern Christian Church bashing. If the same information was presented in a positive tone, rather than a negative one, it would have been an enjoyable historical read.

This book gives Chrisitanity a major history check. If you have ever wanted to know why a church does \\"this\\" or \\"that,\\" then this book is for you. My eyes were widened after I read about the origins of some of the practices I was raised on. However, this book is not for the faint-of-heart. I say that because it can really shake you up about Christianity; it might even make you angry or bitter towards Christianity. But that was not the purpose of this book. I feel the purpose was to help people have a more educated understading of why congregations do what they do and where that practice came from. The authors are not trying to tell you what you are practicing is wrong, they just want you to know why you do it and how it started.

I think some of his criticisms are needed, but his back-to-the-roots house church is really just another form - complete with music, sharing, teaching... I am not saying this is bad - God uses our own culture/interests/structures/styles to reach us. I am also not against the house church movement and think it is cool that God is moving among his people in this way - but I also do not think everyone should abandon the more traditional movements.

But to then turn about and presume to stick out your tongues at the rest of us who haven't given up, trumping up arguments as to why you are right and we are wrong? Very bad form. Perhaps you haven't realized this yet, so let me just clue you in here--you've left the institutional church behind. The rubicon has been crossed.

It reveals the sources of the changes and the devastating results of those changes reaching on into our time. It is truth that few in Christianity are aware of to their detriment. The authors include the challenge for christians to dare again to \\"do church\\" the way Christ led the original disciples to do it. The book is very well written and is quite hard to put down once started..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown.....","review":"Wow, I was really looking forward to this book. I waited two months for it to come out. I pastor a emerging style church that has challanged many traditions so I am not upset from a traditionlist standpoint. I love Barna's stuff and couldn't wait for this one. While it has some interesting info to think through, I didn't realize it was just a big advertisment for organic churches. It's one thing to educate and discern, it's another to be a walking commercial that if you get it..leave your church quietly and not cause a stir, if you don't, well you weren't ready for the truth yet. And how do you have a book that talks against modern churches using video to \\"entertain masses\\" co-authored by one who owns a company that makes videos for the church. I still love Barna but the agenda (not the info) in this book was very unsettling to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pagan Christianity","review":"Great book. Really makes you stop and think about the practices you often follow in your church and your life and re-evaluate if you really want to continue some of them. Can really give you a lot more freedom in your Christian life and not blindly follow what's become popular and/or \\"required\\" in living a life following Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too harsh","review":"While it is very good to re-evaluate at times and make sure we are all still on the right track and didn't lose ourselves in unhealthy traditions and such, the way Viola and Barna present the matter here is degrading and disrespectful. Some of the questions that they raise seem to come from personal disappointments and negative experiences. The overall tone of the book doesn't serve but scolds the body of Christ in a unnecessary way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What Expected","review":"This book was really a big disappointment to me because the responses of the contributors are so heavy with political and social commentary. I was hoping to read how those areas (Latin America, Africa, Asia)interpret certain Bible passages but so much \\"third-world\\" rantings was brought into it that it appeared more like a text on sociology. Really, a very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How firm is your foundation?","review":"This book will shake most. Why do you believe what you believe...is it scripturally based or \\"tradition\\"ally based? Would you like to know the roots of where the things that most Christians do on a routine basis come from? Are you ready for those answers...and more importantly are you willing to do something with that information? This book really makes you think. It is an eye opener. Search out the truth. Yes, read the book, but search out for yourself. See what can happen. Excellent book!!!Having my teen read it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and annoying","review":"i took a look at this book b/c it seemed to get have great quotes from reviews, but i was quite disappointed. the book contains two plays, both for one actor. the title play is marginally better, and concerns an english boy who loves judy garland and lives in a dysfunctional family. he takes up work as a male prostitute and eventually escapes to america. the story itself is unoriginal, and the style tries unsuccessfully to be deep. images such as birds flying away are incredibly trite. likewise the second play smooch music is supposedly an exploration of love and sex, but in reality is an incoherent mess of attempts at surrealism and depth. also, the majority of it was written as songs, and as lyrics they simply read like bad high school poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I ordered","review":"I ordered a book entitled \\"On Death and Dying\\"; I received \\"Questions and Answers on Death and Dying\\"...a supplementary book to \\"On Death an Dying\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Enchanted Evening is enchanting!","review":"This album takes you on a stroll down memory lane, enchanting all the way.

Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace. However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense. I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-)Sigrid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost his best","review":"Out of all of Crichton's books, only Jurassic Park topped this one.

The story is about a doctor named John Berry. His coleage is arrested for an abortion gone wrong that ended in murder. So Dr. Berry plays detective and tries to get his buddy out of jail. The book takes place during one week and has an ending that I did not expect at all.This was one of Crichton's first books, and the profit off this one sent him through medical school. The book is full of medical terms and has a lot of footnotes that make you constantly have to move up and down pages. Although this isn't Crichton's best, I didn't even use a bookmark because I never put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton's first, but not worst novel","review":"When I got A Case of Need by Michael Crichton, I had extremely low expectations. This was Crichton's first novel, written in 1968, and he was only 26. However this was not the case. The novel was much better then I expected.The novel revolves around a pathologist named Dr. John Berry. Dr. Berry's friend has recently been arrested for murdering a girl who comes from one of the leading medical families in Boston from a bad abortion. Dr. Berry investigates to find out the truth.This is a good story that gives the reader an inside look into the medical industry in 1968. This book is certainly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone must read this book","review":"Let's dismiss the fact that Crichton is a great novelist for a moment. Now let's take a look at A Case of Need. The writer obviously knows a lot about medicine. Besides that he can write a heck of a suspenseful fiction story. Now we will take back into account the fact that the writer is Crichton. You can truly say that he is one of the best fiction and science fiction novelists during our day and age. If you like his other books you will definitely love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good classic detective story, but gets muddled in the end","review":"That was basically it. I really liked the first three quarters of the book--up to the point where Berry first meets with Wilson the lawyer. I was sitting there, with my teeth on edge, waiting for something momentous to happen next, and... it went flat. The ending left waaaaay too many characters just hanging--the father, the stepmother, the other doctors. In general, there were too many of them--doctors Berry meets casually, their names too similarly Anglo-Saxon, their little habits unmemorable--it was difficult to keep up with the names.What I really liked was the little look into what goes on in the world of medicine--and little hamburger places! I don't think I'll ever have a hamburger again in my life... It was also a fascinating, albeit a harrowing, look into the time when the rich women in this country were sent to have their abortions to Puerto Rico, and the poor ones--down dark alleys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book.... captivating 'till the end!","review":"This book is absoloutly riveting!

It is also poorly research as far as the abortion issues (I believe), no matter your view point. Finally, there are so many footnotes and references to the appendices that it really is hard to follow.

Sure, Chrichton is very accurate in his details of the medical world, but at the expense of developing his characters. If you are a fan of Dickens, Greene, John Irving, who make their characters real living beings, do not pick up this Chrichton book. The \\"who did it\\" in this myster book is so insignificant to the story that I frankly found it the easy way out for the author. \\"I've got to invent something just to end this dang book,\\" you can hear Chrichton saying to himself.Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it much","review":"In my opinion, this book is Michael Crichton's most boring novel I've ever read.

The book is similar to one of his later books \\"Airframe\\" in that there is a lot of investigative work, but hardly any action.I was hooked to this book because it was very suspenseful and had a very well thought out plot to it. My only complaint about this book is that there were so many characters that the characters and their roles in the story had become confusing to me.However, I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to almost anyone. Before reading this book I was pro-choice and I must say that this book has further supported my beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it at all.","review":"I only read it because I had heard how good it was.It was MC's attempt to bring up, a then, controversial subject.I read fiction for fun, not for latest controversy.Was not an enjoyable book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"If you like Crichton's earlier and non science-fiction work you'll like this.

A pathologist called John Berry is investigating the arrest of one of his best friends, Arthur Lee. He is convicted for aborting a girl named Karen Randall. As he goes deeper and deeper into the case, he finds more and more secrets and scandals until he finds a surprising culprit. You'll have to read the rest to find out who. If you like a thrilling story with some medical background then this is a book you'll enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"This must be the first book to read...","review":"I like all kind of medical thrillers, I like Palmer, Cook, Sheldon (Nothing Last Forever) and of course Crichton, when I started to read these kind of novels, many times I had to go to the dictionary to understand many medical descriptions, or ask some friends what does it mean this or that in the hospital, this book explain all that and after you read it you will understand many things about hospitals and doctors, this book doesn't say anything against any doctor as other medical thrillers, in this book you see how the doctors try to help themselves and their medical friends.The case of the abortion is good, nevertheless you will not know exactly how John knew who was the bad guy, he just found it, so, at the end you will be a little disappointed but you will learn many things about doctors, for example: do you really know why the clothes of the M.D. are white?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this book.","review":"I found it to start out great but then the story dragged on too long.

I cannot believe all the great ratings people have been giving it! First, it was obviously NOT written by Ms.Hawn - she had an omnipresent ghost writer. Second, the regurgitated \\"wisdom\\" that is spewed is simply that! I do not want a pampered, silly Hollywood-ite to tell me how to raise my children, look at spirituality and live my life and that is basically what she attempts to do. Ugh! I can't begin to tell you how insipid and flimsy this book is. DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for more.","review":"I've seen pics of Goldie with the Dali Lama and was looking to get a spiritual picture of who she is.

I consider myself lucky that a friend had the book so I didn't loose $$$$....sorry Goldie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people are missing the point of this book . . .","review":"This is not a conventional biography . . . and it was never meant to be. What it is: chapters of experiences in Goldie's life and what she learned from each one.It's a great book . . . written with a sense of fun, yet with an underlying stability and with the knowledge that family and relationships are the most important elements of our lives.This book will offer you insights and reading it will give you a sense of calm.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Goldie, but the book? Not so much.","review":"I love Goldie Hawn and will see any movie she's in, many times. (How could she not have been nominated for an Oscar for First Wives Club??) That said, this book was disappointing. She's interesting to listen to on talk shows, so I was surprised I couldn't read this book without my mind wandering. Maybe I'm just not that interested in Goldie's musings on...breathing...life...karma...whatever. Too ephemeral for me, not enough real-life feelings and details."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story about a real women","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have passed it on to lots of mothers I know.

Goldie literally needs therapy. I do not respect her or her lifestyle that she has tried to sell. I am disgusted that Goldie has created a scenario of lies which keeps Kate's father from having a relationship with his daughter. What Goldie Hawn has written is an amalgam of her own fictitious ramblings that co-exist with her fabricated self-righteous sacrifices which have forged a divide with the Hudson kids and their father. I am aghast at her blatent lies and how she weaves the truths into a warm and comfortable blanket of deceit that she believes the public will accept. The book is just as dishonest as the image of Goldie on the book! She looks NOTHING like the cover!!! Hence Goldie Hawn wants to SELL you the IMAGE that SHE wants YOU to BUY! Well, thank God I did not buy this book. Hopefully, you won't either unless you enjoy toxic regurgitated fools GOLD fiction. Get REAL Goldie Jeanne Hawn!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get interested","review":"I don't remember Goldie Hawn from Laugh In.

I couldn't get interested in it so I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Danielle Steele","review":"I absolutely loved this book and have told so many others to read it. Goldie is so down to earth and let's no stone go unturned. She knows how to live her life and inspires others to learn from her and know that what is really important isn't the material things but the memories and experiences you pick up along the way. Thank you Goldie! I've passed the book onto a recently widowed neighbor who can smile alittle bit more while turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a sweetheart!","review":"I love Goldie Hawn and her book.

She is a very sweet and inspiring lady, and her name fits her perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous Flower","review":"Goldie is an American Icon - she is so charming and funny but this does not come across in the audiobook. She read the audiobook and it seemed pompous and self serving. When something serious happens this silly music comes on and you wonder is this for real - really. You get the sense she is trying to let everyone know how great she thinks she is. The greatest daughter, sister, wife, mother ....... Hey and what about \\"Foul Play\\" she does not mention it and she was so great in that movie! I think she is terrific but it does not come across in the audiobook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story to Share","review":"This is a fascinating read. Goldie's everyday life is filled with artistry and a world of dance. When she begins working at a young age she tells a story most honestly, the way it really is. She survives an accident in NYC. Becoming an actress was filled with highs and lows. She expresses agonizing times, but becomes very successful. She travels to different parts of the world while working with the movie industry. She opens a door to her personal life, marriage and children. With her warm, wonderful laugh, she invites one into her privileged life that she has earned. This book was hard to put down, I highly recommend it.Mimi Goldfarb"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clint Walker Western","review":"This was an entertaining western for those who like the old fashioned kind without the Clint Eastwood blood and guts or the profanity-laced modern western.

Track 11 \\"harder\\" and track 13 \\"Drink Beer and F***\\" are so hilarious..this cd is a must-have for those 2 alone. A few of the other tracks have some decent grooves or the vocals arent bad, though most sound like something that came out of the mid-80s at latest (hello, its 1999)..but the cd is indeed worth the money.

The book is well organized and includes topics such as Crystal Care and Selection,Creating Crystal Grids and helpful charts showing astrological and chakra correspondences.As an Angel Healer I particularly found the directory of crystals with channeled messages from each crystal quite interesting. The writers also provide information on quartz terminology such as 'generator' and 'phantom' crystals which is quite easy to understand.Those who already have a good working knowledge of crystals may be a little disappointed by the listings in the directory when compared to more extensive directories in other books on the subject. None the less, I think it is still a useful addition to any crystal library and is very handy for quick references and encouraging you to explore the world of crystals even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough details","review":"It didn't include a lot of known gemstones and just didn't have all the details I'd hoped for.

However this book was used by myself as a introduciton to crystals and the idea of crystal therapy. I am a psychologist who uses holistic and spiritual approaches in my work.

If I wanted to use my intuition to determine where to place the stones, I wouldn't have purchased this book. People buy books to learn what the author has to offer. We don't hand over money to close our eyes and guess what to do next!I'm so disappointed in this book;I don't know where to begin.This is just more money down the drain. I beginning to wonder who in the heck writes these raving reviews? People are churning out books and making mega bucks. I have no doubt that they know something because they're making a lot of money on the junk they toss out.

I found the pictures of the crystals to be very helpful. The layout was easy to follow. The information offered was clear and informative. I keep it handy when I am working with clients or searching for new stones. My grandchildren love to look at the pictures. They will often pick stones out at the crystal store they have seen in the book. It offers the archangels connection and a channeled message from each of the stones.It is a great resource for anyone just starting to work with crystals and their healing properties. It is a wonderful way to connect with the Ancient wisdom the stones have to offer and Angelic realm for a powerful healing.Susan Mavity Author The Light Within, The Gift of A Rose"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and white pictures only in kindle version","review":"I bought this book because it said it ha color pictures of the stones. However, the Kindle version only has black and white images. This is not much better than no images since many crystals look alike except for their color. The black and white photos are not very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I did not like how the author consistenly refers to Spirit, Goddess, Heaven, and other religous ideas. The reason I chose this book was to find out why I was drawn to a certain type of crystal. I found their writing to be preachy and the content left much to be desired in the way of actual information about crystals. The book just talks about how the crystals are our friends, but only grazes the surface of the individual properties of each crystal and what they mean in your life. I was disappointed. The pictures are not large and beautiful, they are just small representations, and not all the stones are represented in this book. I would say that this is a poor compilation of facts and it is worth every bit of $12.95. In this case, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"I love Doreen Virtue and ordered this book on the strength of the other books I've purchased by her. I was extremely disappointed in the book I got, however. The book is printed in extremely large font - which was presumably done to accommodate readers with eyesight issues - but, for me, the formatting made the book extremely difficult to read because it was so unattractive and off-putting. I was also extremely disappointed that there weren't pictures of all the stones in the book and that all of the pictures were in black and white. There are way better crystal books out there, and way better books by Doreen Virtue. I'll be returning this one to Amazon ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doreen Does What She Does Best!!!!!","review":"Crystal Therapy is a fantastic introduction to the metaphysical world of crystals. Does it cover every crystal? Of course not! But it certainly covers MOST of the ones that MOST of those working with crystals will ever be using. The way she connects the angels and crystals is work the price of the book alone. Does each description agree with all the other crystal books? Of course not, but no two books or sources completely agree anyway!Doreen is the BEST at gently bringing the metaphysical to the masses. THANK YOU to her for that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Gems of Wisdom","review":"This is a beautiful book co-written by Doreen Virtue and Judith Lukomski, where you learn the messages, meaning and insight that crystals have within their energy, and how it can help you as it pertains to your life.I had the extraordinary honor of listening to Judith Lukomski speak about crystals at a conference, and her extraordinary wisdom and the answers she gave to the people in the room was enormously helpful, especially for me! Just opening the book to any page can also give you a \\"message\\" that I found surprisingly on target, and it really did help me.This is a great book written by wonderful lightworkers that will surely uplift your life.Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence"},{"rating":"1","title":"A really great introduction to beginners","review":"This is a great book for beginning to explore gridwork, angelic influence, and a basic intro to many stones. Despite the attempt, this book still mislabels several stones, and the information is very limited.

Beyond the beginner, I do not expect that many shall use this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is lacking","review":"I've been a fan of this band ever since Deluxe came out in 1995. I loved it and still do, just like their amazing follow-up Friction, Baby. Sadly memorable songs like The Killer Inside, Hung The Moon, WWOZ and Cry In The Sun make me wonder what happened after the release of How Does Your Garden Grow.In my opinion the band went pop, watering down their unique sound. Additionally the cycle of Greatest Hits, Live albums and re-released tracks (Lifetime first appeared on Closer)suggests these guys are either broke or running out of fresh ideas. If you can get your hands on their hard-to-find album Artifakt (2000, Fudge Records). Now that's a five star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I have loved them since my days at LSU listening to them live at Fred's.

There is not a single song on this album that you will want to skip over. NOT ONE! It starts of with \\"burned\\" which kinda reminds me of swing swing swing by all american rejects. \\"A lifetime\\" appears again on this album, with a little revamping that does nothing but improve a already awesome song. \\"Juicy\\" is as catchy as a song as you can write/sing. Once you hear it, its in your head all day! If you don't know the song, it is used in the Desperate Housewives ads on TV. Overcome (very elegant), it's only natural, special (used on ESPN), A southern thing (a good southern rock song), and our last nite (one of my favorites on the CD) are all extremely good songs. Take a chance on Before the Robots. You will be really glad you did! And definately check Better than Ezra out live if you ever get the chance. They put on the best live show you could ask for. Just ask this veteran of 8 BTE shows!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but dimenishing returns for this band","review":"I'm a huge Better Than Ezra fan, but I must say that I've been experiencing diminishing return on their albums, starting with Closer. Don't get me wrong, this album is good, with plenty of catchy and introspective songs, but it doesn't call me back for more like their other albums have. This album, like most, has grown on me over time, but it just doesn't seem quite as musical as their previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Former quasi-fan","review":"BTE has never been one of my favorite bands, but I did like them in their early days. I think this album is a good example of what happens when a band doesn't change and grow over the years. I'd have to say the production sounds great on this album, but the content is desparately wanting (sorry!). The songs are more of the same sounds/wriffs/melodies/lyrics you've always heard from BTE. However, some tracks are downright annoying (\\"Juicy\\" or \\"Southern Thang\\"). I listened to this band in my highschool and college years (10 years ago). Instead of maturing, it sounds like they are still trying to write songs that appeal to the 16-20 year old age range. I was hopeful when I saw they put out a new album, but I won't be as enthusiastic to give another listen when they put out the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This is a very enjoyable book. It is NOT a wildlife book, but a book about a couple that chose to live in the wilderness among the wildlife. It is about their adventures and about the grizzlies that they lived so close to, as well as the other animals. When you consider it was 1919 it is also a history book.

As a movie, however, this leaves a lot to be desired. This is essentially a book on tape, with some still pictures from the book.

Like many albums on the Qwest record label, this album definitely has some noticeable R&B touches, and Watts' energetic saxophone playing melds nicely with some of the funky, synthesized beats that give this album its distinctive 1985-ness. Underrated by fiery vocalist Phil Perry contributes vocals to 3 songs, and his soulful, passionate voice only deeper enriches an already solid formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I went to the library at my college and check it out.

Yes, this calucator shows the problem - but NOT the steps they teach in school. There are no 'figuring' steps, so he still has no idea how to carry over numbers, or borrow for substraction, or add a zero for double-digit addition. There's nothing showing him how the answer was found - just that there is an answer. He certainly knew this from the other calculators in the house. In other words, the only thing this calculator does is set up the problems in school format - it doesn't show how to solve it, step by step, which is what is required by the school. We are back to square one, and my son is no closer to solving a two-digit subtraction problem than he was before we bought this.

The multiplication X sign is more like four slashes that do not come together at the middle - does not look like a multiplication sign unless you know what you are looking at.

I can definitely say that when I take these, I'm a much better person.Update 09/01/11:I noticed that I would frequently get migraines after I took these vitamins.

While he continues to use a template to his writing that is consistent with every Dirk Pitt novel, the subplots were well developed and interesting.The Celtic history and questioning Homer's Odessey were very entertaining.Anyone who is a fan of Dirk Pitt is ready for his near death-defying feats. Cussler uses Dirk's introspective very well. I do believe that Dirk Jr. & Summer characters need to be much more developed.If Cussler is ending the Dirk Pitt saga, I hope that he greatly improves his other series. The Golden Buddha was far from entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Cussler Write This","review":"Did Cussler really write this book? Weakest plot of any of his work. Unlike his others, this book starts very slow...and then fails to pick up speed. And mistakes? There were many...especially with directions like east and west (hurricanes travel from east to west and not west to east as Cussler said)or distances like hundreds of miles and thousands of miles (the Pananma Canal was 100's of miles away and Cape Horn was 1,000's not the other way around as the book indicates). If Cussler actually wrote this book, who edited it? I have thoroughly enjoyed all the fiction Cussler has written with his name on the author's line. Until I read this one. It's a shame that Dirk and Al had to end their careers (or so the story implies) on such a low note. And how exciting are the books with Dirk Jr. and Summer as the main characters going to be? Being brother and sister, Cussler can't even turn the series into romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clive's Best Work","review":"I've been a Cussler fan since the mid-'80s and have read everything and anything his name his on. But I've got to say that this is by far my least favorite. The writing is pedestrian, the story predictable, and the characters just do not live up to their terrific heritage. The introduction of Dirk's kids is awkward, and at first more than a little confusing, since his son is also \\"Dirk Pitt.\\" I think what surprised me most was the repetition and appalling lack of editing the book recieved. Clive repeats facts, scenarios, and background information over and over again in different chapters, as if it was the first time being presented. It's almost like there were long gaps during his writing period where he had forgotten what he had already written. I guess that's understandable, but what's not understandable is how all this got past his editors! I would highly recommend most of Clive's books, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst Cussler novel ever","review":"The prologue was bad, the next 20 pages were worse, I gave up after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Base plot OK, writing suffers.","review":"The plot may be doubtfully realistic, but it's not what bothers me about this book - Actually the plot idea is fairly exciting. The way the people talk to each other, really bothers me. It's either scriptspeak, or overtly complicated. It's just not realistic. Even in heated action the characters will use complicated play-on-words, analogies and sayings which seems completely ridiculous to me. The way brother and sister talk to each other also seems way overscripted and complicated. People just don't talk like that.Moreover there's a lack of degrees of contrast - From the happy happy rosy family dinners to the evil emotionless enemy (who will still be shocked, though, at seeing an american flag, while the good guys will stare in reverence.....sigh).But the base plot is good, and I kept on going because of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story...poor writing","review":"I am not a follower of Cussler's books...a friend gave me this as a gift. Cussler's plot suffers from poor writing and even poorer editing. Statements like \\"...win, or occasionally lose, which wasn't that often.\\" make no sense. How does something like this make it past an editor's desk? Unnecessary words hinder textual flow. If you say \\"occasionally\\" you don't need \\"which wasn't that often\\". The book is full of this type of writing.If you are a fan...go ahead. If you are used to reading polished authors, you will be annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear.","review":"this is my first cussler novel, and seeing as this particular book is the last of a series maybe i needed to get some background on the characters before reading it. now that i have read it the chance of this happening is zero. Simply put this book has nothing to recommend. the plot is dull,the lack of excitement is astonishing for such a well known author, the two main characters Pitt and Giordino whilst on their deeds of derring do never come close to being in any danger at all. what surprised me the most was the numbing dialogue, characters often explaining the banal with regularity, and if you use dialogue to explain all of the plot it better be done well,otherwise,like this novel,its gonna be sooo bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"I've enjoyed Cussler for several years. I admire his work in marine archeology. But he's no longer on my buy vs library list after this one. The one saving grace for the book is it exposes the reader to Iman Wilkens' hypothesis about the location of Troy and the evolution of the Illiad and Odyssey. Beyond that the book is littered with factual errors a sixth grader would spot. The characterizations are the thinnest parody of the worst of the Bond Movies. The tempo is uneven. The dilemmas are so over drawn as to give melodrama a good name. The basic premise is the least plausible one to show up in one of his books. I read it through hoping it would improve, and it just got worse and worse.At the very best this book is better than being trapped in an airport with absolutely nothing else to read...but only just."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illiterate Trash","review":"Four sentences, pulled at random from different chapters, should tell you all you need to know:\\"Now as their objective stood before them it became obvious that unlike the others towns and cities they had sacked, this one would not fall without a long and lengthy campaign.\\"\\"'You ain't gonna believe this,' he answered in a Georgia accent, 'but the last dropwindsonde profiling system I released recorded horizontal wind speeds of up to two hundred and twenty miles an hour as it fell through the storm toward the sea.'\\"\\"Exotically designed minibuses with luxurious interiors and painted lavender pulled up to the aircraft to accommodate the passengers.\\"\\"Seemingly adhered to the marble slab, he could not move nor turn his head.\\"Talk about phoning in your work!

This book was fantastic! I've read every Clive Cussler book to date, and this one did not disappoint. Once I started reading this, I couldn't stop. Believe me, it's that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you and what did you do with Mr. Cussler","review":"Being a huge Clive Cussler fan I usually grab a copy of any new novel he releases. Trojan Odyssey was no exception, however the quality of the writing makes me suspect that Mr. Cussler is on hiatus. This book could not have been written by my favorite author, it's not even average. After seeing Robert Ludlum release a new book (apparently from his grave) I'm beginning to believe that there ought to be a disclosure if the work is not that of the author listed on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a POS!","review":"I realize this is fiction, and I realize an author can take liberty with his works, but I have to admit: I am used to authors who try to remember what has happened in their own previous creations. Cussler obviously doesn't care anymore. For one, how can Loren's father be present when Dirk found his DEAD BODY at the bottom of a lake in Vixen 03?! And HOW can Cussler write that Loren strayed and returned when Dirk slept with how many women?! Pot meet Kettle! And finally, I never understood how the twins exist at all since Dirk and Summer never had sex! I'm going to attempt to forget that this book was ever written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trojan Odyssey","review":"I've enjoyed Cussler's books in the past. (although his recent penchant for including himself in a cameo appearance in his novels is a little bizaar!) I did not care for this latest effort. In fact after reading about 1/4 of the book I just closed it up and said \\"Nope, I'm not going to waste my time with this drivel. Seems like he wrote it just to meet a deadline. Nothing new or exciting really. So, I'm thinking Cussler is off my list of authors to seek out for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown Crud","review":"It's difficult to know how to describe this book. Exciting, gripping, realistic, well-written, intriguing, thought-provoking? This book is none of these things. The plot would be considered overly silly for an Austin Powers movie, and I seriously expected that at any moment, the arch-baddie (Spector) was going to appear on a video screen in the White House to demand 'One Million dollars'.The dialog would be considered poor for a 1950's Boys Own comic book and the characterization is so thin that my partially blind pet cat could see through it. The only reason I continued through to the end was the fact that I was on a dare from my wife to finish it. I could not recommend this book to anyone, even if they were in solitary confinement in a Turkish prison and the alternative was insanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops Clive!","review":"After reading some of the less flattering reviews I decided to read Trojan Odyssey for myself, not believing one of my favorite guilty pleasures could have missed so badly. Sad to say, though many of the \\"Cussler\\" gimmicks are still included, they seem weak, over done and flat in the overall plot this time. Dirk's kids are just not interesting and after spending so much time with them before the plot takes any real \\"action\\" I wanted to send them to their room for quiet time. Dirk (Sr.) is getting long in the tooth and would be better served if replaced permenantly with Kurt Austin ( a doppleganger to be sure, but hey, no insufferable offspring yet.). Maybe Clive is stretching himself too thin these days, maybe his flare for exciting thrillers is running dry. Whatever it is, I hope this is only a blip, and if he needs three or four years between books to get back in top form, I'm willing to wait before crossing him off my must read list - after all, so many books, so little time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"I was looking for an adventure book and was fully expecting elements that were somewhat beyond reality, but this was ridiculous. A floating hotel with guests totally oblivious to the dangers of hurricanes in the Caribbean? A billionaire who ranks among the world's wealthiest but who remains completely anonymous even to the CIA?The writing is extremely laborious (was Cussler paid by the word?) and the dialogue does not even closely resemble everyday conversation.I tried to convince myself that I could get through a few flaws and still enjoy the story for what it was - but I could not. Ultimately, I just stopped reading. If you value your time in any way, don't bother picking this one up. Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly engrossing, but badly written","review":"While well-plotted, Trojan Odyssey is so unevenly written that I found myself distracted every few pages by another clumily constructed sentence. I could tolerate the bland two-dimensional characters, but when I read a best-selling author who's seemingly so indifferent to the quality of his work as to fail to proofread it, I begrudge him his literary success.I won't be reading Clive Cussler again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I cant give zero stars.","review":"Blah blah blah, I laugh at this idiot who tries to rewrite history in his own words, a total moron, cant believe this garbage got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Someone gave me this book, plus Valhalla Rising. I'm not sure why I continued reading after the first few pages. Maybe morbid fascination. Cussler is one of the worst writers (\\"Curse you, Red Baron.\\") I have ever had the misfortune of reading. In a word, he's awful. Dennis Halsey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Valhalla Rising (but that's not saying much)","review":"OK, a bunch of disconnected \\"historical\\" factoids which are never really tied together coupled with a mystery scheme to get rich. Throw in the usual cast of characters and predictable events and you end up with a mess.The good news (for fans of Loren), is that her Dad who was killed off 3 years before Vixen 03 (a very good book, BTW) has had a miraculous recovery from his death. I guess Vixen 03 was a \\"dream\\" (aka Bobby Ewing) - like the dream that we all have that Cussler could still put together a good read. Clive - TV programs use people called \\"continuity checkers\\" - you might want to investigate that! I also found the obligatory CC appearance at the end to be even more contrived than usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latest Dirk Pitt novel","review":"Couldn't wait for this one to come out. Well written as all of Cussler's books. He seems to have toned down the action a bit, but still managed to keep me riveted. Unfortunately Cussler is chosing to retire Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano.Still I'm looking forward to the next one by Cussler, I believe it'll be out in July, and it is called Lost City, most likely with Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirk Pitt Not on His Top Form","review":"3 and 1/2 stars for this novel actually, since no halves, thus feeling generous, I go for 4 stars. I might change this view in other times to a three-star. This novel is not one of Cussler's best. A decent novel, though for first timers.The only fancy part is the half-floating hotel somewhere in the ocean somewhere in the world. Should try other Dirk Pitt adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"You can't go wrong with Cussler, He can't write a bad book. This one is not my all time favorite so I did not give it 5 starsDragon and Inca Gold and Sahara are better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Dirk Pitt?????","review":"Perhaps the last Dirk Pitt adventure, Dirk and his friend Al go after an industrial druidic feminist cult (wow!--must have used a \\"plot wheel\\") that plans to change the world's weather and profit from the chaos. They are backed by the mainland Chinese. The background for all of this is the theory that the Trojan war was not about Greece or Turkey, but about the British Isles and tin mines (tin is needed to move from the copper to the bronze age). Odysseus traveled not to the Mediterranean but the Carribean. Sort of interesting and almost believable. A decent yarn, which might be Dirk's last (he is getting a little old for all that activity)and two major things change Dirk's life. Perhaps some of the future action will go to his son and daughter. BTW, the editing could have been much better. Typos and dangling modifiers all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trojan Odyssey","review":"Very entertaining. Not as fast pace as all his previous books but still makes me continue reading nonstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Rocks!","review":"Taking historical fact and creating an exciting story is something all of my history teachers could never do. Cussler does it again. After you finish this one - check out PARADISE MADE by eric steeves. I think it might be a pen name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a B- movie","review":"Melodrama, poor writing, extremely unbelievable action sequences and a massive once in a millenia storm. Am I describing a new Steven Seagal movie? No I'm talking about Clive Cussler's novel: \\"Trojan Odyssey\\". Which isn't to say that the novel was all bad. The alternative history detailed in the first few pages of the book had me hooked. There were also some well thought-out scenes where Cussler was able to demonstrate his considerable knowledge of marine wildlife and archeology. These items alone weren't enough to carry the book however.If you are looking for intelligent edge-of-your-seat storytelling I wouldn't recommend this book for you. Then again I, like most of us I think, enjoy a good B-movie once in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepubescent adventure.","review":"I picked up an audio version at the library as I have a long commute. After just hearing Steve Martin's hilarious \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\", which kept me in stitches for five lovely hours, I'm afraid I may now drive off the road asleep.It is clear that this is meant to be adult entertainment but it is so self absorbed in style. OOH, Dirk Pitt has a bunch of cars! Listen Excitedly as they drink a nice wine! Then our hero saves the day by miraculously spotting someone who planted a bomb on his ship! Everything happens so dramatically! God, I can't stand it! I'm only finishing it because I want to write an awful book myself!

Read 'Flood Tide,' 'Atlantis Found,' 'Valhalla Rising,' 'Black Wind' 'Treasure of Khan,'or any of the previous works to discover your love of the series and James Bond-like escapist fantasy. My absolute favorite is 'Atlantis Found,' which can't be beat for pure audacious story-telling and incredible set-pieces. This novel was an oddly boring snooze that was badly written and edited even worse, if it was indeed edited at all. Perhaps this is why Mr. Cussler now hires \\"writing partners\\" for all his works. Immediately after this, the books are much improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAGGING SUPERLATIVES","review":"I picked up this book, remembering a few pleasurable volumes of the past. What I forgot is that I was in HIGH SCHOOL at the time! I found this book to be so fantastic, absurd, and boring that I could not finish it. Even a good book of the fantasy genre has a plausable fact upon which to build the story. This has none. I do not know how an adult reader could enjoy this type of work. On the other hand, I would recommend it to high school freshman and sophomore boys who might not have an interest in reading. It might be attractive to them. To others - - stay away. And with that, I will be silent as I would be embarrassed to admit I tried to read this book to any of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I like a good thriller with a nod to history and other cultures. This wasn't one of those books. It was a bunch of nonsense, poorly written and with a weak plot, weak character development and nonsensical scenarios. The first and last of Cussler for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stick With Dirk & Al.","review":"Why is the author slowly letting the superstars Dirk and Al fade away???? Dirk's children are very, very boring. Please stick with Dirk & Al. I am sure there are many capers and adventures still left for the two heros.

But, to my dismay, I found the story subpar and the narration dreadful. Ron McLarty reads the entire 5 CD's in a monotone designed to induce sleep rather than provide enjoyment.

The island rhythms of The Wave, Normal, Best Years of our Lives, and Break Away are terrific! A real \\"feel good\\" CD! Also the remix of Lime in the Coconut is unbelievable! Worth the price of the CD alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Somebody Make Them GO AWAY!??","review":"I could tell you how I feel about the Baha Men. Like, for example how I don't feel that barking and screaming \\"WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?\\" qualifies as music, or how every song they've ever put out sounds absolutely identical to every OTHER song they've ever put out, but instead, I'll let you know what I think of this CD.The Baha Men have put \\"Move It Like This\\" riding the wave of short-lived fame they received from \\"Who Let the Dogs Out.\\" If you listen to this CD long enough (and oh gosh it's so long), you will eventually discover that every track on here is the same as the one before. They just scream to put lime in the coconut or move it like this a little louder in some places.Don't fall for it.

How Mr. Stormer slants that information is a bit hard to stomach.I am homeschooling my children and am always on the lookout for information to further support this decision. If I can bring myself to pick up the book again I think I'll find some more valid reasons to do so hiding amongst the \\"real\\" reasons for this books release.I think a more appropriate title would have been along the lines of \\"How the evil, sinful homosexuals of the world are attempting to brainwash our children in our schools\\"Unless you share this very biased Christian view, the reading of this book is going to be very hard going.If you can take what you want and leave the rest, this book does have some value to offer in making clear what some of the problems are today with our school system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious Twaddle Masquerading as Critique","review":"I am reminded of a movie review I once read, which began with the phrase \\"Bad, Bad, *Worse* than Bad.\\" Mr. Stormer pulls out every fundamentalist cliche in the book, from posting the 10-C's in classrooms (a nasty violation of the separation between church and state), to sneering about the teaching of Evolution in biology classes (*that* old chestnut - when are these Creationist pinheads going to dry up and blow away? When?) The King James Version is not an answer to *anything*, much less to our underfunded, overburdened public school system. If we were really interested in school reform, we would be studying the highly successful (and highly secular) systems of European and Pacific Rim countries, which regularly slam us into the pavement academically- notably *without* recourse to either the Bible or to frightened fundamentalist old men like Mr. Stormer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dumbing down has to stop!","review":"Although this book contains some fluff, it makes an outstanding point. Anyone who thinks that the children who attend public schools are better educated than those who attend private or home school need to do some serious research. The public school system is a complete FAILURE and it just keeps getting worse. My children have experienced home, public, and private schools.

The moral decline and lack of respect in our schools is appaulling. When you have teachers that are telling you that homeschooling is a good decision, you know something is wrong!

Since Sunday at 2 am I am running two sump pumps, a refrigerator, a freezer, tv, cable, internet modem, and a couple of lamps, as well as occasional use of espresso machine and grinder, toaster, and charging phones, ipads and computers. The circuits have not overloaded, and it runs at least 10 hours in one full tank with all these things connected. Only downside is noise, and instructions are poor, but using it is very simple. Never had to pull crank more than once, and my basement is incredibly dry thanks to the uninterrupted use of the pumps. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for camping.","review":"We recently took this generator on a camping trip.There were two campers to hook to the generator and run.There were two small 5000 btu AC units,but the generator performed well.The only time it struggled was when the AC units compressors started at the same time.Only then did it die and have to be re-cranked,and then start only on unit at a time.The gas held up OK as far as a generator goes.I did notice that while the generator was not in use it had oily substance seeping from the gas cap as the days heat caused pressure to build up in the tank.As far as putting the oil on day one ,all i did was tilt the generator to a 45 degree angle and block it from tipping over and filled,replaced the oil cal and set it back on the ground.The main reason i purchased the generator was for the home,but was certain it would preform well at the camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good generator for the price","review":"I purchased this generator to power a small work shop at my house.

It did come with minor damaged when shipped. The spark plug wire boot was shattered and it came with no manual. I was able to rig the wire and did not need the manual as it is very simple to operate. It does not come with oil so be prepared to buy some before hand. My unit cranked on the first pull and has done so every time since. I have about 15 hours on it now with no problems.

I got 20 minute to put everything on, no problem with fueling the oil. Got it turn on in the first pull. However, it was rough. I went to the internet and download the manual to see the trouble shooting. It doesn't help much with how you set up the choke. I have to read my Honda Power washer to set this properly.

I put in a Reliance Controls generator switch ($140) on my house and ran a refridgerator, freezer, water pump, and a few lights with it. I also used it to power the air conditioner and a light in my horse trailer. It starts OK. For the money it is a good generator. It's not too noisy, but it is a little loud for camping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little generator","review":"I bought this generator for my parents, to keep their fridge and freezer going and allow them run small appliances during a power outage. This unit seems perfect. I like that wheels and a fold away handle are included, and the unit starts easily and is fairly quiet. The only negative comments I have are that the pull start handle is blocked by the front panel, making it necessary to pull the rope partway out and then pull it at about a 30 degree angle to the motor to start it. This isn't a big problem, but over time it might cause the rope to wear faster than if you could pull it straight out. As other other reviewers pointed out, the oil reservoir is nearly impossible to fill without a long, very narrow funnel, but since you may only do this once every few years, again, no big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived broken","review":"This product arrived with a torn carton and broken part that made it inoperable.

I recommend changing the oil frequently until the engine is broken in. I ran it for an hour than changed the oil, I did that twice, than again at 5 hours. The only problem I had is that one of the outlets had neutral and hot wire switched. You can pick up a little tester at a home improvement store for a couple bucks to determine this. customer service never responded to my countless emails about this. It wasnt a big deal to remove the front panel and switch the wires. the only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is due to the no response from customer service. I sure hope I never need to contact them for any reason in the future!

I received 2 units, both units fired up on the first pull of the cord. They are quieter than most generators that I've heard, however they're not even close to a Honda Inverter genverator. The generator on both units did not function correctly, it was running at 40Hz instead of 60Hz and the voltage regulation was horrible, dropping to 104V with a 1600 Watt A/C unit running, this about 1/2 the rated load of 3250 W. After the 2nd unit I gave up and asked for a refund. I'll find something else to use.

Some reviewers had problems with shipping damage which also made me hesitate, but the generator arrived via FedEx with only minimal damage to the box. The generator was free of any damage inside. Wheels and handle were easy to assemble...just be careful you find each nut and bolt in the packaging material. There was a hole in the parts bag and I found one of the nuts in the bottom of the box. Engine started on the second pull and wow does it run quiet and smooth! It's definitely not some cheap, whining sounding piece of junk like some campers may use. Also, the pull rope is not so difficult to get to like some reviewers say. I've definitely seen worse...this one was easy enough to pull.

The 240V outlet on it was angled through the mounting hole also, but it was because the wires to it are just barely long enough and the mounting \\"ears\\" were bent. I removed 4 bolts to access outlets from the back and bent the mounting ears back to correct this. You should have a funnel with a long spout to fill oil (I bought one for about $2.00). Filled it with oil & gas and it started on the 2nd pull. Adjusted choke and it ran very smooth and is not that loud (product descripton claims 68 decibels at 21-feet. The box states 75 decibels). I think it was a good purchase for my needs, hopefully only have to use it once a year at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO, SO Contraption","review":"The TG 4000 is not for the mechanically challenged. At least the one I received. As several have noted, the front panel was slightly damaged in shipment and the pull cord is in the wrong place. The plastic cover for the electronics NEVER fit properly, yet the inspectors sticker was on the cover which clearly could never have been in place to start with; what a joke!The good first - It starts quickly, usually on the second pull and it does produce electricity. The bad - only one of the two 110 volt outlets on mine work. Taking the front panel off and comparing the provided wiring diagram to the actual wiring reveals that the second 110v outlet is wired incorrectly; absolutely wired wrong.I intend to rewire it, but thought about sending it back;- far too much trouble to return it. So,since it provides only half of the electricity that it is supposed to provide, it gets a 50% from me. As we all remember from school, a 50% grade is a FAILING GRADE."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Bought this generator last dec for camping, started and ran for 2 minutes and then put away, when i tried it again all it would do is miss, and blow white smoke, i called eastern tool twice and was put on hold for about 10 minutes each time with no one coming back to me, when i drained the oil from the crankcase it was full of gas, terrible generator, save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"very unpleased","review":"I purchased this product 12/09 for mu husband to go hunting.

Biggest issue was it shipped without oil and, not surprisingly, it would not start without oil. After a frustrating 30 minutes or so of not starting, we finally realized that the missing oil was the problem. Started immediately after we filled with 10-30W oil. It should have been mentioned somewhere in the instructions that 10-30W oil was needed and that it didn't come with the generator (and you had to go out and buy your own)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price, BUT LOUD!

There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch. But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open. Now you would think that that's the point of the power strip cover, right? Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket.

I got this back when I was starting out with lucid dreaming and had been for about 6 months. This book was very demanding and the tasks it was saying to do could not always be done in one day. It pretty much expects you to lucid dream within about 10 days, which is incredibly unrealistic.I really do not like this book. To me, it sounds like the person wasn't that educated on the subject. Please, don't waste your money on this. It really does not include a lot of information and the title makes it very misleading.Definitely go by Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen La Berge. It is a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I only read the book about half way through.

I'm surprised the authors didn't suggest putting aluminum foil on your head and sleeping under a pyramid.If you're serious about lucid dreaming, pick up a book written by legitimate dream or sleep researchers who know what they're talking about.BTW, I've been accused by some of working for Stephen LaBerge.

Too bad because their earlier stuff (Choguy, La Galopera, Paraguay) was brilliantly performed - and much more authentic.I'd keep looking for their earlier recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not the Basis for a Movie!","review":"The reviews of some of Richard Burton's books, as well as those of other 19th century explorers, strike me as hilarious. It's as if people expect that these books to be written in a style that would make for some blockbuster Hollywood movie. This is the REAL DEAL people! Burton didn't write this or other books with the idea in mind of entertaining 20th century couch potatoes starved for action. Apparently people's attention spans get seriously taxed when detailed observations about a country's people and culture are brought into play. When in fact, what could be more important in a first hand account of previously unexplored (at least by Europeans) regions? If you want action at every turn and tailor made story lines then stick with Tom Clancy novels or some such. Maybe faketion turns some would be adventurers on, but not me. This book is a truly incredible account of a larger than life adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for...","review":"The shot glass is for a bar and was marked in measurements. The price was right. It was a gift and was a perfect addition to a new bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality construction","review":"I too purchased this table at a much reduced price during a lightning deal. The table has many problems and repeated attempts to contact the manufacturer have failed, they will not return a phone call.The goal system on this table does not work; it randomly registers goals even when no one is playing.The puck comes in contact with the playing surface and stops in several locations on the table. It seems there are many blocked holes in the perforated playing surface. There is a inch air gap under the playing surface and the surface is supported by wooden slats with channels cut in them, presumably to permit air flow to the holes. Because of sloppy workmanship, the slats are misaligned and cutting off air to the holes in the playing surface, not just one or two holes but rows of holes have no air flow.This table is solid but, because of sloppy workmanship and a complete lack of customer service, it's beyond repair and going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not even compare to the books!","review":"This DVD was a total waste of money. The plot was boring and the children acting in the movie had bad attitudes. Not at all what we expected from the Sugar Creek Gang. I'm glad we only bought this title. Had this DVD been good we were planning to purchase the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"It would play and stop, play and stop, play and stop. We never got to see the whole movie. The DVD was a big dissapointment to my 5 year old grandson. He couldn't understand why a new movie that just came in the mail would not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for electronics Kits! But a little expensive","review":"I've bought kits like theMintyBoost 3.0 Kitand this little guy is indispensable. I was using theHelping Hand with Magnifying Glassto hold my kit at first but I was uncomfortable with the toothy alligator clips and the fact that they were metal. This holds small circuit boards very steady with safe plastic clamps which don't conduct electricity or clamp teeth on the board.I was able to use a gift card to bring this down to 10 dollars, but I don't know if I would have bought it other than that...It seems really expensive for what you're actually getting. It's helpful but there's no way it costs anything near 20 dollars to make this device.The other drawback I had with it is that you can't really swap boards in and out. You have to twist the little lever for a minute or so to readjust when you put new things in. Maybe this is true for all vices, I don't know, but it was a little time consuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"The metal base is very strong and sturdy, but I was disappointed with the flimsy plastic jaws.

It works great for holding anything from XLR's to 1/4\\" jacks to circuit boards that I'm drilling/soldering. It clamps fine, even after years of use and is adjustable to almost any angle. If you are soldering on it, you want to be careful not to touch the iron directly to the jaws for too long since they are a type of plastic, but it has no problem holding 1/4\\" jacks that are 200+ degF. I would recommend this for anyone doing work on cables or small circuit boards."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK, does the job","review":"The Panavise Junior is a funny blend of heavy metal base with a plastic vise. The vise jaws are not very rigid, though for holding circuit boards and wires for soldering they do the job OK. The ball joint is a bit annoying as it's hard to lock it down tight enought, and I would prefer a real ball joint that is not restricted to a single axis. I'm leery of reefing down on plastic parts because they like to break. I've had mine a few months and it's holding up all right, and it appears to be metal-reinforced where it counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Product","review":"Great for holding small electronic parts, durable, and easily transportable! I will purchase the C-clamp for this next and looking to aquire one of the larger models. No regrets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick and useful but don't forget it's a plastic grip.","review":"For holding PC boards while assembling and soldering, I've been very pleased. Instead of permanently mounting it somewhere, I simply use it where I'm doing a project. The metal base is stable and sturdy so there has been no issue. My only caution is a reminder prompted by my own stupidity. I was using the PanaVise to hold a 3D printer hot end while I applied voltage to cure the ceramic head I had just painted, only to realize that the heat was melting the vise itself. No major damage but it serves as a reminder that if you're working with heat, this grip has a low melting temperature."},{"rating":"2","title":"just as good as the bigger models","review":"When I got this vise, I screwed it down to a scrap piece of wood to give a more stable base. Now it is the perfect vise for holding miniatures, models, and circuit boards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you're studying the subject!","review":"I needed some field study recordings for an ethnomusicology seminar I was preparing. All of Lomax's recordings fit that bill. However, if you're looking for something for pleasurable listening, well...you might fight this a little rough around the edges! Remember: these recordings are the real thing: untrained musicians and singers, not always singing in tune, not always playing in tune. In addition, the recordings are done using older technologies (between the 30s and the 60s).That, of course has its charm, but I think I would recommend it primarily to students of ethnomusicology."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNIX Help","review":"UNIX still rules!

But I am little bit disappointed because they are not that soft and thick. I was about to give them as gifts to my grandparents, but I am afraid I have to find other stuff to give them instead this one. Anyway, the stuff still worth the money that you pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the Price","review":"I ordered this scarf in Ocean, which is a lovely color, but other reviewers are right - the cashmere does shed a bit.

This chair is great because it grows with your child. I bought one for each of my other kids and they love them. The chairs and cushions have survived rough treatment over the past 3 years and still look as good as the new set I brought home yesterday.

For me, it was a split between re-hashed anecdoates that I've received 100 times via group e-mail and a filmography of who-almost-got-the-part in old movies I've never seen.I guess I was expecting a little more substance. My copy was only about 90 pages long (10 cents per page) and each page contained 3 or 4 little quotes. Few of these quotes seemed to represent \\"big\\" missteps or miscalculations and many of the subjects could not have \\"known better.\\"I would have preferred the book focus on more important issues and explore each one further so that we can learn from the mistakes of others.Maybe it's because I'm not an \\"I told you so\\" kind of person, but I can't imagine who would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No bubbles or shrinking sides","review":"I had never used these before.

These little pie weights take care of that problem.Just place some parchment paper on the bottom of the raw pie crust and fill the pie crust to at least half way up.I actually bought 4 of these packages , which fit nicely in a quart jar, so that I can either do one deep pie crust or 2 standard height 10 inch pie crusts.Then when the pie crust is done I just lift these out using the parchment paper and put the crust back in the oven for 5 minutes to brown the base.These little dickens retain their heat, so be carefull about grabbing them right after you remove them from the oven. Let them sit for half an hour and then they should be okay to handle.These are a great product, a real bakers helper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product works, shipping was a total miss on the sellers part","review":"The glass mason jar they were shipped in showed up completely shattered, due to the lack of protection inside the oversized box.I was giving as a Christmas stocking stuffier, and was short on time, or I might have tried to return the item. But, instead I bought a new container, and obsessively cleaned each weight of shattered glass (probably not a welcome ingredient in a pie crust!).My brother (the recipient) has use them a couple times since, and says they work well though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meh","review":"They do what they're supposed to: they stop the pie crust from bubbling up.Unfortunately, trying to get the damn things out of the pie crust caused me to drop the pie crust and splat it all over the floor and little hot ceramic balls went everywhere.

Wager is the standard good cop who breaks cases due to his work ethic and insight without taking the easy way out.In this book, Wager is investigating a murder mystery where the corpseless head (as opposed to headless corpse) is found in the Denver botanical gardens.Dated somewhat in terms of crome sophistication, being written in 1979, it doesn't ride about the level of an ordinary detective book. No real twists and turns in the plot. Its not a *bad* book, but there isn't anything to particularly recommend it. I would give it 2&1/2 stars if I had that option, but can't bring myself to round up to 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"It didn't fit my vehicle as described.

You always know where to go and I love the airplane levels. There are plenty of pros, but the only con is the other players or soldiers in the game. They'll wait by a doorway and as soon as you're halfway through it they'll rush through themselves, pushing you back in. If you are in cover (in their way), they run through and push you out into the open. I died countless times in veteran (the hardest, most realistic mode) because of this. I would've given it a full five stars in both ratings if not for this. It is still the greatest game I have played for psp, and I don't regret buying it.

However, much of the material is reprinted from the more lengthy and generally superior previous two books on MIT's hacking tradition, \\"Is This the Way to Baker House?\\" and \\"The Journal of the Institute for Hacks, Tomfoolery & Pranks at MIT\\". I bought this book since it includes some more recent hacks than either of those two. Nightwork is worth buying, but if you really want good books on hacking at MIT, find yourself used copies of the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good soup!","review":"I tried the Vegetable Medley when Campbell's first introduced these soups, several years ago. I'm always looking for it in my local stores, but they never have it, so I was surprised to see it here on Amazon! It's very good, flavorful soup. I'm an incredibly picky eater who doesn't like chunky vegetable soups, but maybe because of this soup's smooth texture with no weird veggie textures getting in the way, that's probably why I like it. (Note to parents: If you have picky eaters for kids, you might want to try this soup.... also, sneaking pureed OR very finely diced veggies into recipes is a very good way to get your kids to eat them. Gotta love food processors!)I wish Campbell's sold the Vegetable Medley in big huge cans! In the 10.75 oz cans, they're pretty pricey, but I love to treat myself to this soup now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version - publisher denies you access to reading your kindle highlights","review":"I bought the Kindle version of this book.

That is the power of persuasion. Do yourself a favor and DON\\"T order or read this book. Mine is going in the trash can. His theory of how our issues are the fault of our genes makes a nice little \\"blame it on the victim\\" story and people are eager to eat that up. Instead, it appears that the author is in need of some caring for himself. Maybe then will he be able to take off his dark glasses and realize what a false theory he has created. This book can only leave you down the wrong path. If you want to be happy - read some of Louise L. Haye's books or some books by Abraham Hicks. Those books will set you on the right path to happiness - not this unenlightened issue-laden book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I don't understand how this book received so many good reviews, unless the author has a lot of friends who shop at Amazon.I'll keep this short. If you're looking for help, you won't find it here. If you like outdated rhetoric, this is the book for you. For example, the author explains that one of the four cures \\"that work\\" for depression is electro-shock therapy. The last time I heard of someone actually receiving electro-shock therapy was forty years ago.In another section, the author spends several pages explaining that depression is more prevalent now than it was fifty years ago. Is there anyone on earth who doesn't know that?In short, please don't waste your money on this drivel! There's nothing new here, the author can't write a readable sentence, and the print is small and dark and smudgy. A difficult and useless read."},{"rating":"2","title":"We only have so much time.","review":"It pays to focus your attention and effort on what changes will give you the biggest gain for the smallest effort. Martin Seligman tells you exactly that in this book. Seligman is the reining president of the American Psychological Association, a thorough researcher, and a damn good writer. He not only tells you what is easier and harder to change, based on the research, but gives you short, to-the-point suggestions (also based on the research) on HOW you can change those things. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on the subject, and I can tell you Seligman has written a very practical book. It is definitely worth reading and re-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is insightful, and practical","review":"I work with \\"at risk youth\\", kids in the foster care system, socially disadvantaged and many who have suffered abuse. I have often wondered how to help kids who suffer from depression, anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress, etc. This book is very helpful because it describes the world view that will give kids resiliency skills, and help them overcome the emotional difficulties they have. It also describes what can't be changed, and how to deal with those aspects of emotional disturbance, clinically. This book offers validity to what I have observed professionally. Mostly, it offers a practical means of knowing how to address the problems I encounter with the kids I work with, and how to teach the kids how to help themselves. Seligman offers a perspective that is based on science and Biological Psychiatry. It's about time psychology moved in this direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful, but Seligman's other books may be more helpful","review":"This book reads like an encyclopedia, with solid information regarding numerous topics such as anxiety, phobias, obsession, as well as sex, dieting and alcohol. A better starting point for many people might be his books, \\"Learned Optimism\\" and \\"Authentic Happiness\\". Learned Optimism summarizes many experiments and studies, and provides the sound theoretical basis for Positive Psychology. This provides the credibility you may wish before you proceed further. Authentic Happiness builds on that theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seligman does a great job - again!","review":"Seligman transforms the complx to consumable. I was most taken by his approach to real issues that effect everyday folks - and things they struggle with, like weight, alcohol, anxiety and depression. What Dr. Seligman holds out is hope for the masses to know what they can overcome - what they can't, and where they should put their attention with some hope of success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quakers in America","review":"The history of Quakers is, in some ways, the history of America and its culture. Early forms of government, the fight against war, slavery, poverty were all influenced by the Quakers. Women's rights, many fields of science, the temperance movement were all fueled by the Quakers, who wanted not just to improve themselves but also the world. This book really helps you understand where Quakerism came from, how it has developed and where it may be going. A must for any library on Colonial American History."},{"rating":"2","title":"God, geological science and common sense","review":"If Christianity seems unreasonable and the Bible appears as a barren bed of 'Thou shalt's' and 'Thou shalt not's'then this book could reawaken your interest in both. It treats the Bible as a confirmation of all of life which can be explored and enjoyed.It is a most extraordinary integration of geological science, God and a farmer's common sense. The God of this book is sublimely transcendent yet part of every cell of matter, the ultimate, 'eternal, unchanging reference point'(p4). The book is logical and biblical without being limited by literality. For example, in relation to the question of the length of time taken for God to create the universe, it says: 'God did not work to the sun (it did not illumine the earth for the first three days!). He concluded each day when his purposes for that day were fully complete.'This is a readable, easily understood alternative to some of the extremes of the argument about the origin of the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work!","review":"I just received these a week ago and I've been eating them ever since.

And none of the pieces gets more mellow than track four, \\"Afterthought.\\" This is one of those, turn-the-lights-down, take-the-phone-off-the-hook recordings that needs to be listened to as dusk is slowing morphing into nighttime. And the sound? It's great -- you've not heard jazz (or any music, for that matter) until you've heard it on an SACD recording. Telarc's very fine multichannel SACD recording is the absolute best.

Gareth always defys his father,and gets into rather serious trouble, but Muffler and Grimbold help him.Muffler also meets the Hob,who lives in the barn and is the luck of the farm,and Madam Nettleweb, Sable's scatty sister.This is a fabulous book,full of magic and mystery.

I couldn't agree more or say it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time","review":"I'm not exaggerating...when I think of my \\"favorite\\" books, this one tops the list. Naslund is a wonderful writer and a pleasure to read! More than that, though, she is a masterful story teller, weaving in so many aspects of history and historical figures to keep it all interesting and evolving a rich, complex character with so many layers and such a complicated past. As I neared the final chapters, I began reading more slowly, so as to drag out the ending of the book. I was truly disappointed when the book ended--because I was no longer able to spend time with my favorite book character and my evenings would no longer spent in this wonderful, historical and fictional world Naslund created. There aren't many books that I hold on to when I'm done as I believe in passing them along to be enjoyed by others, but this one will follow me even through many downizings and moves...and I will read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I have read","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.

Who did not wonder what life had in store for Una and her third \\"husband\\"? The novel is flawed--too preachy (ills of slavery, religion, antifeminism, homosexuality), too flowery (the initial verse on her pregnacy loss almost lost me too), too obsessed with \\"famous folk of the time\\" (Emerson et al)--but she was so interesting and the novel so full of detail about whaling life in the 1800's, that I was disappointed when it ended on the cusp of her new \\"marriage\\".This novel is not a true work of literature, but I did find it truly enjoying. It is not Moby Dick, but I did find this \\"account\\" of Ahab's wife moving and provoking.I thought it was truly an enjoyable read, despite its flaws..and I cannot say that for many novels. I look forward to the author writing again with less preaching and more focusing for a truly wonderful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahab's Wife","review":"I am not sure why I so differ from so many of your other reviewers! I would not even have given it one star, had that been an option. It is tedious, WAY too long, and in my judgment an insult to Melville's giant book and characters. To me, it appeared to be the author's opportunity to celebrate her own brilliance: so much irrelevant information; so little character development; in fact, so little character. Unfortunately, Naslund chose to abandon the few interesting characters she did manage to develop and left their lives or deaths to the reader to resolve. There are so many wonderful books written about the period in which Una lived, I feel cheated for having stuggled through this trite and far too long novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lady Can Write!","review":"This is probably the most well-written book I've ever read. The story itself is compelling, but the language and style of the writing is what impressed me the most. Naslund delves so deeply into the psyche of her main character that I don't know how anyone can fail to see a part of him/herself in Una. This book will appeal to the contemplative, a quick read it is not. Take time and savor this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to satisfy a bibliophiles appetite","review":"This book was the equivalent of a dish I would not be able to stop eating! The writing is lush and descriptive and the story moves along so quickly that it's hard not to justify one more chapter before bed or before you end your lunch hour at work. when I finally finished this book I remembered my next door neighbor's summary of life, \\"You can't go through life without acquiring a bag of rocks.\\" In Una's case, it's how skillfully she manages to carry her bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found the time in my hectic schedule to plow through it. As with SP Somtow's \\"The Shattered Horse\\", I find it intriguing that such an elaborte, well-designed and interesting story can be based only on a single line of prose from another literary work."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Bestseller?? Not.","review":"I am on page 80 of this book.. and the worm is turning on my interest.Could someone tell me who made this a national bestseller? When the author puts Una as saying...\\"my father ... my name\\", then I know for sure how pretentious this book really is.The author tries to create her book in the style of Melville..and it fails.. only the gorgeous engraved illustrations(reminding me of Rockwell Kent's illustrations in a earlier version of Moby Dick) are stunning..Certainly not the characters or the heart of this book..I'm going to put it down.. unless someone can convince me otherwise......."},{"rating":"2","title":"A read good to the last word","review":"I'm confused. Has the mark of good fiction now become brevity? I didn't find a single word in this glorious book wasted. If anything, I was sorry that the book ended when it did, as I would have willingly continued to follow Una's adventures. What an amazing character! Women in the nineteenth century lived fascinating lives, but since \\"social\\" history did not come into vogue until the 20th century, we are only now beginning to know about the lives of women. Novelists, drawing on the knowledge that we do have, are filling in the gaps to create fully fleshed-out characters such as Una.If you're looking for a quick read, best look elsewhere. If you love rich language, love strong female characters, love tales of the sea, then read this book. Ms. Naslund is to be congratulated for creating a truly memorable character and for allowing such a character to experience a full banquet of life experiences.Brava!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs. A and the time machine","review":"I am surprised by the unflagging praise for this book. Although the language and description is well-crafted, I found the character of Una, and references from her point of view, jarringly twentieth-century. I refer not to her spirit, adventurousness, and desire to follow a different drummer, but to her \\"modern\\" political correctness in all things, admiration of the \\"athletic\\" (did they have aerobics during whaling days?), and lack of an 1800's viewpoint in any discernable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyous celebration of mysterious life","review":"This novel will make you feel as though every cell in your body is crying out at the wonder and ecstasy and painful beauty that is earthly life. It seems as though it was not written, but spoken by an aged woman by a roaring fire, telling every detail of her young life. This is possibly my favorite book of all, although it is in competition withThe Red Tent: A Novelby Anita Diamant. Don't be deterred if you haven't read Moby Dick, you don't need to know anything about it. This story is completely sovereign. Anyone interested in complete absorption with their literature, step right up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didnt want the book to end","review":"This is a very well written book that you just dont want it to end! Truly, Una seems to be so real. This is her story, her relationship with a much older captain, and her bonds. Definitely would recommend to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow-going at times, but a good read -- just like Moby Dick","review":"It took me a while to get into this ambitious book, but I was glad I stuck with it.Naslund covers the time period of \\"Moby Dick\\" from the perspective of the woman who spent part of that time as Capt. Ahab's wife. This book touches on all manner of subjects, including slavery, women's roles in the 19th century, sexuality, mental illness and religion.At times I wondered where Naslund was going with all this, and I got a bit tired of the main character's modern-day judgments on her situation. But overall this book is worth reading. At its base is a good story, and that story deals with all the peripheral issues in a way that will keep you thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical journey","review":"This is a BIG read-a fairytale for grownups.Adolescent Una is wisely sent to live with her mothers sister,in a lighthouse,to avoid the increasing possibility of abuse by her father,a religious fanatic. She spends four happy years with them before running away to sea,disguised as a boy,with two young men to whom she is equally attracted.This book is the story of her three marriages,the second of which is to Captain Ahab,a whaler and declared mortal enemy of Moby Dick,the great white whale. We follow Una through tragedies,joys,the loss of two husbands and a baby,to where she finally reaches true happiness and fulfillment. The book is peopled with an assortment of fascinating characters,and M/s Naslund paints incredibly beautiful and vivid word pictures of Nantucket and both the beauty and horror of living in a coastal town with all it's connections to the barbarities of the whaling trade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid.","review":"Overly long. I found the crux of the story to be poorly built up, and given more meaning than it deserved. On the whole, the problem felt forced and overly \\"symbolic.\\"There were a few moments when the book clicked, but they were few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so","review":"Naslund was trying too hard. Good story at first, but I quickly became bored. Can't copy classic style; she should have just been herself. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Fiction that Reads Like a Classic","review":"I have so much trouble finding fiction that is engaging yet meaty. I loved this book so much I was sorry that it ended! Una is a fantastic character - strong, yet very human. All the characters are wonderfully unique and multi-dimensional. I enjoyed the historical figures and references tied in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wasted Weekend","review":"Una made me tired. Everything bad that could happen, did. She continued to revel in her own strength, her own life, her own freedom, blah, blah, blah...I was fascinated by the seafaring stories and the character of Ahab. Seems that I should have read Moby Dick instead. I guess that's why that call Mellville a classic and this one a recent \\"best-seller.\\" That tell us that we are all wasting weekends.The Christian-bashing in this book (in the name of tolerance, of course) was like fingernails on a chalkboard - just rubbed me the wrong way. Una just doesn't \\"get it.\\" Transcendentalism, Universalism, etc all get their equal kudos, but she is absolutely closed-minded where Christianity is concerned.Two stars is a generous rating. Maybe I should reconsider. Should I order the hardcover or paperback edition of Moby Dick?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in a pleasing sort of way","review":"A wonderful Book into a woman's point of view. The soul behind Ahab but it doesn't stop there. Ahab's Wife is a great introduction to Moby Dick if you haven't read it already (shame on you) and a great book with a strong female lead. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular here.","review":"I purchased Ahab's Wife on the recommendation of others. I regret purchasing this worthless jumble of words. These 666 pages are filled with boring reminiscences and flashbacks. By the 60th chapter, the novel has barely progressed. The \\"heroine\\" is reliant upon other characters in the novel. Una is a weakly constructed personality, less of a heroine and more of a dependent. The writing is calculated and boring, formulated for popular success but nothing more. This is an enjoyable yet shallow read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped indoors with this book","review":"This was neither my first sprained ankle nor my last. But it was quite severe and required two weeks of ice and elevation in the middle of winter in an empty house. So I picked up the copy of Ahab's Wife that had been at my bedside for months...and then the real pain began. The \\"Everyone Loves Una\\" reviewer has made all my points for me, so I won't restate the obvious, but just one more thing: Who else found the death of Frannie's \\"Liberty\\" beyond the pale, even for this book? And as to the you-just-didn't-like-it-because-you're-a-bible-thumper defense, I'm a Berkeley commie pinko bra burner and I hated this book. You don't have to be born-again to see that the anti-Christian bent of this book is shallow and cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Reading Pleasure!!","review":"Terrific writing, stunningly embellished with vivid descriptions and details, but easy to read. Subject matter is fascinating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid and self-important","review":"Disclaimer: I didn't finish this book. I COULDN'T finish this book. It was so preposterously self-involved, so ridiculously dreary, so bloated with period-speak and crammed with philosophy, historical name dropping, heavy-handed pseudo-feminism and scientific lecturing, that I made it about a hundred pages in and gave up. A hundred pages. If a book's not going to grab me by then, it's never going to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egomaniacal Apologetics","review":"The first line in this book is brilliant, \\"Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.\\" It was all down hill after that. Naslund certainly likes to hear herself talk (write). She pontificates on a plethora of topics. She self-importantly weaves her \\"heroine\\" through a goodly portion of the current events of her time. Occasionally the prose tightens up and then she starts blathering again. We read this for one of my book clubs and save for one woman this was more or less the consensus. A man in our group thought the women would like it as he considered it chick lit, however, we soon set him straight on that point. Una seemed to be a user of others; a woman that sucked the life out of those around her. She was a woman without a soul on a spiritual quest. Portrayals like this do women in general a great diservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seduced and disappointed","review":"I was seduced into reading this book by the many positive reviews, and by a yearning to relive my joy of reading Moby Dick many years ago in high school. For the past two weeks I've gone from savoring the language and intriguing story of Ahab's Wife to skimming through the final 150 pages, impatient for it to be finally over. Ms. Naslund's blatant feminist agenda is rivaled only by that of Jean Auel, who attributed everything but the invention of the Internet to her Cromagnon heroine, Ayla. Una and her entourage are ultimately implausible as characters, standing more as icons for Ms. Naslund's beliefs. Ahab is the most human character of all, and I'll soon revisit him in his original incarnation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagarism","review":"I just finished rereading Moby Dick and then read, Ahab's Wife. It is a soup with too many ingredients. PLUS in the other reviews I didn't see any mention of the fact that she lifted word for word Ishmael's , \\"Whenever I find myself growing grim...\\" and put these words on P. 646 of her book . Obviously, something fishy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby Dick, who/what? ...","review":"I enjoyed this novel. At times, I found certain scenes/chapters to be a bit tedious; however, for the most part, it was quite enjoyable. Ms. Naslund was able to create a memorable character and story that can stand on their own. Moby Dick, what is that? Well, there did need to be the slightest mention of a wife in the original classic in order for this novel to be believable. The idea was original and the plot held true to the events of Moby Dick. I found it satisfying to hear about the events from a woman's perspective. Any lengthy discription of whaling would have put me to sleep instantly. This is a beautifully written novel and would be perfect for a book club discussion. I recommend this book for those who like historical fiction (whether or not they have read Moby Dick)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Test your endurance","review":"After reading the first chapter I was rubbing my hands together giddy with delight, and I believe you will too. This is a great author, this is great material! I could not touch the style and skill of just one of this author's paragraphs if I had a twenty years to do it. Honestly though, I eventually didn't enjoy the book as much as hoped. It's a little too feminine perhaps. As you continue it becomes obvious the book is somewhat of a soap box for \\"agendas\\" which wear thin and taint the prose. It was a challenge to see it through and read the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Soap Opera","review":"While this book is a compelling and well written read, it should be produced as a ABC movie of the week or on daytime TV. This book is melodrama in pure form. The author also gives the protagonist 20th-century thoughts in a 19th-century world. Una is not written for her time, but for our time. The author name drops famous people into the story, which serves the author's research well but tended to annoy me. It is highly unlikely she would meet Nathanial Hawthorne Margaret Mead or Maria Mitchell. But the worst fault of the books is that Una never has any flaws and unfortunately never develops as a character. I found myself wanting to finish the book but unsatisfied when I finished. There are better books to spend 600+ pages on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Upon a Whaling Ship","review":"My first thought was that this was to be a woman's book. Was I wrong! Of course, I never dreamed that Una, a young woman in the 19th Century, would prove to be an adventuress who finds answers to her curiosities by living them out. For this reason, I would highly recommend this book to able readers who are young as well as old(er). The book is written extremely well, combining dialogue and description of another Century in a believable and fascinating style. Una's adventures describe solitary and simple living,the courage of whale boat crews, and the frightening experience of childbirth in the wilderness. If that isn't enough excitement, there are a few other events to keep you interested. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This was a surprise book. One of those stories that grips you, not only with the beauty of the story but also by the quality of the writing. I read ALOT and this is one of my all time personal favorites. I am sending a copy to several of my closest friedns beacause I won't let my own copy out of my library. Well written, moving and a beautiful extension of the tale of Moby Dick."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars instead of 1 for at least a good start","review":"AHAB'S WIFE begins beautifully. A young girl, Una, is sent to live with her relatives in a light house because she refuses to adhere to her father's religious beliefs. She soon disguises herself as a boy to go aboard a whaling ship. The beginning sets the stage for what could be a very deep book. I was disappointed that it turned out to be a book about Una's progression of husbands. She falls in love with a man who drowns, thus she marries his best friend. Her husband goes crazy and disappears. She then marries a kindred spirit, Ahab, who leaves her in a beautiful house for years while he searches Moby Dick (who was responsible for him losing his leg). After she learns that Ahab is killed by Moby Dick, she meets and cohabitates with her new neighbor. In retrospect, the story seems to be more about the progression of men in her life than anything else. The deepness that seemed possible at the beginning of the book is never realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated Ahabs' Wife","review":"This book might have benefited from a tough editor. It could have had at least 1/3 fewer pages. The author felt obliged to introduce every late 20th century politically correct idea into 19th century New England."},{"rating":"1","title":"tries to do too much","review":"I read this book for my book club's next discussion. The plot idea and first chapter really drew me into the story. Then the book fell flat. The characters are not truly developed on their own, they float around as reflections of social issues. I lost interest quickly with the author attempts to comment on far too many issues in this book (slavery, liberalism, existentialism, feminism, etc.) If she had stuck with a few issues, we might have actually seen who Una really was. Although the writing itself is good, the novel is a poor attempt at modern literature. Not worth the 600 page read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very long","review":"I started reading this book without any expectations. I found the story to be too long. Some of the story lines were very interesting, while others made the plot drag on to no real point.The main character, at one point, disguises herself as a boy, and ladns a cabin boy position on a whaling ship. I know that women have done this in the past, and some were even pirates while disguised, but I just had a difficult time believing this tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much.","review":"Not so much! Even the title was overdone. One or the other would have been fine.Way too much writing for what the book seemed to be trying to say. Too much descriptive effort and way too much jumping around.Sounded as if the book was trying too hard to resemble some older style of writing and just didn't make the grade.Much dedication, though, must have been put into this book from the length of it, but it was such an effort to finish reading.Sorry. Perhaps it is one of those novels that a reader has to be in a certain mood to read. There are many good books around that are that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"Very little research was done on this novel. The protagonist, Una, acts like a time-traveler from the present, and is completely out of place in this book. She also manages to meet nearly every real-life, famous literary figure from the late 1800s in the course of her travels. Pure fantasty, not anything like a historical novel. The writting style was also difficult to get into, and POV shifts were irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"based on a true story","review":"I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, \\"The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex\\" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events. I suggest that readers of \\"Ahab's Wife\\" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read. Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves. I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts. In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"After reading the ecstatic reviews of this book, I dutifully slogged through the first hundred pages of disjointed and melodramatic events, hoping in vain that some thread of plot or some interesting characters would turn up, but finally took out the toothpicks that were holding my eyes open and went to bed. Instead of reading the remaining 568 pages, I plan to make better use of my time by rereading Moby-Dick."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too, wanted to like this book","review":"I was never a fan of Moby Dick but, having been an English major, I am very familiar with it. When I began reading the book, I was pretty excited to have found an interesting take on the original story. B ut then, the plot deviated, and deviated, and deviated. There are just too many plot twists and she \\"accidentally\\" meets just too many famous 19th century \\"luminaries.\\" I must say the most contrived one situation was when she \\"happened\\" to me Hawthorne in the woods surrounding Walden Pond--and he was wearinga black veil no less! Naslund has him leaving a meeting of noted Transcendentalist thinkers...too bad Hawthorne was Anti-transcendentalist! I finished the bookhoping that Naslund might salvage it but, once again she went too far. Una and Ishmael, the man named afterthe Biblical liar? I am beginning to think Naslund needs to change her nom de plume to Ishmael. It'd make her book easier to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long/Boring","review":"Cut out the wasted prose and endless descriptions and the book would be reduced by half - and the better for it. I had to force myself to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Waste of Reading Time","review":"The title for my review says it all. I forced myself to finish this, reading long after it became a chore, just because I hoped it would get better. No such luck. The writing was just fair, becoming very disappointing after a good start, with recurrent episodes of shallow philosophical wandering contributing nothing. Plot unbelievable and immature in it's grandiosity. No message for anyone living in reality. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow Reading","review":"I found this book very slow reading. I could only read half of it. Perhaps if a movie is made then maybe I would see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"The wonder of living on a light house island, that young women have inquisitive minds, that well read men were sailors, too and that women are ultimately more adaptable than men are just some of the themes touched on in this wonderful novel. I, like many others, was sorry to finish the book and to quiet my friendship with Una. It was a wonderful life journey we shared and Una was such a real character, I can hardly imagine that she didn't exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahab's wife","review":"I couldn't even get into it. It is not my type of book. I was asked to read it for a book club but we decided to forego that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!!!!","review":"If you are an insomniac this book is wonderful for you - if nothing else it will put you asleep in record time. A constant \\"bla, bla, bla\\", pages upon pages of lengthy conversations or monologues exploring each others or oneselves deepest \\"feelings\\". One can skip entire chapters and still the story is no further along than just another pages long of Unas musings. It feels as if the author has to communicate to the readers that she is well educated, hence all the literary references and mentioning of famous names.If you like an interesting story you can safely skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guessed the ending...who her last husband would be...and was thrilled, nevertheless...","review":"I guessed who her last husband would be, but it wasn't anti-climactic. It was still a thrill - I'm such a Melville fan. Phenomenal, feminist tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be more than fan fiction","review":"This book was way too long for it's own good.

I felt that the story was rather juvenile,and written in a stilted, hard to get into, style. Couldn't make it past page 200..... Disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slow Journey Superbly Told","review":"Una Spenser narrates her life from a childhood in Kentucky to an upbringing in Nantucket to life aboard a whaling ship and all of her marriages in-between. But \\"Ahab's Wife\\" is less of tale of events and more a tale of a young woman's spiritual journey. So readers should not expect a twist-turning plot or cliff-hanging suspense. Rather the reader should expect a creative tale richly told.I would have given \\"Ahab's Wife\\" 5-stars but I thought author Sena Jeter Naslund's prose was a little heavy-handed. I just feel that written prose should be like perfume where a little is intriguing but a lot becomes overpowering. I thought Ms Naslund's prose-rich writing made for a rather slow read. Enjoyable but slow. If you have the time \\"Ahab's Wife\\" would make a rewarding effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intriguing book","review":"I enjoyed 'Ahab's wife' and read it without pause. It was interesting and stimulating, well written. The main character is a very unusual woman, so unusual in her freedom of thought and behavior and so surrounded by other unusual people to appear, by the end, slightly implausible. That and the repeating pattern of coming across characters that feel compelled to confess their secrets to her are my minor criticisms to this book. 'Ahab's wife' is also interesting as an overview of an era of change in American culture, particularly in relation to religious thoughts and human rights issues (slavery and women's rights). What I found most intriguing and interesting was, in the end, the ability to engage my mind in new, different thoughts about life in general and women's lives in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahab's Wife","review":"BOOK WAS IN GREAT CONDITION.

What is with all these books trying to spin off other things that were better. Dune: House of Atreides? Doctor Who: Interference? Casablanca: As Time Goes By? Young Indiana Jones: Treasure of the Peacock's Eye? What's wrong with keeping the integrity of the originals by not taking revisionist approaches to that which inspired you.

Where will this madness end?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's because I'm an Eskimo...","review":"It's only protein! Get over yourselves! That was the most interesting section of the book, when Una goes on board a whaling ship, and they are sunk by a BLACK whale (Una works in the Crow's Nest and actually sees Moby Dick before she even meets Ahab). Silliness.I will say it has one of the best first lines ever: Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last. Good line. Too bad the rest wasn't as engaging! Too many characters with too little characterization. And what's with that eagle at the lighthouse? I didn't believe that scene at all, and I should have stopped right there. It's a feminist treatise with some nice writing in between. The end made me want to gag.All in all it made me want to read \\"Moby Dick\\". Nice illustrations. Give it fifty pages and see what you think. Some people in our book club loved it! Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Horror! The Horror!","review":"The grostesque offspring of looney feminism and a trashy romance novel. The novel begins with the heroine, Una, lying in bliss with Ahab in the grass. Sorry- has anyone who has read Moby Dick really imagined him as the sort of chap to do such a thing? The author is entitled to taking her own spin on things, however...why must the novel be so politicized? Naslund grafts attacks on every modern social bugbear into the novel. Racism? Una fights racism and has a tryst with great black leader, Frederick Douglas. Sexism? She passes herself off as a male sailor and does just as good as the guy, thank you very much. Traditional gender roles? Heck no- Una runs away and takes up all sorts of masculine activities!Please- tell me a story, don't beat me over the head with nearly 700 pages of overheated, preachy prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.

I can't put it down, but am FORCING myself to, just to make it last longer! I'm enjoying the sheer beauty of her writing so much I don't want it to end. Una is one of the most remarkable heroines I've ever encountered, and this has been/still is one of the most satisfying books I've read in a long time.Follow-up after finishing the book: Well, I've changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars. The last 1/4 of the book just didn't cut it for me. It didn't have the drive and forward momentum I felt in the beginning and middle sections. It felt like random vignettes.

Poor character and plot development, silly dialog (especially the 5% that come from the mouths of females), mistakes, errors, and oversights.This one needs to be recalled by the publisher. At a minimum it requires more thought and better editing - from a grammatical and cultural standpoint. (Hey Mr/Ms Editor!! Learn the proper use of commas, semicolons, and, above all, apostrophes - they are NOT there for decoration!)But, we dumb bunnies continue to buy Griffin's books, so why should he care what he's writing? Until the demand dries up, he'll continue to laugh all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great from Griffin,but.....","review":"A typically absorbing read from the Master with brilliant,deadly accurate battle descriptions,but,like Roy Jaruk (an earlier reviewer), I still get confused about where in Killer McCoy's life we really are.I've felt familiar with the Pickering family for years,but so many unfilled detail about their lives between the end of WW11 and the start of the Korean conflict. And what happened to Clyde Dawkins and all the guys we left in the Pacific? Please WEB,write us some fill-in novels to bring us up to speed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice read","review":"Griffin rarely disappoints, and this most recent offering is the reason why.Once again, the author tells a well-told story about the officer corps of the U.S. armed forces in wartime. He illustrates the unfortunate fact that politicians aren't the only people that practice the arcane, dark art of politics, but that our military leaders did it (and still do it) every bit as much.Reading about Ken McCoy and the others is a comfort, to be sure. It is sort of like a visit from old friends, but I would like to see some of the supporting characters fleshed out a bit more.Having made the criticism above, I will end by saying that despite a few very minor things, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WEB Griffin Strikes again!!!","review":"The Corps Series has always been one of my favorites. Griffin's ability to develop characters and write about action are fantastic. I am digging through all his pseudonyms to find his other books. Did you know he started writing stories in the 50's about the MASH crew at various locations around the world? He has provided me with hours and hours of pleasurable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Surrendered!","review":"Having struggled through about half of Retreat, Hell, I surrendered to the boring plot, weak character development and lack of action and gave up reading it. The jacket cover made me feel that I was going to be in for a real treat. However, I was misled and can sum my feelings up about this book in one acronym...NATO... no action, talk only. Rather than providing a good mix of action and military history, Retreat, Hell is so filled with minutiae that it overwhelms any of the very few and far between parts that are (at best) moderately exciting. Do yourself a favor and sjip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALISTIC, RAW, AND RIVETING","review":"Award winning actor James Naughton has garnered Tonys and won accolades for his screen and TV appearances. He masterfully takes center stage for this no holds barred reading on the Abridged and CD editions of the latest from the literary master of the military W. E. B. Griffin.With the fifth in his series covering the history of the U.S. Marines we are taken to the year 1950 in Korea. General Douglas MacArthur is bent on crossing the 38th parallel and the Yalu River convinced it is safe, that Chinese are not lurking there. However, Major Ken McCoy has an entirely different idea. This is not the only disagreement: as many will remember General MacArthur and President Truman were fighting a different battle of their own. General Fleming Pickering finds himself in the middle of this dispute as tries to bring peace between the two stubborn men.Realistic, raw, and riveting. Don't miss \\"Retreat, Hell!\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same","review":"I became a fan of W. E. B. Griffin in 1994 when I read the first book in the Corps series. I was hooked and subsequently read all of his offerings that were in print, and eagerly awaited his new releases that generally came out once a year. I have noticed a substantial change in Mr. Griffin's books in recent years. They still have the detailed description of characters, equipment and military policy of his past works, but there is little plot and the recent releases certainly are not \\"page turners\\". If you expect this edition to rival his earlier efforts you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Setting up the next series....Griffin is getting bored with the Marines.","review":"It's obvious from this and the last book that Griffin is getting bored with the Marines. I'll be surprised if there is another book in this series. Looks like a new series \\"The CIA\\" or \\"The Spies\\" will be launched soon.Retreat Hell was a disappointment when placed alongside the rest of the Corps series. Little plot, mostly filler. Easily the weakest of the Corps series.If W.E.B wants to really make us loyal The Corps readers happy go back and write the book that belongs in-between In Danger's Path and Under Fire"},{"rating":"1","title":"W.E.B. Griffin is slipping","review":"I read the first 7 or 8 of Griffin's books on the Corps, but this one leaves me flat. Griffin's goes into great detail on his characters but there is no real plot. In many parts of the book there is page after page of meaningless descriptions and dialogue. I get the feeling that Mr. Griffin is only filling pages. After skipping some of his later books, I wanted to try him again. \\"Retreat Hell!\\" just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story?","review":"I have read all of his books and couldn't wait for this one. What a dissapointment. I have about 50 pages left and haven't seen any fighting action at all or even a plot or story. Most of it is people making introductions. You'll read about thier uniforms, boats and planes - descriptions only. In the beginning they capture a prisoner, but they don't play any role in the book. May give up on Griffin after this. It's time for Pick, Killer and the gang to retire and sell timeshares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back to WWII!","review":"I have read everything in the Corps series and loved the first few. Griffin came up with a unique style that educates the reader on the details of military life through the stories of a number of interesting and heroic characters with comic relief provided by an occasional cowardly and/or incompetant martinet. Griffin should go back to WWII where there is much left to be told. The Korea books are not up to standard and make the personalities of the heroes redundant, boring, ridiculous, and parodies of themselves. Has anybody ever considered the similarities of Griffin's books to Star Trek? The main characters never die, just the ones new to the current episode! Or are they like Buck Rogers in which the hero goes off on harrowing missions every week and ends up back at headquarters lauded as the conquering hero once again? The funniest thing of all is that Griffin still has me hooked and I will buy the next installment (in paperback, of course)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHat Picture?","review":"Why would any supposed writer/historian have, as his cover jacket picture, a Marine PFC, from 1st MarDiv, sprinting across \\"Death Valley\\" in Okinawa, in the Spring of 1945?Wrong war........wrong location."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Master is Back!","review":"While I was sadly disappointed with his \\"Under Fire\\", especially because of the miserable, maybe not even existent, editing...well, that is past. Old friend WEB is back in harness and in fine fettle, indeed.There are a couple of warts, but aren't they in any book? Jeanette Priestley of the Chicago Trib, is a brunette in \\"Under Fire\\", and a sexy blonde in the new book. So what! Even my wife is sometimes known to use the industrial version.This book is truly a return to the old masterhood in military story telling. Buy the book, it is worth to be in your personal library.PS: Is that a Cuban cigar he is smoking in the picture of the book jacket? UUUUUUUH! Dat's a nono!Tsk, tsk, tsk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible war story!","review":"I have read hundreds of books on warfare, both fiction and nonfiction, and this one is definately the worst. Hundreds of pages long, many unnecessary digressions and almost no action. Also, some parts are in questionable taste, particularly where a \\"hero\\" while actually viewing the casket of his fiancee who had been killed in Korea, falls in love (lust?) with a woman who had, the day before, attended the funeral of her Marine flyer husband. This subject actually closed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"hell in a handbasket","review":"W.E.B. Griffin's novelistic account of the Korean Conflict in 1950 teaches even as it entertains. Douglas Macarthur - who is still revered as the hero his president wouldn't listen to by many South Koreans - is primed for glory, but has to deny the massive Chinese presence that awaits his troops if he's going to get there.Enter Ken McCoy, your basic straight-talking grunt who sees clearly, shoots when he has to, and wins the day. Sort of.Not a brilliant literary piece, if that's what you need. But a colorful introduction to the no-win drama of the Korean Conflict and some of its key players, not to mention an interesting insight into the psychology of the Corps when its civilian and military masters wander off the beaten track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"This is the \\"real deal\\"--a truly brilliant book which will be read 100 years from now. The book stands the test of time. It clearly, and with great passion, articulates--not only the history of women's poetry in America--a vision as to why women write. If you are a woman writer you must have this book. Buy two copies...one for yourself and one to give away. In fact, if you only buy one book a year, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Seasoning!","review":"I have purchased this item a few times and love it!

She tackles the most confudling dilemmas at work and provides an ethical compass to resolve them. You can always quit,but why not resolve the dilemmas and keep your job,too? I didn't always agree with her, but DeMars got me talking to my coworkers and my boss about what was the best solution-which was exactly DeMars' purpose for writing the book in the first place, I suspect. Yes, sometimes good employees do bad things--so here's what you do when it happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago's early Italians","review":"\\"ITALIANS IN CHICAGO\\" is part of the book series IMAGES OF AMERICA. The book is a compilation of old photographs that capture the Italian migration of the early 1900's and the life styles of the newly settled immigrants in Chicago. The importance of family, neighborhood and church in establishing a new found Italian-American community is captured pictorially throughout the book. Photographs from the various conclaves of Italians on the north, west and south sides are presented. Although the conclaves are dispersed throughout the city a common cultural uniformity can be seen to develop. The book is a valuable supplement to any serious research on the history of Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info...but","review":"The pictures are great and it contains little bubbles of information which is informative. Eye catching. However, I have to give it one star as the environmental tone it contains really is a turn off. It would be a great book without its jabs. While some of the information has truth to it, it seems they're using blanket statements leading readers to assume \\"all\\". I don't care for books that lead young children to think one way by using lack of information. Not only so, it doesn't need to be in this book, but perhaps in a political science type book where students can actually analyze and discuss these issues.This book was bought with a Christian curriculum, so I was taken back by its environmental tone. If that doesn't bother you, or if it's read along with a parent who can discuss some of these issues, it's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK FOR ANYONE THAT DOES ANYTHING WITH SOCCER","review":"I LOVE this book....

There is a 2-3 minute weird Jenny dream sequence which can be easily fast-forwarded through.

I'm pretty sure the show would be better as a result.Worth a watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very original and well done","review":"I love this series and I think it's portrayal of love and life in this group of friends is more in depth than any show to date.

But Gloria Steinem describing the puritans as coming to this country to \\"escape religious extremism\\" was absurd. They didn't come here to \\"escape\\" religious extremists, they came here because they *were* religious extremists. They wanted a place where they could be extreme & practice their extreme puritanical vision, they weren't some enlightened crowd who were being persecuted by, say, puritans. I'm shocked that the writers of this show actually wrote that little nugget of BS and even more shocked that Gloria Steinem agreed to say it."},{"rating":"2","title":"L word","review":"Enjoyed watchin on tv good story lines keep u griped to what's happening next and has girl humour as well, enjoyed every season"},{"rating":"1","title":"First season was brilliant but second season is a huge disappointment","review":"I was thrilled by the first season's creative and compelling representation of characters. The opening titles, music, dramatizations, editing, as well as, subtle humor of the first season, was an artful and poignant display of life to which many people, regardless of sexual orientation, could relate.I was immediately disappointed by the second season, however, as it quickly dissolved a great work of art and turned it into cheap pulp.I hope that the third and fourth season doesn't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Some told me about this show.

The other tracks are outstanding, until the final track, Starless, which is a major masterpiece. It has some of the best lyrics in a Crimson song, and some of the most intense playing that Crimson (or any other band) ever produced.

The people and acts described are too outlandish, too impressive to be true. But I trust Jay to strike awe into me, and he does so repeatedly and without fail in this book.The book's illustrations and photographs are marvelous supplements to Jay's smoothly written histories of performers--memory artists, dwarf magicians without arms or legs, women who walk into ovens.

And I especially liked the dealing with the prophecy of the coming Anointed One and the seventy \\"sevens\\"; the commentary did not go into elaborate detail, which can be very interesting but which might be out of place in a commentary such as this which is concise; the high level presentation of three different possibilities and their calculations of the seventy \\"sevens\\" was well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very user friendly","review":"This commentary is conversational and in every-day language.

He was 65 by the time he actually conquered Peru.

Awkward dialog, jerky action, 2-dimensional characters, convenient coincidences strung together. Looks more the the very rough outline of the concept of a book project that was never finalized. Many ridiculous situations, including: the East Germans keep hands off the family farm; a character goes to a meeting with Saddam Hussein and the official car he's in--and his escort officers--are successfully waylayed by a bunch of street punks. Totalitarian regimes don't work like that. And there's lots of cliche-ridded stuff about loyal retainers who would willingly die for whoever it is they're willing to die for.

The consensus opinions are right about this - poorly plotted, rushed ending, boring villians, and cardboard heroes.The initial premise is fairly captivating; Hitler's diary saved from the bunker in Berlin, and the potentially world-shaking secrets held within. The problem is that the promise of the concept never delivers. Ultimately, I felt the great secret in the diary was not so astonishing, and would have little relevance anymore 60 plus years after the war.The 'cameo' of Saddam Hussein was forced at best, and didn't add anything to the story. I found the dialogue to be wooden and terribly cliched. The best parts of this book were the early scenes set in WWII. Once the story advanced to the present day, all the interest was lost as it became a fairly typical by-the-numbers thriller.

Everyone walks through the paces without much reflection or embellishment. I agree with another poster that \\"SOLO\\" and \\"EAGLE\\" are top-form Higgins and should be where new readers start.The audio version with Patrick Macnee takes it down a notch. I loved P.M. in The Avengers, and he has a great voice, but as a book reader he goes WAY over the top emotionally.

He sets up poitential conflicts (the leading bad guy is given Hitler's diary to safekeep) only to never make it a significant part of the plot--seems that all the Baron got was billions to spend on his own companies!

The plot is sketchy, spanning over 55 years and quite farfetched. The text feels like one of the condensed books by Readers Digest, everything is hurrying by and the situations happen so fast that there is no suspence at all. Everything is over within a page or two.The very worst book I have read is \\"Red Rabbit\\" by Tom Clancy. His problem is to little happening and to many words (=800 plus pages).

What a waste of my time! I almost couldn't and didn't want to finish it. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of all the characters that appeared in other Higgins' books, I thought, except for Baron Von Berger, NONE of the characters have developed enough depth for me to know and to even care about them. As far as I know they're nothing but a group of thugs and murderers that are feuding over personal vindication in the name of contrived heroic excuses. Halfway through the book, as soon as Baron Von Berger faded into oblivion, I started losing interest in this book. The motivation for Von Berger to declare war against Dillon & Ferguson over Kate Rashid was, at best, weak and contrived. I couldn't find character to relate to or to root for. The plot's thin and the emotion's void. It's extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Higgins usually a sure bet....but not this one.","review":"I usually love Higgins novels, be they WWII or other, but this one was horendous.

The plot -- if you really want to call it a plot -- doesn't start until mid-read, and it is a very hazy plot at that.

I really think Mr. Higgins just wants to present his loyal readers with an action-packed, page-turning read every so many months, and he has accomplished that once again with this book. It's quite easy to read, and I polished it off in one sitting over about four hours. The usual group of good guys is present, with Sean Dillon given the opportunity to show what, for lack of a better term, is his \\"soft side\\" when he reacts to the murder of an elderly woman. There's the usual mayhem, with Dillon and Company prevailing in the end.

I've been reading Nietzsche for some ten years now, and had lately begun writing about what makes him so fascinating--when Thiele's book made my own effort unnecessary.

What they have in common, though, is genuine passion, and their timing is perfect. The pianist has a gorgeous and polished sound, with flawless technique, and Binelli shows his incredible mastery of the bandoneon, sometimes to a frightening degree.

Morning and evening portions means that there are two devotions to read each day, and the portions range from half a page to up to two pages. He does see Christ in every verse, and draws out a spiritual teaching from verses where I wouldn't have ever thought to look. He is constantly writing about Christ, love to Christ, the great themes of redemption, and the glory of God. I found the devotional difficult to read out loud with my wife.

Both these men share, in my opinion, an almost Olympian view of the human beings they have created. I sometimes think these men are writers for grown-ups because they do not deal in villains. We see their characters, as they do, as from a great height, so that Trollope's Crosbie, or Tolstoy's Vronsky demand from us almost as much compassion as those whom they injure. I guess I could sum up why I respect Trollope so: he is the master of ordinary life, and --like Tolstoy--he makes it extraordinary.

I find the George Long translation to be the only version with the \\"right feel.\\" This may well be in part because it was the first version to which I was exposed, but its faintly mustily archaic sentence structures, word choices, and overall tone seem best fitted to the work, and, at least for one friendly with Shakespeare and the King James Bible, offer no bar to its absorption and enjoyment.

I was skeptical due to the reviews that these would work due to my child ripping them off, but I read one review that mentioned using zip ties to hold them in place. Accordingly, I purchased them and purchased zip ties. The rails arrived in perfect condition and are made of soft plastic. Not only do they fit snugly on our crib rails, but my daughter hasn't pulled them off (or even come close for that matter) I didn't have to use the zip ties. Again, I am sure that proper fitment depends on your rail dimensions. This was a great solution for $10 and I highly recommend the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit my standard crib","review":"Wish I'd read the Amazon reviews before trekking down to BRU and buying these.

DON'T BUY!!","review":"I agree with everything everyone else wrote about these devices not working. My daughter was 8-months-old when she figured out how to take them off and throw them. What wasn't mentioned was the huge safety hazzard these plastic pieces pose. After months of throwing them off and chewing on the wood anyway, they caused my daughter to have a pretty bad fall. One morning, right in front of me, my daughter crawled up and held onto the plastic railings. The plastic came off the railing as my daughter was holding on to it, and she fell backward to hit her head hard on the rails in the back of the crib. That was the last time it was on her crib. Also, since there are four plastic pieces that aren't joined together, there is risk of finger pinching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on thick rails","review":"We bought this teether assuming it would fit all cribs.

So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months).

Because of this, our daughter has no idea that they don't belong on the crib, so therefore she's never tried to remove them. Plus, she loves chewing on them and it never harms the crib. They stick just fine and if you want to use a mild double sided tape to keep them suction down that can work too. Just depends on the individual. We never plan on taking the rails off so we aren't worried about the tape pulling up the vanish on the crib. I love these things and as soon as I get the next crib I'll be placing these same rails on it too! Use them from the very beginning and the baby doesn't seem to realize the difference!

I qualified for free shipping and my order came much faster than I anticipated, or even as stated when I completed the purchase. Amazon was very helpful when I asked if a different audio Bible came in a case or not. This one came in a nice case. I was already familiar with Alexander Scourby (which is who reads the Old Testament of this order) and was not aware that James Earl Jones reads the New Testament. It is very pleasant, but a bit too soothing for a long road trip.

The author constantly sets technical development in social context, filling the book as much with good tales, as with spanning-keys, scears and springs. US and UK readers alike will enjoy the revolver-controversy of the 1850s between the American Colt and the English Adams. Sadly, this mature and definitive book was written by a still young man who was, soon afterwards, killed by a sniper while serving as an officer in World War II. The companion book 'English Guns and Rifles' is equally good."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! I thought I've seen all the telenovela stories... but not this one.

His men loved him and they poured that into this \\"tribute\\" album. While Walt Johnson lacks the sheer blistering power of Bill Chase, he plays some wonderful lead licks and great solos. Again, if you are listening for Bill, you'll be disappointed, but if you want to hear some fine trumpet playing and solid arrangements, it's a good listen and a worthwile addition to your collection. There are even a few gems on this CD, including \\"Celebrate\\" (which was a staple in the Chase book when Bill was alive) and \\"Watch Closely Now\\". If you like disco, \\"Superman\\" and \\"Rocky\\" are also neat to listen to. There's some incredible playing by all the band members on here.

I bought it thinking we would get some use out of it, even if the reviews I read were true. The truth is that this grater works fantastically, and does not break if used properly. You don't need to exert a lot of force on the grater. As long as you don't overfill it and as long as your hands are relatively dry when you try to use it, you should have no difficulty gripping the handle.I have rather large hands, and can use it very easily. My fiance has very small hands, and uses it very easily, as well. Our other graters now sit unused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works, but breaks easily","review":"This grater was terrific, working excellently with hard cheese, and okay with soft cheese. However, the handle is a little too short, and TWICE, because it is made of plastic, little bits that were essential to it broke off, and it became useless. The first time I returned it to the store and they replaced it. The second time, they wanted me to send it to Zyliss, so I got to the website and it only replaces if you have the original receipt. So of course, I do not, because if I saved all my receipts I wouldn't have room to cook in my kitchen. So, the moral of the story: avoid plastic!! and don't buy this grater!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tough to hold","review":"I should have headed the advice of another reviewer about the size of the grip, especially when turning the handle.

I then revised my operation of the grater and used it to get the small bits remaining after using a box grater. I also added a rubberband to reduce my thumb stress. It disassembles easily and is easy to clean. Overall, I would recommend this grater for small jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"Can't say it much better than other reviewers: This grater breaks very easily, and is hard to use unless you grate things softer than a ripe banana.The little circular guide falls off into the bowl you grate into, and the system that locks the handle when grating breaks so the handle is no locked.do not buy this item"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use and breaks easily","review":"I agree with other buyers of this grater that it is difficult to hold on to so that enough pressure is put on the cheese. It works pretty well if you need only a very small amount, but in less than a minute your hand will be aching while you try to hold on to it. The second time I used the small grater, the handle broke off from it. The handle is attached to the drum with plastic, and breaks when trying to grate a harder cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Crank Handle and Uncomfortable Grip","review":"This seemed like a good idea when purchased, but it didn't take long to get to dislike it.

Avoid this model and get one with a fixed handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and easily breaks","review":"FYI, we generally used ours for hard cheese...1. The grater was slightly uncomfortable for me to hold/use (I have large hands), my wife had a much harder time and commented to me that she didn't like using it due to this.2. The handle is attached with a small piece of plastic to the drum. Within a few weeks, both handles had broken off of the drum. It's now in the trash.I will say it worked well when it worked (for the most part), however, based on the overall design flaws, I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful for hard cheese.","review":"I don't do much grating of soft cheese, this might work for that, but it is awful for hard cheese.1) The large drum and short handle give you very poor mechanical advantage.2) The large surface area of the drum in contact with the cheese creates a large amount of friction.3) The above two problems caused the designers to reduce the number of cutting holes on the drum to reduce the effort necessary to turn the drum. resulting in the grater cutting very slowly.4) The large surface area also means that you have very poor mechanical advantage when squeezing the handle to force the cheese against the drum.5) The large drum requires the addition of the funnel to prevent cheese going all over the counter top when grating.The end result is a grater that takes much longer to use, and leaves you with sore hands when you are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I read some of the other reviews cautioning buyers about the handle--how I wish I had taken them to heart. The handle is just plain mean! The problem is you have to hold this thing in one hand while pressing the cover over the cheese. With the other hand you rotate the little short handle that moves the drum. Trust me, this is akward and challenging even for those who have strong hands. I should have returned it, instead I took it to the thrift store and bought another one of those hand-held grater boards that work quite well. Don't waste your money on this poorly designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, lasted less than year, would not recommend","review":"Bought grater and use it about once every 2 weeks. Lasted less than year. The round piece to collect the cheeze would not stay on after about 2 months. After 10 months, one of the pieces on the fine grater broke, making it useless. Sent Amazon a note about how to get replacement since supposedly a 5 year warranty. Will see what they come back with."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Engineering Disaster","review":"This cheese grater is an unmitigated engineering disaster. The mechanical \\"snaps\\" on the fold in handles are made of plastic. Within days, _both_ grating wheel had their handle \\"snaps\\" break right off. The rubber (in gray in the pic) gripper for the handle also pops off. The design may have been clever if the snap parts were made of metal or something that didn't break the minute the device was used with a piece of cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to hold, easily broken","review":"I am pleased with the large cheese hopper on this unit, but the handle is bulky which makes it difficult to hold proper pressure on the cheese while turning the crank. Both grating drums broke before the unit was a year old. The plastic piece that holds them in place is too fragile. On the other hand, I like the texture of the grated cheese it produces with both grating drums. I just wish it were easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle breaks... during first use","review":"The drum handle is attached to the grater drum (the only metal part) with a thin ring of plastic. This area snapped off during the first use of the grater (that is, the grater drum came lose from the plastic housing*); I don't recommend this product, even if I liked items/appliances that only had one use (I don't).*The cheese was extra sharp cheddar, relatively hard for cheddar, but it wasn't a hard cheese.Get a box grater or a mandoline with grater attachment, imo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"The handle on the small grater broke off while grating cheese. Unfortunately we were past our 30 day warranty.

Very disappointing","review":"I bought this when my old 7\\" Zyliss grater broke (after 12 years). The old grater had been one of my favorite kitchen tools: no frills, and efficient. I couldn't find the same one ... apparently Zyliss was in the middle of converting to the current \\"classic\\" model they list as the 11370. So I bought this thing. It's awful! All marketing, no engineering! You can't grip it and apply force to grate the cheese. (Caveat: pro basketball players will have no problem ... normal humans are out of luck) Plus it's twice the diameter it needs to be and fits in drawers awkwardly.

Boooo. Surely there is a designer out there who can come up with something better than this.As other reviewers have noted, the lever is too short to exert enough turning force and you would need the hands of a stevedore to keep the handles squeezed together.At least it is slightly better than the old Pampered Chef crap that broke a few weeks after we bought it.UPDATE 01/02/08: The unit's drums will no longer stay locked into the handles. I would be willing to pay a higher price if only someone would produce a grater that worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a cheese grater.","review":"I thought I was buying a cheese grater.I really did.You see, when I grate parmesan on my regular upright grater, it makes grated cheese. You know: either a fine powdery substance, or else fine, curly tendrils - depending on which side of the grater I use.My previous rotary grater made the latter kind. It was lovely. It was simple and robust, and it made GRATED cheese.This thing does not. Because this thing is not a grater at all. It is a cheese SHREDDER. It makes cheese exactly like the kind that stores sell as SHREDDED cheese: 3/4 inch long little sticks of cheese.And I don't like shredded cheese. It's too heavy. It's doesn't melt quite so well when you put it on hot pasta.Perhaps you do like your cheese SHREDDED. If so, you MIGHT want to consider this. Especially if you like your cheese SHREDDERS to be enormous, unneccesarily complicated, and overly difficult to clean.But if what you want is a cheese grater, THEN YOU WANT TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Choice for Soft Cheese","review":"I won't keep this cheese grater. I have been looking for a grater for soft cheese. This is uncomfortable to use and makes a mess.

But that isn't often.","review":"When this grater works, it is fantastic. I also love the 2 different size drums.The problem is it doesn't work very often.The handle is supposed to lock but the lock only seems to work for a short time, then it won't stay locked as you are turning it and the handle collapses. Also, the little shield that makes it easy to grate into a smaller area falls off after a few turns.I exchanged this item once and the second one performed the same.If you are buying it for the left-handed feature, it can be converted for us lefties, BUT it turns in the opposite direction than is natural making it not much less awkward than a right-handed one.I don't recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...while it lasts","review":"I purchased this item because I'd used other Zyliss graters in the past and had been happy with the product. This product, at first, performs well. However, the flaw is in that in order to lock the spin handle in place, you have to put pressure on it. Within a very short time, the handle on both drums broke off. VERY disappointed in the quality level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumb leverage required","review":"The primary advantage of this grater over my old rotary is that it is far easier to clean. The diameter of the barrels, the absence of nooks and crannies, and the radiused corners make that easy. The handle can be switched to make use as easy for those who are lefthanded. The handle for the stationary portion has a nonskid pad for the thumb, which is helpful because that is where to press to keep the pressure on the cheese. I find myself choking up on the handle, however, the way one might choke up on a baseball bat. Keeping adequate pressure on the cheese can be a challenge. I have a low tech flat grater, and I no longer resort to that as I did when I wanted to bypass washing the old rotary grater. It's a machine close to perfect. And no grated knuckles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's GRATE!!!","review":"My wife said she wanted a grater like this and a mandolin slicer for gifts, and I chose this one for the grater.It works very well for either one of us (I am left-handed), and we will continue to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fragile than I'd like for a cheese grater.","review":"This grater is very easy to set up and clean, but the design of it makes it inherently fragile and difficult to use. My husband put some hard cheese into it the first time we used it, and immediately snapped the plastic tab-handle off the grating wheel, rendering it useless. Thankfully it comes with two wheels, so we know now to be careful with it.It's also a strain on my arthritic hands to use it for long, which is problematic considering how much cheese a vegetarian household can go through. The way the tab-handle is made, it forces the hands into a very unnatural position to use the grater.Since it can't really handle the hardest cheeses, like Parmigiano-Reggiano, and isn't useful for grating large quantities of cheese, we find we rarely use this grater anymore. I like its concept, and certainly it's one of the better models I've tried, but due to its design flaws I simply can't recommend it very strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine grater.","review":"I read a bunch of reviews that bemoaned the handle as difficult to hold. What a load of hooey. After using it extensively, I've concluded that a person needs 3 things to operate this grater: 1) a functioning opposable thumb, just one. It's got to bend and be capable of a hand-shake's worth of pressure. 2) intact sensation to the hand in question. It wouldn't be a good idea to grate cheese after, say, sleeping on ones arm. Wait until the tingling subsides, then have a go. And 3) Cheese. Seriously. It's easy. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toaster ever","review":"I have had several toasters over the past few years that have all been terrible, however this one was the worst.

This is a DVD for beginners. It has a good section on latin motion and the best section I have ever seen on how to teach the woman to do the perfect dip. Most women are like a board when they try to dip and the man needs to be very strong or he will drop her. This DVD shows the woman that she can learn to dip by herself without any help from the man. This makes it much easier on the man when he does lead the woman into a dip because he doesnot need much strength to hold her and mostly helps her keep her balance. The type of dip they teach also looks much better than what most women are inclined to do. So it is a win-win type situation. The woman looks better and the man doesn't break his back trying to hold the woman up while she is dipping.

Her voice sounds the same as it did when I was first introduced to her on Horses [now of course she has her daughter accompanying her on piano]. What she is now is more political I think then ever before. Her lyrics are as intelligent as ever and her anger on songs such as Radio Baghdad drive her on.One note about the song Radio Baghdad. Someone posted that it was treason. I was called up for the Iraq War and was in Bagdad and Iraq for most of last year- I don't brand her a traitor or treasonous.

This is gritty and real music, full of compelling vocals from Patti and powerful guitar playing by Lenny Kaye. There are sprawling epics such as the churning brew of \\"Ghandi,\\" but as great as those are, I prefer more compact numbers like \\"Stride of the Mind\\" and the opener, \\"Jubilee.\\" It's amazing and impressive that Ms. Smith is still making such important tunes after so long. Way to go Patti!My only quibble is the lack of lyrics with the new CD. I remember my disappointment at the minimal information content on her anthology set a couple of years ago.

They cut like crazy but you have to have the hands of Thor to use them on a regular basis. I even gave them to my burly husband to see if he could work with them a bit to make them easier to use but even he found them quite a challenge to master. If you can send them back to Gingher to have them reworked, then I recommend that - I just saw this as a comment on someone else's review and I'm going to do just that. I must admit that mine has been found lately at the bottom of my sewing box just because of the difficulty I've experienced using them.

From \\"cirkus\\" all the way to the end of the 23-minute epic, this album contains hidden musical journeys in the background of the music, behind the lead singer. Little entertaining bits of piano, drums, mellotron and other instruments playing throughout the entire album in the background, and many people who dismiss this album don't even notice what's going on back there. It ends up making the whole album feel very jazzy and intense.I also don't get all the complaints about the lead singers voice. He's not a gifted singer, but he's nowhere near the worst out there. You might even say his voice can be quite pretty and believable during certain parts.For someone like me who likes music that's WAY out there, this is certainly a very comfortable listen for me. Little bits of creativity are just bursting all OVER the place. Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely remarkable","review":"This album was and is a remarkable achievement, probably far less accesible than most other Crimson works and not one for the new Crimson listener. Most later fans of the band would be hard pressed to believe that Fripp plays only classical guitar on virtually all of side one, some great mellotron work throughout not to mention the wonderful horn and woodwind work on side two. Wonderful early fusion from 1970 especially on side two of the original vinyl 'the lizard suite'. I'm a Crimson fan since the early 70's and have always considered 'larks tongues' their greatest achievement but for some reason still find myself listening to this more than any other of the works.

After about a year has passed his sister Kanako comes into the picture and claims that she is the owner of the Hinata Apartments. She does what ever she can to keep the others out of the annex. I wont exactly tell you the reason because that kinda ruins the ending. Anyways Keitaro comes back after the first episode and brings back gifts.

The book is sparkling and witty, with an intriguing plot, colorful secondary characters, and plenty of humor. The detailed descriptions of fancy clothes and food are a little unusual in this genre, but the author (and Phryne) clearly enjoys them so much, I find myself enjoying them too. There is also a dark edge, as we see tiny glimpses of what \\"the prisoner\\" (the kidnapped girl whom Phryne is trying to rescue) is enduring, and as Phryne reluctantly recalls her postwar days in Paris and the man who broke her heart.As soon as I finish this one, I'm off to find the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reasonably well written Mary Sue piece of fiction.","review":"Is the only way I can describe this.

She does no wrong unless you count grating on the reader's nerves.Of the characters, there was far too little friction/interaction between them. Everyone seemed to accept what Phryne said and did we ever find out what happened to Phyrne's servants who wanted to leave because of Phryne's beliefs?

Within minutes, I knew that The Dead Zone was a far better book.

Johnny Smith, the hero, recieves a gift he doesn't want or enjoy, the gift of second sight. He learns to live with this gift and try to help those around him. However, he is shunned. As you read this book you will feel Johnny's pain and suffer with him as he is slighted by almost everyone who is important to him.

One of the best Stephen King books by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"the dead zone","review":"This book is probably the forth or fifth book that I've read from Stephen King.

It's about a man named Johnny Smith who gets in a car wreck, which leaves him in a coma for five years. In that time, he has lost his job, his girlfriend...but gained the ability of second sight. Whenever he touches someone, he sees there future. The sherrif comes to him for help in catching a serial killer, and one day he shakes hands with a politician at a political rally, and sees the horrible future involving the politician.

There's tight, controlled writing; consistent characterizations; believability; and plenty of literary allusions for those of us who enjoy them. And not too many superfluous characters.Some people might be put off by the political subplot, but it's interesting to me how it presages the political strands in Under the Dome, not to mention the Tea Party movement!This is about the 20th King novel I've read, and I would rank it easily within his top 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little far fetched at times.","review":"I admit I haven't read many of King's books yet but this one got a little unrealistic towards the end.

Okay, I just wanted to get that all off my chest. \\"The Dead Zone\\" is one of King's best early books, and John Smith, the man with the ordinary name and the extraordinary gift (or curse?), is one of his best characters.

It has a true nightmare quality. As a writer it hs stayed with me as far as the ideas go. And when business is bad I always say I'm going through a \\"Dead Zone.\\" And when I say that, I am definitely referring to this book, because I'm a professional psychic whose clients, though they often ask for revelation, don't really want to hear it when it comes!

I have read through it several times, and am surprised each time by some subtle use of prose or dialogue that I never noticed before. Stephen King starts the story off with a shocking event concering the main character, Johnny Smith, which instantly endears you to him and makes you care about what happens to him. As things unfold and Johnny makes decisions that will likely condemn his soul, you're right along with him every step of the way.

I think he is a spectacular author and I have read tons of books by him. However, I absolutely HATED this book. Here's why:1. It was way too long. Even for a Stephen King book. I thought it would never freaking end.2. There was no action. Or suspense. Or anything worth reading at all. There were just a bunch of pointless words.3. There wasn't enough psychic-ness for me which is what I thought the book would be mostly about.4. Just plain boring and a waste of time to read.However, I have to admit that the concept of this book is good I just did not have the attention span to read all the boring parts. (Which occupied pretty much the whole book.)If you want to be bored to death, go right ahead and read it.

I was interested in reading The Dead Zone because I never got to see the TV show or the movie, but was interested in the story. After searching a couple of sites, I stumbled across this one on Amazon for $4.44! Legit! Thinking it was an amazing deal, I purchased it right away. It did take some time to ship to me, but I eventually did get it. Since I have until mid-December to read and write a 2,000 word essay about it, I was in no rush of receiving it. The only thing I wish was different about my purchase was that because it was a hard cover, I do with the original paper sheet covering was shipped with it. But for $4.44, I'm satisfied!

The story could have easily been 50 pages!Then again, the book was written in '79 so i'm sure his style changed considerably.All I know is that I love the series with Anthony Michael Hall as Johnny Smith!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible edition of the book","review":"You do not want to buy this edition of the book.

Check the dimensions for whatever edition you buy, and get something that's normal size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring","review":"I have read many books, and I am amazed at how boring and pointless Dead Zone is. The book could have been 1/10th the size to tell the story (if there really is a story). Most of the book is written about irrelevant events. For example, King drones on about Johnny teaching some guy to read; it drags and drags and at the end of the day, it is utterly pointless and seriously uninteresting. Most of the book is like this. It is one of the only books I began to skim through because it was so pointless and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"King has written so many great books This is not one of them","review":"All King's books I've read have much the same structure: a long boring intro (which goes through 2/3 of the pages...) and an exciting climax, which is in most of the cases worth the reading. Dead Zone's climax follows the same pace of the intro... SLOW pace... Too slow. Besides, you have the impression of having already read something similar elsewhere. The storyline is poor, empty.

Wanda Summers demonstrates the great American spirit of courage and determination to survive, a will to rise up out of the ashes of despair and the pits of hell toprevail and hold on to what little of her life she was able tosalvage. A wonderfully written book about SURVIVIVING that everyone will want to read, whether we have ever been a victim ofcrime or not. It's refreshing to see a new approach to a true crime story, where the good guys win in the end. These two guysshould become the top writers in this genre. I know I am goingto tell all my friends about Wanda Summers and A Reason To Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, touching, a true page turner!","review":"This book is a very moving account of one woman's struggle to survive a horific crime and overcome the injuries to herself as well as the death of her friend. It is a story of her struggle to overcome obstacles so terrifying and so painful and yet triumph in the end.Dale and Billy did an excellent job on this book. Their writing style keeps you interested as well as absorbs you in the story. Also, check out their other book, \\"An Hour to Kill\\"....another definite read for all true crime readers.Thanks for such a moving story.God be with you, Wanda!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimony Of Strength","review":"This book was definitely a testimony of the strength and determination that Wanda Summers experienced throughout the entire tragedy. From beginning to end this book told the story of how one woman can persevere through incredible odds. Dale Hudson and Billy Hills have done a masterful job...a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reason to Live","review":"The title of this true crime book is profoundly appropriate. More than the story of a woman who survived sexual assault and attempted murder, Hills and Hudson have written an intimate portrayal of several South Carolina families, whose lives were shattered and destroyed by two men on a senseless killing spree in February of 1979...all because some guys wanted to make easy money by robbing an elderly man. The determination and courage of Wanda Summers is, for me, the profile of a heroine. This is an emotional book; it made me cry. With skill and sensitivity, the authors deal with the gruesome facts of the attacks. The details of the court case move along swiftly and then the reader must learn how the legal system can be agonizingly complicated after a guilty verdict and a death sentence. There are some bizarre connections to other crimes in A Reason to Live. True crime readers will not be disappointed with Hills and Hudson's second book! Sobering...poignant...inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hobbyists dream!!","review":"This is an excellent product which has already made my life easier (putting up siding); it makes project assembly far faster, more accurate and most importantly more fun. The technology is significant and futuristic in that such a small fuel container can fire so many nails with such force. One should be aware that the device is loud and emits exhaust from the spent fuel with every shot - which is to be expected and has to be taken into consideration with indoor use (need good ventilation).

My wife and I used it for 12 days recently visiting Maui and found it incredibly helpful. The dining reviews are right on the mark (though one great place, Lahiana Fish Co.-is not in this edition), and the tips to get around the island are very helpful. We found the great banana bread and some little special places that were recommended. I can't imagine visiting the island without this book, and apparently others could not as well. We saw many copies in other people's hands. This is the only guide book you need when visiting Maui!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome shipper & product!!!","review":"This book is so worth buying!!!

It was terribly confusing to follow and so syrupy and wordy and authoritative. It oversells itself and really gives tourists the wrong impression.

Hawaii's newspapers and community meetings are filled with dilemmas on how to avoid numerous injured travelers as well as continuous trespassing on private land and destruction of natural and cultural resources. In virtually every case the misled tourists were carrying this now-infamous \\"blue book.\\"The restaurant reviews are also surprisingly unbalanced, though that is a more subjective and less dangerous matter.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden Gems","review":"If you're wanting to find all the touristy spots this is the book to choose.

Now, because so many people have the \\"Blue Book\\", as Hawai'i Revealed is called, we locals can no longer enjoy the places we used to treasure, because of the hordes of tourists now invading them.Please, think twice about buying this book. If you buy it, and do what the authors tell you to do, you'll be helping to turn our islands into the exact thing you're trying to get away from. Keep Hawai'i as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disoriented","review":"I agree with the reader from New York. This book contains more negative information than positive.

For the tour bus crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorkeling","review":"I read every guidebook I can get my hands on before I go on vacation. Of the pile I took along, this was the worst for snorkeling. My main problem with this book is its tone. It was trying to be too authoritative on every topic. Snorkeling experts they are not. There is a much better book out for snorkeling called SNORKELING MAUI by Malewowski. The maps are much clearer, there are far more places to snorkel and it is much better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content Please","review":"My biggest complaint is the way the book is organized and its terrible directions.

It missed so many of the good places we later found out about.

We've been to Maui several times, but found a lot of new things to explore w/ this book. One recommendation we were really happy to read was Warren & Annabelle's Magic Show.

Vaughan also offers up her own understated rendition of \\"Alfie\\" (which contrasts considerably to the aggressively-belted version by Cilla Black).This limited edition reissue reproduces the album complete with the Mercury logo and the original liner notes. It's being discontinued in early 2005, but I hear that copies will get harder and harder to get hold of as early as next year.

Normally a western with Bronson and directed by Sturges would have been something to wet one's appetite. It is not so here. The movie is dry and the pace is so slow. The production value is cheap. Despite the presence of an internationally popular star at that time, Bronson just could not carry this one. It amazes me that the director associated with films like The Magnificent Seven and The Gunfight at the OK Corral could come up with something bad as this one. But the trend was already there when he directed Joe Kidd with Clint Eastwood. That was bad. This was worse. The DVD picture is bad and hazy. It seems that this was taken from an old and badly copied VHS and transferred to DVD. Shades of the old MC Clintok DVD from Goodtime Video. Don't waste your money on this one.

There really is no continuity in his writing; throughout the book he jumps back and forth in timeline. It does get very confusing and frustrating to follow. I personally didn't learn anything new; than what I already knew about the subject. So I was really not pleased with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK","review":"It was alright, however most of the crafts in this book I could think of on my own.

Unfortunately, what this CD consists of is terrible compositions (except for maybe 1 or 2 tunes... the opening track is absolute garbage) that sound like they were recorded in mud (or someone's garage). This ranks right up there with Genesis's ABACAB as one of the biggest musical dissapointments of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Such a great book! I got this because I liked the description and when I needed a break from the deep, loaded books, I picked this one up and was pleasantly surprised. I expected the typical girl falls in love with guy story, but it was well beyond that. Enough twists and unexpected surprises that kept me shocked many times throughout the book. I really thought I'd always know where the book was going, but many times I sat here thinking, \\"Man, I didn't see that coming!\\" I also enjoyed the writing stye and laughed many times through.My only complaint is that the editor wasn't very good. There are so many grammatical and spelling errors, even words missing (small things that probably no one else would pick up normally). And the author has a tendency to use the exact same phrases over and over again when describing things, so I'd be thinking, \\"Didn't she just say that exact same thing?\\" and indeed, she would have.This was my first Elizabeth Young book, but I plan to read others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best laid plans","review":"Sophie just got dumped by her boyfriend Dominic.

I definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, light reading!","review":"I find if you can identify with the characters in a story, you love it even more than the ones that take you outside yourself. I thought this book was lots of fun. Sophy's sense of humor was good and she had a pretty typical view of herself for a lot of us women out there...pretty low on our own appearances. As the book progresses, she learns that she was putting her own character strengths aside and focusing too much on her appearance, which apparently was passable in the first place! Sophy makes you feel like a girlfriend you can hang out with and for being of that \\"romantic comedy\\" genre, there are some surprises in the plot, for sure.

Unoriginal plot, witless dialogue, boring characters, predictable outcome -- I can name several more flaws that made this book such a bore. There are some cute moments in the story, but not enough to make it interesting. The heroine often wondered if hiring an escort to pass as an ex-boyfriend of hers at her sister's wedding made her desperate. I think we all know the answer to that!

I thought she was nasty, didn't have a sense of humor and another thing, why would Josh like her? She completely spent most of the first part of the book whinning about not having someone to take to the wedding, then the second half of the book whinning about taking Josh. Somehow I feel sorry for Josh's kids if he were to marry the whinning heroine of this book. I skipped through most of the second half and read the end. Don't waste the time or money on this book. Also have read this author's first book, and felt the same. Gave this a second chance because the story sounded fun...it wasn't...what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and Silly","review":"I'm surprised that this book has gotten so many stars so far. I thought it was terrible. The main character of the book, Sophy, was so irritating. She's a bitter and angry person which I found absolutely annoying. I'm surprised Josh found her remotely interesting. The story in the end was a bit over the top, too unrealistic and stupid. Another thing that bothered me were the acronyms that the author used. They were too unclear and not easy to understand. It was a waste of time reading this book. I'm surprised I even made it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely snarky morsel","review":"I highly enjoyed the snarky narration and the British slang. The only trouble I had was with an occasional abbreviations or cultural references.

The main character is teeming with paranoia but, luckily for her, all of her lies don't completely ruin her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a tangled web we weave.......","review":"well, i was pretty disappointed for the first 300 pages or so. then, i couldn't put the book down. it was very slow at first with a very wordy dialogue. however, when i got through about 3/4's of the book, it picked up like a whirlwind and proved to be a lot of fun and worth trudging through til the end.sophy started with a simple \\"fib\\" to keep her mum happy.....and then it spiraled out of control. she couldn't stop the charade and it finally stopped her. it was a bit much with all of the sidestepping she and josh did throughout(for a LONG time). i was happy with the last 1/4 of the plot. the ending made it fun.her sister, belinda, had a great twist. and......blood is thicker than water.don't let the slow, wordy beginning stop you from finishing this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Bridget Jones than Debra Messing","review":"The book was okay, but I really loved the movie. There are major differences in the book that completely change the tone. First of all, she's British and more closely resembles Bridget Jones than her movie counterpart. You see a lot more of her friends in the novel.Also, she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight. She is not described to look anything like Debra Messing, but rather an overweight \\"squishy\\" girl, which is completely fine, but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes.The writer is British, I believe, so it has more of the British slang, which at first is a little confusing. It's not Thackeray, mind you, but don't expect any American tones.Their relationship is more drawn out, which is fun to read.Still, what I remember most was how we envision all the characters (Domonic included) as a little chunky. They aren't size 0 models, we get it! Now get over it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I had to write in response to the reveiwer of 2002 who found the book tiresome. Not true!

If you like authors such as Jane Green, I think you would like this too.

I loved the main plot idea, i.e., Sophy needs a date for her sister's wedding, so she hires an escort. Hasn't every single woman at some time wished that she could show up at a big event with a gorgeous, adoring man on her arms? Sophy's people are suitably impressed, to the point where she needs to bring the hunk back again and again: one white lie breeds another. However, the novel is predictable. I suppose that novels of this genre will never end with unrequited love. That fantasy is probably part of the reason we like them so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Fabulous and Sweet Tale!","review":"In Asking for Trouble, we are introduced to the main character, Sophy. Sophy is a 30-something Londoner who has created an entirely fictional boyfriend named \\"Dominic\\" to keep her nagging mother happy. The trouble arises when Sophy's younger sister gets married and Sophy must bring the fictitious \\"Dominic\\" as her date. The very desperate Sophy hires an escort to pretend to be Dominic for the wedding and that's just where the trouble begins!This book was too funny. Sophy gets herself in a really big mess with the fictional boyfriend. I laughed out loud at some of the situations that arise and could see myself doing something so hair-brained. The book was extremely entertaining and I would recommend it to any lover of \\"Chick Lit.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read!!!","review":"What an absolutely fantastic fun read. This story reminds me of a cross between Bridget Jones and the Shopaholic series in its humor. I laughed out loud at the way things progressed through the story. It also shows how sometimes one little white lie can turn into a huge white elephant. What happens when you tell your mother you have a fabulous boyfriend that doesn't exist and you have to produce him? Well Sophy (with a Y not an IE) hires one but, ack she is actually really attracted to him and this has her confused. There are a couple of other story lines running through also.

(He seemed quite nice and charming.) I found Sophy so unpleasant that I could barely finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I purchased this book after seeing that it received some great reviews from other Amazon customers. Basically, I did not enjoy the book very much. I found the main character, Sophy, to be annoying. She appeared to be sloppy, bitchy and the constant mention of her \\"wobbly bits\\" made me sick to my stomach. The escort/love interest charcter Josh/Dominic was very underdeveloped, as was the \\"best friend\\" character of Alix.The book was very slow until the last few chapters when it finally got interesting. I spent a lazy weekend in my apt reading this book. It was a quick read, but I got the feeling that at any point I could just toss it aside and not give a crap about what happened to any of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny book to ease the mind","review":"I think that the book is for pure comedy entertainment. For those who have had a bad day, or a stressful week, I recommend this book to help you relieve some of that tension, and bringing you laughs.

However, as you read further you will find her as a warm woman starving for love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift, so I Haven't Used it!","review":"I was excited to find this book still available.

I kept waiting for the meat of the story to kick in but was disappointed. The story was too chopped up for my taste with little opportunity for the characters to truly develop and draw you into their stories.

I don't know how I would have reacted seeing this one in the bin. Is she offering an alternative- It's a typical Blue Note-like blowing session with Byrd,Jenkins and Curtis Fuller soloing on all tracks. The rhythm section was led by Tommy Flanagan.-- Two tracks Orpheus and Honeylike as well as a different version of Star Eyes and a couple of other tunes with Frank Foster on Tenor Sax from the BYRD'S WORD session appear on the Donald Byrd CD - TIMELESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"One volume many voices","review":"It is helpful to have perspective away from the northern hemisphere.

This is the book they request we bring on our annual visits, so we know they are using it. It's the first of it's kind - the ABC is not a critical, academic, verse-by-verse commentary.

I think that The author could have done a little better when she was describing everything and could have made some of the characters a little more lively. I really liked how the author made Maxey sound really rude at first, but then she gradually got nicer and eventually was very nice to her sister.

Unfortunately, like the song Everything Changes says, what a waste of time and my mind. The rap is pathetic, singing about nothing important. If you like \\"B Boys\\" and turntables and a cameo from Chester to get rock credit, you will like this. They try to sound educated and important on Shock and Awe, but it is all rehashed shots at Pres. Bush and Iraq, which we all already know, and this cd is not going to bring down the whitehouse.

Conclusion: Butz is an articulate idiot. Over the past 20 years I have enjoyed debunking a variety of popular conspiracy theories, from the \\"Hollow Earth\\" to 9/11. I have noticed that all such theories have certain common features, as do the people whose mindsets are susceptible to them. This one will be no different.

Its heavy reliance upon faulty reasoning is indicative of the ignorance embedded within it. Its author is a known holocaust denier who trades upon his position as a tenured (i.e., cannot be fired) Professor of Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University to obtain credibility among the morons who believe this tripe. One cannot know the source of his bigotry; one can only pity him and hope that in the interest of public safety Butz is a better teacher of electrical engineering than history, for as a historian he is pathetic, offensive, and slyly illogical. Only our allegience to freedom of speech permits this offal to be disseminated; only the ignorance, antisemitism, and raw stupidity of the reader provoke its purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Holocaust Deniers' Polemic","review":"...This is a putative history by a man lacking any qualification as a historian.

In the book, Butz \\"proves\\" that the Holocaust didn't happen, no mean feat considering that 1) there are such an annoying number of eyewitnesses on both sides who aver that it did and 2) without the Holocaust, one is almost at a loss to explain the near-disappearance of European Jewry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is he talking about?","review":"I agree with many of the reviews on this book.

Anyone who takes it seriously or believes that the Holocaust is some kind of weird \\"myth\\" is not only seriously mistaken, but in danger of allowing events like the Holocaust happen again through their ignorance. History repeats itself, and the less aware you are of the events themselves and what lead up to them, the more likely that it will. I've been to the camps.

It took me three days to watch because, in my opinion, it just wasn't believable. In my DVD the audio track often did not match the mouth movements of the actors. The script took such artistic license that I'm sorry to say it wasn't credible, and therefor often made the acting seem wooden. As another person's testimonial indicated, the actions of the St Rita character just don't seem realistic (ie from honourable to deranged and back). More than being a matter of only personal taste, I would like to have seen more of the saintly behaviour I've read about plus a little more historical accuracy, perhaps exploring the stigmata phenomena a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Rita DVD","review":"The life of St. Rita ...

This is not an accurate account of St. Rita's life, I would recommend reading on her.At one point in the movie, I thought it was going to get trashy because on her wedding night, there was lots of kissing, sensuality, and then finally they walk off in the other part of the bedroom. This could have been left out of the movie, it did not need to show this, or all the times Paolo has to take his shirt off, and they could have left out the word [...]. This is suppose to be a movie on a saints life.It's already hard finding good family and catholic movies to watch but I'm not going to let me child watch False information that proclaims to be TRUTH. This includes other religious movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a saint's life, but a fantasy of one","review":"As a homage to one of the most beloved saints of the Augustinian order, this is a truly compelling and well-intentioned film. However, viewers who are new to Rita's story and those whose lives have been blessed by her favor should explore the information available at the National Shrine of Saint Rita in Philadelphia. Here, one can learn of latter-day research that not only rehabilitates the character of her husband but also makes a convincing case for her implausibly \\"miraculous\\" entry into the convent, to say nothing of its various depictions of her astonishing devotion to Christ's passion. Indeed, Rita's receipt of the stigmata from the crown of thorns--which takes up mere moments in the film--was the indisputable center of her many years in the convent and the origin of her progress to deserved sainthood. Instead of the wildly inflated and romantic tale offered by the film, Rita's real story is one marked by austerity, Good Suffering, and holy mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is NOT saint rita","review":"The film is beautiful, historical setting is excellent... but.. where is she, Santa Rita that we know? 12 yo girl forced to marry, where is her inner life and what about the receiving of stigmata which was not a small deal and the miracles of her entry to the convent...

I wanted to see the light of this advanced soul, shining of barbarian customs of medieval italy... I did not find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the name, not the life","review":"Very surprised that St. Rita's life was completely changed... there are no sacraments in the film, nor any Catholic identity at all.

The REAL story would have been more encompassing. Imagine a twelve year-old girl being forced into a marriage, then overcoming death and mayhem, while keeping her faith, and finally being rewarded with Heaven's imprimatur. Now there is a story worth telling. What a noble soul! Smaltz is a poor way to portray her noble life.Frankly, when it comes to the lives of the Saints I am tired of being presented with seriously misleading drama. Shame on the so-called Catholic press who market the deceptions as they play fast and loose with the facts. No more DVD's on the lives of the Saints. I'll stick to reliable books.

However, any half-educated person and knowledgeable Christian would give two thumbs down on this depiction of her life.May I suggest the title \\"Twin Swords\\" or something similar to denote the bloody nature of the film?

There is even one part in the movie where she says something about religious life not being for her because she wants a family. And yet, this is what catholic.org says of her life:\\"She was born in Roccaporena, near Spoleto, Italy, in 1381, and expressed from an early age the desire to become a nun. Her elderly parents insisted that she be married at the age of twelve to a man described in accounts of her life as cruel and harsh. She spent eighteen extremely unhappy years, had two sons, and was finally widowed when her husband was killed in a brawl\\"Nevertheless, she is portrayed as falling madly in love with Paolo and working very hard to get approval to marry him. Not a good portrayal of what she went through in her life's desires and marriage, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than satisfied!","review":"I bought this easel for my 2 year old nephew, based mostly on the reviews here.

The previous owner used it with two kids, and after we gave it a quick paint job, it looks brand new! It is still very sturdy and we have no problems with the shelves warping or not being strong at all. We did have to tigten the screws, but no complaints about that because who knows if the previous owner ever did. And it is a very pretty changing table! We highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this table","review":"When setting up the table, it became clear that this is a poorly made item. The changing table bed and shelves are plaster board, and the directions for assembly are confusing. But more importantly, the company sent us the wrong crossbar - it did not even fit the set nor looked like the other 3 crossbars. When I called the customer service line the next day (during weekday business hours), a recording told me to leave my name and address and description of the problem. There was no way to get in touch with any real person there! This greatly frustrated me. I immediately went online to Amazon to return this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me","review":"I don't know what everyone else is doing with it, but I've had no problems with it falling apart. It was not difficult to assemble but you did need two sets of hands. I store all our diaper-changing items on the top shelf in baskets, and then diaper bags go on the bottom shelf. The only complaint I would have is that the changing pad is yellowing in strange spots (nothing to do with where it is used most)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this table!","review":"I would like for everyone to know that I absolutely love this changing table.

The reason this changing table is inexpensive is becaue it is CHEAP and poorly made. Unfortunately when putting it together several of the pieces cracked and split. We had to order new pieces. When the replacement pieces came they were different from the original ones and required different hardware. The hardware was not sent with the new pieces so we had to go out and buy what we needed from a hardware store. When it was finally completed it was not very sturdy so I am going out to look for a new changing table. This was a very poor purchasing decision. I reccommend spending a little more and getting something that won't fall apart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great table","review":"This was given to us as a gift. We put it on the registry because it matched the crib we bought. The crib was so easy to put together that I did it myself, however, it took me and my husband to put this together and it was still difficult! We had such a hard time trying to keep the shelves in place while we put the sides on and if we tightened the screws too tight(which didn't seem tight enough)then the wood cracked. I think the hardest part was putting on the rounded top piece. I was certain it wasn't going to fit and I'm still surprised we finally got it on there. The table was also chipped a little in some spots when we got it out of the package.

Because (in MY opinion) that mentality shows nothing but a fan boy who's obsessed with being an outsider.An outsider even though they buy ALL of their clothes at Hot Topic, go to the mall and other populated areas just to get attention and be stared at, which is only used to fuel the anti-social facade put forth in public, plays D&D;, and goes to the park and LARPs with his pretend misanthropic friends.ANYWAY if you want BLACK METAL - this CD is for you.

Like all the other Blackend compilations, Volume 3 is a dubious purchase; totally devoid of unreleased/rare tracks, this is nothing really more than a pair of coasters with some of the most commercial happy-metal and Norsecore in existence on it. The only saving graces provided are from Enthroned, Usurper, and Amduscias; other than that, this CD is nothing to excite any underground aficianado. Had a compilation of this type been released prior to 1996, it might have generated some excitement and been relevant to those who like the now long-dead Scandinavian metal scene.

I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Our Worst Cheese Slicer","review":"As if you don't already feel disgusting enough munching on shards of cheese, Zyliss has found a way to make the process even more degrading with their Dial-n-Slice Cheese Slicer. Defined as a \\"slicer\\" by only the broadest definition, the Dial-n-Slice is more of a novelty item, or a lesson in futility. While the dialing mechanism does seemingly succeed in adjusting the baseline width of your cheese slices, an arbitrary bend at the edge of the blade ensures that the cut is made as jaggedly as possible, leaving you a rough-hewn slab torn off the side of your cheese brick--more often than not with a larger hunk attached to its end, punctuating exactly how terrible this cheese slicer is. Naturally, your freshly-sliced cheese hunk's irregular shape and rough edge will inevitably get it stuck in the device, so be ready to prod it out and watch it crumble on the plate below.Never buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This cheese slicer was with the presumption that it would \\"cut the cheese.\\" Unfortunately, it only crumble the cheese.

It breaks huge chunks off the end of the cheese as you finish your cutting stroke. The cheese also gets stuck in the cutting mechanism, preventing you from cutting more cheese, and it's difficult to clear the stuck cheese.It also has poor durability. I ran this through the dishwasher once, and was unable to adjust the cheese slice thickness afterward. The mechanism is permanently stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"zyliss cheese slicer","review":"This cheese slicer is junk! There is too much resistence on the slicer when pulled against the cheese.

First we tried another adjustible wire, which did not work - the wire kept coming loose. So we tried this Zyliss, thinking its different design would work. But this slicer just slices for 3 quarters of the way and then breaks the rest of the cheese off in chunks. Dialing the blade does nothing to change the performance. I'm disappointed and am going to look for another wire type slicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work for the softest cheeses...","review":"This slicer was terrible when trying to slice a block of colby-jack cheese. Setting it between the thinnest and thickest setting resulted in virtually no difference in the thickness of the slice, and either way you can only get one slice of cheese before the cutting area becomes clogged (it doesn't really \\"cut\\", it kind of drags along the cheese like a wood plane. You end up with a kind of curl of cheese). I even tried it a second time to be sure, but after two attempts, it went back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"For the price, you are much better off with an adjustable wire slicer. Even the thickest setting is so thin that the slice is paper thin. Forget that grilled cheese sandwich, unless you start early! Even medium-bodied cheeses, like Pinconning, break as you slice through. Not just the lag at the end break, either. Big chunks out of the edge of the brick. Fairly useless, waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crumbles the end of every slice","review":"Like some of the other reviews here, I found that it slices okay until you get to the end of your block of cheese, then it crumbles and breaks off chunks. And then it's not easy to get the chunks out of the blade. The variations in slicing thickness is a nice idea, but I don't care too much about that, I just want something that cuts thin slices of cheese smoothly, without tearing up my block of cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cheese plane ever","review":"This cheese plane does a terrible job slicing cheese.

The warrior doesn't fumble over his declarations of love. Neither of them is searching for someone to make them whole.

Since then I have re-read it until it is falling apart. There's no higher praise I can give a book than that. Cordelia's Honor is one of those books that alters your worldview, changes your life, and sits on your top shelf forevermore. It's a love story but it's a lot more than that. It's the story of how two determined people from very different backgrounds meet, fall in love and go on to change their worlds for the better. Cordelia and Aral become like real people you actually know--better still, they become your friends. If you haven't read this story, you don't know what you're missing--it is INCREDIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - 2 books, actually.

Shards of Honor was good, although sometimes my suspension of disbelief was challenged, and there were some pretty glaringly amateur areas--the question/answer chapters.But Barrayar was full of cliched characters and plot. Predictable, nauseating. Cordelia is not the same woman she was in Shards of Honor. She is now a self-righteous foreigner who belittles the existing society of Barrayar, and Aral is reduced to a cardboard \\"Yes Dear\\" cutout. That really saddened me--he was the best part of Shards. Bujold seems to have expanded her overly-zealous mad-feminist and mommy-hood theme (which made me gag), reveling in pregnancy and birth (I've been there, done that, and can't say I find her story believable).

Billed as a sci-fi, the reader is immediately fooled into expecting some swashbuckling futuristic action in the first few pages. This quickly falls apart, however, as the book finds its own in talking about character relationships on a planet that resembles present-day Earth in every way. Prepare for endless pages on horseback riding, formal events, romance, balls, feminism, and a wedding. Dozens of pages are devoted to each topic.And the book does well with its stride. Characters have some depth to them, the world presented feels real enough. The storyline is consistent and well-presented. Were this billed as a present-day (or even knights or fantasy) story, it would have been a hit with its target audience. As it stands here, \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" just doesn't cut it as science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me how you're really feeling!","review":"OMG - Barrayar is literally the worst book I've ever read. Halfway through Shards of Honor, I suspected the author was a woman. Halfway through Barrayar, I was convinced the author was a sexist man writing what he thought would be a woman's perspective. I mean, if I were to write a book mocking the 'stereotypical woman,' I would basically write Barrayar. The protagonist sits in a house all day long every day and really only gets involved in the exciting events of the outside world by going from room to room asking the actual participants how they are feeling. When not playing therapist, she spends her time waxing maternal, playing matchmaker, and noticing her husband's flashing eyes. I'm not making this up.I'm on book 7 of the Vorkosigan Saga. It has its ups and its downs, this is definitely a down. Unfortunately, it's basically required reading for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Days of our Lives in space.","review":"This isn't a science-fiction novel- this is a Harlequin romance! If you like ornate costumes and Grand Royal in space then you'll love this book- everyone is so dashing and suave. Bujold seems obsessed with vain trivialities. Does Cordelia have bags under her eyes this morning?...What is the lordly lord wearing today? Oh, what a lovely ball, too bad there are assassins everywhere...No wonder Cordelia spends the entire book worrying and complaining. As for real science fiction? Forget it. Nothing of interest here. Her make-believe world is silly, shallow and implausible. It's all in the characters, and they'd make Barbara Cartland blush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Sci Fi?","review":"Bujold has a strong following among sci fi readers for good writing and Cordelia's Honor demonstrates why. The writing is strong, the characters, if sometimes more carictures than characters are distinctive.Unfortunately, the sci fi is missing. Yes, there is a gloss of other worlds, disruptor rays and stunners and faster-than-light travel, but these elements are incidental to both books. Take them away, put Barrayar and Beta on two continents on opposite sides of the world (or, rename them Sparta and Athens) and you can write the same book.Classify this work as a political thriller with a sci fi gloss.

I don't like to advise people on what to buy and what not to buy. The next person may love this cd, but I didn't. I am a classic rock and rockabilly fan and thought I would like it. Dave's sound is hollow and ordinary. I tried listening to it several times and it didn't help.

I thought it was going to go more in depth to what the title suggested. I wasn't thinking Backyard wrestling, but I was hoping for at least some lines of text that wouldn't insult my intelligence. This book would be better suited for the first time wrestling viewer who wanted to take it a whole different level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road trip","review":"Who of us has not dreamed of a road trip!!?? These teenage kids are just dreaming of getting their van all fixed up (even if there is a squirrel family living in the engine space, and a raccoon family living inside this old van...)But a road trip symbolizes the freedom, no more school, no more restrictions and rules, no more parents to answer to, freedom to go where you want to and see different places...This road trip is both fun to read and also a revelation how much fun it is just to plan a trip even if it would never come true...

Glad to find anything made in the USA these days. However, I wouldn't recommend this for a Pug, which is the breed for which I purchased it. The strap that runs from the chest to the belly is too long for a Pug, but would be fine for a larger dog. I had to get the 14\\"-24\\" size as Pugs are very broad-chested, but having the larger girth means having a longer chest strap. The rear loop that goes around the dog should be just an inch or so behind the front legs; on this one it's much further back. The causes the chest strap to \\"bunch up\\" when the dog sits, so having all that extra room means the dog gets his front feet through the neck loop quite often. I would definitely recommend this for a big dog, but not for a stout dog like a Pug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort for your pet","review":"This harness is very strong and easily adjustable. It is much more comfortable for my pet than a leash. connected to a collar; it holds up on her body rather than her neck. Also, no chance of slipping her collar!

I love the variety of available patterns too, they are very cute. I liked it so much I bought one for all my companions. The best part??? They have a chew-proof guarantee too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to put on my French Bulldog puppy","review":"This harness fits my 7-lb French Bulldog puppy. However, it is challenging to put on her because of her large ears. I imagine it is easier for other dogs with smaller ears. Other than that, it's super-cute, lots of compliments and its much more comfortable for her than a collar."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hardware and have not heard from the vendor....","review":"The mirror is nice quality. I would have given this a much better rating (at least 4 stars). However, I was surprised it did not come with hardware to hang the mirror.

Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the list","review":"You cannot find a better read-to-me book for threes and fours. A warm, get-ready-for-wonderful-dreams book.

A book that will be loved over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"First of all, my family loves all books by Mem Fox. She is just a gifted author. And Sleepy Bears is one of those that I love to read as much as my almost 3-year old and almost 6-year old love to listen to. Kerry Argent's illustrations are wonderful. One of those bedtime stories that are a must have for your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sibling rivaltry between sisters or . . . ?","review":"This book preports to give the \\"real\\" biography of Roseanne Barr, and it is colorful indeed. Still, one wonders about the author's (her sister, Geraldine's) credibility since much of the text is presented in a negative light that highlights Barr's faults. The passages on Barr's accusations of childhood sexual abuse are intriguing and raise skepticism; but overall, the book has a whiney, defensive tone coming from a sister who was suprisingly and, in her view, unjustly fired as Barr's agent/promoter. More info about the development and execution of the popular \\"Roseanne\\" television show would have been interesting. In my opinion, the writing in this book is much too padded and reads a bit like a gossip tabloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"If you were to total all the interesting parts of this book, you'd come up with about thirty pages. Mostly, it chronicles how Roseanne Barr went off her rocker when she got involved with Tom Arnold and then, with the aid of false memory syndrome, betrayed her family. If you have a lot of patience and don't mind reading the same thing over and over couched in different (yet still unlyrical) language, then it might entertain you just for the dirt it gives on a major celebrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been said she knocks 'em dead...","review":"It's worth the full price of the entire album just to hear her sing \\"Sweet Georgia Brown.\\" No one else can ever sing it like her, they should have retired the song after she recorded it. Plus the arrangement is fantastic.I also love that wig she's wearing on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Perspective on Charlemagne","review":"I enjoyed reading this account of Charlemagne written by a contemporary of Charlemagne. What makes this book interesting is being able to see Charlemagne through the eyes of Einhard. Yes, I know Einhard was a friend of Charlemagne and might have influenced his account but all in all, still a valuable work into the life of one of the most important men of his era. Plus I am a fan of Medieval History and find it fascinating to be able to read something like this over a thousand years later. A great easy read that is informative and insightful into this period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocky Horror Trivia show","review":"This is totally unacceptable for a teenager.

It's been a huge amount of fun sharing the care of our pets together. Figuring out how to use the virtual pets is not at all difficult for a grown-up or older child, but it would definitely be too hard for him to figure out alone. With a bit of help from me he has learned all he needs to know (a bit of word recognition is required of him), and we have great fun babysitting for each other and connecting our pets via the infrared capability. In our current Tamagotchi generation we have a boy and a girl, and (I never dreamed I'd have a context in which I'd say this) I'm looking forward to having babies with my son. It's been a great bonding experience and a decent learning experience for him, and I'd recommend it to other parents as a fun activity to share with a caring, gadget-loving younger child."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok....","review":"this toy was horrible, a babyish toy and i think only 5 year-olds will have fun with this. it was so irritating and i couldn't find the intructions and their a ripe-off and it wastes your money and it really doesn't teach you anything. i don't like it and i am only a third grader. i hope this will open up your minds up to the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but dont turn it into your guide!","review":"I was totally hooked when reading this book, and it was very entertaining endeed. Even though the spiritual warfare around us daily, and the power of prayer is very real, I sure hope people dont take this book as total spiritual truth and total theological correctness. REMEMBER-- This book is a FICTION novel BASED on real spiritual facts! Do not let it confuse you in some of the details... The real guide for our lives and what you should base your beliefs in is the Holy Bible! Keep christian fiction books for what they are made for: entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING DRAMA THAT HOLDS YOU TO THE END!!!","review":"Frank Peretti uses his phenominal writing style in these epic novels. Each tells of the war on three worlds- heaven, earth, and hell. Using a style of writing that picks up speed until the finale, Peretti does a wonderful job of displaying the supernatural in accordance with everyday life. Highly suspenseful and original, this book shows ordinary people what is going on in the world. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piercing the Darkness","review":"After reading this book, I became awake to the fact that everything under the sun has life in it.I saw the presence of the messengers of light shinning over a situation or in flight because, a believer has not encouraged their fight over darkness with his/her prayers.I highly recommend this book to all pastors and a must for evangelists since you break frontiers in search of souls to save.Like Angel Gabriel in the book of Daniel, there are demonic princes and captains of different regions that would be in opposition to your mission. Therefore, know them and how they operate. I could read this book over and over again.May Yahweh bless you brother Piretti.Soon you'll be getting my order for This Present Darkness and other works.Remain blessed and Sholom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"This book is a great addition to any Christian reader looking for a fiction book that both encourages and strengthens your spirit. Both books give a realistic look into satan's attacks on our minds and lives yet leaves you encouraged to continue the fight. Hope this book blesses you as much as it has me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness shall be defeated","review":"This was great to have both books in a beautiful hardcover. Piercing the Darkness was recommended to me years ago, when I was a young Christian. I started reading it but honestly it scared me and I wasn't ready for it. I am older now my children are older and I wanted to read books with a purpose. I came across these books again and was completely hooked by the first page.These books are very eye openning as they take a look as to what is going on in the unseen. I enjoyed both books very much, but I have to say The Present Darkness was my favorite. Both have great story lines, but I think Piercing the Darkness moves a little slower, but just as good. These books are scary, suspensful and a thrilling ride. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"The first few chapters of the book are kind of slow, but once you get throught them you absolutely cannot put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Eye opening, thought provoking!","review":"Frank Peretti gives some idea to the reader about what is really taking place in the spiritual realm. Whether or not we know it, there are things going on all around us - like in the book, that need to be \\"battled\\" with prayer. Frank Peretti's style of writing is very attention capturing, it's very hard to put one of his books down! Thanks Mr. Peretti!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual Hollywood","review":"It's a little too unrealistic for me. Satan and his demons were once angels in heaven. Why does the auther deplict them as dragons of folklore and hollywood monsters? The Bible says \\"Satan comes disguised as a messenger of light\\" and to \\"test the spirits\\" so deplicting demons as monsters turned my pages closed. This would make a good \\"Hollywood Horror Film\\". If your into that stuff, enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't hit the mark","review":"Not the best Christian fiction I've read and at best it is quite paranoid beyond belief to hold up to any truth today. Also the theological references at best are quite skewed from the gospel's actual message and everyone should remind themselves that the novel is FICTION designed to feed into fundamentalist paranoia and apocalyptic frenzy.Do not lose sight of Christ's true message because of a fantasy story. True Christians will not even have to contend with these so called demons because true Christians will not allow them to attack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not readable.","review":"Mr. Peretti does now how to excite, but not how to write. Iread his book Prophet, but the characters in that book were socliche... It was like reading some harlequin book. Besides, I don't think that the word theology is apropiately used in this genre. Books like this tend to be superficial and not profound, which theology should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What hogwash!","review":"Is this guy nuts? I didn't know that Christians believed in yellow-eyed, sulfur-spewing demons! And how in the world could he depict proponents of Universal Love to be the bad guys! This is the first book that I will throw away. I won't even donate it to a thrift shop lest some poor soul will waste money on it- even at 25 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing to read","review":"This book literally changed my life, and two of the best selling Christian novels in history, now combined. The battle raging in the spiritual realm has changed my prayer life forever. With this Present Darkness, Peretti broke onto the scene by graphically tearing back the veil between the human and the spirit world. Descending upon the small town of Ashton, angels, demons, and strongmen engage in a vivid battle and we, the reader, see it all unfold. Before Frank Peretti I wasn't interested in \\"Christian fiction\\". I just didn't see the point. But, I love fiction and I love the Lord. It's wonderful to be able to read, enjoy what I'm reading and learn something all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I haven't had time to finish reading this book but so far it has been good. It sure makes you think and be aware of what is happening around you that is invisible to the naked eye but not to the spiritual eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Present Light","review":"This Present Darkness is a timeless work of art in that it peels back the veil of a world just as real as ours that many choose to ignore. This particular book is a double treat because the reader gets to continue walking the path of enlightenment in Piercing the Darkness without having to buy a separate book. All encompassing, the two-story work is a rare gem not to be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unseen warfare, the battle for souls","review":"These books were a revelation at the time they were written. Many christians \\"woke up\\" to how serious this battle really is. Unfortunately, like everything else, the fire died, and christians became slothful, lazy, and lost the fire. We forgot that before these books were even wrote, the holy scriptures talked about the unseen war thousands of years ago. These books were a serious wake up call to a sleeping church. Peretti, was inspired I believe to write these books. He was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give us a shot in the arm. These books did just that, at the time. Now, at this present time, in this present darkness, we are faced with a horrifying tragedy at New York City. Sadly, it took that display of raw, satanic, destruction, to unite the White House, the people of America, and the churches. To me that is REALLY sad. God bless him for writing these books, thankyou Frank, there hasn't been books like those since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this really fiction?","review":"This brilliant depiction of the unseen spiritual realm is incredibly intriguing. It is disturbingly realistic, and yet comforting at the same time. A definate page-turner all the way through. Unexpected twists and turns in the plot are stunning! A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This rating is for the condition of the book that I received...not the content of the book.","review":"I purchased this book as \\"new\\". The book that was shipped to me appeared to be used or, at least had been handled very rough. The cover was scratched, had a small tear, and had something dirty smeared on the front and on the spine. One corner of the book was bent as if it had been dropped. Since I was purchasing a new book, I returned it to Amazon without any problems.I owned these books before and loaned them to someone that didn't return them. I am a Peretti fan and especially liked these two books and wanted them in my library. That's why I was purchasing this combination book. I will buy them soon, but not from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing The Darkness","review":"Of all of Frank Peretti's novels, these two remain my favorites. I purchased this book to replace the originals that I bought years ago. My wife and have read and re-read them, Frank has found the way to bridge the gap between Christian and non-Christian readers. The storyline is riveting and compelling. I can't tell you how many times I've lent these books to friends who had questions about nmy faith. The questions are answered in a powerful way. I can only say, \\"Thanks, Frank!!! Your unique storytelling is a true blessing!!!\\" I highly recommend these books. Very entertaining and enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a great book. Even though I no longer believe in God, angels, or demons this was a very gripping read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little book!","review":"I have to say that this book as a lot of effective information to help you with essentially any problem you're facing. For example, if you have problems of keeping your emotions in check, she has some bible verses you can say that will balance that issue out. If you're a Joyce Meyer fan or enjoy reading her books, you owe it to yourself to buy this book and use this to change your life. Everything in this book is written to make it simple for you to understand and use without any difficulties, plus I like that fact that everything is broken up into sections (anger, hope) to make it simpler to find what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is an awesome, handy little book.

I purchased an extra so I am never without in case my hubby takes one on the road with him! We LOVE Joyce Meyer!!! This book is so easy. You can access scripture you need immediately since it is separated by catagory! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice as a small present","review":"This books contains bible passages that are under certain topics like Faith , Trust etc. If you do not want to spend the time looking in the bible for things like that , this is the book to get. But it does not in any way compare to the wisdom you could obtain searching for passages on your own. It makes a nice present or companion while travelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Spiritual tool!","review":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word by Joyce Meyer is a wonderful help for dealing with life from God's prospective. So many times we become negative when faced with problems. This book gives us the assurance that through the power of Scripture we can bring positive results out of negative. Each subject outlined in the book has Scripture references given to speak to the issue at hand. Jesus addressed each lie Satan tempted Him with by quoting Scripture. This book is a powerful tool in the hands of a believer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this","review":"Do not waste your money on this.

The weight of the player, the battery life before charging was 4 hours plus, and the ease of using the player was great.

I bought it for my 2 year old to keep her occupied on a long plane trip. The swivel screen was the selling point. It swivels over the player itself and hides all of the buttons. Then it easily fits in a carrying case (included) and can be hung on the seat's tray. My toddler is a button pusher and the screen was great in limiting her ability to turn the player on and off. The sound was great, too.

We tried several more times to discharge and recharge it, but the unit was defective. I called Amazon, who told us to return it to Coby and thats where the real problems started. We returned it in August and still have not received a repaired unit in return. Every time I contact Coby they are very disorganized and unhelpful. I could not recommend any Coby product based on my experience with their customer service (or lack thereof). I gave the unit two stars because it seemed like if it had worked it may have been great.

I'd actually had it for over a year, but hadn't used it much as there weren't all that many opportunities so I was very disappointed to discover on a long car trip when I really needed it that it wasn't interested in playing the many movies we brought along for entertainment. It would play parts of the movies, or perhaps the special features, but apparently, the read head had lost its ability to operate smoothly all the way through the disk.

Although it approaches the divine from the Middle Eastern tradition of Islam, it is not dogmatic and rather stresses the truths within all religions (which is the Sufi way, being the path along which the author travels).It is an account of a journey, an adventure, right into the heart of 'God' - in whatever way you choose to understand that term. It has been a true inspiration to me, and I count myself blessed at having had the chance to have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Adventure Story","review":"This book is great! I read it over a year ago and much of the imagery is still right here with me, partly due to Feild's descriptive prose, but partly due to his strong beautiful message and captivating story.

She paints such wonderful pictures and brings every character off the page with baited breath. It amazes me how much she shows without actually showing the reader. She does dive a bit too much into the scenery in this book, but her location is rich and lush.Kearsley's approach to the past is completely different from what I expected since I'd read so many of her other books, but it still helps explain the connection to all of the secrets possessed by the family.Enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"This was very readable. For most that sounds like a C grade, but since I have not been able to read much of anything recently that is a very good thing. The language flows and the characters are rounded, they each have a personality and a true character, ie the author shows us who they are and stays with it.The only thing I had against this book is that the description gave me the impression that this would be a historical, perhaps 50s or 60s but not modern day. This book does take place in the modern era.Finally, regarding the love story. It is hte perfect gothic pace.

The historical element of this book is not as strong as in, say Mariana or Sophia's Secret, and the \\"mystery\\" that takes place in the past is a little predictable, but the modern-day story more than made up for that. There's a mystery and some ghosts in the modern-day story, and I really enjoyed the suspense and the hint of something supernatural that seems to haunt the second Celia. The characters of this book are also well-formed and fully realized, although the second Celia seemed a lot older than her twenty-two years sometimes.I was also fully able to appreciate the setting of this novel, too--I went to Italy in 2004, and one of the places I visited was Lake Garda and the town of Sirmione. Both are just as beautiful in real life as they're described in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well . . .","review":"Although I am a big fan of Ms. Kearsley and her books, this one just didn't grab me the way the others have.

This is my first SK book. I took to it right away, but my sister did not. While it was a little different from most action/romances I've read, I fell in love with it so quickly! Alex was one of the best characters ever! Wow! What a great job SK did making this guy irrisistable. Celia was adorable, too.Part of what sets this book apart from others is that when we meet a character, we're never 100% sure what they're about, who they are, what they stand for.Celia's friends were absolutely terrific.This wonderful book proves that you don't have to have graphic love scenes to imagine Alex and Celia falling in love.

There is no real strategy or skill to the fighting other than wailing around on the buttons until the bad guys die.

The greatest hero in the marvel universe should be playable on all systems.

I would also say that it is completely comprehensive, except that I noticed that the 1967 copy of Captain Johner and the Aliens published by Gold Key seems to be missing from some editions....One important thing to keep in mind is that the guides themselves become collectibles.

I have been a long time fan who eagerly awaits any JD Robb title. I think this book is the worst in the series so far. There isn't any suspense in this book at all. Nothing was exciting, surprising or unpredictable. In my opinion, the best thing that can be said about this book is that it does provide some background information on Eve and serves as a transitionary story that will lead to hopefully better releases in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory in Death","review":"I really enjoyed this book as I do all of the books in the \\"In Death\\" series.

There are too many better researched, talented writers of fiction than this writer available. She doesn't hold a candle to Nicholas Sparks, Sue Monk Kidd and Nicholas Evans.

Their adventures, in the future as a police detective & spouse, are always filled with suspense. Even knowing Eve will \\"always speak for her victims\\", the story lines are never dull. The saucy life she lives with her husband and friends, is full of entertainment. Worth getting involved with these stories about Eve! She will pull at your heart & soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of series...","review":"A very disappointing read-laborious, predictable, no interesting plot or characterization. The supporting characters that make Eve such an interesting person and the books such fascinating reads were missing--for a book set during Christmas, this lack was even more apparent.

Can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory In Death","review":"Wonderful book!. Eve Dallas is a tough, no-nonsense New York City cop but, in this book, we watch Eve grow as a woman, wife, friend as well as a police officer.

It is a tale of pain and growth and of memories for the good Lieutenant.Roarke and Eve's relationship has its ups, downs and rocky patches and yet its almost as interesting as the mystery. I found the mystery to be a wee bit on the weak side. A little predictable... But not bad at all on the whole.An enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory in Death","review":"Loved it!

There sits Trudy Lombard, one of her foster parents during her time in Dallas, a woman who'd best be described as \\"Mommie Dearest.\\" Unprepared, Eve handles the situation poorly and has a physical reaction that levels her. When Roarke discovers what has happened, he smartly realizes it won't be long before Trudy will visit him for a shakedown. This book is worth the read if solely to read that scene!That's all I'll share about the story so you'll have the pleasure of following what happens next. This book is a treacherous path down Eve's memory lane and we gain lots of insight into her past in addition to an intriguing murder mystery she and Peabody are tasked to solve. It's interesting and the culprit isn't easy to identify but it's possible.This ranks as one of my favorites in the series both for the mystery/suspense and the peeling back of Eve's many layers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Robb","review":"Because this book deals with Eve's past, it's less of a suspenseful police procedural than some of Robb's books. But all the classic trademarks of her writing are still here; excellent dialogue, great characters and interaction between them, well-done sense of place and, lest we forget, hot passion. Personally, I prefer cases where Eve's past is less involved, but that certainly doesn't mean I'm going to stop reading the series. These are definitely books I read as soon as I receive them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quotes and personal wisdom","review":"Lloyd has compiled the wisdom of leaders from the last 2000 years.

Verve should be ashamed of what they have done to great vocalists' works. The only cut that I could even tolerate was Dinah Washington's. The one saving grace is that I purchased it used (excellent condition because it probably was only played once before). The lesson I have learned is that I will take the time to read the customers' reviews in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Right Mix!!","review":"This CD is the definition of what \\"jazztronica\\" or whatever else it's called should be. This disc should appeal to fans of electronic music, as well as jazz traditionalists. Virtually every track makes you perk up your ears and bob your head along to the music. Tracks of note include \\"How Long Has This Been Going On\\" and the funkfest of Willie Bobo's \\"Spanish Grease.\\" Kudos also to Verve for selling the \\"Verve Unmixed\\" CD at such a low price, encouraging people unfamiliar with the originals to get educated."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of these things is JUST like the other!","review":"If you like the retro-vocal melancholy, jazzy, cafeteria-style, insular-yet-panoramic, lush, smoky-lounge, orchestral, strange, ecstatic, DJ-scratchy, sublime, sampled and genre-bending compostions of Art of Noise, The Matthew Herbert Big Band, De-Phazz, Enzso, Funki Porcini, Yello, Caleb's Cosmosis, Hugh Marsh, Future Sound of London, United Future Organization or Bowery Electric, then you will love this. 'NUFF SAID."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delish!!","review":"I ain't gonna say much about the album. I kinda got bored in the beginning with the Spanish Grease and slipped right through it. MJ Cole gets you interested with his bouncy,\\"garage\\"-style mix. I must say this album requires you too warm-up to it a bit. DePhazz hooked Ella Fitzgerald's \\"Wait to You See Him\\" up! Listening to this song reminds me of a love scene in a movie; very smooth and sensual. dZhihan and Kamien blew me away with their hypnotic take on Billie Fitzgerald's \\"Don't Explain\\". Masters at Work get you in a playful mood and ready for the dancefloor. Tricky and Tony Scott...get too weird and ruin your buzz!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Balance","review":"It seems that there are three types of people who purchased this CD.1. The Jazz fanatic who ends up hating it because the work is not in tack or the artist vocals where rewroked.2. The uneducated \\"Techno\\" (Its a genre of edm not a generalization of edm folks) fan who doesn't get or appreciate the beauty of the classic jazz tracks.3. The heads who get jazz and understand the mantra like qualities of EDM.The remixes on this album are mostly fantastic, some are creative and dont hold to a pop format which makes them more uncomfortable than the standard \\"song\\"If you are someone who read Kerouac in high school or university, dug nina and ella and monk and davis and mingus and then discovered the New Jazz (EDM and IDM) then buy this CD. If you are in either of the 2 catagories of uneducated techno fan or old school jazz purist you may have to open you mind to get the beauty of this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"I have all three of the \\"Verve Remixed\\" CDs. This one is the worst. On this CD, I just cannot see the point of mangling these old recordings. I found no compelling rhythms at all.By contrast, the #2 and #3 CDs in the series are great. I find this puzzling. Usually, sequels suck. In this case, the musicheads at Verve seem to have improved their game with practice. I respect them for that. Now I'll just start up Remixed #3 and bliss out for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"Since the advent of sampling, a number of labels with rich libraries have opened their vaults to the new musical alchemists. This CD is among the best of breed. The secret to great cooking is great ingredients. The guest djs/producers are tops in their craft and they manipulated some of the best jazz voices ever. It's worth it if only to hear how jazz greats like Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan would sound with contemporary sounds. All of the djs intently preserved the majesty of each singer's voice.I am more of a jazz purist admittedly. But I was impressed when I heard Dinah Washington's \\"Is you is...\\" at Pravda Lounge (NY). I bought the CD the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz beats for a new generation","review":"You would probably have to be a diehard jazz purist to not like this CD. If you are not afraid of avant garde experimentations on classic ground, this may be just the right thing for you - Dorfmeister's \\"Spanish Grease\\" remix has a typical club house beat that also gives it a new, fresh air. Among the remixes that fare better on this compilation are those of Ella Fitzgerald's \\"Wait till you see him\\", Billie Holiday's \\"Don't Explain\\" and of course the two Nina Simone's remixes on this album. Anyone who knows Tricky's work won't find the Billie Holiday's \\"Strange Fruit\\" remix weird-sounding, but one can't help wondering if it was the right thing to do. All in all, a solid compilation that should be equally at home with jazz enthusiasts and downtempo/lounge aficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rae and Christian do it once again.","review":"This whole album was just wonderful.The rae and christian track on the first cd was my favorite.. I turned it on, and just jammed.. right away. Great transition from drum n bass to good old jazz.

There's a great use of typography and white space not often seen in historical publications of this nature. But perhaps there's a reason for that...This is a great example of a book's design taking precedence over its subject matter. While the grid use and minimalist photo treatment is stylish and contemporary, it's not conducive to this particular audience--an audience expecting to enjoy larger, more detailed photographs and content.I don't entirely blame the designer for the book's failure, either--it was a mistake for the publisher to call it \\"Definitive\\", when it truly isn't. This only makes the design flaw more glaring.Students of design may find the book more interesting than Civil War buffs.

Yes, it does have a weaker story than either Raiders or The Last Crusade, but it does have the most action in the series, particularly the thrill-packed finale, one of the best extended action sequences ever put on film. The action scenes here are a bit more polished than in Raiders of the Lost Ark and there's more humor, and even a kid sidekick, which might annoy some.

I had not problem with the more extreme violence but parts were people are eating monkey brains and so on are just stupid and make the film seem more tung and cheek.Also the Shorty and Willie are both cliched and boring. There only purpose is to annoy and really hurt the film in the character department.Still, The Temple of Doom is exciting and well done. Several scenes(the heart removal for example) are excellent and it's a shame that the films minor flaws drag it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad.","review":"Nothing less than the worst Hollywood film of the 1980's. A tale of bloody horror, explicit violence, misogyny, xenophobia, racism, sexism, and religious prejudice. But it's Spielberg, so take the whole family!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cruelty: toward the characters, the actors, and the audience","review":"I totally agree with the previous review. I watched the film last night with my wife and kids... somehow I'd missed it when it came out. I recommended it based on my enjoyment of the first and third films in the series.Temple of Doom is a celebration of cruelty, terrible violence, and some terrible acting. Kate Capshaw, she is a rotten performer! Harrison Ford looks like he is hating every minute of his job getting this movie made. The non-stop action is so poorly paced, the audience has no room to experience climaxes or dramatic tension.But mostly, the cruelty and torture was unrelenting and, as the previous reviewer mentioned it, a lot of the cruelty is directed toward children.I would not recommend this film to anyone. It stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad plot, too unrealistic","review":"I am not going to give away the plot in this movie. I hate it when people do that to me, so I will not tortue you that way. Anyway, I thought the plot was relatively bad. Bad compared to other movies, awful compared to Raiders and Last Crusade. I liked the music, special effects could have been better. Next: realistic or not?IT WAS UTTERLY UNREALISTIC!How could putting a torch to someone's chest take them out of an evil trance? How could a mine car going very quickly jump from one track onto another and somehow land perfectly? How could a group of archers manage to fire hundreds of arrows at a target and somehow miss every shot by about two inches?Anyway, it was not good enough to be a film even comparable to the other two Indiana Jones movies. With how bad it was and how good the other two are, I wonder why they even bothered to make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TEMPLE OF DOOM or DANTE'S INFERNO?","review":"Ever read Dante's Inferno? Well, this is what this movie reminds me of. A dark, red-hued hell with all sorts of devilish characters. Like Leonard Maltin said, it'll give you a headache. The storyline is DIRT compared to RAIDERS. The acting isn't so great, either. And really, who cares about three stupid rocks in the middle east? I don't know if there even is such a thing as three sacred rocks in middle eastern culture, but it would be nice if Indiana went after an artifact that's a little better known to us. Which is why I think the series went with the Holy Grail theme in the last movie, LAST CRUSADE. All in all, this is a very dark, depressing movie, with few parts that are really worth your time, or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to love life...","review":"I gave this movie a one star review only because there was not a zero star option. I once loved life. After seeing this thing I now hate life. This can't even be called a movie. I now know what it must be like to be consumed by The Nothing. I would actually prefer such a fate rather than watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"whos the editor of this movie","review":"the movie starts out pretty cheesy, as when jones throws a spear and it flies like it got shot out of a cannon. a plane flies into the mountain and the mountain is unscaved. a raft as a safety device...c'mon, my butt hurts when i fall off the couch. next is the natives that can speak better english than the little chinese kid short round. i can go on...guns reappearing in indys hand after they fall fly off a cliff, water from a 1000 gallon bucket fills up a lava filled cave. mining carts flying like a plane. alligators that eat clothing. people having their gun jammed and cant shoot it, but still makes a bang sound. people running like bears. rubber swords and pick axes used for fighting. bad guys falling through trap doors designed for when western guys in cowboy hats attack them. but if youre looking for a laugh, rent this...i liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Raiders was great.

Lucas even admitted that when he wrote both Empire and Temple, he was going through a divorce. And so both movies are dark, I have to say this movie doesn't even feel like an Indiana Jones movie. Kate Capshaw screams all the way through this movie, Short Round adds nothing to the movie. And the Nostalgia Critic is right, Indy says he doesn't believe in the power of the stones, but yet all of a sudden does at the end. There really is no reason for him to go after the stones, not a good Indiana Jones movie. The only reason I have it, is to complete the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm, creepy but good","review":"This movie was pretty good, overall. Some parts were sort of corny and that darn lady in it was soooooo annoying. The plot in it was also a little bit on the stupid side, but hey, thats just the way things are. I would not reccomend this movie to the weak at heart (ha-ha) There are some pretty nasty scenes which include a man getting his heart taken out while he is still alive and another man getting rolled over by a rock crusher.

And I was even willing to suspend disbelief at all the airplane antics, but the over-the-top racism of this movie stuns me.How can anyone with half a brain find this non-offensive?Saved by the British??? The British were MURDERING people!!! How 'bout the utter mangling of a religion practiced by more people than there are Christians?White damsel in distress dressed in white threatened by the hordes of dark heathens???I loved the other Raiders movies.

What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"unwatchable","review":"This movie is close to being the top of my top ten worst movies of all time. I used to rent it every few years to make sure that I wasn't imagining the true waste I thought this movie was. I was always reminded after having to turn it off halfway through to always trust my instincts. Kate Capshaw turns in the most annoying female performance of all time and the young boy - short round - is the worst kid character of all time. The opening scene is wonderful fun but it's all downhill from there. A truly horrible film, not because it's boring and uninteresting (which it is) but because it's just so damn annoying. This is the cinematic version of nails on a chalkboard. Hard to believe Spielberg could stoop this low. By the way, I LOVE Raiders and The Last Crusade."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After Raiders... I found this episode dark and sinister with little to redeem it. The actors struck me as very one dimensional and not all that entertaining, even Ford. The special effects were well done as one would expect from a film of this type. I do not find myself wanting to run out and see this again on video, unlike the other Indiana Jones films. I'm not sure what Mr. Lucas was aiming for with this film but he missed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An action classic!","review":"This one is my favorite of the trilogy. It is often criticized for being more violent than Raiders & Crusade which I think is unfair. The other two films have people getting run over, blown up, diced by airplane propellors, melted, etc. Granted the chilled monkey brains are a bit much, but the beautiful locations kind of make up for this, and I think the mine-car chase on the tracks is one of the best action sequences of all time. It seems to have inspired a couple of computer animation videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the three!","review":"This one is often the least favorite of many but not for me. In fact Temple of Doom is in fact my favorite of the bunch.Indiana Jones is in 1930s Shanghai China and has been making a deal with a Chinese mafia leader but after an altercation, he escapes until things go wrong when the plane goes down in India and he ends up in a village where all of the children have been kidnapped. It turns out that they were taken to an underground diamond mine that is run by a Satanic Thuggee cult lead by Mola Ram. The cult worships the evil god Khali and Indie must rescue the children and retrieve the stones.This one is my favorite of them all. I like them all but TOD is the best of them. I love it's dark and sinister tone and the incredible action sequences especially towards the latter half. Some scenes were a bit troubling and even stereotypical but overall, Spielberg and Lucas hit the high mark on here. Go and buy this movie but get it on the DVD set immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could'a been a contender","review":"What a shame about this film.The film started so very well with an excellent opening dance and song piece, fun rollicking in the Shanghai club, the big escape in the bad guys plane.Harrison Ford was at his best in the role amd he had two excellent support characters in Willie Scott and Short Round.The devastated village scene, the travel across country with the elephants, Willie's problems with the wild life, the bat scene and then the tour de force dinner scene at the palace, followed by the will he wont he bedroom scenes, and then the trap door and bug scene.Yep it was shaping up as the best of the series.But then it seemed to get lost in the caves and though clever it didnt start to pick up again until the underground roller coaster scene.Look its a good film but it went flat in the middle...a shame because it could have been a contender for the best of the Jones films. Just felt the later half of the film couldnt keep up with the excellent first half.What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too spooky for my taste","review":"The \\"now standard Indiana\\" formula is there and there are a lot of fun parts to this movie. However the bad guys are too bad and the situation is too spooky. Be sure to watch \\"Riders of the Lost Ark\\" first even thought this takes place chronologically earlier.Once again James Bond has nothing on Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) as he negotiates for a treasure and is double crossed at every turn, barely escaping with his life, also the acquisition of a steriotipical blond singer Wilhelmina Scott (Kate Capshaw), and his new sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan).In his hasty retreat he does not realize that there are greater forces at work insuring that he fulfill his destiny to recover a sacred object and all the children of a beleaguered village.Is he up to the challenge?In this case does being blond help or hinder?Will Short Shot prove that size does not matter?Take heart!Be prepared for a dark passage \\"a little too dark for my taste\\".The Librarian - Quest for the Spear"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pimple of Doom","review":"If you want to believe, don't bother reading this.After much anticipation, I just finished viewing Temple of Doom and found it a dissapointment. Indy's 2-dimensional companions \\"Willie\\" and \\"Shorty\\" seemed to toggle between desparate comic diversion and self-serving audience identification. The main villian spouted exotic gibberish to some styrofoam god gave the term \\"heart wrenching\\" a new definition. The insects were slimy also.

Even Dalai Lama and all the Buddhists while preaching ahimsa have no problem eating animal carcass. But the religious Hindus do not kill animals and yet this vile movie showcased them eating all kinds of stuff.The origins of such BS came from the Anglican Brits who made up the whole Thuggie story of Kali worshipers killing innocent people.

Indy's new adventure is to find three rocks and keep his heart inside his chest cavity. Oh, yeah, don't eat too many of the bugs.TEMPLE OF DOOM misses the mark. It wanders away from what Indiana Jones should be doing, fighting Nazis and using his brain to piece together ancient puzzles and find buries treasure.The value here is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas will learn what they did wrong for the next Indy adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Screwball Comedy/Mystery","review":"Jonathan Latimer was a reporter with Chicago Herald Examiner in the thirties before publishing this novel in 1935. The central character is Bill Crane, an operative with a detective agency in Chicago. There are 4 other Bill Crane books by Latimer, all of them hilarious. Crane has to be the hardest drinking private dick in the history of literature, even surpassing Hammett's Nick Charles. This whole series is a screwball comedy lover's dream. Hearse follows the efforts of Crane and his cronies to save an innocent man on death row with only twenty-four hours until the execution (and for Crane, that's a lot of drinking!).

We all know there's something, or someone, out there but to try and label it, or the band, is downright ignorant. This band is deffinately a must have if your into the metal genre. Absolutely awesome, talented, and highly spiritual creatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste Of Time","review":"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Ehhh. These reissues bring back a lot of memories, but mostly of stuff I would like to forget. Things like middle school.Blindside were part of the explosion of heavy Christian bands in the mid to late 90's and were one of the few to have a bit of a nu-metal tinge to their sound. Needless to say, the sound on these albums are dated and honestly, Blindside are so far past any relevance in heavy music these days that these are really a waste of time and energy.There are a few decent tracks here and there, but most of the material is just... boring, completely lackluster, and the nu-etal edge is frankly horrible. Perhaps their major label signing had something to do with the reissues, but they are pretty much pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!","review":"Ok; one of the most innovative current heavy acts in the mainstream today used to be finding their feet: this was then. Don't dwell on it. I got this cd expecting to be blown away, but instead I hear a wannabe early Incubus/Mr. Bungle/Slipknot audio-crap. Ugh. This band is good, but I don't reccomend you befile your ears with this pseudo-early band trying to sound like a mixture of the current acts of the time (some may include revolutionary Swedish brother band Refused). Don't bother with this unless you like Disturbed or some crap like that. Good band, but if I were them I'd take this album lock it up and throw away the key."},{"rating":"2","title":"a really good buy","review":"tons of great hardcore. invert totally kicks. in many was simalar to the beastie boys in rappish coreish sessions through out the cd. really good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLINDSIDE IS THE BEST CHRISTIAN ROCK!","review":"I love blindside they let me listen to the beat that i like with the christian influence it's great!

It changes in to a teenager about a day 1/2 later. I forget how many days later it changes into an adult. ^_^\\" Anyway, when it is 7 years old it can mate. I think when it is 13 years old it can't mate anymore. (I always mate when the Matchmaker comes!) It will turn into an old person when it can't mate anymore! Tamatalk.com is a fourm on Tamagotchis.

The bottom of the CD cover says \\"music from and INSPIRED by the motion picture\\", so it isn't really the soundtrack from the film.

For those seeking the two cuts from \\"Dave's True Story\\" (learning to kiss scene), you will have to buy the reissue of the \\"Daves True Story\\" CD (available on Amazon.com). Nevertheless, this CD provides an excellent, relaxing score to the single or swing-life in NYC. Liner notes are brief, but it does include the recording dates of each cut (some from the Verve catalog in the 1950s), and most include the names of the well known studio musicians who played backup."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the soundtrack","review":"It's a very nice CD, but it's missing several songs from the film and has several songs not in the film.

The movie is filled with songs that really match its changing moods and make for a wonderful collection, but I was a little disappointed when I discovered that several of the songs from the movie were not included on the soundtrack. I know that many others have this same opinion, and I appreciate the research that has been done to get the titles of the songs from the movie out there. I found out today that the BARRY WHITE song in the movie is called \\"I'M GONNA LOVE YOU JUST A LITTLE MORE, BABY.\\" If anyone knows the name of the rap song that is played when Jessica and Helen return to Helen's appartment after their conversation with the two men at the bar about the male interest in lesbian sex, please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-serving garbage from Verve Records...","review":"What?

It broke in my backpack in the first week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economic Solace","review":"This is a wonderful story for all in need of a little economic solace. Russ Roberts (who is wonderful in person) illustrates a world of free trade in a charismatic fictional story. Reminiscent of It's A Wonderful Life, the \\"angle\\" David Ricardo teaches an american tv manufacturer why free trade is so important even if it does destroy his business, so convincing is Roberts that I teared up on occasion and bought a copy for everyone I knew. The Choice is a book too compelling for anyone with any kind of education not to believe in the power of the Market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, Elegant and Wrong","review":"Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better. Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible. In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs. Fables like The Choice (or the \\"free-market economy\\" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple. That's why the book is dangerous. The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good. The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable. If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well. Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capable of convincing even the most cynical skeptic...","review":"...that free trade benefits EVERYBODY in the long run. If you have doubts about the matter, buy the book. Roberts analyzes every critique of open trade policies and systematically, in thoroughly entertaining fashion, dismantles them. If you're a frustrated free-trader in a sea of protectionists who talk in platitudes, BUY THIS BOOK FOR THEM! It worked for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped","review":"I've had this cookbook for quite some time - looks like an older edition than is sold here. I had never really used it, but recently found some tasty recipes that I wanted to make. I have to say I was rather disappointed by the end result of all three recipes I made last week. They lacked real flavor and, on top of it all, were really labor intensive. Not meals you'd want to make after a workday. I feel that I find so many more interesting vegetarian recipes elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with previous reviewer!","review":"If you're a fan of Colin Wilson, this book reads like a 'greatest hits' collection.For the general fan of the strange and the unexplained, this book is a good collection, but is not as detailed or complete as a great primer ought to be.

He does not romanticize the lives of the poor, nor does he damn them with neglect;rather, he gives their lives dignity.This is the moral tightrope that all Third World writers face: the choice between compassion and brutal honesty.

The reader is likely to spend much of the time wondering what just happened, how did we get from there to here, who is that, etc., which does not make for an enjoyable read. I realize that the book is targeted at children, but children are YOUNG, not stupid. Even when I was younger I would have dismissed this as trash. Greg Ehrbar (The \\"writer\\") is a name I will studiously avoid in the future. The saving grace is the sketchbook in the back, showcasing the design work of the movie's Production Designer, famed comic-book creator Mike Mignola.

Singer, and ultimately descends into bathos. I had difficulty in following the (to my mind) excessively complex, blowsy plot, which I suspect reflects the current level of the writer's style, without her husband's influence. She attempts to keep fifteen balls in the air and drops a few. I felt that, having missed a couple of turns at the end, that p'rhaps I should go back a few hundred pages and Review. Maybe Diagram. I decided against it, feeling that I should reserve this sort of attention to War And Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangle of Love, Loss and Redemption","review":"This was a beautifully written novel. Each of the characters were uniquely introduced and formulated into people I cared about. I was led through the life of a gifted writer and the unexpected twists his life took, the losses he suffered and the lives he touched in unforeseen ways. To speak too much of the plot would give away the story. The conclusion was soft spoken, poignant, and well worth discovering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I found myself going back many times to reread parts, and try to figure out just what was going on. This book is part mystery, part love story. Interesting, but I needed to pay attention to much, and didn't get enough answers at the end. Great book club read, though, and the chat going on at the end of this section really helps a lot. Don't read too much of it prior to reading the book, but use it as a way to get questions resolved once you've finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"by and when","review":"When you read this book.

I found myself skipping to Leo's chapters quite often, as the other readers were not as engaging, and their stories not as interesting. To me, Leo's story alone made this a fine book that got me laughing, crying and willing to listen again and again. Ms. Krauss is poetic, and Mr. Guidall captured her poetry with unusual sensitivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labor of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss' The History of Love is ingenious and precocious -- ingenious for its plotting, precocious for its fluent, page-turning style. But it hardly shows much to us beyond its own spectacular surface. And this is odd and disappointing, because it appears to be structured to allow a glimpse into something deep and mysterious. That is, this isn't a novel of character development; if anything, the characters are fully formed by the time Krauss gets to them, and they are used to spin the plotty tale. There is poignancy in the stories, and Krauss should be credited for not leading us to a too easy epiphany at the end. But ultimately, sentiment gives way to sentimenality. Hoping to illuminate the sinuous paths of love and affection, Krauss reverts to a winking knowingness. I concur with James Woods who, writing in The London Review of Books, says this novel infantilizes its readers. One feels manipulated by the entire mechanism -- a fully achieved writerly machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I could not get into the characters at all, so ended up not finishing the book. It was selected for our book club. Too esoteric for me - a complete waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...So what?!?!","review":"Here's what I got from this book, which really isn't all that much. Leo Gursky is a old man that is preoccupied by his own death. In his efforts to survive he makes a complete nuisance of himself in public. Sixty years ago, his life was not this pathetic. He wrote a book about the great love of his life and survived the Nazi invasion of Slonim, Poland. The book that he thought was lost or destroyed, mysteriously survives and is a huge part of Alma Singer's life.Fourteen -year-old Alma Singer has her hands full with feeling solely responsible for her mother's happiness after Alma's father's death and trying to takecare of her brother, Bird, who thinks he is the Messiah.Ms. Krauss explores the timeless themes of love and loss and the ties that bind, but for me thebook was very choppy, dry and for the most part, except for Alma's story, tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I disliked this book so much that I stopped reading it in the middle - something I almost never do. My son, who usually has the same taste as I do, recommended it, but I found it both confusing and dull at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this, very bittersweet","review":"Can't review it in depth without spoiling it.

Read it, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!!!","review":"I loved this book! It's sweet and funny and very human. The author has created characters that are so real you feel as if you've known them all your life. The story is captivating -- touching, moving, sad, hopeful, and hard to let go. It's not linear though, so practical types move on. But for the romantics among us, and for anyone who treasures the novel as a literary form, it's beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The History of Love","review":"In The History of Love, Nicole Krauss navigates the theme of loss through the characters Leo, a feisty octogenarian who refuses to become invisible by deliberately making a scene when he is out in public, and Alma, a tenacious teen who devotes her energies to assuaging her mother's loneliness. Leo and Alma use reading as a vehicle to connect them with those who they have lost, and they write in order to bridge the all-encompassing gap that exists between their desolate, loss-punctuated lives and the happiness bestowed by those that they love. In unexpected ways, it is their acts of reading and writing that resolve those losses. Unified by the processes of reading and writing that encircle them and ultimately, bring them closer and closer together until their climactic meeting at its conclusion.Sofia Sheth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative take on love that will leave you wanting more","review":"I have read all of Jonathan Safran Foer's work. When I finished his last book, I started to wonder what his wife's style was like. I picked up \\"History of Love\\" and found it is pretty darn similar! They write in almost identical styles using the same post-modern conventions. While I prefer Foer, Krauss brings her own charm to the literary world. The book is at times confusing. There are three separate narratives woven together, yet at times they are ambiguous. The details can be difficult to pin point. I am still struggling to piece it all together. As I read through the book, I found myself longing for the real \\"History of Love\\" that we only get snippets of in the novel. I think Krauss should go back and write the actual \\"History of Love\\" the characters continually refer to in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I'm an avid reader, but have never written a review. I felt compelled to do so for this book for the sake of other readers because it's one of the worst I've ever read. I'm sorry I even have to give it a 1-star rating. It's inconclusive, confusing, and wholly unsatisfying. I persevered, hoping it would come to something in the end, but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"i forced myself to finish it because i bought the book....","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers who emphasize the difficult to follow, convoluted style.

Unfortunately, it went all downhill from there. But for the strength of Leo, I would not have continued reading. This book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Likeable","review":"None of the glowing reviews for this novel is accurate.I found it confusing and utterly frustrating. Just when you think it can't get worse it becomes ok. And just when it becomes ok it gets worse and you think you have nothing left to look forward to. Well let me tell you, the ending is just as baffling as the rest of the book.There are a very few pages that will endear you to them, but worry not, it lasts not long. If you're VERY bored this is an ok book. It will pass your time at times. But as for recommending it, it could have been soooooooooo much better.It's true most of it is written in so many styles it will leave you confused. But I'm no critic, make your own decision. I just know I will not look for more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent and Beautiful","review":"This book as absolutly great. Its a novel that can appeal to many different people, not only women who enjoy a good romance on a rainy day. This book incorporates a number of different characters who all are all weaved together to show the beauty of love, lost and new, and the interconnectedness of the human race. I sincerely recommend this to those who would like a to read a fantastic book about love and family and hard times that try the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak ending to a very strong arc","review":"The narrative power of this exceptional book is stunning. How can it be that you find yourself laughing at pratfalls and Clouseau'esque pronouncements in the same page filled with grief so powerful that you had to pause to recover? In that context, I was disappointed with the ending which attempted a cleanup of all loose ends to create a moebius strip-like circular plot with a Hollywood-like neatness. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that, except the writing was not up to the task of keeping all the twists in place while maintaining the same naturalistic tone of the rest of the book.Nonetheless, a page turner.[Later edit] Ah, two revelations: One proceeds logically from the review above, the book has already been optioned as a movie. The second is pleasantly contextual, the author is married to one of the Foer brothers. The hermeneutic circle is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it again, Sam.","review":"I had to reread this book twice to understand the presence of Bruno and what revelations after the 2nd reading.It was our book club selection and Ms. Krauss would have blushed with pleasure over the depth of discussions this book took us last night. Majority of the women had read it twice. It didn't end there. We followed this book to email discussions the following day. It's this kind of a book with a complicated and incredible plot structure. I hurriedly purchased her next book \\"Great House.\\"Now if only my books would get rereads in one sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hated Book!","review":"After reading a recommendation for this book, I decided to check it out. I found it confusing and annoyingly quirky. The characters were all isolated loners. Very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved Leo, didn't get the point","review":"I loved the beginning of this book. Leo's story seemed to have so much substance ahead. I kept reading so that I could learn what The History of Love was. I didn't learn a thing! After the initial Leo segment, I was confused, bored and disappointed in the next few chapters. Once the mystery was solved, I guess the book got better but by then, the story was over. I thought it was a depressing look at life and love and I didn't get what the History of Love was at all from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Based on the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was hoping it was a classic on the scale of Henry Roth's \\"Call It Sleep.\\" But it was not. The story was bland, and the characters were flat. It was not well written. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book club discussion","review":"This book was hard to follow. Half the people in my book club thought one of the girls was a boy (the way the author wrote character). I would not recommend this book to anyone but a book club read. The reason for the book club reading this book is that the we all missed or found things that others didn't catch. So, it was a very lively book club but we basically all agreed (12 women) that we would not have finished the book if it wasn't our book club book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bay Area audiophile","review":"If you've never listened to books on tape, this is the book to start with. I have a 45-minute commute to and from work and this book has made me wish my commute was longer - believe it or not. The audio CD version is well worth the money. The actors are wonderful; the accents of Leo and Bruno take me back to an unknown time and place - have I been there before - have I known these people? No - but then why do I feel so nostalgic? It's the writer's beautiful, haunting prose and the actors' incredible talent that nearly lull me off the road. Try books on tape - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed but sometimes terrific","review":"This book reads like a short story that got expanded just to make it a book. The story of the old guy, Leo, is terrific in detail and longing and perspective. The rest reads like filler - clever filler, but still, the only voice I wanted to hear from was Leo's, and much of the rest is just irritating and so convoluted that it's hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Pick","review":"I had to order this book for the spring trimester of my English class. I was a little skeptical, thinking the \\"girl-seeks-love-for-her-mother\\" plot would most certainly end up in the clichéd ending of a happily ever after with the man of her dreams. Not only was I surprised to learn that the plotlines are entirely original, but that none of my predictions came true, and the outcome was one I would never have expected. The book is beautifully written, the stories jumping between protagonists, and time periods, journal entries and long-lost letters. The writting style is one I have never seen, and this book definitely deserves a spot on any favorites list. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and to my surprise I actually found it easy to participate in class discussions each day. Over all, a beautiful, moving book for anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound story of love and searching","review":"The History of Love is a powerful novel narrated by several of the characters. Their journeys, their quests for love and fulfillment, their views of the world, are woven together to create an irresistible web. It was a book that was easy to jump into and difficult to set down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth Reading...","review":"I read this book right on the heels of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close which, of course, was written by Krauss's husband, Foer. Perhaps that was a mistake. While I enjoyed The History of Love, I didn't feel that it was as refined or powerful as Foer's work. Some parts of the novel seem a bit to contrived and predictable. Still, I would rank it among the best books I have read recently. It is certainly worth the time and effort though, like others here, I don't think it is an easy or quick read. It takes a bit of effort, but in the end, the characters will capture your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic History","review":"Books rarely bring me to tears because of how beautifully written they are, but here is one for you to try. First: the language. Such voices in my head, I can't tell you. Second: the structure is gorgeous. I've often grown impatient with the common device of alternating between and among characters, but this time it works just perfectly.Finally, the truth. This writer knows people, evokes them with an unblinking eye for detail and tone. Rueful, strange, nearly blanketed with sadness at times, yet. So good.I didn't really expect to like this book much, but you know, the reviews were promising.And delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read me a story","review":"I bought the audio book of The history of Love because, after reading it myself.....I wanted to 'hear' it. The story is such a strange, long, flowing tale that sweeps you along with it....makes you think....and made me do some research about people and events held in the story....It's a good book that makes you want to do your homework rather than write a book review! And so, after reading it to myself,I wanted someone to read it TO me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Annoying Disappointment","review":"This book was a disappointment. It was overwritten, self consciously mannered and just plain annoying. The picture of old people was revolting-- too much bathroom minutia.

Oh, well-- each to his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get through it","review":"I tried to read this book because of all of the fabulous reviews that it has received, however I could not bring myself to finish. I lost interest and after a while gave up. My interest was piqued with the charachter of Leo but Alma, Bird and her mother left me cold and I couldn't have cared less what happened to them. I remember thinking let's get back to Leo, at least he is interesting but I couldn't push through any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers love it or hate it.........no middle ground","review":"The History of Love was a selection for a book group. It clearly split this group down the middle. Readers either loved it or found it boring.This is the narration of a man's life through war, love, loss and enlightenment. He discovers that a story he wrote for the woman he loved has been published by a younger man many years later. As he searches to remain a visible presence in the world, the elderly locksmith seeks out the truths that seemingly lock themselves out of his reach.There is also a very young woman looking to obtain information on who she has been named for.The tale entertwines itself in a way that makes it nearly burdensome.The people that loved it, loved it a lot and defended it vigorously."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANTED to love this book, just didn't!","review":"I started this book with such high hopes. I feel in love with Leo right away and was so excited to \\"enter\\" his life. The story for me, however, got confusing FAST. I couldn't follow what was what and who was who...

Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"If you like good writing, you don't want to miss this book. I wasn't hooked by the first few pages, but thank G_d, I picked it up again before returning it to the library. I loved all of the characters, especially Alma. Krauss's story manages to be both mundane and yet magical. It was probably the best book I read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to enjoy","review":"I read this book as a book club selection. I'm not sure I'd have ever picked it off the shelf without the club, but I'm glad I did. Nicole Krauss weaves a fascinating tale. Some of our book club members had a hard time following it. Just keep in mind that those funny little symbols at the beginning of each chapter represent a different character's voice and perspective. I found the characterization wonderful. Each voice so distinct I didn't need the symbols. The old man, Leo Gursky, so honest and candid and so lonely.

But, I am sorry, I did not think this book was worth my time. I got very frustrated with Krauss' writing (\\"And yet.\\", \\"But.\\"), I did not find a real mystery or climax, and did not perceive any sense of closure for any of the characters.On the other hand, if you want to read a good book about a book, please accept my recommendation of \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", a truly entertaining and beautifully written novel.

It's a bunch of boring and detailed rambling from characters that have really depressing lives (even includes accounts of their bowel movements). If this book has anything at all to do with love, our world is in a sad state. Also, I had no idea what all the jewish words meant. The crazy syntax to make it \\"artsy and original\\" just created MORE confusion, as if that's even possible.

The novel is very interesting the entire way through and I really expected it to build up to something big, but I felt the ending fell flat. The story is a puzzle, and the reader continues turning the pages to find out how all the pieces finally fit together, but then is left feeling unsatisfied. It seemed to me that the author focused on the complicated narrative structure rather than creating a meaningful story that touches the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent Hodgepodge","review":"The book got off to a real good start. The old man named Leo was interesting -- fascinating in fact -- and I was enjoying reading about him when -- whammo! -- the book turned topsy-turvey and I couldn't figure out what was happening or who was who. As one of the other reviewers noted, I kept wondering when we were going to get back to Leo. Somehow or other we got sidetracked into reading about some other people who weren't at all interesting and about a book within a book whose relevance to anything else was mystifying. I guess this is literature, huh? Anyhow, the author can string words together real well and her tales about Leon were, as I said, fascinating. But around page 100 I got tired of trying to figure out this maze of a book and tossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is still not illuminated","review":"I won't finish this book.

The plot was disjointed, jumping around character POV and writing styles. If a better plot was used then maybe the author may have been able to pull this off but in the scope of boring OLD john everyman this book was boring. Understanding without something like sparknotes is also a colossal challenge. When a read is mandatory I expect a well written piece of literature, not some half baked mockery of a book. I don't know why but instead of love, this book gave me intense hatred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once is more than enough","review":"I read this book for a book club. I have to say it was tough to get through. Like others have written, it was a bit confusing in spots, and very hard to keep track of the characters. I wasn't endeared to the main character very much, and the other main character, the girl, was a bit more intriguing at least. I just don't have a lot to say about it, I finished the book, said thank goodness after that and then I didn't think too much about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"\\"History of Love\\" is compelling story, told in a non-linear fashion, so the experience of reading the book resembles the experience of being in love.

The prose is remarkable and the story touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Prose, but a Little Confusing","review":"Some of the more lyrical passages in this novel are breathtaking, and the basic story line is an intriguing one. However, the plot twists and turns with flashbacks and different narrators that are difficult to keep track of at times. That said, it's one of very few novels that I KNOW I will reread someday. One piece of advice: it's best not to put the book aside for a few days, but rather read it straight through with only short breaks. Trying to recapture the story is challenging. It's not a light beach read, but perhaps a good read for a long, holiday air trip when you have no distractions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Own","review":"This is a book that I want for my \\"library\\". That's how much I liked it. It was Leo's first words that hooked me and from that point on I savored every other word until the end. It's beautifully written and the characters were endearing. I will say that at times I needed to go back and re-read excerpts to make sure I had things straight. It can get a bit confusing...or maybe that's what the author intended. This is a book to read and re-read anyhow, so I just got a head start!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and Confused","review":"A friend from work gave me this book with the highest recommendation! If a book is good, we pass it around to our little group. I found it very difficult to follow along and without giving anything away, I want to say that I really liked the characters BUT at the end of the book I had no idea what happened. I could make no sense out of the book and i had to go around asking other people that read the book to explain it to me. Since i'm not the only one this happened to (quite a few other people had the same experience)I just wanted to make the average reader be aware that you may have to read it twice to figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion Reigns","review":"Confusion was the overwhelming reaction to our book club's reading of A History of Love. As a result, our discussion was a series of explanations about who was who rather than the themes, characterization, etc. of the novel. One of the members felt it necessary to read the novel twice and took notes in order to make sense of the plot and the characters.On the positive side, several of the characters were engaging - namely, Leo, Alma and Bird. Leo's circumstances made us sympathetic to him as he fought to remain visible in the world. Alma and Bird's struggles to grow and mature as they were overwhelmed by their mother's grief were causes of sadness to us.We decided that the author was attempting to remind readers of the Holocaust so that we would \\"never forget.\\" However, requiring readers to jump from Nazi Poland to New York City to Chile while keeping track of each character's relationship to Leo Gursky obscures the theme and lessens the impact of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, but","review":"The writing in this book was wonderful, I wish I could turn a phrase as well. But the loneliness of Leo was almost more than I could bear. The scenes he created in public so as not to be invisible, which many reviewers found funny, were some of the saddest scenes I have read in a novel.I guess I really liked the writing, but wish I could have enjoyed the story more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book changed my life. It made me look at things in a way I hadn't before. I admire Nicole Krauss for her ability to master point-of-view changes.

After discussing it with five other people, I have a better sense of what the author was trying to do, but the first reading was rather confusing.The author is not only trying to juggle the perspectives of the two main characters, she also tosses in the perspectives of some of the minor characters. This forces her to jump through space and time creating a rather incongruous mess. I am generally good at puzzles, but even I could not see how she was going to weave it all together at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful language but disjointed","review":"Story lines were disjointed and hard to follow.

I tried to \\"get into\\" the (creative?) mix of styles, disparate story lines, and quirky characters, but I just couldn't. When I got to the end, I was absolutely baffled. Not only was the book confusing, but when I actually step back and look at the plot, it is just NOT GOOD. There are so many good books out there! Honestly, I read this book based on the editorial reviews all over the front & back covers. I am not going to make that mistake again. I am so mad that I wasted my time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"From the reviews and Amazon selection, this book appears to have appealed to literary types. I am someone who often hates what the critics find appealing (the movie The English Patient as a prime example!). I judge books and movies soley on enjoyment, not on its \\"literary value\\" whatever that is. If you are a typical reader like me, simply looking for an engaging story, don't waste your time.This story is a mish-mash of chapters from different points of view, with almost no information that assists you to tie them together. The transitions from one narrator to the other are disjointed and abrupt, and none of the characters were likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The History of Love","review":"Read this for my book club. Found it slow and boring and confusing--I couldn't wait to finish. Found the style of writing difficult to follow. I found myself having to flip back a page or two to re-read and refresh my memory.

Good reading shouldn't be this hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"feh","review":"I hate books about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds aimed at upper middle class New Yorker-reading women. Krauss wrote this book with one eye on the casting for the movie, which, if made, will star oh maybe Hallie Steinfeld and Robert Duvall, in what critics will call a stretch role, will garner luminous praise from the usual suspects,make 30 domestic,and be forgotten with the rest. If you want to read a true masterpiece about the psychic costs of the Holocaust, try The Pawnbroker, by Edward Lewis Wallant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe history isn't my subject...","review":"I am sincerely surprised by the amount of positive acclaim for this book.

And after it was all said and done, I felt like I had wasted my time. Just not an interesting story - pass on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safran Foer's Wife Can Hold Her Own","review":"With The History of Love, Nicole Krauss proves she is as fine a writer as her husband, Jonathan Safran Foer. Writen from the perspective of multiple characters, Krauss delves into (all too familiar) histories of love and loss. The novel is emotionally captivating, down to the last sentence. The only disappoinment lies in the narrative voice, which is stikingly similar to her husband's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure","review":"I think that the literary analysis of this book has been adequately covered here; this review is purely personal.The History of Love is moving, thoughtful, beautifully written.

The wait is arduous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The History of Love","review":"I was given the book as a gift by my boyfriend. It's a beautiful story and I highly recommend it. The reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because there are times that you need to flip back to connect certain people and time periods that are mentioned so much later in the book. This is due to the fact that it is three separate stories written so you follow each every 3rd Chapter. But the stories do eventually entwine. It's best to read the whole book in one sitting, but I didn't have the time for that, thus the necessity of flipping back and forth to make sure I was connecting the right people and places as the stories unfolded."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting and sad","review":"This was a book club choice that I probably wouldn't have otherwise read. Yet, I'm glad I did. The characters are poignant and believable. An old man has been robbed of what should have been his life by World War II which claimed his friends, family, and chance at love. At the same time a young girl, is just beginning to understand love. There is a note of optimism to the beautifully sad story. This is an enjoyable read that will keep you interested to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a review for the audio version","review":"I stopped reading during the third disc (about 1/4 of the way through the book) for two reasons: 1) mainly because I had ZERO interest in what happened to the annoyingly precocious Alma and 2) the voice of the person who was reading about Alma was as irritating as fingers on a blackboard. The first section -- from Leo's quirky perspective -- was charming and endearing. That narration was performed by the always superb George Guidall. Once he became silent, the book lost its oomph. Two stars for that brief visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly overrated!","review":"I feel that the writing is so disjointed to the point of distraction.

Not to mention, the story as a whole is really a compilation of six 30-page expositional short stories loosely tied together by an additional 100 pages of story set in the \\"present\\". The author also overly uses sex and descriptive references to human fluids in what feels like a contrived attempt to lend interest to the story. It was only through pure will that I made it through this book (and the fact that behind all the garbage, the background ideas are quite interesting). For those looking for an interesting jaunt through sci-fi check out some works by Orson Scott Card, David Brin, William Gibson, or Robert Heinlen. This book just isn't worth the time, IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"The most important rule in Science Fiction for an author is to work the technology and sociology seemlessly into the story as quickly as possible so that the reader can understand everything as the book unfolds. Simmons does not do this. Instead, he writes a very confusing group of independent stories with confusing explanations of the structure of his world. And, as a final blow to the reader, he does not even finish the story. It is one thing to write a novel with the idea of a sequel (as Orson Scott Card does with his Ender series). It is quite another thing to drop the reader into the \\"valley\\" with his characters and not even offering some conclusion. Adding to this unfortunate ending is the fact that his characters are annoying and do not create a reason for the reader to care about them. I am reading the sequel only to find out what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck did I just read?","review":"Let me start by saying that I have have read and absolutely loved seven other Dan Simmons novels. My expectations were high given that I have enjoyed the aforementionerd novels, I love SF and that this was an award winning novel. For the life of me I cannot figure out why this won anything. In lieu of a story, more than 50% of the text is concerned with descriptions. Endless descriptions. In addition, it is a confusing mess of terms and places invented for this universe. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Violates \\"Truth in Advertising.\\" It would have been a better book if they just titled it, \\"A Collection of Short Stories About Hyperion\\" rather than pretending it was a coherent novel. Individually the stories are okay and I kept waiting for the payoff that would tie them together and bring the \\"novel\\" to a climax, but there is neither a payoff nor a climax. There is no ending to speak of. It was like the author got tired of writing, so he just quit. And what the heck ever happened to Het Masteen? The guy just disappeared from the story and was left hanging, but it was nothing unusual since everything else was left hanging. No, I can't figure out why other people gave this a high rating. There are lots of good novels out there, but this is not one. This is the second time I've been burned on a \\"Hugo Award\\" winner, the other one was \\"A Deepness in the Sky,\\" which was just a snore. That's the last \\"Hugo Award\\" winner I'm going to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"horror of a fevered mind","review":"Perhaps I simply have never encountered this type of writing before - so dark and filled with unending images of disgust and horror. The writer is a compelling writer but I'm half way through the book and don't think I can take a moment more in such a hideous imagination. I hope some innocent and healing hand touches this fevered mind and lifts it into some kind of peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality story telling, a MUST READ","review":"It has been a very, very long time since I have been able to recommend a sci-fi book to my friends. Hyperion has not only been recommended, but I'm being thanked for letting them know such an amazing book exists. The mixture of Canterbury Tales, Keats poetry and sci-fi worked so well that I found myself reading nonstop. Fortunately I purchased the Fall of Hyperion at the same time so I was able to keep reading. The author clearly understands the struggle people go through to find meaning from their respective religions and meaning in their lives. It is so seldom that an author comes up with a new idea and then crafts a well written story that expresses that idea in a detailed, thoughtful manner. I would give this book more than 5 stars if that were an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abrupt End","review":"A thought about the \\"unfinished\\" nature of Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion. . .Keats' poems by the same names were also unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fiction work yet written in any genre","review":"For those who have already read it, \\"Hyperion is Cantos\\". For the rest of you:Hyperion is full of awe-inspiring concepts, brilliantly rich and real characters, flawless historical and technical accuracy cunningly woven together with broad-ranging philosophy... I could go on. Suffice to write, I have read only three books more than once...this I have read four times. Please read this book! In centuries to come it will be seen as one of the literary acheivements of this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A universe which is more real than reality!","review":"Rarely, a writer manages to create a universe and characters which are so completely realized, so intensely involving, and so compelling, that it can be hard, after reading about them, to segue back to reality. Dan Simmons has managed to do just that. While alluding to Keats and Chaucer, among other literary giants, he works on so many levels that the reader becomes lost in the world he creates, a fascinating world which I, for one, found hard to leave. This book works on an intellectual level as a commentary on religion, as well as on a simple adventure level. I have read a lot, and I can easily say this is my favorite book. Read the whole tetralogy - it is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely engrossing!","review":"How I, after reading scifi for more than 25 years, have missed out on the Hyperion series - is beyond me. The story and the universe Simmons describes is just that slightly \\"off\\" compared to other novels Ive read - that I was completely engrossed reading both these and the other Hyperion novels - wanting to find out what was really happening with the Shrike and all.This is a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was amazing.","review":"This book was simply amazing. I ranked it 5 stars and it deserves every one of them. The only downside, if it is one, is that it's written at a high level. This isn't your average 8th grade level pulp science fiction. This was written by a serious author for serious readers but trust me when I tell you that it's worth the tad bit of extra effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best SciFi books I have read","review":"The way the mystery around Hyperion is developed along the book makes you want to stay awaken the whole night. Every character in the history carries a bit of the solution for the whole puzzle. Personally I loved the histories of Martin Silenus and M. Brawnie.Totally recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars until the end.","review":"I loved the way this book flowed all the way until the end. When I read the end I was left with a feeling of \\"what the?\\" It was so bland. It was as if someone else wrote the end of the book. I know that Hyperion is only one piece of the two book puzzle but come on... a Wizard of Oz reference. Really?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD !!!","review":"This story has everything a reader could ever want, realistic characters, amazing worlds, an enveloping plot, morethings than I could possibly think to list here. From the beginning of Hyperion to the end of Rise of Endymion this story explores things I would neverhave dreamed of. This and all the otherbooks in the Hyperion Cantos are a must read for any sci-fi fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best books made. Ever.","review":"I've read what most people call classics. The Tolkien series. 2001: A Space Oddessy, along with the stories that followed. But, Dan Simmons's Hyperion, along with the following Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and The Rise of Endymion, blow every other book away. From the start of Hyperion to the end of The Rise of Endymion, this series will not let you stop reading. These books are magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"One of the most fascinating series. I can read and re-read these books again and again, always discovering something new. Epic, and very well thought through."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First 5 Star Review Ever!","review":"Hyperion and it's sequel The Fall of Hyperion are masterpieces of science fiction storytelling. What a treat to encounter the far future universe Dan Simmons has created for us. What sets Hyperion apart from so very many sci-fi sagas are the characters. Far too many authors have great stories to tell but fail to develop anything but paper thin one-dimensional caricatures... Not so in the Hegemony of Man. The poet Martin Silenus is as prickly of a smart-ass as you'd ever meet in any timeline. Sol and Rachel's story is as touching as anything you'll ever read. I particularly liked the wit and humor of Ummon the AI personality of the TechnoCore.No need to go into storyline detail that previous reviewers have so ably outlined for you - other than to say that Simmons doesn't make an unecessary mockery of religion and faith like so many futurists do. There was nothing \\"preachy\\" (pardon the pun) in his approach to the religion angle in this epic. Three Cheers for Hyperion!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hyperion- Great SF","review":"Hyperion by Dan Simmons. Hugo award winning novel (1990) with a brutal cliffhanger ending. Very cool picture of the universe and the \\"hegemony of man\\" in the future. If you liked the Vernor Vinge books you will like this... it unfolds similar to the Canterbury Tales... with 6 travelers sharing their tales to the group while on a pilgrimage. The Hegemony is a \\"web\\" of worlds connected by farcasters(teleportation devices). There is a troubling technological over structure called the \\"techno-core\\" which is populated by AI constructs that seceded from the Hegemony and serve as the technological framework of the government and economy for their own, unknown, reasons. There are mysterious constructs on the world Hyperion called the Shrike (apparently a creature that brings only death) and the empty \\"Time Tombs\\" that are both moving BACKWARDS in time for unknown reasons as well.I finished it last night and now need to get the sequel (Fall of Hyperion) because of how it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VERY BEST","review":"If I had to choose one book to read for the rest of my life, it would be the bible. But this would be my second choice, cant wait for Mr. Simmons next Sci-fi work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"Mr. Simmons has created a truly unique story. 6 pilgrims relate their stories on a journey to see the Lord of Pain, the legendary Shrike. Vivid insights into the personalities of the characters (such as the ancient Steinway piano in the consul's ship) and a very believable view of the future make this book a masterpiece. It is the kind of book which you have to put down every now and then to catch your breath (but not for long!). I finished it terrified, horrified, and craving more! The Shrike is the most intriguing and horrifying...well...thing. And the stories catch your imagination so that you are actually living and feeling along with the characters. This story is so different from much of the fluff that's out there nowadays (David Eddings stuff) and is truly memorable. (I found the Priest's story the most horrible and the most wonderful...imagine...seven years!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I read this book as part of list of the top 100 Science Fiction books of all time. While it is good, I was not overly impressed. I found books like Dune, Ender's Game, The Red/Blue/Green Mars series better. But it is a good beach read."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing, well-crafted novel","review":"this is a very clever bit of fiction - it develops a new, future world, and drops the reader into the middle of it. Then twists the story between a range of different characters. It can take a while to fall into the story because of this swapping in and out - but twisting the different ends together is quite fascinating. It's worth knowing that you really have to read this one with the sequel - Fall of Hyperion - otherwise you're just left in the middle of the plot. And I, for one, found the ultimate ending slightly bewildering and rather unsatisfying - a pity given the work and detail that went in to the books ahead of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Put in to Words.","review":"I've read the entire Hyperion/Endymion saga. All of the reviews on Amazon.com here do much of it justice. I'm not here to add yet more about what many people have already said about it... they probably did it better than I could have. I just want to say that it is very rare that a book can move me to tears, Hyperion for one, and the Rise of Endymion for another BOTH did that. Weintraub's tale is worth it for the emotional impact alone... as are all the tales in their own right.Short and Simple: This series will be remembered for as long as there is literature. To not read it is to deny yourself one of the truely sublime experiences of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and well-written!","review":"What a GREAT novel - leaves the reader yearning for the sequel (which is equally EXCELLENT).

The only other novels I have read that much is Dune by Frank Herbert. If you are a fan of sci-fi, it doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Reading Fun Book","review":"This is part of a two book series. The book is complex in story line, and plot. Sometimes I got lost in the characterization, but found it as the book move forward. This book was actually a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything under the sun and then some.","review":"This is easily a 4-1/2 to 5 star book. I read it back when it originally came out and I enjoyed every bit as much today. Complex but enjoyable. It hits so many different types of stories. Each pilgrim's story is completely different from the others. It may be a bit difficult going if you have not immersed yourself in SF, but part of the fun it how many different concepts are thrown out there for you to try to catch. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some nice ideas","review":"I agree with some of the other criticism of this novel - that the style appears to be very much in imitation of early Asimov and Clarke. That's not necessarily a bad thing, if that's the kind of Sci-Fi you like, and I do.What struck me most about this was the ideas presented. Some were fleshed out a little more than others, and I expect that some of those which were a little thin will be more fully explored in the sequel \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" (not read it yet, but it's on the list).There are enough characters that everyone should find at least one to relate to, perhaps not at first, but certainly after their personal tale is told.The ending was a little abrupt for my tastes. I had assumed that this was a standalone, but luckily I am already in possession of the sequel. There are sufficient unresolved issues to ensure that I'm looking forward to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendously creative and fun to read piece of sci-fi","review":"The most impressive trait of this book is how its form corresponds with the content. Each part of the story is written in a different style, reflecting its respective characters. In fact, in Hyperion you get several different sci-fi books, albeit set within the same plot. It's really fascinating, and the ease and flexibility of the author is extraordinary. Other aspects, such as the story itself, the characters and especially the landscapes are also amazing, albeit on par with other good sci-fi books I've read. What distinguishes Hyperion most importantly is the literary (at times: poetic) skill of Dan Simmons. One of the best sci-fi books I've read, topped probably only by Use of Weapons by Iain M. Banks (which, coincidentally, is as interesting in terms of form, although in a totally different manner). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars (plus 10 more if I could)","review":"No one is going to find this review helpful, but I HAD to put my 5 stars down.....because this book was absolutely incredible. All I will say is that after reading Hyperion, I bought all 3 other books on my next trip to the bookstore....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"I picked up this book based on the suggestion of a friend and a lot of critics reviews calling this one of the best sci-fi novels.Well, I would not call it exactly a disappointment, but it was definitively not up to my expectations. The author seems to be trying too hard to define a future world, and is constantly forcibly drawing parallels between his future situations/devices/event with real life. The use of alternative language for \\"every day\\" things is sometimes inspired (e.g. \\"entropic tides\\", \\"farcasters\\"), but most of the times they feel gimmicky and almost tacky (e.g. \\"death wand\\"). The HYPERION universe and mythology is not as rich and nuanced as, for example, DUNE.The sub-stories, which are really the core of this book are entertaining in a pulp fiction way, but, IMO not significant (socially, or even within the context of HYPERION itself; see DECAMERON), or even memorable enough to make this book a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"The detailed, unique universal construct makes this novel shine. Yet, all that luscious background cannot hide the weakness of the story. Or I suppose I should say \\"stories.\\"This is Sci-fi Canterbury Tales. The entire novel reveals the history of the 7 characters chosen for this specific mission. The individual stories are good enough, but after the fourth, I found myself skimming. It's too unrelated. Too eclectic.And then comes the end ... rushed, abbreviated, truncated, and nonsensical. All this sound and fury leading to nothing. Huge disappointment. And in some ways, a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! The Shrike!","review":"After slogging through six or seven-hundred pages of a story with characters I didn't feel much sympathy for, I expected some kind of payoff and didn't get any. Just the promise of a six or seven-hundred page sequel with no promise of Shrike-like closure. Maybe I shouldn't judge the story from the standpoint of what I wanted out of it. But you know what? Life, as any Shrike will tell you, is way too short, my brothers and sisters. Leave Hyperion where it orbits - in the dusty recess at remote edge of the universe. You'll save a couple of light years of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done.","review":"It's like Peter F Hamilton meets Keats in a sci-fi fantasy setting. I enjoyed this book. Just the right pace, reminding me a lot of Pandora's Star, but with less world-building and more dive-in-and be confused prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it despite the ending","review":"I really liked the frame story structure, though some of the stories were hard to get through. I found the Poet's Tale particularly annoying, though I suspect it was the author's intent for you to dislike Martin Silenus. The story of Sol and Rachel was very moving and for me was the highlight of the book.One complaint I have is the book does not stand on its own. Make sure you have a copy of The Fall of Hyperion on hand when you finish this one.Some other minor complaints are the use of colloquialisms from the present era. The Ousters could have used a more thorough introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable crap...","review":"The story is a sequence of stories told by pilgrims on their way to a shrine, much like the Canterbury Tales. Except in this one, the characters are neither interesting or likeable. The time-traveling notions in play at the shrine and in some of the stories are silly and poorly thought out. Any attempt to wade through the morass of disconnected junk that makes up this novel is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sullied talent","review":"Mr. Simmons writes well and his story is powerful.

However, this book had literally 0 plot. The entire story is a background of seven different characters, telling why they are on the planet Hyperion, and why they want to meet the mysterious creature the Shrike. The book climaxes to the night before the meeting of the shrike....and then simply ends. It was a pathetic end to a pointless book. If youre thinking about buying this book, think again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got about 6 pages into it. That was more than enough.","review":"Thankfully, I wasted only a very brief part of my life with this horribly pretentious book. I should have known right on the first page -- any sci-fi novel that starts off with a reference to an obscure piece of classical music is a deal breaker right there.From the get-go, there was too much of Simmons's overwrought style and self-indulgent jargon. I got about as far as this bit of prose-fapping:\\"If the fleet did construct a farcaster in time and the Hegemony committed the total resources of FORCE to defending a single, distant, colonial world of Hyperion, the Worldweb ran the terrible risk of suffering an Ouster attack on the elsewhere...Before I said \\"WHAT?! The hell with this!\\" And resisted the urge to farcast the book into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profane, Vulgar, and Indecent","review":"What a disappointment Hyperion was. After reading all the hype about the book, I was excited to read it. I only wish someone had written something about the muck one has to wade through to get to the story. This book is profane, vulgar, and indecent. It reminded me of third grade when certain kids learned crude words and tried to use them as often as possible. I threw the book into the trash can with the rest of the garbage before I could finish it. I will not recommend Hyperion to anyone, young or old."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked it, you need a drool cup.","review":"One of the worst books ever written. The sequel is another. Fluff for the easily impressed. If you are completely taken in by verbose drivel and pseudo-intellectualism, this book and it's sequels are for you. I would have rated it a \\"1\\", but the words were spelled correctly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperion hyperion hyperion","review":"This book is well written and fairly readable, but overall reading experience will be much less than the sum of the parts. The book is composed of pieces that knit nicely together, but the actual story does not work. Mostly this is because the ending is as well thought as \\"then I woke up\\"I don't know why this book has won an award for anything.. Perhaps the author wants the reader to buy the rest of the story in an other book, but as for me.. I will leave Dan Simmons alone from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting in parts...but a real struggle to finish","review":"Really a collection of short stories though they are all related to the central story. Ultimately I think it had a rather boring non-ending. Maybe the end was supposed to be this big twist/surprise but it fell kind of flat to me.Don't see how this has gotten such a great reviews, I won't be reading any of the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book is a collection of several stories of varying quality.Overall, I found the writing style to be too wordy. I would rather be entertained by ideas than an unusual use of words.While I did enjoy a couple of the stories, two others left me completely indifferent - if not annoyed at having to read them.The overall story was intriguing enough that it kept me reading to the end. A secondary benefit I was hoping for, was reading about one particularly annoying character's death. Unfortunately, the ending has let me down on both accounts. Not only did the annoying character survive, but there was also nothing even remotely resembling a conclusion.Two stars - for the two stories I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read almost the entire book before I realized I was BORED.. It had some nice ideas, but I just couldn't continue anymore. I'm suprised it has so many positive reviews on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away","review":"Tell me, do you want a good book? I know I do. So, if youare interested, pick up _Hyperion_ and read it. It will blowyou away. Trust me, or don't, but read it anyway. You'llbe glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classical storyline overlaid with outstanding Sci-Fi","review":"Having heard nothing of this series I bought this book while browsing at a bookstore. ( A real bookstore... gasp!) I was immediately captivated by the intriguing blend of classical literature (Canterbury Tales) and Sci-Fi. The tales of each of the pilgrims keeps the book fresh, and the point of view unique. This type of story-telling also allows the reader to use his/her imagination and intellect to piece together the history and core concepts of Simmon's detailed future. I loved the blend of religion, technology, warfare and politics as well as the author's contribution of futuristic \\"gadgets and monsters.\\" An excellent read, and a MUST for any well read Science Fiction Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories","review":"I really enjoyed this book, even though I do not find the subject of human pain and suffering particularly interesting. For one thing, Simmon's narrative is very good! I wasn't annoyed by the lack of a specific ending. After all, the stories are perfectly good by and in themselves. I'd recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel Hullaballu","review":"The book is great. Read it. The reality of the today's modern publishing arena is that the publishers like serial books. Writing and publishing are profit endeavors. My guess is that Simmons would have loved to write the whole series in one book, but face it, thats not practical on any level. (BTW, those of you that have the true first edition, only about 2000 published, its worth about $400.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simmons is the Wizard","review":"... a beautiful and exquisite melange of ideas and haunting images poetically evoked by a truly gifted writer. The strkingly original ideas and visual grandeur will sweep you along, and Simmons keeps you emotionally invested until the very end--when you are left breathless. I promise you will learn something important about yourself in these works. (That's why he's the Wizard)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, Epic Sci-Fi","review":"Although not a book for everyone, if you like a mix epic sci-fi, a little literary prose, and some good old fashioned Star Wars-like plotting, you will love this book.I read Hyperion back when it was released, and recently came back to re-read it and complete the series with Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion. Simmons creates a world that one can easily be lost in--I read nothing else until I had completed the whole series. He must have had a blast creating it!!!This is not your average dungeons and dragons style sci-fi/fantasy. Simmons gives us a world that is all too real, and a future that is all too possible. A beautiful book, and series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sci-Fi Book that I have ever read. (no spoilers in this review)","review":"I would like to highly recommend this book for anyone with any imagination that likes science fiction or just loves books in general. This is one of the best books I have ever read from any genre. All 6 travelers tales are very intriguing, especially the Consuls, it was my favorite, and the Shrike is truly a horror/mystery of mythical proportions. I absolutely cannot wait to read The Fall of Hyperion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Science Fiction, Marred by Adult Content","review":"Hyperion ranks among the best science fiction books I have ever read. It is written to be similar to The Canterbury Tales, I suspect, and it does a fantastic job establishing the universe of the book with every story told. The way it slowly reveals more and more about the situation regarding the Shrike and Hegemony society in general is masterfully written, and the story about Rachel’s Merlin sickness actually had me in tears. While some of the more adult parts of the book felt tacked-on and unnecessary, it was an enjoyable book, and I plan on reading the sequel.I would recommend this to any fan of epic tales and science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining, I Thoroughly Enjoyed It.","review":"I am a pretty discerning reader. I mainly read classics, but I can enjoy a good Stephen King novel as well.I haven't read much science fiction, just the greatest-hits like \\"Dune\\". But as far as I am concerned, this is the most entertaining science fiction book I have read. The stories are great, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic sci-fi","review":"If you reached this review you will already know the overall concept of this book. Six travellers from different worlds come together, each with their own hopes of redemption and understanding and each with the common goal to reach a mysterious place that seems to defy the laws of physics as we know them.This is only the first book in Dan Simmons epic science fiction masterpiece that consists of 4 books: Hyperion, The fall of Hyperion, Endymion, The rise of Endymion. Personally I was not satisfied to read only one book, but have read them all twice. The universe created by Simmons is complex and captivating as are the people inhabiting it. I think of these books as the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" of Sci-Fi. An amazing adventure in all it's complexity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to start, satisfying to finish.","review":"I loaded and unloaded this book a few times during the first 150ish pages, but then it grabbed me and off we went. Epic SciFi at close to it's finest. FYI - The \\"Scan to E-Book\\" conversion is absolutely ridiculous. Update and re-release it please... Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST","review":"The best Sci-Fi ever, the whole series (Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, The Rise of Endymion). The characters, the plot and the intensity make it a must read not just for Sci-Fi buffs but for any Fiction reader. Dan Simmons has as big of a surprise in the end as did Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. This series touches on all aspects of humanity in seven characters lifetimes through a plethora of worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to recommend to non-SF readers","review":"I've loved Hyperion for years. As a librarian, I recommend it highly to any (adult, not teen) reader who wants an introduction to the SF genre. This book, written as a string of long narratives by six different characters, represents some of SF's best themes: life after death, messianic figures, interstellar warfare, time travel, interplanetary colonization, strange alien encounters, cyberpunk. It even crosses genres with the detective's story. The characters are all well-fleshed out and thoroughly engaging, even if they're not all entirely likeable. I thought Fall Of Hyperion was just as good and a definite must-read for anyone who liked Hyperion. The two Endymion books fell a little flat and I don't usually recommend those unless I have a hard-core Simmons reader in front of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining","review":"I found Dan Simmon's Hyperion to be an entertaining, thought-provoking and compelling novel. The stories of each of the pilgrims were masterpieces of short fiction in their own right. Although I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan, I give it 4, rather than 5, stars as I found Simmons' writing to be at times over-descriptive and somehow lacking the true can-put-it-down momentum of a master storyteller. Although I am one to appreciate some ambiguity at the end of a novel, I felt like after all the build-up, Simmons owed us more at the end of the story than the obvious compulsion to turn to the next book in the series. With the right ending, I would have been left thinking about the many great themes in the work. Instead, I just found myself feeling empty and disappointed. Nonetheless, I certainly look forward to continuing this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant prologue to Fall","review":"While I read this book I kept asking myself, when does the story start? Hyperion is the story of a group of pilgrims adventuring to the mystical Time Tombs. Every night another of them would tell the story of why they were there. This is a great premise, but not as a whole book. I found myself completely uninterested in the few smatterings of story between their tales. I found myself sometimes even skipping to the next persons story due to sheer boredom.While this book suffers as a standalone, it really shines as a 500 page proloque to Fall of Hyperion. Under normal situations I would have stopped with this series but a family member said that I should read Fall, even if just to understand. When read in succession, these two books have an amazing synergy that never ceases to amaze me. So if you plan to read this book, you'll want the other, so that you can dive into it ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable ideas in this book","review":"What a great book. I've read many SF books, but I can ensure you that some of the ideas in this will follow you for the rest of your life:I'm from Spain and don't know the english translation, but the more impressive ideas were for me: the Shrike (alcaudón), \\"el arbol de espinas\\", \\"el cruciforme\\", the consul, \\"la enfermedad de merlin\\", \\"las catacumbas\\" with his piles of dead people...I'm sure never will forget these histories. You must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining...i recommend it","review":"I was brousing when by accident i happened on this book...rare to find only good reviews...so i bought it(at a second hand store...sorry amazon)this book is so well written,it covers the experience of a number of characters,from their meeting with each other to each character's recollections of circumstances that led up to their meeting...though it is a good book i have to assume you have to get the fall of hyperion to reach the story's climax...too bad...but i really want to know what happens so i'll bite...(i might even buy it from amazon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was really good","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever resd. It rivals the Ender's Game series and the Dune series for supremecy in the sci-fi realm. The only thing I dindn't like about this book was some of the stolen language, like Hegemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Fabulous novel. One even the literary snob types might like, given the structure and all the Keats work.The novel has a Canterbury Tales type feel, as a group of men and women travelling to the important planet Hyperion tell their stories.Travel is instantaneous throughout the galaxy thanks to the TechnoCore, an AI group and their farcaster technology. People can literally have different rooms of their houses on different planets.Hyperion is the site of the Time Tombs, an artifact travelling back in time, sent by an unknown entity.The planet will be the site of an attack by a rogue group of far travelling humanity called the Ousters, upon the stay at homes, unflatteringly terming themselves the Hegemony.The travelling band must also deal with The Shrike, a monstrous avatar of pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"A pretty good book, but doesn't quite live up to the hype. The book is really just 6 tales by 6 strangers on a \\"pilgrimage\\" about what led each one of them to Hyperion. I was a bit disappointed that nothing actually happens ON Hyperion, all we find out is why the pilgrims are there, not what happens next (presumably that is in the sequel). Allegedly this book is a \\"Sci-Fi Canterbury Tales\\", but I do not remember much about the Canterbury Tales myself (read them 15 years ago or so). What was most frustrating and the reason I will read the sequel is some interesting hints of an AI \\"race\\" that may be done with humans and want to destroy them as well as the mystery of the pilgrimage itself to the \\"Time Tombs\\" which are structures travelling backwards through time (which are possibly tied to the AIs, who knows?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"English does not have the appropriate adjectives...","review":"Every aspect of this book - the absolutely realistic character development, the description you feel in your guts, the imaginative and fully-developed plot, the exceptional dialogue - is like a drug. You will not think of the genre the same way after reading Hyperion (too much of it will seem like drivel). A friend told me about it three years before I actually read it, and I regret not rushing out to get it the moment I heard the title cross his lips. This is one of those rare books that defies description. It transcends the ink on the page and becomes a cohesive, truly beautiful work of literature. It challenges one to think about some of the assumptions we live by. The 'Father's Tale' was one of the most moving and powerful pieces of writing I have ever read. Please, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch","review":"One of the best series of all times; rankswith Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. Thecharacters are believable, the dialog engaging,and the story is fascinating and will suck you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperion Cantos","review":"I am an inveterate Sci-Fi reader and usually wade through even a poorly written book to see if there aren't some redeeming qualities. I didn't finish this one. The plot and characters could have been written by a computer program. Always take a book review as from someone who doesn't necessarily share your tastes, however, if you were a friend, I would advise you to spend your reading dollar elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"D Simmons creates an interesting universe and the Canterbury Tales device works well. But the pretentious smugness of this book made it infuriating to read. Another reviewer had it spot-on when he said, \\"the characters are present day Americans dressed up as denizens of the future\\". There are just too, too many references to 19th and 20th century America to be believable. Shotguns, garden hoses...The Wizard of Oz? How would any of these characters know anything about such things?Maybe the Babylon 5 fans like such overwrought pap. I am astonished this won the Hugo award. The number of 5 star reviews here sadden me. Have they never read a decent book before? One in which the author doesn't club you over the head with his \\"wealth of literary knowledge\\"?There was something good here, but it was smothered its own smugness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asimov reincarnate? Please.","review":"I inhale sci fi; the Foundation Series and Robot series are some of my favorite books of all time. Starship Troopers is another winner in my book. I read this tale with great anticipation--And found myself bewildered and let down.Confusingly told, badly written, poorly conceived- there's not a lot this book has going for it. As an outline, maybe; as a novel(ette), no way.Also one of the most anticlimactic books I've ever had the misfortune to delve into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious twaddle","review":"I am astounded by the hysteria that surrounds this novel and its sequel. Quick frankly, I can't find a good thing about it. It is overwritten. It logically makes no sense whatsoever. John Keats, fine poet as he was, is hardly an apt figure for the ultimate savior of mankind. The science--ranging from tree ships to a super-Internet that be both (a) intelligent and (b) a transportation network (\\"It's a floor wax! It's a dessert topping!!\\") is worse than embarressing. I literally forced myself though both volumes, with a \\"this can't get any worse\\" attitude--and it did. Be warned. If you like, say, the Charles Sheffield / Arthur Clarke / Isaac Asimov end of the spectrum, you will hate this. If you like fantasy and have no sense of logic, you might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"How does an author who cannot even write convincing dialog manage to win the Hugo? Don't ask me. The worst is the character Silenus, a crazy poet, who speaks like someone straight out of a B sci-fi movie. A couple of the stories are actually interesting but if you're into \\"hard\\" science fiction, don't even consider this book. Simmons is heavy on the speculative but low on scientific content. He should stick to writing horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather be sailing","review":"A lesson really, that all the fancy awards and 5-star ratings simply do not mean much in some cases. Hyperion is one of these cases, while its universe is described adequately and it has some ok ideas. Other (ideas) are not so original, such as guys in body hugging skin suits, running around, making inhuman leaps and decapitating people (hello Paul!) ..or the poor AI seeking freedom for itself. It is quite thick though, so hey, you can use it as a monitor stand or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very original","review":"This book got such great reviews, I was expecting a lot more. All I got were rehashes of tired scifi storylines, a mix between not-so-scary lovecraft and star trek the original series with some graphic, violent sex thrown in. *shrug* I didn't care about anyone in the book enough to even finish the series - I had checked out a combined edition from the library. *yawn*"},{"rating":"1","title":"The never ending story....","review":"I like Dan Simmons. \\"Carrior Comfort\\" is one of the best horror stories I have every read, so having seen so much praise for \\"Hyperion\\" I was eager to give it a try. I'll admit, I was one of the unaware that this was the first book of a two-part story, and that all this book covered was character backstory. This soured me on it to no end. I was expecting a story about what happens when the characters face the ultimate killing machine \\"the Shrike\\", not the long dull journey before hand. In the end, I wasn't moved enough to get the second book and would recommend getting \\"Carrion Comfort\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hubbub, bub?","review":"A couple of good yarns (the priest's tale is especially good), but otherwise nothing special. The stories are supposed to have a common thread that just isn't there. There is no ending. This is a rip-off. This book was obviously written with the intention of forcing you to buy the sequel. And from all I've heard, the next two books in the series are written in just the same way. Shine it on, big time"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!","review":"One of the best books I ever read. From the first page to the last keeps you hooked, and you just can't wait to read the second part (The Fall of Hyperion). Notice that you must not read the second part without reading the first and vice-versa. The caracters are very deep, their stories very tuoching, the situations allways changing, there isn't a moment for boredom. The first two parts of the sequel deserve my admiration, I hope the third will keep up with it.And to keep adding, the Science Fiction behind the story is simply great. The ideas that have como to Dan Simmons with the \\"portals\\" are a very good idea as to what might happen if we had them. A lot of authors have used them in SF but none with such realism. I have only one thing to say to Dan Simmons, \\"Thank you for giving us this book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word...AWESOME","review":"This book ranks up there with the greats: Dune, Enders Game, Foundation. Simmons creates a great and original universe with great character development, cool technology and a plot that is not predictable. One warning...you MUST have Fall of Hyperion ready to go when you finish this book. I don't want to spoil anything, but trust me, you will be sorry if you don't. Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion could have been one book. ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some bad, some very good. Worth a read.","review":"Hyperion is a book of somewhat uneven quality. The sentences have a short, irritating, grating feel sometimes. It's not the most polished of works.The story is in a somewhat unimaginative style where several pilgrims head off to Hyperion and get to hear each other's stories. There's a lot of fluff in Hyperion and the novel could have been cut down substantially.That said, some of the stories are very strange and powerful. The priest's story and that of the man with the child were very disturbing and left a strong impression. Those two alone make the book worth reading. The others were mixed, some ok, a couple very dull.Worth a read, but not a sci-fi great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"\\"Hyperion\\" barely edges out \\"Dune\\" and \\"Romance of The Three Kingdoms\\" as the best book I've ever read. What's not to like?! The individual tales run from exciting adventures to haunting love stories. For the most part, Mr. Simmons has a moving style that always involves you in the plot and characters. Granted, it's slow, but maybe people could learn to ENJOY the description. Finally, although the framework is little more than a setup for the sequel, the actual stories can be read on their own if that bothers you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I cannot understand all the whining people do about the reader needing to find the second book \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" in order to answer some of the questions from the first novel. Why not be happy about the fact that Simmons has created an incredible and complex world that we get to enjoy in MULTIPLE large novels rather than only a single book. This ranks as one of the finest SF novels I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post-modern science fiction","review":"Maybe I'm just not the right demographic for this novel, but I hated the beginning, tolerated the middle and put it down permanently near the end. The model is the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, but I don't think it works. I just never got interested in the characters enough to care what happened to them and for me, the story--stories, really--never came into focus. I guess the New York Times Book Review should have tipped me off because they compare it to Frank Herbert's Dune and the Foundation series of Asimov, both of which, in my opinion have aged really badly. I never realized how bad Dune was until I saw the awful movie of it.The fundamental metaphors operating in Hyperion seem to be backwards living. Well, ok, but I just don't see what it is a metaphor for. Nor, by page 473 where I finally gave up, did I care."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is unreadable","review":"I have read science fiction for more than 40 years, I am a scientist by training and profession, and I found this book completely unreadable back in the 90's. How it has survived to be more than a doorstop (and managed sequels at that) is more puzzling than the 16 dimensions of quantum mechanics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hyperion Series","review":"The seller was very good at responding to email inquiries, shipping method chosen was honored, product received on time & undamaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"you can get the basics of the story in the other posts.i was really looking forward to this after reading all the glowing reviews.after all the build up to the final meeting with the shrike,the book ends as they walk into the valley!no final anything,it just ends.it is just a collection of crappy short stories.this guy was too lazy to write an ending? one of the worst books i have EVER read in my 40+ yrs of reading. YUCK...weeks later i have been informed the story is continued in second book.i didn't realise this.maybe \\"to be continued\\" should have been added to the end??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand why this is so highly regarded","review":"I liked the book well enough to read past the first 100 pages, and I did enjoy the Scholar's Tale, but beyond that this book really failed to satisfy. I don't want to give away any details, but I will say that all of the excitement and mystery surrounding the Shrike is NOT satisfied at all by the end of this book. Presumably it's wrapped in in the next book but I found myself not interested in slogging through more of Simmons's half-baked plot to reach satisfaction. I felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly over-rated","review":"It seems that I'm the only person in the world who has read Hyperion and not loved it. I found the independent stories mostly unbelievable and stupid - let's take Rachel's story, for example; isn't it classic scifi in the negative sense of the term? A simple idea, looks brilliant on paper but turns out to be impossible to do well enough? The same can be said of the whole epic. Simmons just rushed head over heels into something he couldn't handle. And the basic plot drags on without awaking a spark of interest in me. I'm just glad it stopped before the climax; now I only have to avoid the rest of the series so that I'll never have to know what sorry idiocies our beloved author made up for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"This book and its sequel are two of my favorites. Science fiction doesn't get much better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hyperion, et. al.","review":"For lovers of Science Fiction, the Hyperion series ranks only slightly below the Foundation/Robot series (slightly,only). I liked book two and book four best; however, I enjoyed all four of them. \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" is the best SciFi novel since \\"Foundation's Edge.\\" There is good fiction and bad fiction; there is good Science Fiction and bad Science Fiction -- writers like Dan Simmons and Vernor Vinge make life worth living. Read the Hyperion series. Enjoy it. There ain't no more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I have read all 4 books in the Hyperion series and they are by far some of the best books I have ever read.

But the Kindle version is so riddled with typos and errors that it is incredibly distracting.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read But Be Warned","review":"This is a great book, and while I do not think it is the greatest SF book ever written, I will say I agree with many of the reviews I've read. The only thing I think worth adding is this warning: This is the beginning of a series of books and while the various sub-stories which make up the book are more or less complete, the novel does not actually end. It leaves you with a lot of What about this? and what about that? I have yet to read anymore in the series, but I really hate when I'm forced to because I want to know how a story turns-out and the author wants to sell more books by putting the answer in part 2. I much prefer a novel that is complete within itself even if it is part of a greater series of works. Regardless of all that, I still recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"All in all, this is an entertaining read. The characters each tell their own life stories. I must say that those back stories are MUCH more entertaining than the story of the pilgrimage itself. The pilgrimage story isn't bad, it's just that the others are so much better..... Sometimes, there's a bit too much philosophising for my tastes, but this book does entertain, and in the end, that's what matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-fi","review":"Many of the less-than-flattering reviews of this book are centered around the ending (or lack there of). Certainly, not much is resolved in this book. But the six stories told by the main characters (blended with a \\"current\\" plot-line) are such superb sci-fi and such superb writing that it hardly matters that one needs to read another volume for some resolution. In fact I'm looking forward to it. This is one of the best sci-fi works I've ever read (in 30 years of reading sci-fi). Do yourself a favor... read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best science fiction book I have ever read","review":"Hyperion is a wonderful read, almost as good the second time around. The first tale, about the priest, is absolutely spell-binding. It has been my experience over and over when I give someone this book that they say they COULD NOT stop reading the first tale no matter what else was happening around them. The story about Rachel and her father is also tremendously moving and harrowing, especially if you are a parent, but not in the way of so many books and movies these days of \\"child in danger from another person.\\" You have to read it to see what I mean.As you get into the sequels, I thought the story progressively became more strained and metaphysical in a silly way. But you'll have to read them, because once you've started Hyperion, it's like a drug, YOU CAN'T STOP! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick With It!","review":"I am not a fan of science fiction, but I decided to delve into something a bit different. This book, well, for me, began slowly. I seriously contemplated putting it away, but I hardly never finish a book. But I stuck with it and was glad I did! The tales included will make you think. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best series of all time","review":"The four Hyperion books (Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion) comprises the best sci-fi series I have ever read, and maybe the best of any fictional genre. Amazing story, characters and the Shrike is the coolest figure in Sci-fi hands down. Read these books now...as well as everthing else Dan Simmons has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't see what everyone else is raving about!","review":"I was suprised to see this on the list of \\"raves\\" here at Amazon.com. I found it especially odd to find some reviews comparing it with Ender's Game (one of my favorites). I can hardly think of two sci-fi books more different.I will say that the writing was quite good. That is why I decided to complete the book, but I was looking forward to getting to the end. Then when I reached the end and realized that this was only the first of a series I felt cheated. I knew I wouldn't read the second, but had absolutely no sense of resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"bit of a let down","review":"I had high hopes starting this one.

Mr. Shrieber called and nicely redirected me to Janet Bonnifer at 818-464-9618. She said that there are no plans for the other season to be released any time soon because of licensing issues regarding the songs used in some of the scenes. This is the reason why they have not be able to release it all these years. I have seen shows released with different music and/or songs than the original episodes because of the same reason. It was worth the try but I am no longer holding my breath for this. I will just have to get it from someone who has recorded them all from tv as I did before. The last set I got was flawed and I was unable to return it from Video MagicBox. I will try some other source."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will a different world season 2 come out?","review":"THE FIRST SEASON OF A DIFFERENT WORLD IS GREAT.I CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL THE OTHERS TO COME.I HOPE THEY COME SOON.WAS THIS HELPFUL TO YOU.

This is not a review of that season, most people here are honest enough to call a dog, a dog.

No Mr Gains! No Dr. War! No Kim! I use to love the Different World back in the late 1980s (watched every single episode - except that my mom wouldn't let me watch the attempted date rape episode from season 2 - episode 42, I finally watched that particular episode 6 years later on WB reruns). The main reason why I gave this dvd 2 stars is because Deniese butchered the season (she wasnt funny like she was on the Cosby Show). Jalessa was too uptight (she'll get funnier on season 2) and Whitley and Ron (not shown enough)was not that funny for this season, but will be hilarious by season 2. Not only this season was too weak and serious, but I also didnt buy this dvd because I was afraid of the editing scenes (like they did on the dvd releases of Cosby show and In Livin' Color - SHAME ON THEM!). Right now, I'll just hold my money until they release seasons 2 and 3 cuz they were the funniest seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"Lisa Bonet was like watching wallpaper in this show. She had no charisma or charm at all. She was so much better in the Cosby show. She must have hated it when Jasmine Guy was in front of the camera, she acted rings around Lisa. Heck the actress who played Millie held my interest more than Lisa did. She should have stayed on the Cosby show. Good thing she got pregnant so the producers didn't have to fire her. There is no way this show would have lasted if she had stayed the star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"These 22 episodes are the edited, chopped and truncated syndicated version of Season 1 (my favorite season). Entire scenes from each show have been left out leaving horrible gaps in storylines, great jokes and episode conclusions. As someone who never missed a show during the 1987-88 season (after that, the series was overcrowded and kinda' ghetto)I know these freshman episodes featuring the gentle comic stylings of Lisa Bonet like the back of my hand and trust me, anyone who buys this pathetic package is being shortchanged. I await the day the full, original episodes are restored and released, because this is a shoddy bit of product. Stay Away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold On","review":"This TV show was the impetus for me to research--and finally attend--a historically Black college. This show seemed to capture the seriousness, quirkiness, and joy of going away to a college that prided itself on helping students find their own identity. From Dwayne Wayne to Colonel Taylor, each character was authentic and real to me. They addressed so many touchy subjects: interracial dating, family pressures, grassroots activism, rape, colorism, minstreling, and everywhere in between. Though, like the others, I don't think this first season is indicative of the whole show, I have been waiting patiently for A Different World to come out on DVD and I believe that it was truly a beautiful experience. I hope they don't stop releasing this show on account of season one. It truly grows and matures, just like its audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bonus disc","review":"I bought the first season of A Different World dvd because I am a huge fan of this show! Even though the first season was my least favorite of all, I still enjoyed the dvd and especially the bonus disc. I absolutely love seeing bloopers of my favorite show and so that was a highlight! It looks like the cast had such a good time together. Ironically, none of the bloopers were from season 1, which was great b/c the rest of the seasons were so much better, but seeing the bloopers from later episodes made me really miss the show even more and wish that the rest of the seasons were available on dvd! I also like the behind the scenes documentary on the bonus disc too. It was cool to see some of the actors get together and reminisce about the show and they also included footage from rehearsals, which was nice to get a glimpse of. I just want to see more!!!! Please release seasons 2-6!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"I have ordered Tresor perfume online before and been very happy with it. I decided to order a bottle recently.

I first pick up my copy at Soper Hole on Frenchman's Key West End BVI while sailing the area. I'm not a \\"fast\\" reader, slow in-fact. It was hard to put the book down while anchored off Yost Van Dyke and finished in two settings.

Each thought described in each sentence displays a flash of brilliance but characters in the story blend into one another without much distinction. I'll have to heed Professor Kermit Roosevelt's notations paraphrased here by me as something like (1) succeeding is energizing, exhilarating and satisfying but success is empty and also (2) a society person is bound by tiny thread of custom and duty and so at minimum he risks being ridiculed by community if he aims and achieves wholesale reorganization of personal lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy","review":"Too wordy.

Grishim, Turrow, etc. Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should. There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped. The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.Kermit, you have the talent.

If it can get any worse than that, they were lawyers. The characters' shockingly realistic personalities, neuroses, and mannerisms lead me to believe that Roosevelt is either an extremely keen observer of both self and peer, or possibly a genius slipping into both schizophrenia and multiple-personality disorder. Does it matter?I would believe this work to be enjoyed most by fans of Joyce, Tolkein, or Herbert; it's language and character development both allow the reader a seamless transition into a world foreign to most, a world found only 'in the shadow of law.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned alot","review":"KR's book is way better than the legal thriller genre might make you think. Its more like Umberto Eco than Dan Brown, and more like John Franzen than John Grisham. You learn alot, even if you were already a lawyer or a law clerk yourself.Kim's book, to paraphase what someone once said about Marilyn Monroe, has curves in places that others don't even have places. Yes, you may have to use your brain when reading this, but fear not KR will take care of you.Tell me what other book can make a plot issue out of asset securitization? Or explore what it feels like to win a case, but feel sick about the judicial reasoning? That's the kind stuff you have to have a kind of hyper-legal sensitivity to write about. That's K.R.Finally, the book contains the great idea of putting metal taps on your shoes which does indeed protect them."},{"rating":"2","title":"legal mystery for lawyers","review":"I tend to agree with parts of the one and five star reviews. The technical legal jargon can be overwhelming at times but not too much to take away from the intimate character portrayals. The plot lacks a little in the middle then picks up at the end. This novel is a good read but more legal philosophy than story. It's hard to tell if the author is writing for the layman or trying to impress the layman with his legal rhetoric. All in all it was a smart and in depth novel. I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that made me like novels again","review":"I am not a big fan of novels (in spite of having a degree in English) but I gave this book a shot and was hardly able to put it down. It's beautifully written with characters so vivid, you can practically picture a movie version of the book. The only caveat I'd issue is that you probably need to be quite interested in the legal field to enjoy the book. I used to work in a K Street law firm, knew a lot of lawyers, and often wished I'd become one, so I was familiar with the world Roosevelt was talking about and also understood quite a bit of the legal theorizing involved. The only part that bogged me down was the discussion of \\"securitization\\" and other aspects of corporate law, but I don't think understanding all that is integral to enjoying the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"green is not my color","review":"beautiful at first[three days] then it all went down hill from there.the ring is gray and the stones look like i dipped them in vaseline very cloudy looking.my finger is green and i am out 50.00 bucks.all of the awsome reviews had to come from the makers of this ring.not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diamonds too small to see, Band too thin.","review":"This ring I ordered because I loved their Jessica Simpson replica, however it is uncomparable.

First of all, I expected more quality in it -- this read like a soap opera story. This is why I shy away from best-sellers, but I thought Walker might be different. I can see her strengths in writing, but I do not even feel as if a vivid portrait of anything was painted. The characters, the home, the reasons behind many of the abrupt actions were all left unanswered. After putting up with that plot throughout the book, I expected a decent ending (I stuck it out). However, the ending was the worst part, as it came suddenly and then the novel was over.

He does do Sinatra's \\"All or Nothing at All\\" justice, giving it a slightly danceable rhythm and upping the tempo beyond \\"crawl\\" for a change.

I'm a size small in dresses for reference and I'm 5'1. It did not hug the waist area and the curve of my back. There was a big space that just goes straight up without hugging tight to your waist. I think its because of the fabric or maybe because i have a small waist and a big butt. My waist is 23inch and hips/butt 38inch. But i really think its the fabric.

I was sadly disappointed. A the few books I have read on his life the beginning of this movie does not relate to the books. The people in the movie are speaking Italian so you have to read the English translation that scroll across the bottom of the whole movie very quickly. I believe they got some parts of the movie wrong for instance a young monk calls Antonio a nightingale but actually it was St. Francis who was the nightingale. St. Francis in the movie is called Francesco. The movie was very short and Antonio seemed to be angry the whole time that he could not be a martyr. They showed very little of his preaching and little of his miracles. They never showed that the Christ Child appeared to him. They left out so much of his story. The dvd is not worth buying. Buy a book about it him to get the full scope of the wonderful saint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"Very thorough guide. Works like a dictionary.

I don't think the pink box was cheesy at all. It is light pink with the \\"Marquis by Waterford Truly Yours Collection\\" imprinted in black on the top and it latches shut. The padding is wonderful and holds the glasses perfectly, if a little tight. I did notice a slight discoloration on one glass but it turns out to be sticker residue that just needed to be lighltly scratched off. The detailing stands out beautifully and the glasses came without issues or chips . The glasses were also much larger than I expected for flutes, not a bad thing!, but I don't have much experience with the average flutes and I guess I should have read the dimensions more closely. Beautiful glasses, I will proudly use them at my ceremony and would definitly give a set to a friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and sturdy","review":"They look smaller than they are.

First of of all they're made in China says so right on the box. Secondly the pink box is cheesy. The first time I opened it the bottom part of the buckle fell off and hit the floor. I had to push the tabs back in. Then when I put the lid back down one corner ripped. I wasn't being rough either. When I was cleaning the glasses off with a tissue to see if I liked them better there was a chip in the glass at the top, I could feel with my fingernail. I also think they look quite cheap. I wanted to look at them before buying but I couldn't find them anywhere so I took a chance. I honestly don't even think they're worth the price, I could get a cheaper glass that looks more expensive and has better quality.

The opening description of the resort and Loisiana were wonderfully lush - beautiful simple language. But the book was really ruined for me because I could find absolutely no sympathy or even interest in the protagonist. In the end, I felt that she was rather selfish and petty. Her awakening to me wasn't much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic with a dated style of writing","review":"The Awakening, reviled in its own time, is now considered one of the pivotal books of feminist literature. The story concerns 28yo Edna Pontellier, a well-to-do wife and mother in New Orleans' Creole society. Her frustration with the limits placed on her sexual, creative, and artistic leanings lead her to rebel in a way society cannot understand or condone.The writing style, popular when the book was written a century ago, is more 'telling' than 'showing,' and modern readers may find the reading a bit of a slog these days. But the story, even though the outcome quickly becomes predictable, is compelling enough to keep one reading and reading.A classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The awakening; should be called the abandoning","review":"It is a great mystery to me why female supremists love and adore this book. Kate Chopin's character Edna ruins the lives of her children by selfishly taking her own. Does a woman really demonstrate her strength by wimping out in the face of life?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awakened Souls","review":"The Awakening by Kate Chopin is an inspiring novel, focusing on the internal struggles of a young married woman, Edna Pontellier, who tries to fight off the chains of society while discovering who she is as a person. Edna's friends and husband end up pushing her, unintentionally, to become more of an independent woman. Once she discovers her new-found freedom she must learn to balance this independence with the relationships she wishes to pursue. Chopin's writing style keeps the reader engaged, using dramatic imagery and shifting perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES THIS REMIND YOU OF, SAY, FLAUBERT?","review":"I am giving this novel such a low rating because of its blatant unoriginality. The similarities between Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Chopin's The Awakening is more than I can ignore. Take the plot, for instance. Married woman finds herself bored and dissatisfied with her station in life. Woman seeks man for satisfaction, enjoys herself guiltily for a while, then relationship ends. Woman becomes despondent for a while, realizes she will never become happy so ends it with suicide.It is this basic idea that haunts both Madame Bovary and The Awakening. There are a few trivialities that are different, but the plot of Chopin's is entirely unoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick read, but not too pleasant","review":"I think that this is a good book to have read to get a different perspective on feminism at the turn of the century, but it bothered me greatly while I was reading it. The main character, Edna, is SO selfish, childish, and self-absorbed that I can't see why the novel is so highly acclaimed as a piece of feminist literature. Perhaps it is because a woman takes the main role. Perhaps it is because of the sexual images that do not relate to men. I consider myself a feminist, but I had little respect for Edna or for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it! (See review for why it got two stars...)","review":"Of all the femi-nazi literature that my teacher shoves down my throat, this was certainly the least tolerable. Devoid of any interesting subject matter, this book challenges the reader to make it through without expunging his most recent meal from his system. This book, however, has its pluses. If you need to strike up a conversation with someone of the female ilk, just toss this one out there...apparently women are born with a desire to read insipid and boring books such as this one, so you're sure to hit a home run. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopin really was ahead of her time...","review":"Upon examination of this book, I agree that Chopin is a writer ahead of her time. She would be more apt to write in the 1990's where cheesy romance novels and Danielle Steele reign supreme. This book is horrid in every aspect of the word and could only be made worse if she mispelled several words including the title and made a plethora of grammatical errors. It is a bland plot mixed with bland character development that is built on a stupid premise that makes me feel stupider now that I have read the book. In fact, I think the CIA dropped these books on Russia to create a brain drain in the nation. In the words of the immortal Jay Sherman: \\"It Stinks!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT enjoy","review":"I went into this book expecting a 'revolutionary' piece of literature. Instead, I was disapointed. I don't understand why a woman who was a poor mother, an adultress several times over and an all around bore would peak anyones interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A REPRINT - POORLY PRINTED","review":"I am reviewing the edition of the book: CLASSIC REPRINT. The text is large, and appears to be photocopied. Some of the letters are actually not complete. It reminds me of the old manual typewriters when the letter did not completely strike the paper. I am not reviewing the actual manuscript, as the book was bought for my son's high school class, so I am waiting for him to finish before I read it. But I wanted everyone to know that this particular edition is a bit off as far as the print. My son's teacher and classmates got a good laugh about his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I gave it four stars because I'm a heavy classics reader. It's a great piece within the genre, but i'm not sure how much people would like it if they prefer more modern styles of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as expected.","review":"I can see why this is described as an early feminist work, however I did not see this excellent book in this light, no doubt due to being male. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel for the quality of the writing, the excellent characterization, the period and the setting. However I found myself impatient at the slow pace of the heroines activity or should I say inactivity in moving toward her goals. To me this is the tale of someone who for the times in which she lived had everthing that was available to her but was unable to achieve satisfaction. In the story the heroine wants to reject even her children to achieve another life she is unable to define, she is confused and frustrated with tragic consequences. To my mind her sex is not the crux of the novel, the complexities of life and how individuals achieve or cannot achieve self fulfillment regardless of gender are the subject explored. Well worth reading regardless of your interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving up on life","review":"I'm offended that people consider this book a feminist statment. It is not a statment, it is a pity party. The language and imagery of the book was decent enough.But Edna did not supply the book with the heroine it needed. She considered only herself, ironically accusing Robert of selfishness. In her \\"awakening\\" she was totally self-absorbed. If this book is meant to empower women what is it meant to drive then towards? Suicide? She gave up on life and love. If I could I would have given it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the single worst book I've ever read...","review":"I had to read this sorry excuse for a novel for an AP class in high school, and it almost killed me. This is less a story of a woman's feminist transformation, and more a seemingly unending list of complaints at how unfair the world is. The worst part is Chopin's writing is so terrible a had to reread most passages 2 or 3 times just to figure out what she was talking about. The best part of the book is the end, when the main character commits suicide. This is the only time in my life i have cheered for someone ending their own life.This is the worst book I've ever read; and i read \\"Going Rogue.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The lost","review":"The story was beautifully written. The author did not provide any solution to the problem Edna was struggling with. Although I like the writing, the heroine is completely the opposite of independent female. I have to confess that i could not sacrifice myself for my two wonderful boys either. however, so far, I don't have to sacrifice anything. I can understand her abandoning the husband, but how could she leave her children? To me, she is completely lost in her lust."},{"rating":"1","title":"sick. just sick.","review":"i dont have problems with books that have female heroines. but why is it that in literature, women have to commit adultery to be considered heroines? and why iis she (or hester Prinn from scarlet letter) considered models? why is adultery considered a good thing? what next?"},{"rating":"2","title":"dream or true?","review":"I\`m Javier Araneda I found the book very good. Specially the love story, which is very well structurated, so you will not be able to find out how it ends, until you have finished the whole story. A woman who loves a man in such an unconditional way, to abandone all she had loved before. This love was for her the only important reason to exist. She was blind. She wasn\`t there for anyone but for her dreams of love. We all know that there exist no unfinished dream, so she also had to awake. But she could not tolerate the reality. That\`s why, I think, the book is called \\"THE AWAKENING\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have read much worse stuff.","review":"I had to read this book in my Women's Writing Class. I can not say I enjoyed this. Edna does not really capture much sympathy or admiration. The pace of this is also quite sluggish. The supporting characters are not really memorable either. But at least Chopin had a good idea. She was trying to portray a woman who had everything, but could not be happy with the role of women in society. If you want to check this out, you must keep this in mind, or the book may seem meaningless. I did not really care for this, but I remember reading many books that were MUCH worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty craptacular","review":"I may be at a decided disadvantage in fully appreciating this book, being a man, but I really found this book unenjoyable. The main character, while taking tremendous chances in her \\"awakening\\", seems to me to be selfish and whiny. I also found the pace of this book to be largely inadequate, as it plods along and never really kept my interest for extended periods of time. All in all, this book fell far below my expectations, judging from the accolades it has received in more recent times."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Awakening","review":"Kate Chopin's writing is very detailed and some what mind boggling. You really need to be interested in the story in order to keep up with what the writer is saying. I found myself drifting from the book, chapter by chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Awakening in one word: HORRID.","review":"Okay, I was assigned to read this book in my lit class, I thought it would be kind of good, but then it just got boring and really dumb, I mean it was depressing to read, the ending [stank] and with most books, people are like \\"Oh yeah, I can't wait to see what happens next!\\" For me it was just like another obstical that I had to do, if I wasn't assigned to read it, do you think I would of, heck no!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I remember","review":"I've been re-reading many novels and short fiction from the turn of the century and THE AWAKENING was a pleasant surprise. While emotional and sexual liberation have inspired some great artistic works in the last century, Chopin here is refreshing precisely because Edna Pontellier's \\"awakening\\" is portrayed as nebulous, ethereal, and above all, inarticulate. Edna is not sure what she is feeling. She knows only that her new feelings of love have no place in her society. Indeed, Chopin shows that for a woman to be awake emotionally at this time in history is to be psychologically isolated and socially estranged. The choices Edna faces are devastating, and so is this slight novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"I'd say 4.5 stars. The characters are intricately and finely drawn; I found Mademoiselle Reisz especially interesting. As far as its influence on society goes, this short novel is obviously quite significant. Edna Pontellier's desire to revert to a completely child-like view on life is irritating at times, but the way Chopin shaped the plot, I don't find it impossible to empathize with her dilemma. I don't know if this is meant to be its primary focus, but above all I see this book as a love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of its time, ahead of the pack","review":"A century after the publication of Kate Chopin's novel, its themes -- a woman's awakening to the full potential of her sexual passion and her sense of being smothered by marriage and motherhood -- have become the staple ingredients of 'chick lit'. It is thus easy to overlook how revolutionary and shocking the events and ideas of this story must have seemed at the time. Then, the book was banned from public libraries; now, it is required reading in public schools.In many ways, both in theme and treatment, it resembles \\"Madame Bovary\\". Although Chopin lacks Flaubert's scope and breadth of vision, she reaches deeper into the soul of her heroine. Her style is restrained and elegant and some modern readers, accustomed to a pacier and more explicit treatment, may grow impatient at times. But there is beautiful writing here, embodying rich characterizations, strong evocations of time and place and thought-provoking moral ambiguity. An undoubted masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"She happened to me!","review":"I read \\"The Awakening\\" in my English 101 class, and I hated it. Met \\"her\\" the following year. Wether good or Bad \\"The Awakening\\" is true. There are ideals and then there are people trying to live them. I met a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but surprising experience","review":"As a teenage male I shuddered at the thought of having to read this book about female independence. I am happy to admit that The Awakening was much more than a feminist handbook. It was sensitive and thought-provoking, but it was also coldly realistic. This book will enlighten anyone who reads it, young or old, male or female"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of her time","review":"Kate Chopin's The Awakening gives an insightful look into the life of a woman trapped in a marriage and a life that doesn't befit her. The characters are very well done -- not all of them are deep, but for good reason. Chopin's writing style never ceases to amaze. I've read this book three or four times, and it never loses its power, its impact. There are themes throughout that give the story a deeper meaning. When you read it, think about the elderly widow and what she represents, and the young lovers. Everything means something, and it is all tied together very well. It's the best book I've ever read. I simply love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic character","review":"It was hard to read this book at first because of Kate Chopin's style of writing. But once I got used to it after a few pages, I really got into the book. The reader really comes to feel Edna's pain and want for freedom. I must give Chopin tons of props for having enough courage to write a strong female character and daring to use sensuality and lust in her book, even though it was written in the late 1800s (a time that even mentioning a passionate kiss on the lips in literature was forbidden). I got so into the book that I felt as if I were Edna living in a opressed world. Read this book to learn or get more knowledge on how women were treated during the Victorian Era...it is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispensable","review":"In this brief novel, Kate Chopin tries to depict the spiritual awakening of a privileged young woman. Unfortunately, the book doesn't make much sense. When Edna, the protagonist, casts away her public self to become her true self, we might suppose that her quality of life would improve. Instead she exercises poorer and poorer judgment, ultimately destroying herself. Edna is not a likeable or even an authentic character, and the supporting cast is almost as unattractive. In this novel, even New Orleans seems to have no attractions. The Awakening is not terrible; it just has little to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and meaningless.","review":"This is undoubtedly the worst book I've ever read. Though it is, in fact, a short book, it seems to take forever for the plot to pan out, and even when it supposedly does, its very slow and boring. Alcee and Edna commit adultery? When?!

If you're looking for a rich and stirring piece of American literature, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Doesn't Awaken It Makes You Fall Asleep!","review":"I just finished reading this book for my AP English class. It's got great imagery, but other than that it's boring. A couple times while reading this I went to sleep. All it is, is Edna whining about being oppressed in her nice house with everything being given to her. Awwwww, poor baby. I enjoyed reading Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God much better. It seems to me the only people that like this book are female English teachers, that's the only reason it's a classic. Nothing jumped out of the pages to me.

People of African descent have names!! Chopin called the 'black' character The Black Girl, and she made her a maid. All the 'white' characters had names. It is not right to dehumanize people. I didn't care for any of the 'white' characters. My focus was on The Black Girl since I, too, would be seen as 'black' in that society. I destroyed my copy as soon as the class was over.

What makes this book outstanding is its theme and imagery. Chopin articulated very well a woman continue in the traditional gender role but at the same time develop a sense of who she is, i.e. outside of family, outside of husband, outside of children? Here, Edna could not and thus the story has a tragic ending (I should just say suicide since the \\"utopianpessimist 4/28/99\\" let the cat out of the bag already!!!). I agree with a previous reader that at first it seemed like a pathetic ending. On the other hand, one must look at the context of Edna's situation and the circumstances in her life.

As a young woman of 21, this book opened my eyes regarding the patriarchal powers that existed in the Victorian era, and still today.

Only a few people will be able to fully comprehend and appreciate what Edna does and why she does it. The little shadow on her two boys only enhances the pain of this book.

Every woman should read it at some point in her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelievably whiny, obnoxious, and self-centered heroine","review":"Although I am certain that some individuals would beg to differ, I found Chopin's The Awakening an exercise in masochism. I found the main character, Edna, did not elicit any sense of pity. The notion of societal pressures on an indivdual is certainly valid, but Chopin's dull (at least in my personal opnion)prose made the point too blatant, and Edna's so-called escape is a very poor resolution to such problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awakening that transcends modern feminism","review":"This book is dear to me not because it is some sort of feminist statement - but because in many ways Edna Pontellier is a role model for all women, both traditional and iconoclastic. One hundred years ago, before women's awakenings were politically correct and expected, Edna did the unexpected. She left a stagnant marriage to follow her ideals, defying a stifling society in the process.Although this is a more of a novelette than a novel and can be read rather rapidly, I prefer to digest the Awakening slowly - taking in the lush language and scenery. The pure escapism of being transported to 1899 Creole society and New Orleans is enough to entice me back to this book time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST book ever!","review":"I have noticed that many say that females love this book and the females can relate to Edna and her feelings about love, marriage, and children. As a female, I wholeheartedly disagree. Edna is a spoiled and whiny character who after finally \\"awakening\\" takes an easy way out that should never even be considered. Though she is \\"awakened\\", she is ultimately a weak person and I hope that no female reads this book and \\"awakens\\" to be the type of person she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich 19thCentury Woman Abandons Family & Self","review":"Just because a woman doesn't like her position in a male-dominated, repressive society doesn't automatically make every way she rebels feminist. This character was pretty shallow and uncompelling, very much a spoiled brat. I can't believe it is hailed as some sort of early feminist landmark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Literature","review":"I was required to read this book for my Women In Literature class this semester. I had always been told what a great book this was (from a literary analysis perspective), but I was steadily surprised. This is one of my favorite books of all time!! (Next to Daphne DuMauriers \\"Rebecca\\", of course.) To be completely honest, the story is a little slow and hard to get into at first, but trust me, it gets better. I found the main character \\"Edna\\" to be very relatable- not just because she an opressed woman searching for liberation, but becasue the idea of oppression is universal no matter where one comes from. READ THIS BOOK!!!! However, the ending was a little disappointing for me, but this is still a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edna is totally selfish","review":"I really did NOT like the book. Edna really ticked me off. She is a total player. She sleeps with other guys, ignores her kids and sends them to their grandparents, ignores her sister's wedding, etc, etc, etc. Chopin must've been smoking some serious stuff when she wrote because it went totally against the values of the day, and Edna is looked upon as a totally selfish person who is only looking to benefit herself. This may be called feminism, but it is total crap for the fact that not all feminists are inconsiderate sluts. She portrays Leonce as being an inconsiderate person, but in fact he is more loving to her than she is to him. He gives her what she wants, does what she asks, but she does not do what he asks. She gives a wrong view of both men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible read","review":"Although Kate Chopin did not publish much in her lifetime, she made a strong impact. I especially loved Awaking. It hit a chord for several reasons. First, I was amazed to read something from 1899 with such a strong conviction toward women's rights, with such a realistic ending. Second, I think there are so many of us females today struggling with our own identities. I loved that the heroine broke from the norm and persued a life of her own (rather than living for her two children or the opinions of her husband). Third, I got a taste of an historical and diverse Louisiana. This is the story of Edna Pontellier and her journey toward self-awareness/discovery through one summer of freedom from her husband and children. I especially loved that she was flawed enough in the end to defy social/familial convention to commit the ulimate self-driven act."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brand new book","review":"The book was in perfect condition upon arrival just as the description stated.

But in the end, she still does not find anything to satisfy and fulfill her, an awakening that ruins her life, and her children's lives. I just love the stark clarity of the words which lead on to a poignant understanding of why this just has to be one of the best books in the world, one that will never become outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite awake","review":"I do not reccomend this book to anyone with any sense whatsoever. I read this book on the premise that, although published in 1899, it was an inspiration to women fighting for their independence in the 20th century, and was highly disapointed. The protagonist, Edna Pontellier, is a weak character. Not only does she spend half the book asleep, drawn into slumber by the intimate touch of her many lovers, but at realizing that the cause of her achings is her dependency on her husband, she does nothing about it. She mopes around town, defying her husband without standing up for herself, she cries alot, and she ultimately takes her own life, with no consideration or sense of responsibility. She is incredibly dependent on men, and yet she resents that she depends on them so. She is a horrible character, who does not represent anything fought for by our ancestors this century past. Sorry Chopin, no thumbs up for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Awakening","review":"In \\"The Awakening\\" by Kate Chopin, Edna lives in a society during the late eighteen hundreds and has her own role assigned to her by that society. Edna has a hard time sticking to her role, especially when she meets Robert; who becomes a good friend. Throughout the novel, Edna is attempting to find herself and who she really is, behind the role that society has placed on her.\\"The years that are gone seem like dreams-if one might go on sleeping and dreaming-but to wake up and find-oh! well! Perhaps it is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather than to remain a dupe to illusion all one's life.\\"This novel is a relatively short read and is slightly difficult. I really enjoyed the book and especially enjoyed the symbolism throughout; I would rate it a nine out of ten. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a proficient reader and enjoys novels that involve social issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to get into","review":"This was just not my kind of book.

Powerful and empowering at the same time.Definitely a must-read for women everywhere! Also, I would highly recommend Chopin's short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a feminist book; Spoiler alert","review":"Although this book is known as one of the first great feminist pieces of literary merit it actually is in no way a feminist book. The main character, Edna is supposed to be realizing her independence as a person but in fact she is incredibly selfish and self obsessed. She is whimsical and uncapable of forming meaningful relationships. She is trying to escape life and all her responsibilities. She leaves her husband and her children for selfish reasons and seeks only to only talk to people who will entertain her. Edna is a selfish and dim witted character whos inevitable end is fitting. She goes out in the only way that is possible for someone as melodramatical and pointless as herself, suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"textbook","review":"Needed to buy it foNeeded to buy it for a class, can't recommend it since it wasn't a purchase for fun, just out of necessity."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was okay","review":"I didn't like the book because it showed how week Edna was and how she her lovers first in her life.The book was ironic to me because I didn't expect Edna to drown herself, especially over a male.I recommend this book to females who are interested in knowing how some women choose to handle their love life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, literary merit but so boring!","review":"This book surpasses even The Scarlett Letter in being dull! There is absolutely no action. The heroine is frustratingly naive and the ending is horribly disappointing! The premise of the novel has promise but the delivery lacks anything to involve the reader, leaving him bored and DYING for the end of this sub-par read."},{"rating":"1","title":"che stupido!!","review":"This book was utterly a waste of time to read. My artistic nature and love for good literature was completely offended by the sacrilege of this exceptionally ridiculous plot. Granted, the idea is to convey the trapped woman vs. the time of the late 19th century and the ineffectual struggle countered by many women. But the plot serves to indicate nothing more than a crazed woman who abbandons her family, life, and morals (all of which were under no concern or abuse) and utterly leaves all those around her in a daze regarding her ridiculous behavior. I clapped when the fool drowned at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy of Life and Death","review":"\\"The Awakening\\" by Kate Chopin is a great book. It deals with a woman who is confused about the way her life is going. She doesn't realize it but she is an extremely strong woman. She has to deal with the feelings she has for her husband and children and also for another man. She doesn't want to be tied down. She loves her family and regrets that she cannot give herself completely. A part of her awakening comes when she decides to swim in the ocean by herself. She has the feeling of pure joy and a certain amount of sensual pleasure as she swims farther and farther into the ocean. She begins to wonder why she had never done this before because it is a pleausre that is so enjoyable. In the end she gives herself back to the ocean. She returns to a place where she feels an unexplained joy of life and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Tale!","review":"After reading The Awakening, a story of a woman breaking free from typical society, we concluded that the themes portrayed in this novel will continue to perpetuate themselves throughout time. Therefore, we recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading 19th century literature. In life, everyone lives through their own periods of \\"awakenings\\", and reading Chopin's novel can help to better understand them. What a riveting tale filled with both romance and suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great class assignment","review":"I was given The Awakening for a class assignment over vacation for English class. I was angry to have to read a book over vacation..but once I got into this novel, I instantly changed my mind. I had no problems getting through this book. There were some parts that did confuse me a bit, which I had to read over a few times, but overall it was a touching story that I could relate to in many ways. The ending is heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aren't We All Mother-Women?","review":"The Awakening made me realize so much about my own life and my eventual role as a woman in today's society. Experiencing an overwhelming sense of \\"ennui\\" with her life as a \\"mother-woman\\", Edna strives to break free from the oppressive role that she has accidentally gotten herself into. Not finding happiness in living through her children or even her husband, Edna searches for meaning in life, attempting to possess the soul that \\"dares and defies.\\" This book must be read by all women. It is a remarkable cry that is voiced from a female who we can all relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joni's Story","review":"Joni's Story is an very inspiring book because she creates a good athmosphere by using a wide variety of words. She explained her feelings well and you get a picture in your mind of all the things she was going through after the acident. I liked the book so much I ended up reading it twice. The first time I read this book was when I was 8 but when I read it again I was 10 and that shows this book is not aimed at any specific age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes it's not the answer you're looking for...","review":"At 17, Joni (pronounced \\"Johnny\\") Earekson prays that God will turn her life around. The answer to her prayer took the form of a diving accident that left her paralyzed from the neck down. Non-Christians may find Joni's spiritual reflections tiresome or puzzling, but will still find inspiration in a young girl's transformation from suicidal despair to spiritual serenity. Illustrated with photos and reproductions of some of Joni's artwork, this is a worthwhile read, best suited for a summer day under a shade tree or a winter night beside a warm fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Made","review":"I received this item today and was very pleased.

So, it did fit the changing pad the first time I put it on. However, after the first wash, putting it on the table pad was the biggest joke. I would say it shrank by the size it needed to be. We purchased two, in white and pink, and they both turned out the same. I am very disappointed. The price I paid was too much for such poor quality. Almost $13.00 and they did not last one wash. The material did not maintain its original texture or nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good as a back-up","review":"This changing pad cover doesn't wash that well.

I read a lot of the reviews on here, and was overwhelmed at how positive and diverse they were. Convinced that I wouldn't like it, I bought the cd anyways, and boy, was I wrong. This gal can rock! And the more countrified/ bluegrass roots music is so joyous or personal that you have to love it. Just one thing, though... maybe it's just me, but the music seemed a bit too slow for Loretta on a couple of tracks (1, 11). She's singing her heart out with a lullaby! A great album, nevertheless, and a must own for any collection. I think I'm gonna have to buy some more of Loretta's music now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want to like it but...","review":"I really was prepared to dislike this album. You know, cool indie rocker works with country legend and the hype machine kicks in overdrive. I mean, give me a break. Who cares? But, sadly for me preconceptions and happily for my cd player, this is far greater then the sum of it parts. The hype is justified, not because of the personnel, but because of the music. For me it exceeds any of the previous output of the two principals. The simple chord changes and melodies of Loretta's obviously country tunes strips the pretense right out of White's indie rock, and his production and arrangements give the tunes a unique (for her, anyway) and agreeable edge. I don't know if this would work again, but for now this album is a great reprieve for those of us who miss the first wave of alt-country (when it was still alt-country, not shoegazers in cowboy shirts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Appalachian inspired Tunes","review":"Ten years from now this cd will be on a top 100 album list.This cd transcends the \\"country\\" label and belongs in the same\\"Americana\\" category that consists of singers such as Lucinda Williams,Gillian Welch, Nanci Griffith, and other artists who skillfullyblend folk, blues, country, and rock into personalstatements. It's miles above anything put out by the currentcrop of commercial country Barbie dolls. When veteran artists such asLoretta Lynn and Dolly Parton return to their Appalachian rootsfor inspiration (and shun the slick country establishment),we are greatly enriched by the endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - I absolutely love this album!","review":"This is a fantastic album that brings together two unlikely musical genuises who you'd never think would have any reason to get together. I have a new respect for Jack White and a revived love for Loretta Lynn. If you liked Willie Nelson's 'Teatro' or Johnny Cash's version of that Nine Inch Nails' song, you'll get this album. More albums like this might give me hope for the post-modern creative world."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Country","review":"It is so refreshing to find a cd that has actually figured out that this means the sound should be both new and country. This is not some little pretty diva's brand of soft core pop--this is the real stuff and it's strong as they come. It serves to bring out into the fore front a side of Loretta Lynn that was often kept in check via humor. The humor is still here, but the laughs behind \\"Mrs. Leroy Brown\\" are mitigated by the harsh reality of \\"Women's Prison.\\" If you like the idea of a Steve Earle mixed with a dose of Allison Moorer, this is the album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"I don't really have words to describe this album. I have purchased MANY MANY albums in my lifetime, but very few have equaled the quality of this album. The musical arrangements are near perfect, the writing is poetic, and the voice is one of a kind. Jack White and Loretta Lynn's talents mix perfectly. This CD will be in my player for a very long time. This album is a piece of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record","review":"This is an extraordinary record. The pairing of Jack White and Loretta Lynn was a gamble, but it paid off in a big way. Featuring some of the best singing of her career, here Lynn gets some great, rough arrangements courtesy of the White Stripes musician, an obvious fan. It's the opposite of slick, and it works (Nashville take notice)! The whole record is deeply moving and very satisfying. I'm guessing that this will be thought of as a classic in the years ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"VAN LEAR ROSE ABOVE THEM ALL","review":"This is a must buy CD for everybody that has a taste for music that is worth listening to!!! Loretta ROSE above the rest and conquered her seat at the top of the music industry with this cd!! Even if your not a country music listener you will enjoy this cd. The best song on here in my own opinon is WOMEN'S PRISON and I don't know why but this song has a gut wrenching feel to it and I get goosebumps every time i here it and believe me I heard it more then a hundred times already!!! The other song on here that is my favorite is MISS BEING MRS. this song is as country as you or anybody can get but the word are simple and plain and true!!! Well all the songs are great I can go on and on and on but I won't just buy this CD and you will agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you're lookin' at Loretta you're listenin' to country!","review":"Loretta Lynn takes country music back to its roots (a refreshing change from the wannabe crossover bubble gum or sappy sentimentalism that passes for so much of C&W these days) with her latest and already one of her greatest albums. From the traditional theme of \\"Family Tree\\" to Miss Being Mrs., a tribute to her long marriage with late beloved husband Mooney, and the charming \\"Portland, Oregon\\" Loretta gives us new hits as well as a look back at her long career. She truly is the \\"First Lady of Country Music.\\" Highly recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Writing, Bad Production, Bad Band","review":"This is little more than a White Stripes record with Loretta Lynn singing. the playing is that of a garage band with no talent. If she wanted authenticity, she should have got musicians who actually knew how to play. the drums are weak, yet mixed way too high in the recordings, the lap guitar is feeble, the vocals are bizzare. Avoid this record if you love Loretta. If you love bad garage music, by all means pick this up immediately!!! I am desperately sorry I wasted my hard earned money on this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack White","review":"I hear all this praise about him...The White Stripes suck justlike nearly every rock group today. It's amazing people actuallythink this group is good. As far as LL goes, being from the westside of GA you can bet I've heared every song she's ever made. I'mnot a fan som I'm not rating this album because that would beunfair. This does sound alittle different from what I've heardfrom her though.PS:The White Stripes suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst loretta cd ever!!!","review":"I DONT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH LORETTA'S HEAD WHEN SHE MADE THIS CD,THIS IS THE WORST IVE EVER HEARD HER SOUND!!!

Loretta still sounds great considering her age, however, most of the sample tracks provided for us to listen to sounded tinny. Some of it came close to what I consider heavy metal. Naw, TINNY is the word. There is too much hollow echoing sound. On one of the tracks she was talking and the tinny echoing prevented me from hearing what she was saying. I'd have to hear much more of the overall sound before I'd be willing to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeleivable","review":"Good Lord, Lorettie, what were ya thinkin? I was expecting to hear a classic Loretta album and what a surprise! The Queen of Country meets, or is killed by, acid rock. I did manage to listen to the whole album - needed a valium by the end - and the only song that had any merit was Miss Being Mrs, which I had seen her perform. I guess I was hoping for more of this accoustic type performance, which is Loretta's forte, but instead, was leveled with her trying to scream above the maddening guitar licks! Beware Loretta fans, this is not her typical wonderful stuff! I only wish it had come before Halloween so I could have turned the stereo up to scare the kids on the street!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Effort","review":"For a legend like Loretta to put out a product such as this is a huge disappointment to me. I love her music but this was not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"um, yeah, crap.","review":"God, I have to listen to this horrible thing almost everyday at work. If she says have mercy one more time, I'm going to lose it. This is good music? What's everyone smoking. It's no more than muzak. Reinforced stereotypes of an already cliche genre. I've heard every riff a thousand times, every lyric a hundred more. Oh I know lets throw one of those hip new musicians into the mix that all the kids are talking about. Everytime I hear the name Jack White I want to vomit. Meg couldn't play drums to save her life, and to think I used laugh at them when they played little venues that at the most garnered five people. Just goes to show you that pop culture is a wasteland, and the public still has no taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upsetting.","review":"This CD, in my opinion, is absoultly terrible. It's time Loretta retires. She's just not as good as she used to be. This CD proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it up, Please.","review":"This CD stinks. Loretta is too old to keep doing this. The tracks sound tired. I wouldn't recommend buying this album. Only Patsy Cline could pull off singing at such an age. Sorry to say, Loretta cant"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bend an elbow and enjoy!","review":"This album is hotter than a tick on a Mississippi BloodHound! Loretta Lynn at her finest! The producer(Jack White) did a swell job himself. Pour up the whiskey if ya feel a little frisky and put your legs up and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loretta lynn the definitive collection","review":"This is an excellent CD. Her distinct voice and style really comes through. I highly recommend this CD.Jim Mixon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comeback from a Legend!","review":"It may seem to be an odd couple - Loretta Lynn and Jack White, but why argue when the results are so good. This is an awesome disc with songs of traditional country themes but modern arrangements. However, White as the producer lets some \\"twang\\" come through and the results are astounding.I've not really been a Loretta Lynn fan having never owned any of her recordings before, but after listening to this one in a store, I had to get it. She's had great hits and duets in the past but this disc is probably the best one recording of hers - it deserves to be a hit.Hopefully, radio will play some songs, possibly leading to a revival in the greats of country music past such as Barbara Mandrell, Conway Twitty, and many others. New country is excellent, but we can't forget its roots. Lynn and White have combined the two quite successfully here."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic","review":"With Loretta writing the songs and Jack producing them, how can you go wrong? Loretta's voice is lovely, and her lyrics are amazing. From beginning to end, this album is perfect. Old-school country fans may be turned-off by the rock sound to many of the songs, but Loretta will undoubtedly make many new, younger fans. This will probably be the album of the year for many a critic, and deservedly so. This is the best album I've bought in quite some time. Believe the hype--it's all true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loretta is Amazing!","review":"You have to listen to this album with an open mind becasuse it is none like Loretta has ever put out, but all songs were written by her, and I have to say I like the entire album. Some of the songs have a rock edge but Loretta keeps up just fine. Some of the songs are as country as you can get. Very good album. I reccomend it. My favorite songs are, Vanleer Rose, Miss Being Mrs, High on a Mountain top, and Mrs Leeroy Brown. They are all different, but its all good music. Great instrumental music as well as vocal. Loretta is Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Gem","review":"I'm just going to echo everyone else's sentiment. I'm not a Country music fan by any stretch of the imagination, but this album is amazing! Honestly, I cannot understand why anyone wouldn't love this record. It's going to be an instant classic, and hopefully it will appear on jukeboxes everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Music Queen Loretta Lynn nails it time after time.","review":"Whether you're a country music fan or not, this is one album that should not be missing from any personal music collection! This album has something for everyone from her sweet country ballad \\"Miss Being Mrs.\\" to such songs as rockin' \\"Have Mercy\\" and \\"Mrs. Leroy Brown\\" to the down home good time song of \\"High on a Mountain Top\\". Jack White's collaboration with Lynn on this album truly set a new \\"raised bar\\" in the country music business, this is one album that will be hard to beat. Trust me on this one people, whether you're a fan of Loretta Lynn's music or not, this is one album that you will catch yourself listening to over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALBUM OF THE YEAR","review":"I have never owned another Loretta Lynn album, but after I read all of the hype surrounding \\"Van Lear Rose,\\" I bought it, and wow - it's quite impressive. I love every song, and really dig the production of the album. My vote for the Grammy for Album of the Year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nashville...Please take notice of this album","review":"I came upon this album as a long time White Stripes fan. It's rare for me buy a country album, however the previous country album I eagerly purchased was the O Brother Where Art Thou album -- a multi-platimium selling collection of pure original-country roots songs. Nashville, you need to take a lesson from Jack White and start producing honest, genuine, unadulterated country music -- the kind of country music that made the genre great during the 60s-70s. Why has it taken a leading musician from rock music to show you that this music can appeal to the masses? As for the album itself, I won't add much to the accolades that have already been posted except to say, buy this album! It is, and will be, a classic. Congratulations to Jack White for helping to remind us all that Loretta Lynn is an American musical treasure who is as musically vibrant as when she left Kentucky to break into her legendary music career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"I bought this CD because I'm a big White Stripes fan. It's pretty cool. I've never really listend to Country music before, it's something different and new than what I'm used to. I like this CD, it's very good. Especially Loretta and Jack's duet. After listening to this I'm definately more open minded about checking out new styles of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grammy material","review":"Classic Loretta with true grit. An excellent mix of sounds/style thanks to White and Loretta's well of experience. Portland OR had my ear from the beginning with the music, then Loretta's voice had my heart. All the songs' lyrics are solid, good clear country with a tweak to the music. And the mix of types of songs are well thought out, you swing from one thing to another effortlessly. I hope the Grammys recognize an excellent body of work and doesn't just pay homage to the current rock/country big bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best music I have heard in years","review":"The most stunning and relevant album I have listened to since Radiohead's OK Computer. Wonderful song writing, passionate honest singing. I'm not a country music fan, but this album trancends classification. Definitely refreshing in this era of over produced pop music garbage they force down our throats on the radio. Anyone who loves great songwriting should own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country fusion with a little snarl","review":"WOW! This album transcends all expectations I heard about it. The album sounds like it was recorded in an old kentucky coal mine, dirty and gritty, country roots at its finest. \\"Portland Oregon\\" is a fine example of the hard country fusion Jack has melted with the traveled voice of Loretta. They go back and forth about a crazy night in Portland with a pitcher of slow gin fizz. Another awesome track is Have mercy which sounds like Jack, Meg, and Loretta. This album will win many awards, mark my words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Gone Goood!!!","review":"Not all but most country music artists today much like not all but most rock artists have lost their edge. And what I mean by that is that the passion to be original and innovative is gone. They are all doing what so-in-so did to get popular. Jack White, a old school style, but yet original style rocker has teamed up with Loretta Lynn to give you this old school country yet refreshing origianl sound (not this popish $t#ff) that they are feeding our airwaves and t.v. channels. Did I mention I am only 20? Yes young but not fooled by what is original good music and what seems to make a quick dollar type music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice effort from Loretta","review":"I bought this cd and was very pleased. The songs are very wellwritten and Loretta voice is as good as ever. The only complaintI have is that sometimes the music seems too loud and overcomesher beautiful voice. However, this is only true on a few numbers. The cd is well worth buying for the outstanking cuts: Family Tree, Miss Being Mrs., and Trouble On The Line. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the year","review":"It's hard for musicians to reinvent themselves or do something new and exciting so late in their careers. It's great that Jack White has got involved with someone like Loretta Lynn, because then maybe young people will start listening to older music. All the songs are pretty exciting, a mix of rock and country. Country music never sounded so weird and fun. It is a revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't like country, but WOW!","review":"I'm not a big country fan, but I am a big White Stripes fan. This album is great. A mix of country and blue-grass with a hint of the White Stripes stripped-down rock.It's easy to see why Loretta Lynn has entured over the years: her voice is a beautiful combination of sultry country hurtin' and good-time rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger: This Album May Prove Addictive","review":"Like many other reviewers I cannot stop listening to this cd.While at times extremely traditional it can occasionallyrock like Elvis (\\"Have Mercy\\"). Its greatest gift to thelistener is in having Lynn write her own songs again, thusechoing her classic period in the 1960s and early 70s. \\"Storyof My Life\\" updates Coal Miner's Daughter while \\"Family Tree\\"and \\"Mrs. Leroy Brown\\" take her earlier cheatin' songs innew directions, thematically and musically. \\"Trouble on theLine\\" and \\"Miss Being Mrs.\\" will touch your heart while\\"High on a Mountaintop\\" will lift your spirit.Its an album people will remember many many years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Lear Rose Wilts","review":"I have been a Loretta Lynn fan for years so imagine my surprise when I purchased her new album \\"Van Lear Rose\\" after hearing all the rave reviews and couldn't believe what I heard! The album is a totally ill-produced mess, with Lynn seeming so out of place in nearly every tune. The sound is just awful, despite Lynn's usually competent vocals, and the backup band fights her at every turn. I wish these songs could have been produced by someone who could hear! Owen Bradley would have just laughed or cried. I'm not sure which. No comparison to White. And I can't beleive Loretta could have heard the final result without screaming \\"NO! This jus' don't work!)\\". Sorry,kids, but for me it really sucked the big one and I got totally got taken in by my faith in her integrity as an artist.The rose has wilted and died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extemely Disappointed","review":"This cd was an extreme disappointment to me. I got through over half the cd and couldn't bear to listen any longer. The album cover was beautiful and led me to believe that I was going to hear some new, traditional country sounding Loretta Lynn music. The lyrics were ok, but the music was strange and even sometimes disturbing. If you miss the old style country music from the 50s and 60s don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oof!

It is jsut plain junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Loretta's best work.","review":"There are a couple of good songs in this collection, but this isn't Loretta's best work. In my opinion,it's her worst. The CD sounds like it's a practice session. The band does not sound professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed in this CD. It was more rock than country. The music was dissonant, loud, and got on my nerves. I really like Loretta Lynn, but this is definately not one of her better efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless, remarkable","review":"Unlike many of the other people who have posted reviews, I am not a fan of the White Stripes, and although I of course I respect Loretta Lynn and her legacy to music, I have never purchased one of her albums. I am, however, a fan of great art, so I bought \\"Van Lear Rose\\" because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has received.I am so impressed by the artistry of this album. The lyrics are superb, the musical accompaniment is perfect, and Loretta's vocals are - what can I say? - not at all time-worn. Rather, her delivery is warm, heartfelt, filled with pathos & pain, yet shot through with optimism. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of music with the highest artistic value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Country Album Anyone Can Grasp Onto","review":"I've never been one to shun country music anyway, but this is one country album that can appeal to almost anyone. With Loretta Lynn's sweet and charming vocals mixed with Jack White's edgy production, the result is what country music should be: gritty and touching. Up until the release of Van Lear Rose, Ms. Lynn was basically a has-been, but just like Rick Rubin's masterful productions of Johnny Cash's American Recordings, Jack White has rejuvenated Loretta Lynn's sound and career. The production has not taken away from Loretta's unique sound, rather, it has updated her sound to please her longtime fans and to appeal to newer listeners. Jack White has been unofficially producing albums since he was thirteen, so he is no stranger to getting music onto an album. He's not just a hip, young trophy for Loretta to hold on to. He is a masterful producer who has enhanced Loretta's style. This is absolutely the best album of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collaboration","review":"The only question is, who do we thank first? Jack White or Loretta Lynn? Lynn's songwriting and amazingly powerful singing and the outstanding playing and arrangments of White create a real masterpiece. This is no gimmic. Good, honest, authentic Americana music."},{"rating":"2","title":"van lear rose","review":"I have to say this is one great cd. i have been playing it for 1 week now, and it took me 5 days to get past the first two songs, van lear rose and portland oregon. i kept playing them over and over and over!!! i thought could the rest of it be that good??IT SURE WAS !!!!!! i wonder can you wear out a cd by over playing the songs??

It was dumbed down and disjointed and quite frankly, it wasn't exactly accurate to the gospels. It was more of a \\"what if\\" from a fictitious perspective which makes it fiction, not a tool for evangelism like they claim. It was cute, but something just really bugs me about the scriptures not being portrayed accurately. Furthermore, it was boring to me, and I think that anything but a first grader would be bored too. But Jesus is NOT boring, so it must be the movie ;) Additionally, the actor sounded like Ringo Starr which was distracting to me, but he was a terrific actor in this film despite the the distracting accent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this purchase","review":"This DVD was very disappointing for several reasons. The main character (a boy) was contentious toward his father on several occasions, yet received no real correction for it and showed no sign of repentance. Several children meet up at night without any parental supervision on different occasions, and at one point two of the boys get into a brawl. I honestly could only handle watching about 30 minutes of this and had to turn it off. I would not show this DVD to my children because of the ill fruit it might produce in their character. The portrayal of Jesus and his disciples seemed much more on track with what I was looking for.

Consequently we read everything that, evenly obliquely, touches the Cayman Islands.

I gave it one star. I gave it one star because there isn't really a plot, main character (at least with a name), and it is boring. The book is sort of written in a mix between the first person and third person perspectives. The book is hard to understand, especially with 2 two page long sentences! The book kind of seems like it is someone thinking, with no real reason. It skips from one place to another in one chapter. It is hard to get into the story, and since there is no plot, there is little suspense.

I especially like the realism in the situations they faced, and the fact that not every conflict was neatly vanquished and tucked away.

I turned it on and it looked great with the dark purple black lights. Unfortunately, it did not zap any bugs. It was broken right out of the box.

They fly all around it in safety.Plus the grids are not side-by-side like the Flowtron, but one grid is inside the other, closer to the lights. So if the bugs are too big, like moths, they can't make it through the outer grid and never get zapped.

The Ridgeland Community Theater has fallen on hard times, and with good reason. The acting is terrible, the sets look like cardboard children's toys, and the production values are abysmal. But there are still actors who want to be a part of this little theater troupe, and one of them is killing off the cast.Opening Fright could have been \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" meets \\"Friday the 13th,\\" but there's just one problem--you can't tell where the intentional bad acting and special effects leave off and the real acting and effects begin.

Yet, I believe that it fails in appealing to its target audience of 4-8 year olds. In reading this book to my 4 1/2 year old daughter, she almost immediately tuned out.

Is it what he does and only what he does? How does he know what he does isn't fake? He tackles issues about mixing styles and such (that it is not for the serious practioner), but does he realize that's what people have done for centuries? No! Praying Mantis blends monkey and mantis moves, White Crane mixes birds with the ape,etc. I've looked a long time for a good non-instructional Kung Fu book(with in- depth history and philosophy), and this proves to be a disappointment. Kung fu is way too diverse to generalize into a certain \\"way\\" like other martial arts. Mr. Hsu attempts to do way too much in so few pages. A noble attempt, yes, but the many flavors of Kung Fu are best left exposed by the many practioners of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give it 5 stars but...","review":"Let me clarify several things from this book.A) The book is absolutely fantastic. Definitely in my top 5 favorite martial arts books (Along with Zen in the Martial arts, Meditations on Violence, & others).Adam Hsu is a longtime practitioner of traditional martial arts, is skilled, and knows his stuff.Now that that's clarified..B) Adam Hsu is VERY Gung ho about what is \\"real\\" kung fu. He is most certainly a purist, and seems to be disgusted by all these other false forms of Kung fu. That's alright, but it seems to echo throughout the book very strongly.This book NEEDS to be added to any martial artist's library, especially if you study kungfu."},{"rating":"2","title":"empty mind","review":"I enjoyed reading this collection of short essays on various aspects of kung-fu teaching, practice and history.

I'm honestly considering selling them to make room for books that are easier to understand and that don't try so hard to write off the beaten path (formula romance novels for instance) that they stray off in so many other directions that the reader is lost time and again, yet keep the same stupid romance novel story line; stupid, stubborn virgin girl (arabella) and broodish mountain of a man (john)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"This book makes you feel good about being \\"gifted\\" - you know you aren't the only one around in that situation.

Most high school students need all the help they can get, and there is no more help available in a single volume than here.As far as I know, Norton Critical has never published P&P;, but I know they'd do a good enough job to rival this. But for now, this is the edition you want, if you want to understand the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough coverage","review":"The pluses - it was comfortable, reasonably priced. The minus was that it did not cover enough of my thumb to be of use to keep my \\"trigger thumb\\" from bending - which hurts a lot. I have a small hand, I ordered the small size, but the thumb part didn't extend high enough to immobilize my thumb. I did not return it because after just one day's wear, the stitching was coming loose at the top of the thumb sleeve so I just skipped it. For anyone with this problem, just wrap your thumb with about two turns of that self-sticking bandage wrap stuff that's available in different widths - I use 1\\" - and is flesh tone which frankly looks better than a bright blue thing that everyone feels compelled to ask you about. Unless you like that sort of thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Champion wrist/thumb support-","review":"This is a good product that offers light support for strained wrists/thumbs but maintains flexibility. My daughter uses it for basketball and needs something lightweight to offer support but allow movement. Fits somewhat large so if you are on the border of the sizes, go down a size rather than up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Looking For","review":"After my initial recovery from an RCL tear in my left thumb (7 weeks in a cast, 8 weeks in a removable hard splint, and 11 weeks of OT), I was looking for a brace that would support my thumb but allow movement of my wrist. I'm pretty active in exercise(swimming, yoga, Pilates, aerobics, water aerobics, weight training), so I needed something that I could wear while doing these activities. The CHAMPION Neoprene Wrist/Thumb Support did not have the support I was looking for. I wore it once during a water aerobics class and in order to get any support from this item I had to adjust the tightness to the point that my hand went numb. This product would be great if it had some support bars along the sides and top of the thumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit well, causes dumbness","review":"Bought one for my wife when she was experiencing pain in wrist and thumb from holding our newborn. Measured her wrist to be about 5.9 inches in circumference, so it is within the range recommended for the small size. With the Velcro strap aligned properly, it was too loose and did not provide much wrist support at all. To get it tighter, we had to stick the velcro on the blue part of the wrap. However, wearing it tight like this to support the wrist caused thumb numbness after a few minutes, so she stopped using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good baseball","review":"This is a great value. I run a travel ball program and buy a bucket of these blem balls for each team. They make great practice balls. Blemishes are usually small such as a small indentation, and some of the stitch holes are stretched. They are just not up to the Wilson standards but are still very good practice baseballs.These are a great buy and would recommend these for any team looking to stretch their budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King Of Pop.......","review":"I like the DVD.....mostly for the Oprah part of it.

Why isn't there any synopsis of what the interviews are? It is an insult to me that the producer of this video chooses to not tell the potential customer anything about the product! I refuse to give money to people who don't seem to care enough about me as a Michael Jackson fan. It seems that you have something to hide....if this is NOT the case, then give a description of this video. Is that too much for the customer to ask?! I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no description?","review":"I agree with everyone else. Alot of people are making money off of Michael Jackson and we're the ones paying for it.If it's the Interviews by Rabbi Schmuley Botteach I'd consider buying them as I am now reading the book and it's very interesting.But this that they are advertising can be anything by anyone!

First Evan Chandler--father of Jordan Chandler, the boy who first accused Michael of molestation--committed suicide by handgun, sparking speculation that he'd perhaps done so out of guilt over the whole child molestation scandal that arguably started the downward spiral of the fallen King Of Pop's bizarre life. We shall never really know, and there was no suicide note at the scene.Sorry, just ordered this video two hrs. ago.

It is interviews with Michael Jackson himself from the age of 10, with Barbara Walters, Oprah (amazing interview), Diane Sawyer with Lisa Marie Presley by his side, etc.There is one \\"interview\\" with Michael with LaToya in the early 80's where you get to see Michael is a typical brother. LaToya doesn't understand one of the questions asked of her and MJ rolls his eyes and says in a Groucho Marx voice \\"I have an idiot for a sister.\\" Hysterical. I laughed out loud and had to replay it a few times because it was so great.This DVD gives a true picture of who Michael Jackson is as a person. Nice.Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed it","review":"This video is great in delving deeper into the person Michael Jackson was, getting beyond all the media hype. I found it very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cary's triptych","review":"I have just reread Cary's three novels, Herself Surprised, To Be a Pilgrim and The Horse's Mouth. It is amzing that books written during the second world war should be so secure in their tone about a vanishing England and its history. Cary uses his three entirely diffeent voices - tricky sensuous woman, nervy religious dirty old man, obsessed manipulative artist- better than anyone else i know uses the limitations of the first person to show what we do and don't know about each other. His descriptions of places and things are delicious. Also I shd like to say what beautiful books the New York Review paperbacks are to handle and read. Most people know The Horse's Mouth, and many know Herself Surprised . I'm not sure To Be A Pilgrim isn't the best and most surprising of the three- which is saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is truly a great book","review":"My take on Sara Monday is very different from what I'm reading here. I believe that she loved life and indulged herself in its pleasures. At the same time she was a nurturing soul. Read it for yourself to decide about her character. Gulley Jimson is also a great character. The descriptions in this book are wonderful. She describes the sea as being like oven glass one day and the edges of knives another. It is so good that I didn't want it to end, and now I'm going to read the other two books in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Africa-brought to life","review":"It's a very real look at Old Africa. It shows the truth of man's bad luck, bad descisions, greed, and life filled with hard times. It shows nature in it's true self, not some Disney version of happy animals dancing around. This is an excellent book and should serve as a wake up call for the multitudes of Americans who believe the garbage that is spoon fed to them on their televisions. It may be well more than most readers can handle, because the truth is not sugar coated here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayjah Mojo","review":"Moleskine Pocket Journal - Plain PagesI love this book! I lived in North Africa, briefly, but had friends that lived in Kenya and places where safaris actually happen. So, I have heard many first hand accounts of life in modern day Africa, (Malaria!) but thanks to the gorgeous photographs, torn bits of history, diary entries, drawings and Beard's interesting explanations, I could experience a different Africa. Aside from actually undergoing a painful series of shots, venturing into the grasslands, climbing Kilamanjaro, or just trying to figure out the settings on my camera, I think reading or just gazing at this book makes the perfect African holiday.

She has meticulously reviewed and analysed the literature and film on or related to Mary Magdalene. She has summarized the limited archaeological work done at Migdal.Perhaps I have been afraid of Virginia Woolf. Now I will read her work, and try to compare it with the work of Mary Ann Evans. I have been interested in what Evans says about religion.I find Schaberg's discovery of allusion to 2 Kings 2 in John 20 to be breathtaking... I will be spending a lot of time with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New perspective","review":"Having never given much thought to Mary Magdalene, a professor suggested this book.

Lets go write a book about those other white christians. You know the ones that are warm but strange and definately not up to British standards.Let's poke fun at what they think about women and nationalism.

Then lets skip half the Othodox world, ignore what was there before Christianity (and still is) and pronounce a thesis based on this sardonic approach. This is what you have here, green eggs and spam. Not to be confused with reality. Not even a mention of Roxolana, the Orhtodox Queen of the Turks, let alone Berehinia the nature god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased beyond belief","review":"This book begins with the author feeling oppressed that she cannot get on to Mt. Athos. Athos like most monastic environments is segregated by gender. (I can't enter the clositer-enclosure of a convent of Carmelite nuns either). This diatribe aginst the Holy Mountain and its 1000 year old traditions signals the author's extreme bias against Orthodoxy Orthodoxy is seen as the source of all the evils and problems in Post-Soviet Eastern Europe.

Not a word is wasted here; every one of them counts toward the whole. As with good poetry,as much is implied as stated outright here.This is a story of initiation, of a young boy's coming to grips with his family and community and his own place in them. The book's final image, of the boy Nathan carrying his dying grandfather home, serves to sum up this theme perfectly.This is a gentle novel and an auspicious beginning to an important saga of place and people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Georgie","review":"Not nearly as good as I wanted it to be - very slow moving with pedestrian content, and not much action.

I picked up at a Deseret Industries for a dollar and I have to say that this was a dollar well spent. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Period. It is beautiful, and almost lyrical in its compositon at times. It is well researched, and it has a feel of good quality. It is especially good as a period piece. You feel like you are there. Its more about the times of Jesus then anything, and what it would feel like to live in that time period. The only thing I didn't like was Pauls sexual frustrations...besides that it is a perfect book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and Tiresome","review":"I got through about 250 pages before I finally became discouraged. The constant preaching of the tone of the book is tiresome as if the feels that the reader will not see her point without constant preaching. I wanted to read about St. Paul, but I will look elsewhere.While I enjoy a good, long story, this book should be condensed by at least 50%. Obviously, it appealed to a number of reviewers, so I would suggest reading 100 pages. If you are not into the book, put it down.

Its many quotations from and references to the Bible makes it seem very accurate in terms of adherence to historical events. I'd like to know if there are any sources to support her many details of Saul's (St. Paul's) life that are not found in the Bible. Some of them are very hard to believe, but made the book interesting and hard to put down. I was very impressed by the author's ability to describe St. Paul's (and other's) inner feelings, as well as her descriptions of the landscapes and cities of the time. I'm looking forward to reading some of her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for personal studies!","review":"I studied English literature in college as well as some upper level French, but this is my first serious endeavor to study French literature. I like the structure and organization of the book very much! There is plenty of cultural, historical, and literary context for each movement, as well as introductions to each author and suggestions for further study. Each poem has a page by page translation to help with vocabulary building, but no other critique offered on the poem itself.I like the book because it is well balanced but allows the reader to explore at his or her own pace. With plenty of information to read, but structure to skip over what you like, I think this book is well suited for those who would like to peruse it in their own leisure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"French Poetry for French Students","review":"This book is irritatingly vague. It may be an excellent book for those who are widely familiar with French and French history, but for anyone who has never studied it before I would not at all recommend it. The explanations of the movements were not often very informative and very hard to understand due to the references they make but never explain. I learned very little from reading this book. It would have been better as a book of poems alone, so that the person compiling them did not have to do any extra work than to copy what other authors had already written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The ink itself is good, except too little to print for replace another new one.

Furthermore, one idea is to walk away (from a friend) and then on the next page is states to talk to a friend. Which is it?

Hundreds of toys have since been found in coastlands around the world, shedding light on our understanding of how currents, winds and tides interact. This book traces the story of one bathtub toy from the time its crate boards the ship until it is found by a boy in Alaska. The story draws young readers in by personifying the toy as if it is experiencing its journey as a sentient creature. Caldecott Medal Winner David Wisniewski illustrates the story in cut-paper collage, skillfully rendering the dramatic power of the ocean without being too frightening. This is an unusual story that may not appeal to every reader, but for those who prefer \\"real\\" stories or who are interested in science, it's a sure winner. It's best suited for preschoolers and early elementary readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I have been using these insulated cups for years, when I broke the last of the originals, I couldn't find them anywhere, someone told me to try Amazon.

Because they are wonderful they feel good when you were them. The reason I gave the shoes 4 stars is because they don't make them for women becuse most women play sports like: basketball, and other sports. I think that they are wonderful as a matter of fact you should buy some and I mean right now! Go, run and get these before there is none let.

It's pace is pitch perfect, the various voices work wonders and the ending is so gorgeous it blew me, a writer too, away. In addition, See is hilarious, generous, and writes as if it is easy, which we authors know is not so.I don't think anyone here wouldn't simply LOVE this book. Go, Carolyn See, may you have great success with this masterpiece filled with love, prophecy, sadness and most of all, somehow you managed to be hilarious all the way thru.You are my ideal writer. Thank you so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Will Never Be Another You","review":"This was an unexpectedly good book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I finished it in a couple of hours. It was a very real story with a strange twist. I thought about it a lot after I finished it. I am surprised it isn't on a best seller list. If Oprah was still doing her old book club it would be an Oprah pick for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow characters, rediculous plot!","review":"I find myself wondering if maybe the previous reviewers were relatives of the author or work at her publishing house.I did not find this novel interesting or engaging. And yes, I did finish it. The characters were all shallow, self centered cliches, and the \\"plot\\" revolves loosely around some completely unbelievable espionage thread relating to biological terrorism. None of the characters seems able to engage with the world or with anyone in it in any meaningful way, they just drift off into thier own lonely, selfish, self imposed exiles. I found it sad and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"joan didion, no she is not!","review":"This is not a great book and it's barely a good book. The first chapter is captivating: a widow re-emerging from the shock and just trying to live day to day. Then it degenerates into a Desperate Older Housewives using terrorism as a convenient sideplot. If she'd stuck with the first chapter and gone from there, it would have been decent. Don't waste your time on this one. I want to smack everyone but the old lady upside the head. And then even she goes idiotic. UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There will never be another book as bad as this","review":"I guess I can't complain since I didn't actually spend money on this but borrowed it from the local library. I guess I'll never get my time back. The characters were not interesting and more annoying than anything, and the plot was absurd. It was some time ago when I read this, I do read a lot of books - I'm trying hard to push this one out of my mind.

I can't recommend this book though you might want to try it out for yourself based on some of the more positive reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, fun, and touching","review":"Immensely readable, thoroughly enjoyable, and ultimately poignant.

The photo quality is remarkable - better than any lab has produced for us - and the speed is jaw dropping compared to Epson.Haven't done large format photos yet - but have regularly printed 11 x 17 B/W CAD drawings - which are incredibly crisp even on plain paper. Tiny type is readable on reduced checkplots. I should have put a stopwatch to it, but it seems that a reduced D size print with complex title bar/graphics comes out in 15 seconds or so. Just received some 13 x 19 paper so that we can print D size (24 x 36) plots at exactly half size - giving accurate 1/8\\" scale drawings for example for what would be 1/4\\" scale on the plotter.Separate ink tanks, quality and speed are what drew us to this printer.

This canon is half the cost of the epson and it blows it away. The reviews are accurate it is a perfect printer. I have not had one misprint yet. The epson only gets the color right about half the time.The hp was fine for regular print jobs, but the resolution on my last 13x19 print was unreal.separate ink tanks are a bit of a pain, but they save you money in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!!","review":"I am very pleased with my new i9100 printer.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about photography"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but Beware of Booklet Mode!","review":"This is another fine addition to the Canon line, but an unnecessary limitation in Booklet Mode limits its use for engineering applications where one must retain precise scales.Print an engineerring drawing in Normal and it comes out by default scaled exactly as the source document. (Of course, you can scale it up or down at your option if you wish.) One inch on the source prints out as one inch on the printout.Booklet mode, however, forces an unsuspected margin and scales the output down slightly. There is no provision in the driver to supress this scaling. Otherwise, this printer does everything else very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pictures, high cost ink, limited printer life","review":"I have used the S9000 for three years, mainly to print 11x17 drawings. It has been a flawless printer, but today I purchase another brand. I am so mad I could spit!Apparently the Canon products have a spent ink container that cannot be self serviced. There isn't a sensor to indicate that it is filled, the printer just stops working after a given time period or set number of copies. I have tried the internet codes to reset the printer, but to no avail.The local Canon service center wants $100 to reset the codes. Add to the fact that a complete Canon ink refill is about $90 and this printer is too expensive to keep.Whatever marketing genius came up with this plan to get more money from their client base has lost my loyalty and business forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I purchased the i9100 after my old hp died. I searched the webread reviews and everything looking for the best printer, not considering cost. I thought this was it, but not so, it was, in my opinion junk. MY old hp that cost 130 dollars printed circles around this thing. It must be just this one, I can't believe a 500 dollar printer prints like this. I'm returning this one and ordering a new one just to see if I got a bad one.

All the characters do is repeat the same lines over+over again. Larry David needs massive amounts of serious therapy. Michael Richards is 20th rate Robin Williams+the rest of the cast is just as bad.

Sounds like the reason why SeinDVDs aren't out yet are for the fact that everyone watches them on TV and the fanbase increases and increases worldwide....and it's still making money on the TV. If people really want DVD, stop watching them on the TV :) A whole season would be what....like $50 or more? Multiply that by 9 and you have $450. Add a inflation equal to the time it takes for all 9 seasons to be available and you have maybe $700+ cost. Invest that money in a set-top DVD recorder and record your own personal favorites like you would VCR. The commercials would be a nostaglic :O) Cause who really cares to watch all of the episodes.

At the top of my all time list of shows and comedians that have never made me laugh, not even a snicker, snort, or chuckle, nay not even a smile is Seinfeld.

One episode is about shrinkage, the next show is about Keith Hernendez's loogie, the next one George is making like a bed under his desk. No plot, no cliffhangers, just dumb simple minded buffoonery.

There was even an episode that addressed this premise where all the characters ended up in prison because of their indifference as Kramer filmed a fat man being mugged and the \\"gang\\" just stood around making commentary.That's the beauty and cleverness of the show; it pokes fun at people's indifference towards each other while showing the neurotic side of human nature. Those of you that have lived in a \\"big city\\" will definitely understand this. It will leave you saying \\"I can't believe he/she just said or did that!\\" It's a jovial poke at the 80's-90's yuppie/slacker over-analytical crowd.Warning!!!

The second season on this dvd has unforgetable episodes like the one where George goes to tell off a pregnant woman at her own baby shower and the one where Jerry offends an old Polish woman by saying he hates people who had ponys while growing up.

The early series also include Jerry's stand up routines, which I like!Now, some people prefer the later series, many of which omit the stand up routines, and show the main characters to be selfish, and mean.

And it would be the best dvd set yet (the best, Jerry! The best!).However, you'll have to be Superman to get all 179 Seinfeld episodes on dvd. I craved, I've yearned.

Beto is the film's principal character. He makes his living bicycling into Brazil to smuggle goods back to Melo shopkeepers. Beto hatches the most grandiose money-making scheme of all -- to build an indoor toilet for the anticipated crowds. Using his wife's pin money for their daughter's education, Beto builds his toilet. The crowds never arrive, and the residents of Melo are left poorer than before. The film is based on Pope John Paul II's 1988 visit to Melo in which only three hundred visitors arrived out of the predicted thousands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Table Topper","review":"Husband and wife team, Claudia Nizza and Billy Mernit, took many conversations and made a very dear little book.

Mina tells a gritty story that was as fascinating as it was disturbing.Mina ties together all of the unresolved items from the previous two books (hence RESOLUTION) very nicely. I was totally satisfied with how things played out.Mina is the writer that other authors such as Karin Slaughter wish they could be and I would hope in the future that Mina brings Maureen back, perhaps 10 or 15 years older. She is an interesting, intriguing character and it seems there is a lot more to her story that can be explored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resolution by Denise Mina","review":"This is the final book of the Garnethill trilogy (Garnethill, Exile, Resolution) with tortured heroine Maureen O'Donnell. Mina tackles very dark topics (incest, domestic abuse, alcoholism among others) and manages to squeeze humor as well empathy for the characters and a love of Glasgow out of her novels. Mina does for Glasgow what Ian Rankin and John Rebus have done for Edinburgh. If you are looking for a gritty unexpected crime solver with charming Scottish dialogue, this is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admirable attempt","review":"I have to admit, being a little bit too snooty on the DJ side, that some of the mixes are not \\"perfect\\". But the whole is a great collection of how house and RnB and some 'experimental' jazz-house fusion can work together. Some of the vocals seemed a little too childish sounding and too pre-teen qualities to it. However the compilation of these differing points of great SOUL are worth it. Great points: 'I'm on Fire' - solid attempt @ some Portishead-ish sound, 'Glorious' - great FUNK, 'Gotta Go' - sassy power with soul!, 'Do For You' - okay expect for the 'perfect wife' line I was really diggin its mix of vocals and production, and the mellow 'Anything you say' is great chill fulfilling music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalga","review":"Great CD.

He summarizes the causes which started the revolution, the events which happened during the revolution, and the effects it caused, some of which have reverberated down to the modern day. The short chapters make the book easy to read in a few sittings, and the chapter titles give the reader the direction for the chapter (Why it happened, how it happened, what it ended, what it started). Doyle mentions all the key players, political parties, and the international incidents the revolution impacted.Also included is a very detailed timeline, a note on the Revolutionary calendar, and a nice selection of suggestions for further reading.

I think this is a very unique and special album. I confess, being a guitarist, Tal Farlow was the draw, and Tal does not disappoint (nor do Charles Mingus or Red Norvo). The musicianship here is pretty mind-boggling. Red Norvo had a penchant for FAST tempos, and many of these tracks absolutely burn. The arrangements all have a distinct, cool-swinging, 1950's vibe that I really enjoy. Retro-cool, baby. For listeners interested in jazz guitar, Tal Farlow was one of the most technically astounding guitarists that jazz has ever seen, and these sides clearly illuminate and underscore that fact. As such, I recommend this to jazz guitar enthusiasts. The only complaint is the audio quality, which, to my ears, seems fairly flat and poor, even by early '50's standards. Real jazz aficionados understand that you have to roll with poor audio quality when you're digging for pearls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad software","review":"This scanner has probably good hardware but you can expect big problems with software.

I only got one and decided that I at least need one more while one is in the laundry.18 months hasn't even put any wear or tear on it, even washing it at least once a week hasn't stopped this durable pad.It is a perfect gift for someone.In fact we love ours!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover shrunk and was rough after first wash","review":"I purchased a yellow one (from Babies R Us) and emerald green one (from Baby Depot). After using it a few times, I gave up. Recently, I started using them again (after 8 mths) because the vinyl covering is beginning to break up and is not comfortable for my son. I didnt like this for the following reasons:(a) it shrunk after the first wash and was difficult to fit nicely over the pad. it caused the pad to curl up.(b) it got rougher after each wash and fibrous strands started to stray;(c) no way to use the strap with the cover on.Also a tip, with the frequent pee bath my son gave us in the first few months, I needed to change the pad cover almost every time I changed his diaper. It was easier to use the changing pad without a cover because the vinyl sheet was much easier to clean up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Buy Just One!","review":"If it had slits for the safety straps it would have gotten 5 stars. You need these for your changing pad and what a time saver. If there's an accident, just change the pad(perfect at night when all you want to do is go back to sleep).They're easy to get on and off.

I tried the cover on before washing. Little particles were falling all over the place. I read the directions about washing. I washed it in cold water. My mistake was probably putting it in the dryer. It said it was okay to dry. I don't know if hanging it to dry would have made a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible- falls apart, not worth the money","review":"We bought two of these changing pad covers.

The stamping, welds, and \\"triple chrome plating\\" looks at least as good, if not better, then the OEM bumper I had. The bumper came with all brackets, bolts, and the bumper reinforcement bar, which is welded onto the bumper, so no need to order these parts seperately. You will need to go to the dealership and order the retaining clips for the spare tire crank access door. The only problem I had, was Amazon sent the wrong bumper the first time, looked like it was made for a older Ford truck. One email to Amazon, the correct bumper was sent, arriving in two days, and the incorrect bumper was picked up. No problem, no hassle, typical Amazon customer service.

After reading a portion of the book, I got the feeling that Conti/Finkel had written this book based on the mistaken belief that they could explain it better than those who had gone before.In my opinion, they failed.

I've received emails hyping this book for several weeks through their mailing list, and I'm sure book sales reflect these tactics. Overall the book is well-written and easy to read.

The techniques that Peter teaches make so much sense and can work anywhere.

There are all kinds of people in the real estate business, and then there are sharks....In terms of the book itself, some of the tactics here are simply unethical. Much of the book relies on owner-financed deals. In order to get the owners to accept below market interest rates, the authors suggest labeling the payments \\"thank you payments\\" instead of interest. \\"Just by labeling the payment this way you de-emphasize the need to get an interest rate\\" (p. 103). Lessons in how to deceive and swindle, sweet dreams.They also suggest you push for a same day decision on any property.

After reading this book you can't go out and make a million, but with a little time and work you could make some very profitable investments. Real estate deals aren't born they are made. This book gives detailedexamples and good techniques to use when you start to Create a deal. Most books give you just enough information and then tell you to buy their $250 program to find out more. Mr. Conti took one real estate investing technique (lease option) and went into detail about it.

Orange slices look great and you can eat them without squirting juice all over. I sliced apples & made cinnamon apple bake.

I was and it cost me a trip to the emergence room, 10 stitches to sew the end of my thumb back on. It went right through it and left it sitting on the cutting board. OUCH!I see that others have had the same misfortune. I should add that I had it set on #4, which translates to about 3/16 to 1/4 inch slices. That's how much of my thumb was removed.

When using the slider, be VERY CAREFUL, my hand slipped while on the french fry setting and sliced the palm of my hand--yes--right over the blades, then, my hand sliped and somehow sliced my finger underneath the mandoline. I still can't figure out how I managed to do that.

The old one actually works better than this.I really have to shove the vegetables through to cut them. It really shouldn't require the excertion I'm needing to use. If it's so sharp, WHY must I shove so hard? It seems like the potato, onion, or whatever gets stuck halfway thru the slice consistently. I'm wondering if this is what causes people to slip and cut their fingers. It's a little frightening. I'm dissapointed to say the least.Other than that, I think the product is fine. Once you've used it a few times, you remember how to open it and use the options.Not ready to toss my old one just yet though!

I have watched the video online, the DVD inside the box and.... I found a way to cut off my fingers! So be careful when you are using this mandoline. I had cut potatoes and it was a breeze, perfectly sliced saving you a lot of time to cook. The catch is with long veggies like zucchinis and squashes as you have to start slicing them without the food holder.... make sure that when you come to 2 inches left on them to start to use the food holder otherwise an accident may happen quickly... slicing with this is a time saver but can become a nightmare at the ER so be careful!

First of all, this thing is simply way too wide. That isn't necessarily a bad thing for everyone, but the next thing is. Whatever this is made out of, it burns. It burns the tongue and mouth, the vagina, even the skin. We have other toys of similar design, and none do this. It can't be any sort of allergy, because it affected both wife and I and we have completely different skin types.

I found it nearly worhtless although I was pleased with the WSAD 4 coverage. However, explanations are minimal and trying to deploy your first app to WebSphere 4 using this book was a waste. After reading and re-reading everything it said, we still had no success so we just dug in, trial and error, several days and finally got it. Discussions on virtual hosts offered us nothing but a few descriptions that only make sense after you understand what a virtual host is. With paragraph after paragraph labeled understanding, I would have thought some would have been imparted - we needed quick understanding in a real project and the way things are today, we needed it fast. The book gets rarely referenced by myself. There is just not enough in depth explanation to save one from the school of \\"hard knocks\\". A student, with time may get some value as an introduction but overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for the newbies","review":"I bought this book because it was marketed as a guide for the beginners and intermediates. Lie.I needed to learn websphere for my job, so after the first few chapters I had to stop because the thing started to fly way over my head. All I needed was something to explain me the basics and the most common architecture and mechanics.This book doesn't do that. Maybe if you are a veteran with Websphere, this might be good, but if you are looking for something to get you started, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had what I needed","review":"I recently started a job that is using WAS for their application server. I needed a reference book to help jump start me, and I felt this book did a great job. It covers the install and admin pieces quite well, and I am beginning to go through the development sections. I like the fact that they have a lot of code examples and an overall running project example. I get alot of use from looking at actual working code. The book does use the WSAD(WebSphere Studio Application Developer) tool to illustrate the examples, but I just used my favorite editor and Javac with out any problems.

I wonder what the use of Jesus sacrifice was if one can enter heaven through Allah or Buddah. None.And that is because there is no other way to eternal life exept through Jesus Christ. This book can only lead a person away from the truth and into deception. Jesus died to take our sins away so that we can come clean before God and so that when God sees us He will see Jesus in us, thus giving us the right to enter heaven without blemish. Believe in Jesus and you shall be saved.

Wanting desperately to be 'Caliph instead of the Caliph.' , he comes up continuously with plans to get rid of the incumbent , which always backfire on the miserable Iznogoud.Iznogoud's penchant for evil invention, together with the charming illustrations and witty dialogue makes for charming albums, by the same people who brought you Asterix.In fact in 'Asterix and the Magic Carpet' a reference is made to Iznogoud, as Asterix and friends is to battle against Watzisname, Iznogoud's evil cousin in India, in order to save the lovely Princess Orinjade.I was given a couple of these books, as a present when I was eight, and absolutely loved them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible writer...book worth reading, but not his best.","review":"SRL always delivers a great read, but this book didn't reach the same level of excellence as the first three in this series. I'd have to compare this to the fourth book, Pendragon. Both are good stories, but seem to be dragging the story of Arthur out. In the third book he concludes the story. The fourth and fifth then go back and tell us more about the life of Arthur. If you've read the first three books you should read this one also, but I would not recommend starting here. Like always SRL does an excellent job of taking the legend (in this case the Holy Grail) and presenting it in a more realistic light then many other fantasy novelists who make up extremely unrealistic fantasies. Once I finally got involved in the series I enjoyed it. For a really good read I'd recommend Byzantium or the Song of Albion trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantasic faith builder-Power over is evil is found in God!","review":"This is a great story, wonderfully told. I especially enjoyed the section that exemplified the power of God over evil: speaking the word of God rather than relying on mere human strength or devices. It reminds me of the Bible scripture, \\" Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord.\\" It was very inspirational!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love the first 3 books DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!","review":"The first 3 books in the Pendragon cycle are among my favorite books (I got the trilogy over 10 years ago and have read them countless times), and the 4th book \\"Pendragon\\" was OK...(although not particularly interesting). But \\"Grail\\" is absolutely horrible. This book is actually an alternate ending to \\"Arthur\\" (book 3). It ignores the last half of that book (and the PERFECT ending) and completely changes everything for the worse. \\"Grail\\" is uninteresting and boring, and for it to be called the 5th book in the Pendragon cycle is utterly ridiculous! Avoid this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawhead sets apart his telling of the Grail legend","review":"Stephan Lawhead all but ignores the Grail legend in his first three books of the Pendragon Cycle, and limits its pressence in Pendragon. It would seem that he set it aside for this faithful telling from the perspective of one of Arthur's Guardians of the Grail.Consistent with the other books, Lawhead finds new voices to tell this tale using Gwalchavad as the principle storyteller and Morgian as an occasional foil to him. Many fans of the first three books will not care for this one. It is steeped in religious context that the other books only aluded to. This is actually part of Lawhead's gift. If the reader takes the time to understand the perspective of the storyteller, he will understand Lawhead's need to cloak it in religious mysticism.This book is an excellent re-telling of Grail legend, and a wonderful use of the characters that Lawhead has given life to in his Pendragon cycle. It seems a shame that this saga should ever come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short book title and short attention span.","review":"I look back at the time I spent reading this book and ask myself why I wasted three weeks of my life attempting to read and contemplate the text within this fragment of harolded literary masterpieces. Again, like others, I too have felt the uncontrolable urge to jump out of my bed in wild abandon and toss this book into my natural gas fireplace and watch each page sizzle into ashes. I seriously could never stay awake long enough to go through 5 pages in one night, so I had to read it in the daytime.

The plotting was choppy with no vitality or momentum, the narrative pedestrian and unimaginative -- and, come to think of it, isn't \\"imaginative narrative\\" one of the top goals for a writer? All the characters are cardboard-thin, and the narrative point of view skipped all over the place; sometimes you're reading three different character's thoughts on the same page!And the main plot point, the kind sending Fiona to be a spy...Why didn't he just get someone who was WILLING to do it???Well, that's where I stopped reading, so unfortunately didn't get to the \\"gratuitous sex\\" parts I heard mention of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time and effort!","review":"Written under the genre of historical romance, this tale could better have been listed as adult. The basic plot of a highland lass, only fifteen years old, finding true love simultaneously with two men is a sheer cover for the unending, gratuitous, raunchy bedroom scenes.Although descriptions of lush landscapes are well-written, the characters aren't dressed long enough to enjoy them and the only emotions portrayed are lust and jeaslousy.For a good Scottish romance, look elsewhere - try Jude Devereaux or Julie Garwood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The grammar and spelling is horrible in the kindle edition","review":"The book itself is typical Beatrice Small.

I enjoyed the premise thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read If You Want Something A Little Spicy!","review":"This book was very gripping from the first page to the last.

I knew it was a collection of (largely) previously published work, but why should that matter? Unfortunately, it turns out to matter a lot. Buckley's magazine pieces would no doubt be funny if you came upon them one at a time in a magazine, just the way Andy Rooney could be funny at the end of a 60 Minutes broadcast. Strung end-to-end, however, these short essays just become irritating. Here's one thing Buckley doesn't like. Here's another. And another.

We followed the washing instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful","review":"Well researched book, full of facts you cannot find anywhere else about the attitude of the Jewish community in Ottoman Palestine during World War One regarding the Armenian Genocide, and the Zionist-Armenian cooperation in London and Paris. Also presents the legacy of the Armenian Genocide and the danger of such a tragedy befalling the Jews (ironically the Zionists worried about the Yishuv during World War One whereas the Holocaust occured to the Diaspora during World War Two); the influence of that very fear on the Nili Group of Pro-British Ottoman Jewish spies; the significance of Franz Werfel's Forty Days of Musa Dagh during the ghetto uprisings and the Armenian Genocide in the literature of the time as well as direct eyewitness details of the Genocide. An excellent read, cites many nearly obscure primary sources from the World War One Period.

Oh Well. Good thing this album is so versatile and easy to listen to. My favourite tracks are \\"Before we go Under\\" and \\"I can't watch you drum\\"...they're definitely the two most rockin' songs. The bass line on track 18 is sweet and comforting, and the vocals on track 7 are very Kristin Hersh-esque. I would recomment this CD to anyone who likes Throwing Muses, Beth Orton, basically girl soloists in general. She also has a few songs that are surprisingly celtic in sound, which is not a bad thing, but takes some getting used to if you're usually an indie-rock listener like myself. All in all it's a worthwhile buy for rounding out your music collection, and it's a good album for rainy summer days or cleaning the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts through windshield grime","review":"I got this glass cleaner just to fill up a last little bit of an order to get free shipping.

I was WRONG!!! It started to unravel after the first washing and the softness goes away immediately. Spend the extra money and purchase the Chamois Cover from Pottery Barn Kids. It is worth the extra $5. I have two of them and they wash EXTREMELY well (stays soft, stains come out, etc.) and it has slits for the safety belt.

First, once it was washed it shrunk and would not fit properly on the pad. I bought a standard contoured pad from Babies 'R Us and so it should have been compatible. Second, it's too much of a pain to keep taking it off, washing it and putting it back on. I have three of these and now don't use any. If your baby remotely spits up or goes to the bathroom while on the changing table (before you get a new diaper on) I've found it's easier to buy some nice inexpensive matching towels and lay them over the pad. They're cheaper and you don't have to worry about fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought & Returned.","review":"This cover is soft terry cloth, but we bought the safety changing table pad deluxe by Dex Baby Products and you do not need this item (we returned ours). If your baby ever has an accident while you are changing them, you will end up washing more then you should have to. We just use the pad which is vinyl & easy to wipe down after changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Item!!!","review":"My son is now 12 months old, and we have had this item since he was born and love it. We have two covers in different colors, and this works perfect. When one is in the wash, the other is on. I haven't had any problems with shrinking in the wash, and I don't really understand the need for the slots either as the straps come up under the cover. The only issue I have seen is that both covers did get some pulls early on. No big deal, though. Sometimes I turn them inside out and use them that way. The pulls happened really early on and haven't gotten any worse. I love these covers and would highly recommend them to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product!","review":"The quality of this changing pad cover is very, very low. After only one washing, I had loose threads all over and the terry had already snagged. Now, after months of continued use and turning a blind eye to all it's imperfections, the terry material is pulling away from the elastic edging. The Especially for Baby brand changing pad cover is so much better: MUCH softer, better made, comes out of the wash perfectly, doesn't get snagged by bibs with velcro closures that are also in the wash. I had two Simmons covers and both are terrible. I'm buying another Especially for Baby one immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrunk in the wash","review":"These covers shrink in the washing machine. The cover now bends the changing pad causing it to rip in places. I will now need to purchase a new changing pad. The cover now measures 27 or 28 inches long instead of the original 32 inches it started out as. This is after only 2 months of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHRINKAGE!!!","review":"I really like the color selection and the softness of this product, but I am very disappointed by the shrinkage. The cover barely fits over the pad (weren't they made to go together?) and the pad itself it turning up at the corners. When I lay my baby down on the pad, he is comfortable, but he sinks into the pad because it doesn't fit properly. It does look nice, though in our nursery, but if I could do it over I would have selected a different pad and cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm afraid to wash it anymore!","review":"This is an attractive cover, but oddly, it's way too hard to get on the pad it's designed for. The first time it was difficult to put on, but looked ok. After repeated washings, it's getting worse and is bending my changing pad. the ends are all smushed down. What a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small!!!","review":"I have a standard sized (16x32) changing pad and I bought this cover for it because I liked the color.

I was looking for a frisbee tossing game. This is similar to Frisbee Golf. The assembly was quite easy. The overall size is fairly small. To solve the size problem in our Fun Fair, I purchased an orange 5 gallon bucket from Home Depot and placed the game on it. Not only did this solve the height problem, but also gave us a storage device for this game. Other than the small size of the game, everything else worked out fine. This game will be a keeper for next year's Fun Fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun time killer","review":"An office mate of mine bought one and brought it into the office. We had a good time tossing around, and set up some holes to play after work hours. We're fairly avid disc golfers, so being able to play indoors is great. After playing in the office a bit, I decided that the price was well worth it and bought a set for myself. I use mine at home and have taken it camping. It's a ton of fun.One thing to note though is I didn't get the blue color as shown in the picture.

But for starters, greatest indoor disc golf ever! Here's where it really gets awesome. The discs that come with this are cool I guess, but too heavy for indoors I think. IT'S UPCYCLING TIME!! I recycle and upcycle. So, take those Country Crock butter lids, sour cream tops, and you name it, and you've got an ALL-DAY arsenal of sweet-flying, soft-touching, free!, frisbees all around you. They are the perfect size for this basket and the hang-time on them is sweet. Heck, I've got a Country Crock, cleaned out tub which holds the butter, now nailed to my wall as a little basketball hoop!! That's right Mother Earth, I found a way!! Alright, but anyways, this thing rocks. If you're in a house, heck you could make some bad-ass Par 5's startin' from the second floor and on down. Don't let the dog snag your 'B' though! Awwww yeahhhhh!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the living room!","review":"I have been a disc golfer for about 8 years now and never liked playing outdoor mini disc golf. I got this since it is cheap and wanted something to play around with while friends are over. The minis that come with the basket are a bit too lightweight for my taste. I do own a bunch of mini discs so they have finally come in handy. Build quality is cheap and flimsy but you get what you pay for and it gets the job done - fun fun fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Badass! Buy it now","review":"The other reviews say it all. It's awesome. I bought this for my office and I thought only me and one other sales rep would use it. 2 weeks after I placed it in the hall, I have all 15 people throwing discs and trying to bang the chains.It does what it's meant to do: play disc golf indoors. Only other thing I would note is the discs it comes with are pretty understable. You might want to buy the heaver small discs to play, but it might plow through the chains more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a blast!","review":"While this is not for playing serious disc golf, at this price it's a steal and I think every disc golfer should get one. It's large enough to be fun while being small enough that you can set it up inside your house. It's great if you're bored, sitting on the couch and watching TV or for getting your buddies together and setting up a full-on indoor course. Another great aspect of this basket is that you can play with it at night whereas even if you own a full sized basket it is hard to find a well lit spot to play (except maybe some putting in your back yard). For their size, these discs fly surprisingly well and they float on water which I thought was nice because I want to set up the basket to where I have to throw it over the pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"64 times, and counting","review":"I have seen this movie 64 times, and I plan on seeing it at least 1,000 times more.

That was a long time ago, forty years. A lot has changed in forty years about painting. Brushes, materials and grounds are very different. Something this old isn't able to address that.

I recommend this product to anyone with an ipod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, easy to use","review":"This is clear and easy to use. I like that you can use your own display as the display for controlling the iTrip. It would have been nice if it had come with a USB cable with the right connector on it for hooking it up to, say, Griffin's own PowerJolt car charger. What's the point of not providing the right cable when they already go to the trouble of providing a USB to iPod dock connector cable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, but poor performing","review":"If you are into just looks then get this transmitter. If you want something that works, look elsewhere. I purchased this based on a few reviews I read on an iPod website but when i received the iTrip I was greatly dissapointed. It sounded awful, even when there was not static. Once you start driving the sound is brutal, static, and you have to really crank your radio to hear the music. I like the fact that you can fine tune it, but even when i set it to mono and found a totally dead station the sound was not listenable to me. I then purchased the monster icarplay and it works 1000 times better. usually i am not a big fan of monster products but that product works perfect, on every channel i tried. Stay away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"compact, kind of a battery eater","review":"fits perfectly with the original nano...sticky part on the back loses its stickiness (i dont know how to get it sticky again)...great range...eats up battery (expected)...protective bag leaves TONS of lint all over the nano :P...multiple settings are great...takes a while to get used to how the menu works"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I have several problems with this model. First...it doesn't fit the new \\"skinny\\" Gen2 iPods. Secondly...nothing in the literature warns you of this fact prior to buying it. Third...when I hooked it up to my older model Nano thinking I could at least use it on my old model, the unit didn't work well.

There's tons of static and you have to crank up the volume high.Now imagine what it sounds with music. Man it's horrible, it's like hearing hold music over the phone. It's WORSE than radio station music.I wish i could return it, but i exceeded Griffin's strict 30 day return policy. Woe is me. I'd resell it on ebay or craigslist, but i'd feel guilty to sell such a crummy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are all FM transmitter's this bad?","review":"I recently got a Nano and carry it everywhere with me. I use earphones at work, but wanted to be able to hook into sound systems in my home, car, and boat. They all have FM radio, so this seemed perfect. I liked the cool way that it integrates with the iPod.The product description said it could reach up to 30 ft. What a crock! This thing can't seem to push a clear signal into my FM tuners even when it is right on top of the unit or right next to the antenna. It's barely useable under the best of circumstances, with my music sounding fuzzy and static-y.I have no other experience with this technology so I don't know if all of these FM xmitter gadgets are this crappy or what. Perhaps this one sacrifices performance for style, or maybe I just got a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit new nano","review":"This product is not compatible with the new nano.

Form: 4+ stars, Function: 1 starForm: Great design. It integrates perfectly with the iPod Nano. The control button on the side works well but takes a little getting used to. The features it offers are nice on paper... if they actually worked, that would be nicer.Function: I purchased what I thought would be a nice replacement for an older FM transmitter that I use that required being powered by the cigarette lighter. My first attempt to use this product was inside the house with my home stereo... as other reviewers have commented, anything outside of 1 foot from the antenna (high powered, high gain antenna at that) developed static. At 5 feet away, no signal could be detected at all. This was repeated on numerous channels. In the car, the static was always there. I attempted to use clear channels throughout the range and always received the same annoying static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept ruined by implementation","review":"This little ditty is great in concept but Griffin ruined it by making it dependent on a headphone jack instead of the dock adapter as they have done in their other FM Modulators.The interface is really nice.As with most FM Modulators, either the FCC or the companies who make these things never make them capable of making enough signal strength to actually be useful. Consider the kensington pico adapter or Xtreme Mac's solution (which includes an antenna)."},{"rating":"1","title":"iTrip","review":"I guess I got what I paid for, $0.01.

It's very frustrating when technology is released before it reaches an acceptable level of quality. This transmitter literally needs to be sitting directly on the radio or the sound is flooded with static. I'd even try turning it around, upside down, whatever...nothing worked. Even direct contact is no guarantee. Forget about manipulating the song lists. It's very disconcerting listening to music up loud, then getting hit with a burst of static. Maybe other transmitters are better, but I wouldn't bet on it. I bought something called a \\"Nano Starter Kit\\" for $40 at Circuit City. It had a wall charger, car charger, cassette adaptor for the car, stereo adaptor wires, a case, an extra set of headphones.

The songs by Phil Collins were exceptional and he won the Academy Award for best original song (\\"You'll be in my Heart\\"). The voices of Tony Goldwyn, Rosie O'Donnell and Minnie Driver behind the excellent score proformed by Marc Mancini (Speed) make it worth seeing alone. The animation is stellar (isn't it always?) and the characters are lively. \\"Tarzan\\" is a movie treat for film lovers of all different ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but you'll have to wait to see it!","review":"Loved Tarzan. but the DVD *forces* you to sit through several trailers before allowing you to actually see the movie. This is no fun when your 2-year old is screaming for Tarzan! Disney programmers have single-handedly negated the instant access features of the delivery system. Now we insert the DVD and watch something else until we're sure the movie is ready to play. Disney, get a clue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarzan","review":"This film is right up there with the Lion King! The animation is out of this world. The story is funny, heart warming, and has alot of great family messages in it! I recommend this to any family,especially if somebody is adopted. A beautiful story about adoption, (I thought! )in a animated film! I don't have enough good things to say about this video. TheCharacters- you will fall in love with them all!

Talkin about the DVD it look Wonderfull, The sound IS GREAT, and the IMAGE are TERRIFIC, this is no the special BUT HAS too many extras, LIKE Phil Collins video, a demo of tehgame, the trailer of Dinosaur, and many more, and For DVD-ROM, you have wallpapers, WEb page, IS REALLY GOOD. all the disney movies has to be like this, I think is a dissapointmen of Little Mermaid, it dont have anything. Buy Tarzan You dont will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Video but Sloppy Audio Work on DVD","review":"It was my first time to watch the Disney-rendition of this movie. Overall, it was fun and exciting to watch; especially recommended for kids...just don't encourage them to go near a gorilla, though. The video technicals were as awesome as I expect them to be (two thumbs up!). Somebody in the recording studio made a sloppy sound recording on the DVD, though: (a) No sub-woofer recording (WATCHOUT, it's only 5.0 and NOT 5.1) (b) Some left and right sounds were mixed-up. I'd recommend this only for the curious and not for the serious DVD collectors. Otherwise, just rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROTEST MANDATORY COMMERCIALS","review":"I inserted my DVD with anticipation, since I heard many good things about Tarzan. However, Disney previews were the first thing to show up on the screen. I was thankful that I was watching a DVD, rather than a videotape, since I could immediately skip to the movie, rather than having to fast forward through the TEN MINUTES of commercials, as I do on my VCR. Imagine my unbelievable disgust when I realized that Disney had \\"locked\\" their TEN MINUTES of commercials such that I was unable to skip the commercials (similar to the \\"lockout\\" typically used to display the copyright notice). Since my kids like to watch movies over and over, that means that I will have to suffer through these TEN MINUTES of commercials EVERY SINGLE TIME! If you share my disgust for such \\"shove it down their throat\\" tactics, please let Disney know. How dare they mandate that we watch their commercials EVERY SINGLE TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, great quality, terrible DVD","review":"When will all the cross-promotional mega-corporate tie-in nonsense stop? I loved the movie and was excited to get it on DVD with all the extras. But I'm appalled at being forced to go through their ads every time I insert the disc. This is pathetic. What's next? Will we be forced to watch text crawl at the bottom of the screen during the movie, touting whatever Disney Incorporated wants us to buy? Or will they insert obligatory commercials during the show?Even though the quality is top-notch, I can't recommend this DVD. And until the powers-that-be at Disney reign in their arrogance and abusive behavior, I will refuse to buy another Disney DVD release (or any DVD from any studio that wastes my time with this nonsense)."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent movie, but...","review":"This film is fantastic and it's nice to see it being put back out on dvd, but the main issue here is Disney's marketing. After promising a 2 disc release (that mirrored the Collector's Edition), the US was shafted and only recieved a one disc with minimal extras. This wouldn't be a huge issue, but most everywhere else in the world DID get the 2 disc release and it bothers me that Disney decieded to do this. The false advertisement of this edition of the dvd is unexcusable and I'm very upset about this. In the back of my mind I'm wondering if they're prepping a 2-disc re-release as well but centered for more around Christmas...bottom line, if you don't care about the special features I'd get this DVD. But, for the disney collector, try and find a copy of the Collectors Edition somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Commercials! -- This is DVD, not VHS Disney!","review":"The movie was great, ... the visuals were astounding, the acting and singing were very good, the story was solid (albeit along the typical Disney \\"formula\\"), and the soundtrack was up there with other Disney animated classics.I gave it a 2 out of 5 stars because of the FORCED COMMERCIALS. Someone forgot to tell Disney that this was DVD, not VHS. It's not a tape -- it's a digital format. Disney seems to be attempting to cram all of the rotten things about VHS into their DVDs.All trailers or commercial material of any kind should be accessible from the DVD menu -- NOT PLAYED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE! Why on Earth do my children need to sit through non-Tarzan material every time they watch Tarzan. This is so INCREDIBLY ANNOYING -- until Disney changes this practice, I will not buy another Disney DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad disk avoid at all cost!","review":"Well if the bad audio track was bad enough, being FORCED to watch the previews EVERYTIME you want to watch the movie is. Disney really blew this one. Maybe they can get their act together for the Collector Edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosie Ruined it!","review":"Imagine, some of the greatest animation ever filmed, including breakthroughs in new techniques, and a smooth soundtrack by Phil Collins, yet the film is actually ruined by sound. The sound I'm talking about is Rosie O'Donell's obnoxiously grating voice. It amazes me that the people producing such excellent visuals didn't think this was a problem. She's completely out of place, first of all. She sounds like a heavy metal guitarist in the middle of an orchestra. And what the heck accent is that, anyway? New York? Wisconsin? Chicago? It certainly doesn't belong in the jungle. I like Disney films, but unlike the rest of them, I can never sit through this movie ever again, unless it's on mute. The two stars are for the animation, which alone deserves five, but the three missing stars are for the horrible mistake in casting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Take On A Classic Story","review":"My daughter loves this story and the Disney Edition of Tarzan.

My daughter saw this movie when she was 4 and was traumatized by the first 5 minutes of the movie. For weeks after she was petrified that her Dad and I would be killed. And ever since that movie she has adamantly refused to go to see any movie in a movie theater. I have tried to convince her that not all movies are as scary and reminded her that the Rugrats movie she had seen before, she liked very much, but she has been digging her heels in for over a year.The death of Tarzan's parents is NOT something a young child can handle. There has got to be a better way of categorizing movies than just a 'G' rating.The animation was pretty good but the story line was \\"Disney silly\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Disney DVDs for me","review":"Disney's forced-view commercials at the beginning of the DVD totally turned me off to this disc. It only reinforces their greedy corporate image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun - Kids and Adults Will Both Enjoy This","review":"We own a lot (a LOT) of Disney animated DVDs, and our kids watch them often. Some (like Pocahontas and Hunchback of Notre Dame) get viewed once and then shelved because the music's crummy, the story's slow or dumb, and the kids just don't want to see them again. Tarzan, though, gets viewed again and again. Thank goodness it's a great, watchable story. Lots of action, wonderful job by Minnie Driver voicing Jane, pretty good Phil Collins music, all combine to make this an enjoyable watch. I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a good gift for young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I received this product on time and could not have been more satisfied.

While it has been sanitized for children it still has some subtle wit and satire for adults who watch with their children.The action is quick and there are very few dull spots. The animation is not as defined as more current works it is lovely to watch and easy on the eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! :)","review":"I was totally amazed that disney created this movie. It is absolutly spectacular. The animation will totally blow you away, and the action scenes are totaly great. The thing that really amazed me was that you actually saw Tarzan's dead parents in the corner and the bloddy footmarks from Sabor the leopord. And Clayton is also one hell of a villain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarzan I Loved it!","review":"The movie was great! I am 13 years old and i loved it! the animaton was terrific and the music was fabulous! People of all ages will love it! My teacher loved so much that she has shown it to all 7 of her classes.

[Buy] the collect. edit.","review":"I was very disappointed with this DVD. With so much hype I was excited to finally be able to watch this movie. I had not previously viewed it at a theater. The DVD opens with 3 or 4 advertisements which can be skipped by jumping forward 4 chapters but that is uncalled for. The DVD DOES NOT have 5.1 audio on 5.0 and apparently the audio was [not proper] because its doesn't take an audio expert to hear that the audio and picture is not matched. At some points in the film what should be matched to a front speaker is actually coming from the opposite rear speaker. Big [mistake] if you ask me. With the 5.0 audio you have NO SPECIAL effects thru the subwoofer. Not to say the sub can't used but nothing specifically sent to it alone.I would recommend [buying] the collectors edition and hope that the 5.1 audio it advertises is true and correlated correctly. Maybe ...the marketing people can move the ads to extra features section or end of DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"tarzan","review":"The movie is great family watching, with little hiden jokes for the adults.

If possible view the DVD. the kids will like the games, and the other bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Tarzan didn't at all reflect how Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote him.He wasn't a knuckle walker, tree surfer.

I'm a sucker for a handsome ape man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarzan (Special Edition)","review":"Delivery took much longer than usual.Although the Tarzan (Special Edition) purchase was supposed to have been a new product, the DVD was scratched and unplayable. It had to be returned, which is easier said than done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Add to Shelves","review":"While one must admit that not everything that Disney does is great or even decent, this is one to see and add to your shelves (ie-Sound of Music, Mary Poppins). The imagery will blow you away and great for little kids. Most of the movie is told without words, but uses superior graphics and music to keep you there (And actually manages it for the first time ever). Pure entertainment and far above what Disney is currently putting out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for the whole family","review":"The first time I saw this movie I wasn't able to see it all the way because I had my neice and my nephew with me who were restless but the second time I saw it I loved it.

The animation is quite good especially the scenes of Tarzan swining through the trees. Like many of Disney's recent animation it combines some element of drama. The score features great music from Phil Collins especially the Oscar wining \\"You'll be in my heart\\". The opening sequence may be disturbing for small children especially the scene were a jaguar kills a baby gorilla. In general it it a good family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY good movie, with one glaring flaw","review":"Great animation work by Disney Studios. Visually stunning 3D representation, kids love it, great soundtrack, yadda yadda.The DVD has some videos, and behind-the-scenes looks. There could have been more, considering the price (stores charge more than Amazon), but this is Disney, and you generally expect to pay a premium for their product.The one flaw? Rosie O'Donnell, as Tarzan's best friend, Terk. I understand that we need to hear the gorillas speak in order to have a movie, but why have 99% of the gorillas speak \\"The King's English\\", but one gorilla (from New Yawk, ostensibly) tawks wit an accent dat bawdahs (borders) on de annoying?

I mean, about 6 people died, and that Clayton guy was shooting everyone,Kerjack was not a very nice husband or father, and even Tarzan the \\"hero\\" of the whole movie was kind of rough. I really Disney could have done a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"No violence!","review":"I don't see how the reviewer could be so appreciative of no violence in Tarzan. The movie was wonderful, but very inappropriate for young children. Tarzan does away with the bad guy at the end by throwing him off a tall tree. The bad guy subsequently gets strangled by the vines. No violence? Give me a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The radical forest","review":"This film is great! Lots of fun and thrilling action. Edgar Rice Burroughs must be tumbling on his grave, but in satisfaction. Some things as been added and taken from the original story like Terk, Tarzan surfing in the trees and that he don't see where did he came from (London, that is). There is some sexuality, but in a very secretly way because this is a family movie. I recomend it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The names are riduculous too","review":"Kerchak sounds more like a russian spy than the name of a gorilla. Terk, isnt that an antennae manufacturer?

However, when I watched it for the first time, I was so sad about how much of the content had been directly copied from the two classics, \\"Litlle Mermaid\\" and \\"Lion King\\", I lost interest. The story is predictable, as are most Disney tales; however, the presentation was a repeat of other movies with very little of the classic imagination tied so closely to Disney films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney says it's only 1 disc.

There have been many rumors about this & I emailed Disney. The response says that it will be ONE disc (& if you've seen the fact sheet ALL of the great features of the Collector's Edition are omitted). You'll be getting the movie & some short fluffy bonus materials. I don't know why Disney didn't just rerelease the CE with a new cover & some new previews like the A Bug's Life CE but they apparently are not.

Another Disney rip-off.Touted as a two-disc special edition all the way through the packaging of the Cinderella two-disc special edition, Disney silently changed its mind and charged an outrageous price for a single disc.

No official word (and no apology when I complained), but you can bet the answer starts with a dollar sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney for all","review":"Well personally I believe this is the best film Disney has produced.

Sure, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Mulan were beautifully animated, but the songs were awful and the movies themselves just weren't up to Disney's usual standards. So, I had my doubts about Tarzan when I picked up a copy for my 3-year-old. I was very happily surprised to see that this movie is definitely a return to form. It's actually even more touching than most other Disney films because unlike The Little Mermaid, Snow White, etc., etc., you actually get a deeper insight into the male character and therefore, it's possible to see what it is about him that makes the heroine fall in love, instead of just seeing that he's handsome. The music was fun, and the animation was amazing. A wonderful movie that I thoroughly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORCED TO WATCH PREVIEWS!","review":"If you like to watch previews before you view the main feature, then by all means get this dvd. The lame execs at Disney have made a decision on your behalf that you are better off watching these previews. There is no way to skip, fast forward, jump to the menu to avoid the ads. They have even exploited the dvd technology to prevent you from stopping the movie, how lame is that! Imagine if every dvd you buy contains at least 4 or more minutes of previews that you are forced to view, imagine real hard because if Disney is allowed to get away with ti, other movie distribution houses are sure to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guns, deaths, hangings-not a hot one for sensitive children","review":"Guns, death, hangings...alright for Disney and America!

Before I watched the movie I knew that Tarzan would be orphaned, but I had no idea that they would show the blood of his parents and their bodies.

The atmosphere is too heavy, kind of along the same problems of \\"The Fox and the Hound.\\" Tarzan has too many muscles on his body, it's more about the action, the music is lousy, and I don't like the story. They should have stuck with Tarzan trying to earn his family's respect instead of the torn between two love stories. I also pass on those bland uninteresting Phil Collin songs. My biggest problem with the movie is Tarzan's so-called gorilla father, Kerchak. I know he's the protector of the family, but I just don't like that guy. Terk and Tantor are okay for comic relief, but they're no Timon and Pumbaa. All in all, even though this is a jungle themed movie, I don't think it has the same charm as \\"The Jungle Book\\" or \\"The Lion King.\\" It's just too socially awkward a film for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good except...","review":"The effects and animation are wonderful in this movie.

I would probably recommend it. Even some of my friends who are up to age 17 loved it even more than me. It includes an awesome soundtrack. I would not recommend it, however, for a parent who's child did not like \\"Bambi\\". There are two sads parts in the movie, one almost exactly like \\"Bambi\\". I typically hate Disney movies such as \\"Snow White\\" or \\"Cinderella\\", but this movie was pretty good. The part when Tarzan is sliding down the trees is VERY stupid and unrealistic, and I did not see the first part of the movie, so I cannot tell you about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"I bought this DVD in China, it's wonderful.

It looks fantastic on DVD and doesn't push any of Disney's usual agenda.There are three problems with it, however.<1> The voice acting by Rosie O'Donnel is horrible. Whatever happened to using voice actors with good voices? Get a clue Hollywood! Just because an actor is good doesn't mean he or she is a good voice actor.<2> The hunter in movie was poorly represented. Any hunter worth his salt will not go around blasting his rifle at anything that moves. Once again Disney shows it's ignorance of hunters and is bias against gun owners.<3> This DVD forces you to either view or skip over about 7 previews before letting you view the movie. Come on people! If you want to put the previews on a menu option, that would make sense, but forcing us to skip past your stupid previews is rude. This alone will make me avoid ever buying another Disney movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad!","review":"This movie not for small children! I have a 4 year old and I regret letting her watch it.

On video it was just OK.

It boils down to 2 7min segments..that is it. I usually end up pausing it, so I can hold the a stretch position for a decent lenght of time, he tends to just hold a position for about 10 seconds...so if you are looking for a relaxing deep stretch I would not recommend this video. I use this for a quick pre-work out stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this DVD, but it was awful","review":"Way to much talking! Why would the instructor spend sssoooo much time talking. It was grating.This DVD starts with, what else, explanations of of the stretches, a short anatomy lessons, the instructors opinions about physical fitness. After all that, there is a short preview of the 10 poses you are \\"going\\" to do. Then, a 7 minute routine (still more talking during this) of the first 10 pose stretch.After that, there are more lessons, more talking and a short explanation of poses 11-20 (or something like that). Then more talking and another 7 minute routing of these poses. Why not put everything together.

It is supposed to help those new to options trading understand it, but by covering both futures and stock options simultaneously I only ended up confused. I am interested in learning stock options and the books primary focus seems to be on futures. Perhaps having two books dedicated to each of the subjects would be more appropriate for a \\"beginners\\" book. In addition, the early introduction of examples about \\"offsets\\" are very confusing and, again for a \\"beginners\\" book, not appropriate at such an early stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written, confused me more than taught me","review":"I bought this book a few years ago and have tried to read it many times. It is very poorly written in that it jumps around from topic to topic constantly.

This book is no exception. By comparison, Wade Cook's Wall St. Money Machine is full of the hype that makes for easy and enjoyable reading. The reader walks away with some risky but useable tools for trading options - but not the collegiate level comprehension that this book can give.If you want to be entertained, check out Cook, with a grain of salt.If you want to go to options trading college, check out Natenberg or Gallacher's The Option Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on.

As I tried to read it again today 8 years later with much gained experience I realized how poorly written and edited this book is. I'm sure it's not the editor's fault as they are most likely not familiar with derivatives. Even the basics of options are botched in this poor excuse of a book. The author emphasizes that you be clear in communication with your broker when taking/offsetting positions. How ironic. The author is not even capable of basic math. 5000 x $.01 = $500? or 5000 x $.02 = $1000? Sad. The product of our American public school system? Don't bother and look elsewhere.

For laying out the basics, this chapter, and book for that matter, is too disorganized and goes off on too many tangents. It's as if the author loaded up on caffeine and did a brain dump with little planning as to what he really wanted the reader to learn.Not wanting to give up on options yet, I read a few reviews and picked up 'Getting Started in Options' by Thomsett, which is much better written and organized. I'd highly recommend the book by Thomsett for those starting out.I'll make one more stab at the book by McCafferty after finishing Thomsett since I paid for it, but do not recommend it for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Complicated Explanations of Options-- Confuses","review":"This book made me more confused about options than before I began reading it. I do not recommend this book to anyone interested in getting started in option trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough, yet opaque","review":"Mr. McCafferty's book seeks to provide a comprehensive review of options trading, and it is filled with what could be helpful and illustrative examples. Unfortunately, it suffers from a lack of editing. This means, for instance, that many of the examples appear to have incorrect math, as compared to the written description of how they are supposed to work. This can leave the reader confused as to which is correct.Similarly, because the details of the basic groundwork are partly contradictory, the reader is left with less confidence as the book becomes more complex.This is a great book for someone who is already comfortable with the basics of options, but if you are looking for an introductory text on options, try \\"Options for Dummies\\" or a similar book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably poorly written","review":"I know nothing of options and bought this book to learn about them.

The book is highly predictable, however, in that Clark in almost mechanical fashion slants events to justify her own actions and approaches with regard to the Simpson case. Like just about anyone in her position, she justifies, rationalizes, dumps on her enemies, praises her friends, and turns the Simpson trial into a Manichaean struggle of good vs. evil.Overall, I didn't find her a very appealing personality.

I give Marcia credit for doing what she did. The only thing I fault her for is letting the judge run over her and her team.

I kept asking myself: \\"What's the author's point?\\" but never found an answer. A novelist who only reports life but does not illuminate it shortchanges the reader.Not a satisfying book.

NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While Boyle creates interesting characters and the premise of this story has great potential, I was largely disappointed by this novel. I love TC Boyle's short stories, and I've come to expect great things from him, so when this novel dragged on and on, giving the reader no real new tugs to pique our interest, I wondered where Boyle's editor was. Perhaps the writing style and repetitiveness were meant to give the reader a sense of the boredom and monotony that even group sex could come to have for a sex researcher, but I understood that after 200 pages, and this novel could have been half as long. I love TC Boyle, but this would be the last novel of his that I'd recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars divided","review":"I would give the writing 5 stars. I stayed with the book all the way through because of it. I give the story line 1 star. The subject matter in this historical fiction book eventually succeeded in grossing me out. I didn't care for the characters and I admit, I like to be able to relate in SOME way to at least one. Prok was a charasmatic cult leader who appeared to be living out his own personal fantasies in the name of science. Whatever. Has all this knowledge of how many times a day someone partakes in self-gratifying behavior really benefited society? [...] Milk drove me nuts. I kept hoping his wife would be the redeeming character in the whole book but I felt let down by her too. As a mother and RN when the mention of infant and child sex came up I was physically repulsed.

The products i'd used before had 4 positions on the nozzle, Stream, Spray and Off (2 off positions) as you turn the nozzle around. This product only had two Off positions and two Spray positions, no Stream position. This was a huge problem for me, for the purposes i use this for. Sometimes i need a stronger more concentrated stream that i can aim at the stain. Other times i want a spray to cover a larger area and not penetrate as deeply. I want to have both options. Most cleaning bottles i've used and other pet odor bottles had both options. I really couldn't believe Simple Solution would omit something that basic and important. But they did.

She fills the story with extraordinary characters, wonderful suspense, and all the great style of the Regency period. It seems to be well researched, which I believe Ms. Heyer is famous for, and is beautifully written. It is one of those classic books I want to keep and read again and again.

So I was very pleasantly surprised to come across this one with a bit of the mystery/gothic novel about it. Yes, it was not hard to figure out the \\"bad guy\\" early on, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. The love story was a quiet one - which makes sense with the title - and that didn't bother me either.

The combination of the early 1900s time period, the freshness of a young kid new to the big leagues, and a murder intertwined with baseball is great. It is an easy and quick read. The setting plays a big part of the appeal of this mystery novel--which Soos masterfully creates. The mystery/plot is believable and does keep the reader in suspense. I eagerly await each installment of this series. Soos writing seems to get progressively better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and hard to put down","review":"By using a baseball player as a detective, Troy Soos, givesus the possibility of finding the murder together with him, because his hero is nothing special and the lines of thought are very common.Different from other detective books, in which the authors try to create a very difficult line of thinking to make the hero look greater than an normal human being, Mickey the hero of Troy is just that: A Normal Human Being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start to the series","review":"This was the second Mickey Rawlings book I read and I thought the \\"Cincinnati Red Stalkings\\" was much better. I thought that the characters in \\"Murder at Fenway Park\\" were not very well-developed or differentiated from each other. I also thought that most of the middle of the book consisted of Mickey going from here to there without advancing the plot or doing much detecting.

Rob Glick is a fantastic instructor and the routines are great for the right person (if you like Christi Taylor or Cathe Freidrich, you'll love Rob Glick), but despite stubborn efforts on my part, I just can't master his style.If you consider yourself an advanced stepper and are very familiar with both dance and step terms and are comfortable with routines that continually change, you'll really like this workout. If, like me, your favorite step workouts are more basic (Gin Miller, Gilad, Kathy Smith), you might struggle with the frustration level you'll encounter with this workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good :-)","review":"This is quite a good workout. I'd always heard of Rob Glick, but this is my first dvd of his and I like it. It uses a lot of unique choreography and that is what separates it from the rest of step workouts and makes this interesting. It's fun, funky and fresh.It's easy to follow because he explains each move well, and he keeps adding on to the combinations to make one big combination. It's a little over an hour, but it's great and motivating and he's a very good instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of bootleg copies that are substituted","review":"I ordered this DVD, and received a case and disk that both had this title on them, but surprise! the DVD is actually of a whole different topic, not the one it claims to be.

I've been to Oahu once in 2008 and used my brother-in-law's copy of this book before we went, and just purchased my own last week for a trip in October. Having an idea of what was around before we went helped tremendously, and having it again now that I am familiar with the area makes it even better.Oahu has so much to do, it almost gives you a headache trying to decide in the time you have there. \\"Oahu Revealed\\" takes the guesswork out of looking through the myriad of websites and other books trying to piece it all together.

Did not agree with most of the things they suggested"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a couple of cynics!","review":"I understand that the some of the layout of the book is helpful, especially the hotel placement in Waikiki. I live in Honolulu, and a friend of mine who visited us last week brought this book with him. We all found this book to be generally negative about places, and wondered if the authors had visited some of the places more than once before forming opinions. After we got over the negative offense of the book, it basically became more a target of our own bad humor.If you want a true experience of Oahu - I'd say make friends with a local. Otherwise, don't believe everything you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"go to\\" Guide","review":"I took several travel guides to Oahu but this is the one we kept coming back to. We went to Oahu with another family and they kept borrowing the book because they liked it better than the guidebooks they brought.

I would use this series of guide books for other areas we plan to visit if available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best travel book I have ever read!","review":"I read this book cover to cover. It is so informative and entertaining. The author is obviously familiar with Oahu. I have lived here for six months and through this book I have learned of so many places that I had never even heard of. I love that the book is funny...I didn't expect that.

Write down the names of all the places that interest you and the page you found it on and you are all set!!

It was extremely helpful and made our trip exciting while exploring areas of the island we would have not known about otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide to Oahu","review":"Personally, I liked the style of this guide. It included detailed information on how to find lesser-known or hidden sites, using local landmarks such as signs, telephone poles, mileage markers, etc., rather than just general directions or street signs. The occasional humorous comments made me chuckle, and the guide to pidgin brought back memories of when I lived on Oahu back in the 70's. The maps were very helpful for locating specific sites mentioned in the book. The hotel and resort guide was very helpful and it was nice to read objective comments about them, revealing both the good and the bad.There were several comments on how to lessen the chances of having your car burglarized, which is important when driving a rental car.This is a great guide for visitors who like to go off the beaten path, especially all the detailed hiking information. I will definitely take this guide with me and refer to it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"No better guide for Oahu.","review":"This is my third purchase of this guidebook.

(See my review of the Doughty book on Hawaii.) You won't believe the detail in these books. You get hotel reviews, maps, and much more. Nothing was left out. All of this and access to a great website too! If you are going to the islands, get the whole series. You have to see them to believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was spot-on for great things to do","review":"Without telling our Oahu dwelling friend what the recommendations were in this book, he ended up picking hikes and places to eat for us that were listed in this book as things to do. So, I'd regard this book as the real deal - these are the cool things you should do and see while you are on Oahu. We even taught our friend (who has lived there for 15 years) a thing or two based on what was written in the book. The only thing I didn't care for in this book was the writing style - it reminded me of one of those goofy tour guides who tries to inject comedy as much as possible. I'm all for a good laugh, but when I'm reading a guide book, I really just want to know the facts. I'd definitely buy this book for someone who was looking to vacation on Oahu if they don't already have a local contact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"This was an excellent book. I've been to Oahu many times and saw this book during my last visit. It does an expert job of describing little known areas (beaches, snorkeling spots, restaurants) and gives great detail on how to locate them. I found the book to be dead-on in its descriptions. If you're going to visit Oahu, you only need this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than useful","review":"Probably would have been better off without a guidebook at all. A hike described as light to moderate was difficult for even the seasoned climbers in our group. Would not suggest this guide or purchase from this line again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Guidebooks Ever!","review":"Even if you have been to Hawaii several times these books are worth having. The maps are great and the recommendations are always right on. Mine are all marked up from the notes I write in them about the things we want to see. We like to hike and the hiking section is great. It gives you things to see NOT on the beaten path and stuff to do you may never have heard about otherwise. The other thing I like is the history they give about the islands. Money well spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Our first visit to Oahu","review":"The pictures are pretty but that's about it.

This is the most poorly organized one of all. The author fails to group by location so when traveling to areas one must search through a number of sections to find sights, food, lodging and other essentials. The author is also completely wrong on the translantions and current usage of the Hawaiian language. Living on the island of Molokai with the largest native hawaiian population, one has an opportunity to hear how the words are currently used. They are certainly not as described by Doughty. Lonely planet is a much better guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great. Additional detailed maps would help","review":"E.g., bus schedules.

This book just doesn't provide maps and addresses of famous tour sites, but they either recommend for you, or tell you not to waste your time there.

My husband was home from Iraq and we were ready to see as much as we could. I read all the books before we left, but found this one an easier read, well organized, and full of useful tips. For the most part we found every review pretty much on the money. The off the beaten path type hikes was just what we were looking for. I wish they had included more on Koko Crater, because that was a great hike! Because of the way the book was organized by areas, we were able to travel and stop along the way at each thing mentioned in the book. It was nice having a pretty large selection of reviewed restaurants to choose from and my husband kept asking \\"What would Andrew do?\\" throughout the trip as I directed us to our next adventure.

I'm not sure what is updated about this model, as it's just as bad as the old one. Moving it over my textured walls makes it freak out 90% of the time and need to be reset. Sometimes it will lock up on the \\"found a stud\\" mode and stay there no matter where you move the unit to. If you press to hard on the unit to keep it firmly against the wall, it will make it find a stud or find AC wiring. Sometimes it says it has found AC wiring, and then if you reset it and scan it again, it finds nothing.Bottom line is, it gives so much conflicted data that it is useless. What good is a stud finder and AC wiring finder if you can't trust it? Great job Zircon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a POS....","review":"This stud finder may, and I emphasize the word \\"may\\", work well on drywall as shown in the mocked up demonstrations put on by the manufacturer, but it is useless on plaster walls. I've tried two of them with fresh batteries and neither could successfully locate a stud under 5/8\\" of wallboard and plaster in my house. I am not talking about lathe and plaster, just 3/8\\" of wallboard with 1/4\\" of plaster over it. The demos show accurately locating studs through 2 layers of 1/2\\" sheetrock using the \\"deepscan\\" setting. I suspect that demo is staged. The two I tested could not locate a stud where I knew there was one. It also tends (or pretends) to find \\"something\\" and never stop beeping once it detects whatever it thinks it found.This model would not even make a decent paper weight. If you have a lot of disposable income, go for it.

I was trying to anchor my son's new computer desk unit to the wall. Unfortunately this hunk of plastic is only good at beeping and flashing an occasional red light. It couldn't find one stud through normal one layer drywall. Everywhere it saw a stud there was none to be found. I will never ever ever ever buy anything these thieves from Zircon make again.

I love the Call Of Duty series, but if you want some futuristic blood-letting, then Judge Dredd is the game to get. The arenas are HUGE and at times, beautiful. LOTS of textures and some cool voice acting help bring this game up above Red Faction II or Turok. Still not as amazing as Call Of Duty 2 or Medal Of Honor EU, but close. The game is worth 20 bucks, hands down. Besides, where else can you hunt down your friends and spill buckets of blood on a Nintendo made system?

Consistently.Caregivers have lost entire bottles because the lip pulls away from the edge of the bottle and the whole liner just falls right out. They have also has issues with the liners tearing.

I don't have to wash a million bottles anymore! I just have to wash the nipples. The only complaint I have is that I pre-fill with water and dump in the formula when I'm ready, but when I put in the 8 oz. and let the bottle sit for a while, the bag expands a little so it only looks like I have 7 oz. So the measurements may be a little off. I would use a measuring cup to make sure you get exactly how much water you want and not rely on the liner's measurements."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I can't complain, these things have saved us so many sleepless nights because of a gassy baby! My first child had a major problem with gas because of the formula he was on, we tried so many different bottles and systems until we came across these. What a lifesaver! The Dr. Brown's bottles do a great job at keeping gas out of baby's stomach but these liners do an even better job! I must say though that I do miss the old design and the expandable liners, I don't know why they changed it but the new design still gets the job done. Now, with our second child these liners are still trumping any bottle feeding system out there. Don't buy the cheaper store brands if you really want your baby gas free, we have tried that and there's a huge difference in them! Will definitely be using these again if we have a 3rd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Changes","review":"This is my 3rd baby. We used playtex bottles with liners for our first 2 kids and loved them!

It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another. I cannot comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze. The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner isn't fully expanded. We measure in a different container and pour into the liner. The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just don't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean. Our other bottles are the good old fashioned Evenflo glass bottles. All in all, we recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"playtex dropin","review":"Our little baby girl had colic so we from the avent bottles to the playtex drop in. The drop ins are easy to use. There is less cleaning to do compared to regular bottles. You just need to clean the nipple of the bottle. One problem with the drop ins is that if you squeeze the air out too fast or too forcefully than the milk will spill out from the side. We've been using these for the past 6 months. The colic went away.

This might be more an issue with the bottle itself than the drop-in.First few times I wasn't careful in positioning the drop in and ending up pouring the most of the milk on baby due to a bad leak. After doing that twice I was more careful in positioning the drop-in.Conclusion it is a great idea, time saver on cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"It needs measurements, but once you get used to it, you won't feel the need to measure the milk anymore.

They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk. I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out, squeezed a little too hard and POP!!, breastmilk everywhere. I learned my lesson- squeeze gently, if at all. My only complaints are: 1. They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it, imho. 2. The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and don't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells, so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk.

It embarasses me to think that our country actually went through this selfish stage. \\"She set about separating another high from the dope on the sheet of paper.\\" Drug crazed hippies.

There are a lot of characters most of which are in one scene and didn't have much significence to the story. Throughout the book I only understood about five sections. The author used words about drugs that I couldn't understand, I didn't know what a \\"fever\\" was or \\"getting off.\\" Many of these words I have never heard before. Each scene of the book was short and insignificant. The author bounced from scene to scene making it difficult to use information from one, very short, scene to the next. In the end of the book you realize there are only three important people and all the rest were fill in's to add to your confusion.

It is hard to have to read a book you don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review from City High School Student","review":"The book Dog Soldiers has a good story line, but the writer makes it kind of hard to understand the story. I like the idea of the book, but I don't think it is written very well. The business about overseas drug dealing is very realistic. It seems that lots of drug dealers get their drugs someplace where it is cheap, and bring it back to the United States, and sell it for big bucks. The main characters are Ray Hicks, John Converse, and Marge Converse. Ray Hicks and John Converse are in Vietnam at the beginning of the story. John and Marge are married, and Marge works at a strip club, and John is a reporter in Vietnam. John Converse, and Ray Hicks are drug dealers. The story gets hard to follow when the characters are running around all over, because the writer doesn't explain who everybody is, and what they are doing with them.

A near-perfect mix of basic science fiction, fast paced action, humor and B-movie thrills, The Hidden also features excellent performances from the leads and supporting actors and great special effects. I personally classify this as a drive-in movie, but that does it a disservice, particularly when you compare it to the usual crappy product out there.

Alien zips around L.A. in a series of stolen Ferraris with classic 80's punk music blaring over the radio. Pursued by another alien, a cop out to revenge the murder of his family and partner. Mega shootouts, lots of guns, rocket launcher, and even a flamethrower.Kyle McLachlan (alien cop) and Michael Nouri (human partner) both play their parts with understated humor. Claudia Christian has a classic bit part as Brenda the stripper - that pose outside the club in her red go-go boots is awe-inspiring.The plot is basic run-of-the-mill science fiction, as the bad alien passes from one human body to another, satisfying a hungry appetite for drugs, violence and fast cars. The movie transcends the mundane because of its subtle humor and commentary on the mores of the times. Sex, drugs and rock 'n roll - just what every alien (and human) in the galaxy really wants.Definitely fun entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this tribute cd is absolutely awesome, all the bands did good jobs covering the sevendust songs, but i must say the best song on there is undermine-x's rendition of \\"bitch\\". ive seen them perform it live, and it had all the same energy as sevendust and then some. the one track alone is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series","review":"The warrior trilogy is the best btech series ever.

My big complaints are that they are too tight, the ear cushions could be softer, and the dial tuner is very narrow in its reception range.

Most pictures are taken from above, so it is hard to see the containers. Pests and diseases are covered in a short section, but there are not pictures or diagrams to help you with these either. For some herbs they tell you what the herb is but not how to grow it.More practical information is needed. There are lots of pictures, but in many pictures the herbs are not identified.

And it's November of 2001 so 9/11 just happened. When the camera pans outside to fans, you can see the busted out windows of nearby buildings.

After sending an email to the company,I received instructions (pretty much the same as the book) to set the remote up. After numerous tries, it worked.

Hoffman does a fantastic job with description but I think she focuses way too much on that front. I felt no sympathy for the characters because really, there was a serious lack of development in each and every one of them. The idea of the Sparrow women and their gifts and their history was an interesting start, but that was really the only thing good about this book.

Alice Hoffman paints pictures of depth and beauty, in a way that seems natural and effortless...the mind just follows her down her winding paths. As she says herself, the characters come to a life of their own and name themselves. These were very real characters to me. The sublties of changes in our perceptions about ourselves and others as we grapple for understanding and connections in life were portrayed in a magically interwoven tale much like real life itself.

The story is excellent; however, the production value leaves a lot to be desired. Many of the jets used were not accurate to the actual event.

It is almost unbelieveable how dangerous the ocean can become in a matter of minutes; the author, Tom Waldron, did a great job of describing the fury of the ocean at it's most violent.Waldron put the story together in a logical, readable format. He included a lot of interesting information about how the ship was built, the history of sailing ships, especially clipper ships, and even included numerous pictures, so one is able to attach faces with names in the narrative.Interesting to me was the description of the life on board the Pride -- lack of space below, lack of showers, etc. A very primitive existance. The vivid descriptions of the storms were captivating -- made the book hard to put down.Finally, the section about the aftermath was most compelling. Waldron described in detail the suffering and emotional roller coaster the survivors went through until their rescue.

This book is the well-told story of each of the crew's background and how they came together to sail on this coveted journey. I appreciated the book's true facts up to and surrounding this event, instead of merely speculating about what really happened.

You can do the preview of the songs to hear for yourself, so I won't get into flow or how anything too subjective. One aspect of their music I really enjoy is that when they tackle a political or cultural topic it doesn't come across preachy or contrived. Often times in hip hop we're either exposed to dim-witted lyrics about bling and jacuzzis, or the same dim-witted \\"artist\\" trying to address a topic that is well beyond their ability to sing about it without sounding sophomoric.Not only do they have good beats, but they have enough talent and brain power to write about a pretty broad range of issues making for an interesting album overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another hispanic reviewer....","review":"This movie had a lot of potential, but it fell into a common trap: its creators allowed their anti-Franco political views and opinions to dominate the film, which is poorly organized and historically inaccurate. Also, Olmos, Garcia and Morales are Latin Americans, not Spaniards. Garcia could pass for a Spaniard, but Olmos and Morales are not believable as Europeans. The movie was filmed in Spain- why not use Spaniards? Plenty of good Spanish actors speak English and could have done a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lorca fan","review":"This film is a complete failure. The film never seems to commit itself to taking an actual stand on Lorca's death. The charectors are a banal typecast and hypothesis of what Spain suffered under the Franco regime. The actors are miscast as Spaniards. First Lorca was just over feet tall and pretty ugly by his own accounts. Andy Garcia is tall and handsome, kind of misleading no? They could have at least used some camera tricks to disguise this. The film's holds little historical accuracy and is unengaging. If one wants a better perspective on Spain durring the civil war, I woulds say \\"Silencio Roto,\\" or even the Orwell inspired \\"Land and Freedom.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie in a movie in a movie","review":"Esai Morales was certainly NOT a captivating central presencein this film, and the movie is better for it. Rather he comes acrossas a benign, and even a little doltish, Everyman. The disconnectedness he feels with his life is not unlike experiences we can all relate to. What is different for his character, is the opportunity to explore the reason for his experience of isolation. We see his internal turmoil reflected, in what he gradually discovers in the lives of the friends and family who surround him, and eventually in what he discovers about the historical events of his home. \\"You don't want to know,\\" he's told; \\"it's better left in the past!\\" And after the film's tense conclusion, we might comclude that, yes, some things really are better left out of our cosnciousness. And every time we see a smiling or thoughtful face, we may wonder just a bit more what unspoken story lies beneath the surface . . . the story of a life, of a family, or even of a country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving","review":"Although not completely historically accurate, the movie was beautifully done, with wonderful performances.

The good thing about this film is that it really made me aware of Lorca, an artist whose name I had known but whose work I had never read before seeing this movie. That alone is worth a star or two. I've discovered in my reading that Lorca was not as politically involved as this film intimates. See it, do some reading, make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over produced, underwritten melodrama.","review":"Woefully inept dramatization of the fate of Spanish poet Garcia Lorca. Top-notch cast is thrown away, while the period detail is totally wasted. A good director (not to mention a good screenwriter) could have made this Oscar-worthy. Instead we're stuck with a tepid \\"what if\\" senario which puts you to sleep long before it makes you think. Sole point of interest is the poetry recited by Andy Garcia as the title character, but for that you can read the author's work and skip this embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"needed for school","review":"i saved money compared to buying new! every penney helps for a student. school is expensive enough for this lady!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Older version was better!","review":"The 11th edition is easy to read helpful for tests and full of information.Definitely a lot cheaper!

Of my 100+ DVDs, this is one of the worst looking with dull colors and a fuzzy image. (Let's hope they're more careful with their upcoming Woody Allen ORION collection.) This is a rather oldfashioned straight-ahead action suspenser like they just don't make them anymore in Hollywood, but it's difficult to be thrilled about that when you know you can enjoy a much sharper version on TV.

Things quickly become more complicated when \`the package' makes a run for it...In short, the acting is all right (though nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are average and below average respectively.The movie does bring to mind The Fugitive, though this film does not really provide as much entertainment.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot.In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here... 2.2 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yearning for Kojak","review":"My husband and 19-year-old daughter abandoned me in the TV room about halfway through.

I have to watch \\"The Conversation\\" about 5 more times so I can wash away the bad memory of this clunker. The motivations of the characters were beyond contrived, the music was on the level of Baretta, and the minor players were utterly forgettable.

High ranking military officials on both sides are in cahoots to derail disarmament talks and Hackman, along with ex-wife Joanna Cassidy, are the only ones who can stop them. Stock secondary characters are on hand to provide a piece of needed information or pull our heroes' fat out of the fire and then die on schedule as required by the screenplay so that the viewer can feel the Sense of Danger and Urgency.

There are abundant novels about serial killers nowadays and grisly descriptions galore. This one doesn't stand above the crowd.I won't give anything away but toward the end of the novel one of the victims has a gun on the serial killer. She describes what she is going to do to him. The reader's reaction is, \\"Oh, for Pete's sake.\\" Every reader knows what she describes is not going to happen. If this scene was meant to heighten suspense it did not.

Technically (as a police procedural or plotting ), this book doesn't work at all. The first technical flaw that raised my eyebrow occurred around page 60 when they allowed the husband of the last victim to become part of the investigational team. No police department in the country would allow that to happen - I don't care how well-connected someone may be. Unfortunately, I can't specifically comment on the plotting without giving away the \\"surprises\\" (which, by the way, there were none). Suffice it to say that I didn't find anything in the book based in reality or half-way \\"believable.\\" The psycho-babble just didn't ring true. I labored through this book and I couldn't wait to get to the end just to see if I had it figured out. Well, there wasn't much to figue out; and the ending? Please. I didn't buy any of it!

This story is about violence, kidnapping and serial murder. Rich housewives in are disappearing without a trace and in each case the clue is a black rose and a note. Truly you are kept at the edge of your seat with Mr. Margolin's style of writing and I am amazed at how he portrays his evil character and the way he incorporates a legal thriller with tons of suspense to go with it. This particular novel and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" are two of the best books around to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book by a very accomplished author","review":"Like all Margolin's books this was very entertaining and so smoothly written you are hardly aware you're reading.

When I buy an entire season of something, I don't want to have to think about it or search the Internet for an episode guide to check that Amazon gave me all that I paid for.

Player Piano is far, far below the rest. This is Vonnegut trying to be a pure science fiction writer, devoid of much of the wit and satire that make his other books so wonderful. Looking for some Vonnegut to read? Try Slaughterhouse Five, Hocus Pocus, or Timequake. Only read Player Piano if you're a Vonnegut fanatic and won't feel complete until you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your ten bucks","review":"I started reading this book with an open mind, but by the end, I could not wait to put it down. It drags its feet through the beginning, however the middle is a bit more interesting. Whatever the middle does is crushed by the sour ending. It seemed this book could have made its point in a 5 page essay without being very repitive.Previous to reading Player Piano, I had read 1984 by George Orwell. Player Piano seemed to be struggling to be 1984, but didn't come to the same level. 1984 was a fast-paced book with a spectacular ending that made it's point by being subtle. Player Piano pretty much hits you over the head with its point from page one.If you are interested in this kind of thing, buy 1984 and forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was slow and completely pointless","review":"At the beginning it started off slow and then it just got pointless. The society ended up the way the society was fighting to end"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Vonnegut books.","review":"Having wrote this book decades before many of his better known works, it has a different personality and vibe than the others. There are no references to other planets or aliens, and this seems more of a philosophical and political book about a universe that is easily envisioned even for our own future should one have utilitarian tendencies in their thoughts. A fascinating premise, interesting universe, but a bit of a disappointing ending. A character with vague but strong anti-establishment convictions loses everything and is so willing to be led by an eccentric man he met at a bar and a college friend, yet gives up after a brief struggle. This didn't make a lot of sense to me. Notwithstanding this, it was one of my favorites by this author if only for the fascinating universe he creates, but also because of the compelling story which ends quite anti-climactically."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav so far of Vonneguts novels","review":"This is only my 3rd Vonnegut reading. I started with Welcome to the Monkey House and then proceeded to Mother Night. Both were very good but I enjoyed Player Piano even more so. I lost interest a little toward the end but then it picked up again. This would be a great book for a HS or College english class with discussion. I also think it pairs nicely with 1984 which usually gets paired with Brave New World, but I like the contrast that Player Piano offers better."},{"rating":"2","title":"socially relevent","review":"This is my first Kurt Vonnegut book and certainly will not be the last. Vonnegut's book the \\"Piano Player\\" is a social commentary disguised as a science fiction novel. His choice of mixing religion and man's need to be useful with the ever-progressing technological evolution is genius. Even if his ideas of technology are a little out of date, the way it affects people's way of living definitely is not. His writing is very light and almost comical at times he doesn't burden the reader with extremes he merely comments on them in short excerpts switching back and forth from different view points and finally having them all come together in the end, proving that each point to characters are making are universally the same. Man needs to be needed. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so funny","review":"This is Vonnegut's first book and is not the typically satirical comedies it is more of serios view of a second industrial age. The book is very thoughtfull and worth a read if your a Vonnegut fan you need to get this book because it provides intersting difrences from his later works but I would not suggest this as a first read of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quick read","review":"A good quick read about an American Society where machines take care of all the work for us humans. After all the mahines are more efficient than man could ever be. Thoughout the book the question is constantly posed \\"if machines do all the work, what is a human being for?\\" The question is mainly left unanswered by kurt, I guess he leaves that up to us to figure out. All in all it was a good book that kept my interest and i would recommend to anyone, especially someone who is a fan of Kurt Vonnegut's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow starter","review":"I've read a couple of Vonnegut novels and have fallen in love with his style of writing from the very beginning. He's is the first author i've had the pleasure of reading where i'm not consistently looking ahead to see how many pages are left in the book. Every book that i've read by him i find myself upset when the story is done. Player piano is no exception. Since I enjoyed Vonnegut's books so much i figured i'd start with his first published novel. This book started off slow but it wasn't tough to follow the story line and stay somewhat interested. By the end of the book i found myself in awe of Vonnegut's insight of the human race. He seems to be able to see the world from a much higher plateau. One part i found particularly interesting was after the rebellion the only listed injuries to the immediate crew were caused by them trying to tame their own people from causing too much harm to the city. Overall a very enjoyable reading experience .... now it's on to Sirens of Titan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing fun story","review":"This Vonnegut novel is about a futuristic world that is controlled by machines and engineers. The main character of the book, Paul Proteus, is an engineer himself, and in the course of the novel he starts to question his job and the society his peers have created. It is a very funny and entertaining critique of modernization and the ever increasing role of machines in our lives. The only problem i had with the book was the ending, which seemed rushed and too short. It seemed as if Vonnegut was not sure where to take the story anymore and therefore decided to end it quickly. Other than that, the book is excellent; it is definitly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"I honestly would of never have read this book if I wasn't in honors English. It is required summer reading, so I had to read it. I am not sorry that I did. In fact, this book is one of the best books that I have ever read. I could hardly tell when it was written. It told the story of the future, where machines had replaced most human actions and the managers were starting to take over the job force. Paul, the main character, is mad over the system and wants to quit his job as manager of the Ilium works. Before he can, he has run-ins with people from his past and from his future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Vonnegut book, that doesn't feel Vonnegut","review":"As I said in my heading, this is probably the greatest Vonnegut book, but it doesn't have the odd and recognizable prose that most of all of his other books have. This was his first book, a satire on society, technology and the future. I wouldn't call it science fiction, I would just call this book 'true'. It has some very interesting and provokative points and really makes you think about where you stand in this world.This is the story of a man named Paul who is very high in a society where it's all based on social skills and your IQ, who is influence by an old friend and breaks away from society loosing everything. It's an amazing book, the only down fall is the length, but I'm not complaining. It's one of those books that when you are done you feel compassion for literature, life, what you have and the fact that Kurt Vonnegut is one of the greatest writers ever. God Bless you Kurt Vonnegut...that's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is still happening","review":"This is the great one.Same phenomenon is still continuing, although the decade is differenent.This is pretty much a glory of engineers, but are they so good in other way.I appreciate it.You go to your office and you will notice that the piano player sits right there.This is one of the greatest books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you do not like this book, don't stop reading Vonnegut","review":"This book did not appeal to me. I have read many Vonnegut books and this one was just boring. Unlike other Vonnegut Books, this did not hook me. It was not interesting or weird, thus boring me to death. To tell you the truth, I skipped many pages just to get done with this book.Like I said, if you hated this book or are about to read it, do not judge Vonnegut by just reading this book. I would rather suggest reading Cat's Cradle, Galapagos, or Breakfast of Champions. This book does not include any of vonegut's black humor, or sheer bizzarity (I have no clue if that is a word) well anyway, The back cover may seem interesting, but the book rarely touches this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly prophetic and darkly satirical first novel.","review":"V. wrote this when computers were just starting to change the way people live and I think the themes of the novel deal with many of the questions that come out of our (now omnipresent) use of computers. Plus, its very funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"It wasn't the greatest dystopian I've read recently, but it was still pretty good. I felt that the society Vonnegut created was believable, and he did a great job of displaying the emotions of the people made useless by machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant.","review":"This book was really thought provoking, and despite my suspicions that it would be just another 1984 type book, it wasn't at all. It presents a very unique and interesting way in which humanity can go screaming from the track into oblivion. It isn't as funny as other Vonnegut, though, so I deducted a star. good stuff. this book should be on school reading lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't nearly aproach Vonnegut's potential","review":"Although I consider myself an avid reader of Vonnegut, I was surprised to find that I couldn't help finding this book kind of childish in the simplicity of it and its message. Don't get me wrong! I love Vonnegut. I'm just saying that this book happens to be an exception to his great work, possibly because it was his first and his style hadn't fully matured then. The true Vonnegut books that I recommend reading, are 'Slaughter-House-five' and 'Mother Night.' Please don't dissmiss Vonnegut as a bad writer if you don't like this book or hear that it isn't good. It is not in any way representational of what Vonnegut can do. Go read 'Slaughter-House-Five' and you'll witness the true power of Vonnegut's art."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Vonnegut novel I did NOT like","review":"Vonnegut is a humane, funny, and unpredictable writer. I have read all of his books and short stories, and this is the only one I just did not like. The style is very straightforward, and in a word, boring.If this is the only Vonnegut you've read, it is not representative of his work as a whole. Try \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" to discover his simultaneously hilarious and heartwrenchingly (what a word!) prose. Read Vonnegut's \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" for one of the best collection of short stories around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut's first book an Orwellian good time","review":"When Vonnegut wrote \\"Player Piano\\", he was primarily a scientist interested in literature. By the time he wrote his next book, the cult-fave \\"Sirens of Titan\\", he was a writer interested in science. The transition is contained between these pages; obviously very influenced by Orwell and showing a society turning itself over to technology. The Frankentstein-comparisons and government-as-fascism schemes are hardly original, but his use of humor is already evident and his characters already rich and full of ideas. Don't overlook this terrific novel, a sort of seperate universe from the rest of Vonnegut's nadir. The situations may not be familiar, but anyone with an appreciation of the author will be thrilled"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Vonnegut's best novels","review":"One of Vonnegut's best novels; certainly his most traditionally narrative and coherent. In the glorious future, machines have freed man from most types of labor, and simplified the categorization of people. Everyone is tested scientifically for IQ, personality, and aptitude; everyone's life determined by the tests. Most people spend most of their time bored; they cannot compete for the few real jobs available, most of them in engineering, and must choose between the Army and the Reconstruction & Reclamation Corps. Only the few, like Dr. Paul Proteus, have IQs high enough to make them more useful than computers. Proteus gets involved in a minor revolution, but it is ultimately to no end.

Usally I don't get into a book as much as did with this book. I can tell the author really wanted to tell people about her fight aganist Polio. I would hate to live in a hospital for a long time like Peg had to. Peg went through a tough time in her life, she had to stay at a hospital, throw away her teddy bear and had to be put in an Iron Lung. An Iron Lung is something your put in to help you breathe. When she was in the hospital she could not have any milk which she was craving for a milkshake. The doctors wouldn't let her have one but her mom gave her one. After that she felt much better. She made three new friends at the hospital. Her parents came to visit her a lot and she even got to go home to visit her family. This was a great book and I won't tell you any more so you have to read yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"i really recommend this book","review":"I read the reviews for this book and I really wanted to read this book, so I bought it. I was hooked on it till the end! It was really emotional and that's actually the first time that I became grateful for the shots we recieve so we don't get Polio. The friends that Peggy meet are really kind and I was surprised that none of them were jealous that Peggy had learned to walk. I was really surprised though when something as small as painted toenails meant so much to Peggy.This book wasn't all serious though, it had plenty of humor sparks and I wouldn't have liked it half as much otherwise. I really suggest this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio","review":"This was an excellent book that very accurately described what children experienced when they contracted polio in the 1940's and 1950's.

However, as I've grown older I have real trouble reading his books. I always find them rambling.After reading the reviews for this book and being told by friends it's a good read I decided to try it. I never really knew what was going on in the book at all. I'm still so hopelessly confused and even though it does read a bit fast, I wasn't happy with the book. It just didn't grab me and make me want to read anything further in this series.If you are a King fan, I'd recommend this book if you haven't read it yet. If you aren't a King fan, I'd suggest not reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"This book does an excellent good job of creating a fantasy world, that can easily be recognized as our own future. Very engaging, mysterious and well written, this book spured me to read other steven king books, which I also, for the most part, enjoyed. The gunslinger has a dark tone of cynicism and hoplessness with a mix of action, thoughtfulness and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of an incredible saga","review":"This book, and the series(so far at least) is pretty different from much of SK's other works. Ive recomended it to many friends and relatives, and most of the time get that question \\"Whats it about\\". Thats a really tough one with this book, and series, basically its about Roland and his quest for the Dark Tower, but explaining much more than that in an understandable way is hard.Someone compared it to Lord of the Rings, and I dont think thats an unfair comparison, they're both fantastic tales of fantastic journeys, and they're both absolutely incredible to read.Read it, you'll be doing yourself an incredible favour, trust me(or if you dont, trust all the other people who also love it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"As a huge King fan, I finally decided to start reading the Dark Tower series. Unfortunately, this first book is pure drivel. I had to force myself to read beyond the next word. While I was hoping for a saga on the level of The Stand, instead all that exists in this book is an incredible disjointed series of stories that go nowhere and are so intensely boring that they are impossible to follow. Epic fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack work from a mega seller.","review":"This is probably the worst book I've read since 'Atlas Shrugged'. I think he wrote it during commercials while watching TV. The writing in the first half was on par with most high school creative writing courses. The plot was very confusing and had a thrown together feel, like 'oh well, I'll clean that up in the next book.'The worst part is that he actually sounded like he liked the story and thought it was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the positive reviews are misleading","review":"Gunslinger is the worst book I have ever had the mispleasure of reading. DON'T believe all the gushing reviews that praise this trash. The characters are flat, the story is skeletal and the book reads like fan fiction. It was probably King's grade school writing assignment -- no kidding. The grammar is awful. The book abounds with errors and incosnistencies. I couldn't wait for it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG LETDOWN","review":"I purchased this book because of all of its glowing reviews.

Boreing and not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the beginning...","review":"The Gunslinger begins the saga of Roland, an old west style gunfighter lost somewhere in a strange parallel world. It is a classic story of good vs. evil and only begins a race to the mythical Dark Tower. This book is a short fast read that sets up the plot for the Dark Tower series. The characters are imaginative and interesting, although King leaves allot of holes in the puzzles their pasts (to be pieced together in later installments). As a stand-alone book, it's average King but it's obviously essential if you want to try on this epic multi-book quest. A decent read that will leave you scrambling for answers in Part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trilogy Type Series Based On A Poem","review":"Not being one who normally reads fantasy, I was surprised when I picked this book up. This was definately a new road with Mr. King. I was further surprised to discover that it was based on the poem Child Roland to the Dark Tower Came by Robert Browning.If you are looking for fast paced Stephen King horror; this isn't it. You won't be disappointed though.At times it seemed a little hard to keep up with who was who and where they were from. This book encompasses everything you can imagine. There's Roland (a knight like figure), Jake Chambers a young boy (becomes a protege to Roland), and there are Susannah and Eddie. All chosen to travel to the Dark Tower and save the world from evil.Being one who rarely if never reads fantasy, I can only compare this book/series with J.R.R. Tolken's Lord of the Rings Trilogy.If you like Stephen King, or if you like fantasy this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Cult Classics Are Not Equal","review":"Hmmmm. I got talked into starting The Dark Tower by several friends who (a) know I have read most of Stephen King's work and (b) have taste that I largely agree with. So I've now made it through the first (short) book that makes up the seven-book series. I had started it many, many years ago and quickly abandoned it, finding it not up to his other works and just not interesting enough to make up for that. Having now finished it, I can say I think both of those facts remain true for me. It's too purposefully mystical and I think largely kind of silly (though not fun-silly). However. I'll continue with the series. I'll read the next book (which I've been told is infinitely better) and eventually probably read all seven. Because I'm that reader who, once he starts, finishes. Unless they start to feel like the kind of head-spinning fun-less work that this one was. At that point, I may abandon my quest. But for now, I'll give the impossible dream a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"The Gunslinger, the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series, is a strange tale, a sort of post-apocalyptic western with magic. The elements are rarely seen together and I can't say that they mesh all that well.The book bounces back and forth through Roland's life. The flashbacks to his childhood were infinitely more interesting than his present chase of The Man in Black. Seeing bits and pieces of what makes Roland chase this man beyond all hope of survival is the only thing that makes the story bearable.Sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow and always too confusing, The Gunslinger is not an enjoyable read. As much as it pains me, I have to admit not liking this book. The afterward by Stephen King describing his writing the book and his plans (or lack thereof) for the series make the reading worth it. I've heard many promises of good things to come in The Dark Tower and can only hope that struggling through this book will be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried again","review":"Tried to read this yet again and yet again have no idea why people like this book.

Instead, I am given a character whom I know NOTHING about (his name isn't even given until midway through!), chasing someone for god-only-knows-what reason, going somewhere with no area description at all, and randomly switching time periods to somewhere and somewhen which, again, we know nothing about. How ANYONE is expected to be able to follow this is beyond comprehension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Awesome start to the Darktower series, here we learn about Roland- the last gunslinger, learn a little of his past and get a glimpse into a dusty, dying world where time is skewed-different from our own, but what also seems connected to our own. We meet Jake, who is thrust into Rolands world from our world by the man in black, and learn of beings much more powerful than the man in black. Roland is shown a vision of his world and universe, and the possibility of infinite universes, his own place in time and space, and learns how his own world is dying. Its a mix of sci-fi, fantasy, and western with a touch of-or even underlying- romanticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter a world like no other...","review":"I don't like Stephen King's novels. I find them dull, wordy and they are some of the only books I can't finish. Then I came across The Gunslinger. It is a book of magic, of another world, of pure and unadulteraded genius. This is the series Stephen King was born to write. From the first sentence you are drawn into the world of the Gunslinger. And you don't escape until you reach the end of the book. I couldn't put this book down and when I finished I read it all over again. I'm not going to go into a long description of the book, I wouldn't do it justice. You have to read this one for yourself. Enter the world of imagination, and from what I gather if you are a King fan, you may recognise some of the characters.

Then around the fifth or sixth book it starts going downhill.

All that I can think is that perhaps I missed something. I found this to be one of the most disappointing books that I have read in quite some time. The characters were uninteresting, the plot read like a re-hashed version of a bad futuristic sci-fi movie, and I never found myself caring for anything that King wrote about. The best way to summarise the plot would be to say that a man walks through a desert for 300 pages {\`it's hot, I'm thirsty, it's hot, I'm alone, etc. etc.} and then meets a man, falls asleep {which is what I kept doing throughout this book} and then . . . sequel? Eugh. Maybe this is all necessary for the rest of the series, but it's put me off them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King is a divine author. The weaver of your most horrifying nightmares, turning them into novels that make your very eyes bleed. The Gunslinger, along with Stephen King's IT, were,in my opinion, his best and most intriguing novels he has ever written.The Gunslinger forms its amazingly twisted plot around Gilead, the last Gunslinger. This Man has amazing skills with his dual revolvers, so much skill that an entire village lies at his feet within seconds. Gilead is in pursuit of the Man in Black, a mysterious figure that lurks in the area. Gilead, on his way, finds a young woman named Alice, and a young New Yorker boy named Jake, to whom he develops a stangely fond attachment to.This novel is read in the third person, with some flashbacks and poetic moments. It is a very mature read, involving strong violence, some language and brief adult content. The book itself is a great, exciting novel that will provide hours and hours of haunt and action. I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's best work","review":"The introduction into the odd world of the story's main character Roland is quite possibly King's finest work. Moving away from his norm of fright/horror, this book takes place in a world in which the world's last gunslinger travels across a rapidly dying world in search of The Dark Tower, a mysterious unexplained destination. However, in this world we see signs that it was at one time the same world as our own (or at least very similar). What makes this book the most interesting is not what it tells you, but what it doesn't tell you. It allows the reader to make their own theories as to what has happened to the world, what is happening, what will happen. The Gunslinger (and the books that follow it in the Dark Tower Series) is one of the best works from this modern writer and is definately worthy of your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, this one just didnt grab me","review":"I just want to say it's not a problem with the author. I have read It, The Stand, and Under The Dome and loved them all. I look forward to reading more of King's work. This one sadly just didn't work for me. The world just wasn't explained enough, couldn't understand the character's motiviations, some kid just gets dropped out of the sky from another dimension, high speech vs low speech (what does that even mean anyway). It got to the point I was so preoccupied figuring out wha and what everyone was that I lost track of the story I was reading. Just distracting.I got halfway through, realized I didn't remember half of what had already happened, and didn't care how it ended. I hate giving up in the middle of a book but it just would have been forced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Gunslinger","review":"This is the first of Steven King's Dark Tower series. It is well written and has a lot of action in it. It is Steven King. I reminds me of a bizzaro western. It has nothing too scary. I liked it. There are some adult situations, but nothing graphic. Some of it reminds me of a good western action book. Some parts are a little weird, but remember who wrote it. In general, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good introduction to series!","review":"Interesting and fun. Not my usual genre, but it was so strange and quirky that I couldn't put it down. The characters are complex and it's tough to describe if I ended up loving or hating them. Just look at this book as an introduction to Book 2, The Drawing of the Three! I can't put it down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"My favorite part of the book was the thoughtful and candid introduction by King, \\"On Being Nineteen.\\" It's downhill from there. Being in between books by Rothfuss, Abercrombie and Martin I grabbed this thinking it might measure up. Not even close. I'm not going to say it's awful, and was a step up from the last Sci Fi book I read, Neal Ambrose's Snow Crash. But I found myself dreading the book, which is not the relationship I like to have with what I'm reading. It seemed clear that King wrote this at an annoying age, when we all think we know everything and are the deepest souls in the world. Much of the story sounds like a first year college student, just discovering mushrooms, blabbing on about the infinity of the universe. I'd love to know King's honest opinion of this book. I'd be proud of it for sure, but would probably provide an intro later in life, like he did, making sure to explain that I wrote it at 19."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate Stephen King? Read this book anyway!","review":"I won't say much except this. I've never liked Stephen King, I don't like the horror genre either.I've loved the first 4 books in the Dark Tower series. King wrote some gripping stories when he wrote these. If you have avoided King but are considering giving him a chance, then buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Un hijo para King.","review":"De todos los libros que he leido de este autor esta saga es, sin lugar a dudas, la mejor. No posee ese suspenso y terror a bestias salvajes, demonios o zombies sino que tiene un terror a lo que tenemos adentro. Este libro muestra el interior de cada uno de los personajes sus odios, sus miedos, sus penas y sus amores. Una historia que comienza con un hombre solo y que pronto se convierte en una aventura de varios. Como bien dice el señor King esta obra es su hijo ya que el puso toda su dedicacion y mejor talento en el.

The gunslinger Roland, is on a quest. The bad guy is none other than Randall Flag (The Stand), a truly evil character, King's best villian. The story, though is rambling and unstructured. There is the feeling that the fleshing out of this excellent short work into novel form was rushed. A few more revisions prior to release and this would have been work worthy of standing with King's best. All in all, a good read for King fans. If you are going to try him for the first time, (Where have you been, in a cave?) then try The Night Shift, his best short story collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary background, but not a great read","review":"The Dark Tower series is a must-read for Stephen King fans and The Gunslinger (Volume 1) is necessary to fully understand the back story and the rest of the works. That said, it's not that great a book on its own. It has a different feel and pace from the other books. Fortunately it's by far the shortest of the series. So put in the effort on this one to enjoy the rest of the series. I found The Drawing of the Three (Volume 2), The Wastelands (Volume 3) and Wolves of the Calla (Volume 5) to be the most entertaining on their own while still advancing the overall series thread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This is a surreal work of fiction.

With it's gritty fantasy feel and an eerie undertone, it sets the reader on a spellbinding journey following Roland's quest for the Dark Tower. King's stark descriptions of this world and it's people are totally amazing. I highly recommend this book and the following volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start","review":"This novel is indeed a good start to a series, however there are too many flashbacks without any real discriptive histories. The character Roland isn't developed like King's other characters, he seems to try and grow without letting the readers have a foundation. I've started book two, and can say honestly that King's growth as an author is evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"how the mighty have fallen....","review":"Stephen King is one of the greatsest writers, alive or dead. However, when I came to read the start of what I thought was going to be a fantastice, un-put-downable series, I was sorely disappointed. I read it all in one hour, in the hope of finding a half decent paragraph which made any sense, but I didn't. Never mind, King, one failure out of many successes isn't so bad, but still....."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame...","review":"This book just isn't any good. There are moments of enchantment and fantasy. However, they are bogged down by King's pretentious use of character dialogue (you need a dictionary at every page of the book) and King's unimaginative way of using made up words (to obviously describe made up worlds and their societies) without defining what the words actually mean! It's bad writing at best. It's as if King wrote this thinking it was going to be special and great and that it was going to be his \`Narnia' or \`Lord of the Rings.' Not even close, bro. I sadly bought the second book when I bought the first one. Not even going there... I look forward to reading his new book, \`Under the Dome.' However, skip this bloated piece of self indulgence and save your cash..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown","review":"I suspect King imagined countless scholarly students pouring over this work in another 100 years, following a carfully-crafted path of symbolism much like Chaucer's works referenced in the afterword.Along with his usual tedious description, King gives us a story written in a characteristicly pompous voice. With no real plot and characters drawn in fluid terms that don't every quite allow us to engage with them, this novel doesn't make for an entertaining read.If you want to follow King down the rabbit hole he dug, you'll enjoy The Gunslinger. But if you believe he would do well with an editor who had an affinity for chopping large swaths of description and one that insisted on him having at least some thread of a reasonable plot, then don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"M-O-O-N that spells BORING","review":"I read this book 6 years ago before I started college and it's as memorable as my freshman semester's party induced blur.

I will not be that person. What a great story. It was crafted so gradually, I had no idea what was really going on until the end - which is how a great book is written. It sort of sucked me in one page at a time. The book is about a man tracking another man - and throughout the story we find out why - and where we are in time. That's it. So simple, yet this story is so full of nuances that I couldn't put it down. I am officially all-in on this series and can't wait to start the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cup of tea...","review":"I have tried for a long time to like Stephen King... starting quite a few books (simply because all my friends read him) and seldom finishing them.

Many people have recommended the series, but I guess I've been biased: I didn't think Stephen King would be able to write a good fantasy novel, let alone a series. I was wrong. Dead wrong. From the first sentence, \\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed\\", I knew I was hooked. Just shy of a week later I had nearly completed the first four books of the series. And in my opinion, that's a great review in itself. If you like fantasy novels, mystery, a bit of horror and good old western tales (be it books or movies), this is a book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I'll be perfectly honest right up front. This book took a while for me to get into. It seemed to drag on for a while before it started picking up. Once it picked up, I couldn't put it down. Roland is a character with a deep rich history that i would have loved to have read more of, but that comes later in the series. No let down here. Four stars because it took so long to get going. Definitely worth picking up if you want a series that is fairly well screwed up as only King can do them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this book and give up on the series!","review":"I read this after a friend read it and loved it. I read it and thought it was mediocre at best. However, I refused to give up on the series and possibly miss out on a great saga, and I am very glad I didn't. After I read part II: The Drawing of the Three, I came to appreciate this book for what it is; a prologue of sorts, much like \\"The Hobbit\\" in the LoTR Trilogy. This book introduces you to Roland, and starts his massive quest for the Dark Tower.Each book in the series leave enough questions to keep you reading the series and wanting to understand everything. As the saga progresses, everything starts to add up and connect. That said, judging the series on a single one of the books would be a crime. I loved this, though it isn't his usual captivating horror. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book left off at a cliff hanger leaving the reader to thirst for more.

The story follows a man on a lonely journey to pursue the mysterious man in black who holds the secret to his future. The scenes are dazzling and the symbolism will blow you away.

In closing, I implore you: Please read this book. You have no clue..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, not his best","review":"While reading this book I kept having to go back a few pages to an entire chapter to see if I missed something. The story jumps around in such a way that it is difficult and sometimes impossible to figure out what has happened.The parts of the story I understood I liked, not loved. Apparently this book took some 13 years to write, and I think part of my problem following it was when the writer would set it down for a year or two then pick it up and start writing in a different way with a different idea of who the character was supposed to be. I could be wrong but that was the idea I got from reading this book.I heard my friend raving about how great this series is, I picked it up to see what she was talking about. After reading it front to back (and several chapters two or three times) I still have no idea what the fuss is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Tower Series Great, but Skip to Book Two!","review":"The Dark Tower series is outstanding. But episode one is often slow, slow. Achingly slow travel across endless landscape. Much of it was apparently written by King early in his career. Skip to The Drawing of the Three, with its recap at the beginning. Then enjoy, as episode two is great, with its clever travel from Roland's post-apocalyptic world to our world of the 60s then 80's then 90's. Book Two becomes much more sci-fi fantasy. You'll miss little by going into the more current Drawing of Three, a much better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book that made me a reader for life","review":"My dad brought me to the book store when I was 13 years old. I, with great luck, picked this book out. It made me into a reader for life. The world sucked me in. The vague, but intriguing story held me from cover to cover.So if you're young, or you want an open ended adventure to suck you in for many thousands of pages (meaning this and the rest of the series) then dive in and read these books. They are something to behold, and they just may make you enjoy the art of writing all that much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars as a standalone, 5 when considering the series","review":"The Gunslinger is a worthy introduction to the world of Roland and his quest for the Dark Tower. It sows the seeds for what is shaping up to be a definitive, ingenius masterpiece of a series.A very short novel, but it gets its job done. It gives us an overall character sketch of Roland and his obsession, gets Jake into the mix early, and tells the tale of a bit of adventure in the final days before Roland finally meets Walter, the man in black.Besides its foretelling and awesome conclusion, The Gunslinger, when considered alone, is little more than an adventure story in a strange world (albeit beautifully told, as always when discussing the King). When considered with the entire series, it becomes obvoius that King is deliberately laying the ground for something absolutley huge.So go ahead, read this one (You can do it in one sitting, I know you can), and then pick up The Drawing of the Three. Now that's classic King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not King's style, but still very good","review":"This book surprised me ALOT. I have read most of King's works and have found them all quite enthralling (let aside \\"Gerald's Game\\") and yet I had read none of the books in the 'Dark Tower' series, so with nothing else to read, I read \\"The Gunslinger\\". I read this book in one day, as it was very interesting, intriguing, and full of suspense. I can't wait to read the other books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat confusing as you read it, but looking back it really sticks with you.","review":"I read about 100 pages of this, stopped it, then after reading some reviews on the collection of books in this story, decided to muddle through. It was hard for me to get through it, but once I did, it really left an impression with me. It's hard to explain, but looking back after having read all 7 of the books, this one is most certainly a great start. It sets a mood that just clicked with me.I really didn't appreciate it as much as I read it or even right after I read it. Really it did not resonate with me until I was into the 3rd or 4th book.Anyway, as I know other reviewers have pointed out, the first of the series is the hardest to get through, but once you do, you'll quickly be rewarded for it and looking back will likely remember this book more fondly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of an amazing journey!!!!!!!","review":"This is the first installment of Stephen King's Amazing Dark Tower series.

Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Book","review":"Stephen King's The Gunslinger was excellent! It is the first of four books in the series of The Dark Tower. The Gunslinger is part fantasy and part science-fiction. The Gunslinger is following the man in black, but this is not his ultimate goal. The Gunslinger wants to reach the Dark Tower. The Dark Tower is a very mystical place because King does not reveal what the Dark Tower really is. Even the Gunslinger doesn't know. He just knows that he has to find it. With each coming day, you find out a little more about the world that the Gunslinger lives in, which is different from he world we live in today."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition contains many typos, and the odd grammar error","review":"This printing of the book is definitely not up to King's usual standard, though much of the blame may be placed on the publisher. There's numerous typos (at least in this edition of the book), with letters like h substituted for n (she raised her nands to her face, for example), and there is the odd grammar mistake. It also appears disjointed, with things happening without any explaination, or only a partial explaination. For example, a demon that possesses a woman is killed (we know this because the gunslinger says it is dead) but no explaination is given for how it was done, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous and exciting, a fanstastic book!!","review":"This book is one of my favorite-ever books. It definatly is not for the young reader. It has some vulgar language, and many chapters are all about killing. But for the older and more matuer reader, it is a classic. The book concerns a dark man who wanders through the desert after nuclear war wiped out most of the world. He is on a quest to find the man in black, who he has been following most of his life. A mist read for science fiction lovers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted language","review":"The story jumps around a lot with little in terms of segues. It was tricky at times to even figure out what was going on. I suppose I expected more from the book he allegedly considers to be his magnum opus. I really wanted to enjoy this book, but I had no idea what was going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing a dark tower?","review":"I think Ka dictates who reads this series or not, so I dont see the point in trying to make a persuading argument for or against.

In this story Gunslinger Roland is searching for a mysterious Man in Black, who just might be able to help the Gunslinger find the Dark Tower.There are a lot of subtlety and vision into Roland's life that is intriguing, to say the least. Roland is a kind soul, but very capable of violence. There is a shootout in this story- that's not to say this is a western because it is far from it. But, who would have thought Hey Jude would be playing in a saloon. King is at his best at spinning yarns that stagger the imagination of the reader. He is truly a master when it comes to writing great tales.

Books that prove to be an extraordinary epic. Get through this book and move onto the second of the series, they get much better from then on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing mix of a western/fantasy. The start of a great tale","review":"The gunslinger, takes you to a world that is beyond our own but shares some common history. It takes you to the start of Roland's great quest, and makes you wish you could go with him. It also shows you that Roland quest, is the most important thing in his life. After I read this story I never had more anticipation in my life as I waited for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The Gunslinger was a very interesting and intriguing book. I like books with new concepts, not the same old love story or action book. The Gunslinger tale is very unique. My head was constantly swirling attempting to grasp where exactly Roland was.

I look forward to reading the rest of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gunslinger shoots own foot","review":"The mish-mash of Western, Sci-fi, and Fantasy is very contrived, and leaves a bad taste in the reader's mouth. The plot was very linear, and the ending just falls away. I will not be reading the next 7 in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculous start to a great series","review":"The title says it all. The Dark Tower series on the whole is magnificent, but it starts off the wrong way. This book is just 200 pages of drivel where nothing important happens and next to nothing is explained. Borrow it just for the conversation with Walter at the end (which still doesn't explain or clarify anything; if it relates to the rest of the story at all I haven't yet seen how), but everything before it is pointless. I'm glad I gave the other books in the series a chance. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they're not nearly as bad as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King disappoints for the first time","review":"Considering how many novels I've read by Stephen King, and considering that he is my favorite author, I am devastated that this book disappointed me SO much! Some of King's earlier works are not among his highest rated works (according to me) but this book is lower than all of them. For the first time I had to force myself to keep reading this book through to the finish because I simply could not get to any excitement. Ever. True this book may simply serve as an introduction to King's \\"magnum opus\\", but to save his readers from allowing the tragic dismay at the lack of excitement and unfulfilling plot from dissuading them to continue on with the series, this book ought to be combined with the second. After all, this book left me feeling like I had wasted $9.00 on what I thought would be a sure bet. I'm sure that I will continue on to \\"The Drawing of the Three\\", but I will not be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, long, and dry","review":"I understand that this book is just the first in a large series but there were so many loose ends that the novel was rather confusing throughout the story, even in the end. None of the characters aside from the main two hang around long enough for you to become attached to them. Compared to other Stephen King books that I have read, this was definitely on the lower end. Many of the characters in the story were also rather disappointing. Most characters hardly stick around for more than a couple chapters, and others are simply memories of the main characters. In a story with very little background, this just adds to the complexity of the story. I am giving the second book a chance now just to see what the hype is all about but I would recommend just picking up one of his many other novels instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was horrible for me","review":"I know this is a stephen king book and I loved other books by him but still, i just couldn't read this one.It was boring.

The characters are too shallow for one thing.

I honestly found some Agatha Christie novels more creepy than the supposedly horror stuff this guy writes. But that is not the point here, this is not a horror novel. The problem with this book is that it is so difficult to get yourself interested enough to keep on turning the pages. Stephen King at 19 was a poor wordsmith and I repeatedly found myself getting plain bored. And I am a fantasy lover and a guy who enjoys Western movies too.

I have since read that Steven King wrote this over many years, and did not have a plan for the story when he started. To me, it felt just like that, incomplete, unplanned, and just a rambling idea.

This was the first Stephen King book I have read and I believe it will be my last. I am an avid reader of quality fantasy/sci-fi books and the Dark Tower series was recommended by a co-worker. I had a really hard time fininshing this book and when I finally did, I felt like I had completely wasted my time. The world that King tried to create was vague at best. The book went nowhere and I felt like I knew nothing about the characters when I was finished. Many chapters did not make sense and I could not vizualize much of what I was reading. The other books in the series might be better, but I will not be wasting more time to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, just Not King's normal style","review":"I'm well behind the curve here as this book came out many years ago. But after seeing it recommended by another author online I decided to pick it up. And I'm hooked! It's not like his other stuff and is more of a science fiction book than the mystery/horror novels by Stephen King. Of course his characters came to life just as well or even better than in some of his past works. I enjoyed it so much I'm now on Drawing of the Three.I say if you like King and also like syfy you should thoroughly enjoy The Gunslinger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of literature","review":"I can't find anything wrong to say about this book. The foreward by SK, as well as the illustrations simply add to it's overall value. This writing, done by King in 1970, is genuine and enthralling. There is a timeless appeal to a story like this, and King is able to slowly build worlds both seen and unseen, while adding rich and believable characters that stay with the reader. An Imaginative landscape that has no boundaries, The Gunslinger is a classic that has stood the test of time. Whether you are new to King's work or have read many of his novels, this is a great place to start. I look forward to the next novel in the series.DW"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic sequel to 69 original. Made in 70 or 71 I think.

This \\"Faerie\\" book seems contrived & cranked up as propaganda to put the Fae of many cultures, as well as the Elementals of Nature under an artificial construct of male rule. It seems someone's ego got away with them here. It is not really about what the title suggests. Very misleading.If you believe the realms of the Fae & the powers & beauty of nature should be modeled after \\"man's kingdoms\\" & \\"societies\\", instead of the other way around, go for it. Otherwise you will be as disappointed as many, by a closer insight into the mindset of a modern male author, you hoped would do better. I'm very sorry to say I can not recommend this book. In fact IMHO it is a heartbreaking attempt to usurp the Fae, for misguided use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faerie has it's own agenda.","review":"The author of this book seems to have had no real experience with the subject he is writing about and has not only approached the faerie realm and faeries from a scientific and scholarly point of view, but he hasn't done his research well enough to succeed from that angle. He seems to have taken his viewpoint from theosophical works rather than from actual experience. The New Age philosophy which reduces faeries to elementals or diminished nature spirits is disrespectful. The suggestion that faeries are lesser inhabitants of an Angelic Kingdom who can be called upon or commanded by human ritual as helper spirits or gaurdian angels is dangerous and distracts from recognition of a genuine experience with Faerie. If you are looking for a guide to the otherworld realm or non-fiction material that is evocative of Faerie, I would suggest reading the works of R.J. Stewart as an antidote to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was used to Ted Andrews writing in a style that was methodical, approachable, accurate, and mystical.

I hold nothing against him--the rest of the works I have read which he authored are very well done. However, I would not recommend his foray into the Faery realms.

Penelope's conversation with Richard is often hilarious. The best dialogue has to be when she is discussing a friend's elopement. It had me laughing uncontrollably.

I purchased it for use in wedding videography. It works well for short range (10-15') such as interviewing party guests. It's not intended to cover a long distance. The IR feature is a great extra. I also like the fact that it draws its power from the camcorder battery.

The cams built in IR and Video light is rather weak and works ok at short distances. With this light mounted, it's a game changer! Illuminates IR and Video light much further and brighter then what I expected. I actually have to turn it down a notch most of the time. The extra overhead is more then welcome!

The first few cakes were nearly burnt near the middle of the pan while still raw near the edges, and the last few I gave up and just cooked one at a time in the middle of the pan.

Calm, reassuring, logical. Easy to listen to. Then, it was bait and switch with a voice that I just could not listen to. It sounded put-on and stuffy which was the opposite of what I was trying to picture with the book. To me, it sounded like Elmer Fudd sucking on helium. I suppose everyone else on the planet would love this voice but I could not stand it, so returned the CDs for the book which is simply excellent. The book is a FIVE, for sure.The CDs were based on the old version of the book. They had much less information than that book which has less than the new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brevity as an Effective Communication Skill (would that it were!)","review":"Mr. Luntz sites brevity as an effective communication skill, yet he goes on and on and on with his examples and repeats himself throughout the book.He uses the book as a vehicle to promote his Republican platforms, which is boring and annoying.He is a little impressed with himself and is not afraid to share that with the reader. An especially distasteful example of this is his self-serving introduction about performing for Democrats and celebrities at Ariana Huffington's home.He tries to imitate Steven Levitt's style of writing but he's just not that interesting or cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words that Work","review":"Disappointing. Deceiving title. I purchased the audio version of this book on line simply based on the title. I thought I'd be getting a book to \\"introduce\\" me to some colorful and effective words. Big mistake! Too political! Had I known this, I would never have purchased the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For someone extolling the virtues of word effectiveness it's shocking how many grammatical errors the author makes. While there are some fascinating aspects to the book the negative aspects outweighed the positive ones. I was also distracted by the author's arrogance and right-wing stance. The buzzwords made the book read like an \\"infomercial.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It works only if I an given a fansy speech.","review":"I need hard core stuff for the current work environment. I don't need to know how to deliver some fancy speech. This book was very disappointing to me, only because the author outlines non related issues that are not relative in the work place."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're not planning to write political speeches or ad copy, leave this one on the shelf","review":"The jacket might play up helping you say the right things to get a promotion, get on a booked plan or get out of a ticket, but that advice takes up ten pages of the book, total.The rest might interest you if you want to know how to write a winning political speech or make people buy your company's product. Or, perhaps if you'd like to be beaten over the head with the history of successful ad campaigns and are fascinated by trivial knowledge about TV jingles. If you like rambling books that circle back to \\"clever\\" points made earlier, you'll love it.But if you were hoping the book might be relevant to your own life otherwise, you're SOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freshman material","review":"I am always suspicious of people who insist on putting \\"Doctor\\" in front of their name. My suspicions proved true. this book is well suited for a high school or college 101 level communications class. It's all about superficial tricks with language. Perhaps George Orwell read a similar book before he wrote the famous ending to his work \\"1984.\\" Luntz advocates using words that are appealing to the audience. When you read how they were applied in political campaigns you can see how we end up with the contentious Congress that we have today. If you buy it, get a cheap used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"This is a great book that I use almost on a daily basis! The mailer did a great job of getting in to me in a promptly manner. I recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Books That Waste Time","review":"Having heard Luntz interviewed on Talk Radio several times, I thought this might be just the book to give me insight into the word smithing that goes on behind the scenes in politics.Unfortunately, Luntz' writing style is bland, droll, and boring. So much so, that the reader's mind wanders almost immediately.Perhaps there was an unimaginable recovery after the first forty or so pages, but I find it highly unlikely.In summation, when I finish a book I deliberately leave it where someone else can find and hopefully enjoy it. With Luntz' book, I threw it in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for Getting your Message Understood","review":"I am running for Congress in WI and this is my main book for communicating my message both verbally and in writing. I cannot recomment it enough!Marge Krupp"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"There are a few very interesting stories and some interesting comments. By and large, it is a \\"7 Habits\\" wanna-be and he spends way to much time talking about himself. A bit of common sense will cover the territory he tries to cover in this book.In the last section where he promises to tell you the words that work to get you through everyday things like traffic tickets, he basically says make up a good story and lie like a rug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book should be titled \\"Words That Work If You're Talking to Dumb Rednecks\\". It's entire premise is to use small words and short sentences so the lowest common denominator of the population doesn't get confused by what you're saying. This book will appeal to the Jerry Springer crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in the book because the author didn't write what he purports to have written. This isn't a book about clear communications rather it is a primer on how to use language to manipulate your audience. It would be most applicable to people in advertising and politics especially the spin doctors (left, right or in the middle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'WORD' to the wise","review":"I recommend people read this book (borrow it, don't spend money on it) for self defense; to better understand what they're up against in the world of politics, power and media. This book reinforces the fact that too many people in positions of authority use language to manipulate the uninformed, the gullible and sometimes even the worldly-wise. Call me naive, call me an idealist, but language should be used to convey truth....not to fool people into thinking something is other than it is. The honest and appropriate language for this book is 'despicable'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double-speak","review":"I just heard the author speak on NPR and he is phenomenally dishonest. He claims to seek \\"clarity\\" and \\"objectivity\\" in language, and yet every turn-of-phrase he wants to promote (\\"gaming\\" instead of \\"gambling\\"; \\"energy exploration\\" instead of \\"drilling,\\" and so on), betray his right-wing political biases. The irony is that he bases all his Orwellian newspeak on carefully skewed polls. Where's the \\"objectivity\\" in that? The key is in the subtitle of this book. He is mostly concerned with the political impact of his proposed terminology, and he crafts that terminology to manipulate public opinion in favor of conservative agendas. It would be much more palatable if he were simply honest about that agenda, instead of professing his supposed apolticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Right Wing Playbook","review":"Frank Luntz didn't learn much on the way to his PhD. This book is just another look at his reframing expertise for bad ends. As Maxwell Smart would say, \\"Why couldn't he use his powers for goodness, not evil?\\" His up is down, and wrong is right spinning makes my own head spin. Anyone looking for an objective treatise will be cheated. If you want to read about the psychology of framing, read George Lakoff instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Right Wing Spin","review":"Since the November 2006 mid-term elections, for the first time I actually enjoy listening to right-wing talk radio - Hannity, Limbaugh, Boortz (the Limbaugh wanna-be), Savage, etc. Why do I listen? I enjoy listening to them and their callers whine about their loss!!!Even here, in writing their reviews, the right-wingers are still in denial that the country has changed direction.However, I do recommend Frank Luntz's book to Progressives who want to gain a strategic insight into how the right wing operates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to read if you want to induce a coma.","review":"I have a theory about people who rate products with one star--they are basically clueless whiners. So, when I read the one star reviews of Luntz's book, my first thought was that these were just some pedantic elites with sunburns on the inside of their nostrils. I'm going to have to change my theory because they were right.Most of the main ideas are fairly common knowledge. I thought Luntz would get into more of the psychology of his work, but he drones on with example after example after example. Frank, we got the point after the first example.Click on the Table of Contents, read that, and you will save yourself a few bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Influencing public opinion by the power of words","review":"An interesting and informative read. The author makes his living by putting a positive spin on words and phrases that influence public opinion. He and his market research company have largely served the national Republican leadership and other corporate clients.He gives examples of words that work and those that don't. However, his concern is strictly with winning with words, and not about the consequences of putting in power those who may or may not be concerned with the common good or the public interest. This fact makes it imperative for voters to search for alternative and independent sources of information, and not rely on mainstream media to get the \\"facts\\".George Lakoff's \\"Don't Think of an Elephant\\" should also be read to put this author's work in a larger political context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful","review":"I didn't make it all the way through this book, but I was able to comb through much of it to pull out the meat I was looking for. I was particularly fascinated with how words change over time and what words have more power in one's sales copy now. I have incorporated much of what I've learned. Thanks Dr. Luntz. I enjoy your focus groups on Hannity too."},{"rating":"1","title":"But what if I hear this?","review":"But what I hear is a deeply mendacious piece of self-promotion, which speaks at length about the author's achievements in public life, but which cannot keep its own promises. The blurb claims that this text \\"raises the curtain on the craft of effective language.\\" Yet this is not a book about effective language; rather it is about manipulation. It's not about getting your message across; it's about getting people to agree to a message that has been tailored to elicit that agreement, whatever its real content might turn out to be.If I'm wrong about this, then the author is by no means in control of his own message. If I'm right, then the author is by no means in control of his own message."},{"rating":"1","title":"and too many that don't","review":"Save your money. Mr Luntz has loaded this tome with lots of pointless trivia. There is a table of jargon along with their meanings. Did you know that \\"bling\\" means bright , flashy jewelry? Or how about this brilliant insight,\\"What's particularly striking about the new language is that it is coming not from the older elites of society who live in wealthy suburban neighborhoods but from the hip-hop youth culture found in America's urban areas.\\" You will not be sharing these insights at your wealthy suburban tea parties or with your hip-hop, bling encrusted pals either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, read Strunk and White instead","review":"Aside from the personal anecdotes, there is little in this book that is original or frankly (no pun), all that helpful.For example, most of the points he includes in his chapter \\"Ten Rules of Effective Language,\\" are far more effectively (and wittily) presented in the old standby Strunk and White and like writing manuals.Most of the rest of this stuff can be picked up in your average self-help book or a marketing manual.And yes, I've heard Luntz on radio and seen him on TV. He comes across every bit as disingenuously as he does in writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The books that works","review":"Like Roger Ailes book You are the Message years ago this Republican writes about communication in about as non-partisan way as he could. Luntz is a good communicator. Every key idea is repeated enough for the fast and sometimes uncareful reader to still get all the main points. His chapter on words that work in personal life was not very strong. But if you are like most of the readers of this book you buy it because of the public discourse and its weaknesses for personal words that work will be only a minor distraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little insight, too annoying a voice","review":"I had a terrible time listening to this ebook, as I found the voice most annoying.A certain amount of horn-blowing is expected from an author, especially one whose main field is advertising, but the amount of self-promotion in this book was really unacceptable, particularly in light of the minimal number of insights actually in the book.There are (unintentionally) humorous bits, though. As when the author spent several pages telling about the importance of brevity. :-)The book may be better than the audiobook - at least you won't have to listen to that voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Orleans Legacy","review":"This was a very hard to put down book! I loved the historical background to the story. New Orleans is truly the most fascinating city in America. I would have given it 5 stars, but one part of the story bothered me. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I will not tell what it was. It described in detail the famous Quadroon Balls, life in an Irish boarding house and even meals and why they are served on certain days. Just little details like that shows that Alexandra Ripley did alot of research for this story. I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Orleans Legacy","review":"This paperback was shipped quickly which was great.

Also there are recipes that call for cheese--that again, I seriously doubt whether she has tried to make using dairy-free cheeses.There are typos all over the book, the degree sign for temperature is somehow missing, knead is spelled \\"kneed,\\" plum is spelled \\"plumb,\\" and there is no help as to number of servings each recipe is supposed to make. The references to \\"big black mammies\\" and, in the intro, for \\"girls\\"--\\"find out what his favorite foods are\\" and \\"wear a little apron\\" were unnecessary.

I'll paste what the page says, but I take from it that Symonds not only explores but probably glorifies Michelangelo's alleged homosexuality.I don't care about Michelangelo's sex life. I do care whether a biographer presents an *objective* account of his subject's life.\\"John Addington Symonds (5 October 1840 - 19 April 1893) was an English poet and literary critic. Although he married and had a family, he was an early advocate of male love (homosexuality), which he believed could include pederastic as well as egalitarian relationships. He referred to it as l'amour de l'impossible (love of the impossible). A cultural historian, he was known for his work on the Renaissance, as well as numerous biographies about writers and artists.

As a non-Spanish speaker, this has helped me to be able to nod my head when students are discussing the meaning of a new English word amongst themselves. There are many pictures in the book to accompany new vocabulary. The majority of the exercises are done in English without translations provided. The directions, however, are given in Spanish.

There is almost surely no real life plant that carries a controller based on this design. Additionally, the authors present a mathematical treatment of an engineering subject, but the treatment fails to give the experienced control engineer any insight.From the point of view of mathematical control theory, the book is simply a watered down version of a few topics in infinite dimensional optimization and functional analysis. It is based on an application of the Hahn Banach theorem to a formulation of the control problem. It also contains a lot of mathematical facts, but it does not tie them well to control theory. So the mathematician will get little insight into the subject of control.Here we have a book that is neither useful to the engineer, nor to the mathematician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School Information, Nothing New For This Generation!","review":"Not a very good book.

I like them while they work, but can't help feeling cheated when they fail so quickly. I'd willingly pay more for a durable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philco","review":"Ladies & Gentlemen, save your money and don't bother to buy these if you want reliability.Shortly after I purchased these, the electronics quit working. It was very static and would shut off for no reason. This situation got very frequent over two weeks and finally quit working totally. All functions were affected: am/fm radio and the input jack. The batteries were not the problem. Also cheap flexable plastic battery door that broke completely off because of cool weather making it stiff.I finally had to toss them in the trash can because was totally unuseable. I gave them 2 stars because they do block sound very well and fit your head comfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very good product","review":"After reading a few reviews I wasn't so sure about this headset. I guessed correctly that the people who had poor radio reception may live in areas that have a high level of airwave interference. My headset has great reception for both am and fm. I haven't figured out yet how to use my ipod with it. I think I need to buy an adapter, similar to a car adapter.Now I can cruise around with my lawnmower and listen to the radio , very nice.....it keeps my ears warm too..UPDATE..after coming back I see I made a mistake with my star rating...it should be 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with reception and durability","review":"I have used my headset almost daily for a year and would gladly welcome a better product with the same features. The reception is poor compared to any other radio I use. It's fine for strong stations but cannot pull in others that I routinely listen to.Then, in the 13th month the stereo started to cut out intermittently (the non-radio side has no sound). The company offers a 12 month warranty and their rep declined to extend the warranty, which I find discouraging.I'd like to see a quality product offered by another company. It appears to be a very simple feature set.Update: After paying for a repair to restore stereo to the headset the on/off switch appears to have failed after about 18 months of use. So now I have hearing protection without any audio. I am waiting to see if the manuf. will help me this time and would be happy to update this review again if the situation improves. But I still say that there is room for a more durable product here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality!","review":"To start with the audio quality is muffaled and dose not get very loud. I also tryed to hook up my mp3 player but it was in mono! I retured this item. Would not recomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"RETURNED","review":"The performance of this radio was totally unsatisfactory. I returned it. Could tune in very few stations and it would not hold those. In these days of electronic \\"miricles\\" this radio was a joke. I ordered a better one in the fiftys with Bazoka comics.

Remembering the Ireland of decades gone by, and scrutinizing political happenings in the Ireland of today, Forever Green is a compelling, emotional and heartfelt work embracing the continual flux of Irish culture up to the modern day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensually Perfect!!!!","review":"I first spotted Sensual Phrase on AMAZON.COM, after reading MARS (which was great!) Sensual Phrase was recommended. I'm very picky with what mangas I read/buy but I decided to try out vol. 1. I read it while waiting for long airport delays and the day after I landed I went straight to the local bookstore and walked out with 2, 3, and 4! This manga is so good!!!!! It's geared for more of a mature audience. My friends were mocking me cause I'm a college student curled up in the campus Library reading this book, I handed vol 1 to one of them and now their all hooked!!! Sensual Phrase is refreshing and addicting I'm up vol. 6 now and it's just gets more and more interesting as I read on. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"In the beginning their love was a precious secret. Sakuya, the lead singer for Lucifer, was the seemingly unattainable object of desire for millions of hopeful women. Aine was a young and naive lyricist who suddenly found herself in the middle of a raucous rock 'n' roll circus. The two lovers fell into each other's arms one night and tried their best to keep the torrid affair private.Now, in a press conference that surprises everyone, Sakuya publicly declares his love for the petite towhead songstress. But Aine, much to Sakuya's chagrin, is far from happy.Although she loves him madly, Aine is worried about her future with the intense and reedy superstar. Suffering in silence, she's been waking up with morning sickness. The world of rock'n'roll is no place for children and Aine is afraid that a spawn of Lucifer will cool the heat that Sakuya feels for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual Fantasy","review":"I love this whole series of Kaikan/Sensual Phrase books. I first got into it when I was in High School and I read volume 6 from my friend during our free period. I totally fell for how graphic and appealing it was. It's like no other manga Ive ever read. Now I'm getting the series to have at home. I read it over and over again. Though it is explicit and graphic, it has a great story line and it always keeps you guessing! You feel a little naughty reading it, but there's so much more to it than the moans and sighs of Aine. As a woman you really put yourself in the place of Aine, cuz Sakuya is every girls dream of how she would want her man to be. Tall, strong, completely devoted to you, romantic, caring, kind, mature, secure...the list goes on. Everything you want hes got it! It's an escape...a sensual fantasy you'd want to be in. Very interesting and worth reading series."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh its good!!!","review":"ok i've read all the books and cant wait for the new one , such a long wait dont know if i can take it. but to pass the time i just read some more manga , but i had to find ones that had some sex in it cuz it just is'nt good for me if it dont. now lets see if ur waitin for the new one to come out and u need somethin good to read i would read, desire climax , love celeb , or red river. red river has a good story line plus sex so how could u go wrong. anyhoo i luv sensual pharse but at first i was'nt sure cuz i dont really read books the have singers or sports in it, this dosent have sports but u get the idea.i thought why not plus i didnt have anythin else to read at the moment and it was late so i wanted somethin spicey to read. and then i got hooked how could u not the guys r sexy and theres lots of steamy moments.... by the way i luv yuki hes so sexy luv the long hair!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is for those who are desperate for change in the way they experience corporate life in the church of Jesus Christ. It is a call to the NT pattern which is centered around Christ alone. This book causes you to examine how we do \\"church\\" and that the church is a glorius living extension and representation of Jesus Christ. You will be challenged and changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that put's the focus back on Christ where it belongs","review":"A very good work showing how we have moved away from Christ our center. Frank is able to express Christ's heart for His people and how they come together in Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all encompassing book of the New Testament church.","review":"I found this book with its thought provoking chapters to be extremely worthwhile reading. Frank Viola describes the church in the first century in a captivating fashion. Viola profoundly equates the New Testament church with today's organized church. This book is for those seeking \\"renewal\\" in their church life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excited reader","review":"I feel this book is the modern match to Watchman Nee's great book THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH LIFE. Viola's book is the best I've ever read on church renewal. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Mitford series","review":"I've read a lot of Jan Karon's writings and find them milktoast. But this author not only entertains with a fast moving story, she also manages to leave me with some food for thought.I find her work a lot like the Glady Taber journals. And the characters remind me of Aunt Bee and Andy and on the old Andy Griffin show. This is a warm, relaxing read, remiscent of a gentler time. I hope she continues on with Dorsetville. It's like ready about old friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute story but....","review":"the woman needs an editor who knows basic English grammar and punctuation. I'm not a stickler online, but in a published novel? The three errors on the second page alone were so distracting that I almost gave up.The young man who's been suspended from school for his computer hi-jinks and his holographic adventures with two older gentlemen are fresh and welcome additions to the salt-of-the-earth-folks-in-a-quaint-small-town genre. I hope that the author rounds out her main characters a bit more in future installments, because they have potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and inspirational","review":"I bought this book for a friend, since I had already read it and did not want to part with my copy. It is out of print, but so good that I wanted to share it. I'll probably give my copy away anyway, as soon as I find another place it will do some good. The characters and setting seemed so real, and the situations so familiar to a traditional Catholic such as myself, but would be inspirational to any Christian. The story is really hard to put down, and is a real uplift. It features many memorable characters in difficult situations, always carried along by strong faith, I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's is no miracle of a book","review":"Okay, maybe it doesn't deserve a 1 star, maybe a two, but only for effort. The author is trying so hard but falls so short of being an interesting book. An avid reader of Jan Karon's 'At Home in Mitford' series, I had high hopes for this book. But it is so heavy handed with the religion that it is very uninteresting, and this from a very religious fellow. The writing isn't fluid but stilted and weak.
