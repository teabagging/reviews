I may have just crushed it or the metal and/or construction is faulty (which is my opinion).

It is a flaw in the design of the locking wheel. I guess they wanted to make it simple for people switching punch sizes, but that easy switching is a detriment to the punch. The punch will move off center, so when appling force you are not using all of the punch bit making it difficult to get a good accurate hole, or get a clean hole for that matter.

Getting older, seeking something to add to his life, for another the book is a great tale written by a non-Russian, harkening not only to the politcal situation but to the literary state within Russia.All round if a reader enjoys this author's work, I cannot see that the book, movie, or audio will be a let down to them.

One of the problems that some may have is that the graphic novel is presented in black and white, and younger readers may find the comics (like film) as \\"boring\\" (I say this as I taught at a design college and the comment always irked me).

Her views sometimes differ from those of other well-known critics, but her reasoning seems sound. For example, many critics believe that Jane Austen failed in her portrayal of Fanny Price in MANSFIELD PARK by making her too good. Waldron argues that Austen knew exactly what she was doing and that a careful reading shows that Fanny is not as good as she appears on the surface. The famous Austen irony is at work in Fanny's character.Waldron, thankfully, refrains from Marxist, feminist, and Freudian critical readings of Austen's texts. She uses no incomprehensible jargon.

You never know when you might need some medication and you are out in the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Full color pictures, warnings about plants of similar appearance. I'm not sure if this is the best book to start learning plants with, but it does give adequate instructions on identification. The medicinal sections could use a little more depth, but I'm pretty pleased with it and dying to go on a hike and try it out. Been flipping through the pages happily since I got it. It will tell you which parts of the plant are edible, and if applicable, which parts aren't edible. The only thing that stinks is it doesn't really get too-too into specifics, which is what I was kind of hoping for, but hoenstly, I'm very pleased with this.Also, the paperback's pages are all laminated, and while I'd be hesitant to go swimming with this book, it seems to be reasonably waterproof.Very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"Was a gift, and He loved it!!

I find it as a wonderful book! Explains what the plant looks like where to find it how and who used it for medicinal purposes and who certifies it today! It's a great handbook to learn about plants and a perfect size to put in a bag and travel. I plan to take it camping and explore the woods using this book for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Must Have Resource!","review":"I love this book! I first went through my yard finding plants that could be edible, or just for identification. I like how the book often will tell you what state or region of the US the plants/herbs are mainly found in. I do wish there were more pictures of what these plants look like as younger seedlings, or in the germination stages since this is Spring! The pictures and descriptions are for fully mature plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medicinal Field Guide","review":"This book is great! It is one of the few books I use for references. The pictures are great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like this Field Guide","review":"When I first glanced at this book I was impressed with the color picture of the different plants, but the next part really impressed me. When you turn to a plant they actually have symbols warning you it if is toxic or you need to use caution, I have not seen many guides that do this. Tons of great information. It is a must for anyone who is an outdoors man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Small Print","review":"I bought this for my grandmother in Georgia because she is always telling me about herbs and plants and I know she would learn some new information from this. My only concern is that the font is so tiny that she will probably have to use a magnifier to read it. If you are buying this for an elderly person, keep that in mind. Otherwise it looks great and seems to be packed full of information and photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can always count on the field guide books","review":"I took it and used it. It's filled with great information. I only wish it had a quick plant look up structure where we can identify plants based on leaves and flowers.

Either way a good research book and very indepth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Let Down","review":"First, I have to say, I bought this book from an Amazon.com seller,and am very satisfied with his customer service, my used book appeared to be new and he shipped faster than most amazon sellers do.Unfortunately, the book is less informative than the older versions of this book. It's very basic information, helps identify plants around the yard, but the pictures are often times not detailed enough, or they show a leaf or flower only when you need to see the whole plant in better detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great field guide","review":"Though I don't live in the eastern US and have rarely had a chance to do field botany when I have been there, this is a great little reference when I am researching herbs found in the eastern US.

The hero was a worthless human being, he was Constantly belittling and verbally abusing the heroine. And I didn't like how he had sex with other than the heroine and I say sex because it certainly could not be called making love when he did. And she was beyond stupid, she put up with all his name calling and she never thought before she jumped into anything, which I also found tiresome. The two of them deserved each other, as I didn't like either one of them. I kept reading hoping they would both have a great personality change but they never did. So, I finally just tossed it in the 'To Donate bag'. Good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I really loved Fire Song, the first story in the series. But I was really disappointed in this story. I did not like Deinwald de Fortenbery. He treated the heroine with verbal disrespect and made fun of her because she was not little and petite. As for the heroine, Philippa began the story fighting him and not tolerating his insults, but, after a few chapters, she tolerated his disrespect like it was nothing. He said he loved her, but he was never tender or loving even when they were in bed together. He treated her like she was his whore. And it really irritated me to hear him call her \\"wench.\\" I was hoping he would change like Graelem did in Fire Song, but the change never came. I actually threw the book across the room. For those who have not read this story, I would recommend that you not waste your money on it. I am still angry at the six dollars that I wasted on this book. Read another of Catherine Coulters books like Devil's Embrace, Valentine Legacy, or Fire Song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining!","review":"After reading Fire Song I could not help but wonder what happened to Kassia and Graelam. Catherine did a marvelous job w/ the connections between both books. This is my first time reading a quartet and it is very satisfying to read their continuations. Deinwald and Phillipa were humorous, there were challenges they had to overcome, and to my predicament they did. They met in such an unsual way you can't help but laugh and want more. You will be glued to the book from the very beginning and the including of old friends from Fire Song will delight you.

The problem is that this Chinese-made tool is constructed of such soft metal that we were constantly having to bend it back into shape.In all fairness, the design of this tool is good if they would make it out of the same steel as pry bars are made of.

It has some spells in it but most of it is really random and takes roots in a more ceremonial magick tradition giving a few black and white illustrations of some talismans which by the way are poorly copied and hard to even see the details of. I really enjoy alot of the Anna Riva books and many of them have alot of information in them, but this is not one of them.I do want to add that at the end of this book are some lists of herbs and uses for them, this is a nice addition to the book and is worth having. At best, its a good thing this book only costs five dollars.JetToledo Ohio"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix","review":"For four years, people had been telling me how great this movie was, but for some reason I never got around to seeing it. Sick of people talking about it and people messing with me because I hadn't seen it, I rented the DVD, and I must say it is one of the best action flicks I have ever seen! Unlike most films that get bragged about in today's society, this one actually lives up to expectations, if not surpasses them. After now seeing the movies that followed this masterpiece, I must say that this has by far the strongest plot of the trilogy, since the other two focus on action more. The characters in this movie are unforgettable, despite me not being a big fan of Reeves. I especially think that Fisburne takes the cake with his character of Morpheous, and I think that Moss does an outstanding job as the leading lady in Trinity. So overall, this is one movie that everyone should see and lives up to expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Star Wars of the 90's","review":"I am a film buff, and no other movie has had me wanting more then the Matrix. It is the most original movie, with special effects that will change the way other movies do special effects, like the way Star Wars did. All I can say is prepare to be blown away. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, and when its all over, you will want more. Its not just for sci fi nuts, all of my friends who hate sci fi love this movie not only because of the action, but because of the killer soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"The Matrix is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The movie makes you think, which is something I cannot say for most of the movies being produced today. The sound and technology involved in this movie are beyond words, and the acting is the best I have seen in years.

Anyone from 12 to adult can and should watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best DVD's you can own","review":"I think that most people that don't like this movie just didn't get it. The thought that there is some other force guiding our lives and actions - a dream within a dream - is a common story theme but in The Matrix, the Wachowski Bro's really take this concept to a new level.Whether you liked the movie, understood it, or not, its still worth noting that this is one of the best examples of DVD technology to date. Not only is the film transferred superbly in both widescreen video and 5.1 audio, the extra features are nothing short of astounding!From several behind the scenes videos, to multiple full-length audio commentaries, even pc-dvd-rom features, the disc is innovatively designed to entertain far beyond the running time of the standard film.

There are many reasons for this. One, the steak being eaten by Cipher just looks extraordinary. Juicy, well presented, and when Cipher puts it in his mouth, Sticky's mouth was well.. sticky.But the great thing about it was Cipher's subversive comment about the steak. He notes that even though he realises he's not eating a steak he still loves it ie. \\"Ignorance is bliss\\"And Sticky agrees that's a wonderful metaphor for Sticky Rice, well cooked steak in movies, clever packaging for DVDs and Ben Affleck's sick laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"this is by far, one of the most spectacular sci-fi movies that i have seen in years. the effects were very well done, and there was actually a plot that kept my eyes glued to the screen! although i'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeve's work, this is his best effort yet.

This is the beginning of a complete turmoil related to Neo's existence and he is thrown into an adventure unlike no other ever created, no pun intended. Matrix is a clever science fiction story that triggers reflection in regards to our existence and values, which can be experienced through fast paced action packed entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Explanation of Dejá Vu","review":"I think that this movie was put together ingeniously. When I watched it for the first time (I now own it), I got a little confused when Neo woke up and the machine came and unplugged him. I couldn't tell where he was or which world was real or what was up and down. There was just enough confusion to keep me guessing and just enough to make the realization an even bigger OOOOOH!I recommend this to sci-fi fans, but not to people who don't like somewhat complex plots, because you have to wait awhile before everything becomes clear.

A sci fi thriller to say the least. The effects are state of the art. The software is intense too. The production release I own, makes my early model DVD fail (freeze or lock up) in three different scenes. This material is notorious as an MPEG buster. If your DVD player can't play this movie end to end without stoping, then it might be time for a software (or hardware) upgade for that clunky old DVD player. The fight scenes aren't the only thing that can deliver a death blow. My wife always wanted to see what Keanu Reeves would look like clean shaven and dipped in goo. Way too many bullets for young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie a must see","review":"It has been some time since I have seen a great movie, however this past weekend I bought a movie titled the Matrix.

This was a great sci-fi movie which provided action and thought. The DVD is the only way to watch it other than the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chosen One!!","review":"Keanu Reeves plays an ordinary guy who is supposed to be the next savior of humanity. Sounds corny doesn't it, but his movie actually takes itself very seriously. 'The Matrix' goes around preaching Eastern philosophy like it was its own original idea. This was one of the worst lines; 'Maybe its not the spoon that is bending but your mind!!' Whoa, such profound dialogue. Too bad it was thought up 3000 years ago!! Later on in the film a woman falls in love with Keanu because it was said she would fall in love with the CHOSEN ONE. There are plenty of action sequences that go on forever; the worst is when the robots, who are supposed to be flawless, can't shoot the weak human beings. Then at the end of the film there is some Rage Against The Machine music, just so the teenagers won't fall a sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film of the Millenium","review":"Undoubtly the best film to hit cinemas in the past Thousand years. Stunning visual effects, awesome soundtrack, superb acting (even from Keanu)...and a slight hint of where the idea sprung from. RPG players of the game SLA will know what i am talking about. If you only see one file in your lifetime see The MATRIX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go buy the video","review":"matirx what can i say, in truth i was blown away the graphics and the story line right out of this world, if you haven't seen it go and see it. kick *** movie of the millenium"},{"rating":"2","title":"Film was invented so this movie would eventually be made!","review":"The casting, directing, the story line, plot, the entire film - this film embodies what very few films have been able to accomplish since the beginning of film making. And, as an added bonus, something that will make you ponder about your own existence. Hmmmm......"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLOT HOLES!","review":"An enjoyable movie, but damn! I hate glaring plot holes. For a thinking man, it just spoils the entertainment value.What was up with the phone thing? Why did they have to go across town to beam out? Why couldn't they just use their cellular phones?And why use humans for you-know-what? Why not use cows? They are bigger (more bio-matter) and dumber (the matrix then could consist of only bales of hay and those flies that suck the juice out of the corners of their eyes).Why choose small firearms, when they could've had RPG's or grenade launchers?How can they see so well when they wear those sunglasses all the time?How can it always be 1999 if the people are going about their normal lives? Do they wake up after New Year and start all over again? Or do they just get extremely wasted and forget the previous year happened?I could go on, but its 2am, and I just finished listening to the Matrix Soundtrack (which rocks!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film making","review":"Great blend of action, sci-fi, kung-fu, special visual effects and creativity. There's nothing like this movie because it's one of a kind. It's an original with style!! When it ended, I was begging for more. Hopefully they'll have a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to The Matrix...","review":"The matrix is the best movie i have ever seen. It blends the awesome world of CGI technology with live action stunts and actually has a plot! (unlike some other movies like that) I have seen it 15 times and plan on seeing the sequels as much, if not more. it is worth every penny u spend on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the cheesiest!","review":"What is this? Wanna-be Hong Kong movie + wanna-be Western movie + Wanna-be SF? I felt kinda sorry for all the money that spent on that movie. Yes, the special effects and all that but nothing impressive.

It wants to pose the question: what is really real? It also wants to make us think about the meaning of our lives--a point overlooked by almost all reviewers.--Are we just cogs in a tremendous impersonal machine that is the world? Are we no more than fuel that sustains civilization? What is this civilization? And who is it for? Of course, these are all good questions. Too bad the characters in this movie are flat and the acting is mediocre. I felt no sympathy for any characters in this contrived and predictable film. And I felt relieved when it was all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of special effects","review":"This movie was a total waste of money and special effects. Keanu Reeves does NOT fit the role and the only thing worth mentioning in this movie was Laurence Fishburne's acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile","review":"If you are 12 years old or below in intellectual age then this film will be your cup of tea. It had all of the makings of the \\"New Hollywood\\" classic:slow motion explosions; Kung-Fu kicking galore; small arms fire aplenty; idiotic, trite dialog; politically correct of course ; much noise but little thought;Better yet, get the comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Believe it!!!!","review":"I bought the DVD, after seeing the movie in the theater. I got about half way through the movie and it started to lose tracking and got all messed up. I called customer support at Amazon, and they informed me that there was a problem with this particular DVD on certain DVD players. The manufacturer is aware of this but refuses to fix it. So please beware that this DVD may not work on your DVD player, so check before you waste your time ordering it. Good luck to those who purchase it, hopefully you will have better luck than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"VR, CG experience I (sadly) won't forget..........","review":"The Matrix was a waste of my time. I could have spent the money on something useful. The acting, trite and sometimes melodramatic, did not help things at all. The special effects, sadly, are the only high points in this film. Judging by the trailers and teasers, I thought we were in for a treat and that this was going to be the kind of movie that defines a decade, the kind we'll be telling our grandchildren about. I was sorely mistaken. I always enjoy a good story, but this is one place I looked and failed to find one. The script was filled with trite remarks and predictable dialogue. This movie was basically nothing but a very expensive cut-and-paste job, blatantly stealing ideas from predecessors -- I found many John Woo, Ghost In The Shell, and Akira ideas here, among others. Is this cutting edge? Is this the best they could do? I hope not. Find something better to do with your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just many pieces of good movies put together","review":"Come on, how can anyone say this is a good, deep, reflexive movie? Have you ever seen Dark city, Total recall, The thirteenth floor (highly underated movie), and many others? It has SOME good FXs (and all were show on the trailer), but the action is in a boring video game style. If it WAS an original idea, maybe i'd say this is a good movie. But since it's just a remix of many great stories, i'd say THE MATRIX is just a mirage of a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be the best ever if it worked...","review":"At last, science fiction with brains... the likes of which you don't get to see that often nowadays. One excellent movie, on par with The 13th Floor, but alas, the disc crashes on too many players (home and PC alike). Wait for a V2.0 if you want to buy it, but rush for it as soon as it's out."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomprehensible","review":"The most incomprehensible plot since 'Mission Impossible'. I mean, what the hell is going on? How dare they subject us to this? The only nice thing I can say about the movie is Laurence Fishburn's voice & diction. Otherwise, awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, Underwritten","review":"With the plot device of 'virtual reality made real' (don't ask) the sky was potentially the limit for the writers. But after the first hour or so of interesting but too numerous and convoluted twists, the film devolved into a very prolonged shoot-em-up/kung-fu show down. What a waste. It took me half a dozen sittings over several weeks just to get through it because it became so mind numbingly boring and predictable. If slick special effects and gunplay are all you need in a movie then go for it. Personally I'd rather watch my lawn grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST TO KEEP US IN PERSPECTIVE. . .","review":"I gave this movie three stars (all 3 for effects) in a previous review, but I thought I would weigh in one more time. I am changing my score to counter the flood of five star reviews being given to the Matrix. All reviews given for this movie read as slight variations of the following: \\"great effects and the story is good too!\\" EXACTLY. Effects before plot, style before substance, form over content. Good sci-fi movies acheive a synthesis of these elements. The Matrix does not. It has a half-realized concept and its effects are extremely overdone. For TRUE classic sci-fi check out 2001: A Space Odyssey, or if that's too \\"old\\" for you, try Gattaca or 12 Monkeys. Oh, and P.S. the acting is not that great. If this is your favorite film, you just haven't seen enough movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't enter in the cyber marketing movie","review":"Don't waste your money for a movie like this one. This movie was made for teenagers with anti-social messages like : don't trust the police, your parents, your teachers etc... The gratuitous violence in the movie intend to attract youth people with a message of contestation. In fact, the movie is a real product targeted for the mass market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Displeased","review":"The Matrix is by far My favorite movie of all time! I went out and bought the dvd the day it came out. However when I got it home to play it the size of the screen appalled me. I was watching a tiny little rectangle and my tv is not that small it's a 36\\" tv. But tvs are square for the most part and to make the screen size so small it gives me a headache to watch it. How hard would it be to release these movies in both formats and give people the choice it's not fair! For those of you who love this movie as much as I do, don't waist your money on the dvd buy it on video at least you get a full picture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good thing Keanu is cute","review":"Another bad movie by Keanu Reeves. I've been told that if I didn't like this movie it meant that I didn't get it. Oh, I got it...bang, bang, shoot 'em up cheese fest. The plot was thin, the violence was overdone, and the effects were well the only salvagable part of the movie.Laurence Fishburne is too good of an actor to have made such a mistake. Even his talent couldn't save this film.I like sci-fi, I like dark, this movie was simply trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best dvd yet","review":"absolutely jaw-dropping extras. a very cool movie that looks and sounds great, plus cool extras. what a great dvd.

The acting is so horrible, I felt like I was watching public access. The special effects were used a little too much. This movie lacks in quality the way all the other special effects filled movies do. Like twister and speed, this movie is horrible, beginning to end. I cannot explain how bad this movie is, so, if you really know what a good movie is, do not get this one, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"FX movie with no plot","review":"Theres no denieing the fact that somebody came up with a few new speichel effects and decided to quickly rush them into a movie. Apart from the effects which have been copeied and done to death so many times since this movie, this movie has absolutly no plot, no intrest, no point, and if this movie did not have the SFX shots that it does, no body would even have known what this movie was, except for the Keenu Reeve fans.Purchase all 3 if you want to see some stunning visual FX but all based around a completly pointless, or, IF ANY plot at all. If the movie had plot ideas, it could have been somthing, but its highly given credit to, when every one cant denie its just the SFX that people are stunned by, not the plot.... watch the intro to that Olsen twins show if you wanna see the SFX from this movie!Bottem line; Take away the FX, you have a bad movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated!","review":"Keanu Reeves is hands down the worst thing going.

HOWEVER, this WAS sadly another American film that completely perpetuated the glorification of gratuitous violence. Yes, the \\"matrix\\" and hackers and all is VERY cool, but walking through buildings killing as many security guards as you can find is NOT cool. \\u0003Can anybody say \\"Columbine\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Stupid Stupid movie","review":"I realize alot of people think this movie is good, but, you're wrong.

Why would you cast \\"Ted\\" as an action star?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dazzling special effects, superb cast","review":"No one can be told what the Matrix is ... Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Agent Smith are carefully developed and wonderfully portrayed in this deliciously thrilling cyperpunk extravaganza.

Hooray for the directors!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"killer movie","review":"The Matrix is one of those movies that defines what DVD is all about - incredible action and sound, not to mention a pretty good story line and direction. The Matrix gets a spot in the home DVD library because you can watch it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chilling Vision","review":"Fans of writers Phil Dick and William Burroughs will love the paranoia deep at the heart of this stylish movie. With a palette whose major color is a weird shade of black-green, the Wachowski brothers have made an intelligent, thought-provoking action flick -- a genuine rarity. Oh, there's one too many action cliches, and Keanu Reeves' acting is as close to dead as you'll see onscreen, but there's a lot to like here too. I'm especially fond of the way the script slowly unfolds our understanding, rather than trying to lay it all out for us, and the look of the movie is as close to genuine cyberpunk as anyone's yet come. The DVD has lots of extras, but a lot of them are empty fluff (\\"Are You the One?\\" -- now really!) and about half are accessible only on a computer with DVD capability, not on your standard DVD player. Still, you can't go wrong with The Matrix if you like intelligent sf, moody action, or witty paranoia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keanu Reeves proves to be on eof the most over rated actors","review":"First of all the Wachowski brothers first film BOUND was much better. I could dig what the Matrix was trying to say...it is basically the same story of Plato's Allegory of the Cave...but i thought overall it was rubbish. the directing was great, at first, but after seeing the rotating camera shot for the 10th time i was quite fed up. Keanu Reeves as always is a ridiculous actor. overall i would not recommend this movie. Watch BOUND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix - The Perfect Movie to have on DVD","review":"This is a great movie.

ETC But MAtrix is the movie that is most imaginary, has coolest special effect, and sound in 1999. I was tired of those childish Science Fiction like Jurassic Park, Terminator,or other stuff.

It's the Matrix","review":"I do not agree with the violent content in this movie. However the special effects were off the hook. When I first went to go see this movie I didn't know what to expect. Everything was a surprise. They didn't give away anything in the previews.Which is good. this is where most movies fail. I found myself still talking about this movie a month after I saw it. I couldn't get it out of my mind. I've never seen a movie like it in my life. I'm still unclear of what the matrix is because I think It's more complex than a simple definition.The only bad thing about the movie is that the violence should of been replaced by martial arts. then it would of been hype. However, the people in Hollywood can't stop the urge to just shoot things up. They glamourized guns in this movie. And I saw kids in the movie theatre! It could of had 5 stars if it wasn't so violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix","review":"This movie just blew my mind.

Having studied philosophy, I can tell you that this movie is what Descarte was talking about when he said that he could just be a brain in a vat and the evil genius is just imputing impulses into his brain. The final realization reminds me of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. If you are not familiar with the major themes of modern philosophy, this movie is just a sci-fi action film.

My advice: GET IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, good start, but a bad finish","review":"I saw the Matrix only because so many people reccomended it to me, and the idea did sound intriguing. And I was pleasantly surprised up until they woke Keanu Reeves up and brought him into the real world. After that not only does it become necessary for him to act, but the movie descends to sickening levels of testoscerone and explosions. It's a shame that they thought it was necessary to keep interest going by blowing things up and shooting everything. But the real shame is that it ruined what could have been a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns and glory!","review":"If you didn't like the 13th Floor, don't assume you won't like the Matrix. The Matrix is fast-paced, original, and wonderfully crafted (e.g., did you know that the red hues were filtered out of the matrix scenes to give the viewer a sense of a drab facsimile of reality?). Although few sci-fi movies are as thought-driven as 2001, the Matrix is surprisingly stimulating. It definitely holds your attention throughout and makes you want to watch it again when you're done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy and Science Fiction rolled into one!!","review":"This movie aired almost 7 years ago and I think about it often.

The picture quality is so high that I thought I have the original footage from Warner Bros. - A bonus on the DVD is the making of \\"The Matrix\\" which is very long and sophisticated.

The Matrix holds that answer. Keanu Reeves (Speed)stars in a Electrifying Sci-fi cinema hit, and a eye-popping action film too. The film has great classic Action, and state of the arts special effects. Reeves is a computer hacker whoses about to discover that the 20th century doesn't exisit. brilliant acting and good plot.

At first the effects attack you with their jarring edginess, and then the idea of a real Matrix, and finally the philosophy becomes the sharpest edge. My whole family is full of conspiracy theorists, and this is our new favorite. An oracle that hands out cookies? Yes indeed. Spoon bending as a parlor trick and mind-numbing metaphor? Uh-huh.

We've all seen him destroy great films like \\"Devil's Advocate\\" and \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\" This time, Keanu, don't feel bad, it wasn't you. The script in this film stinks! In a strange attempt to tell the story of Jesus Christ through a futuristic sci-fi film (doesn't sound like a bad idea, right?) this picture only manages to showcase the latest in CGI effects. I must mention, however, the one reason I gave this picture 2 stars instead of one: Hugo Weaver is brilliant as Agent Smith! He is also fortunate to have the only good lines in the film when Smith is telling Neo what he thinks of the human race and our world. What other movies has Weaver been in?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mindless Way to Spend an Afternoon","review":"It must be the \\"age-thing\\" because I just didn't find this film to be all that others said it was cracked up to be. The special effects were great but the story was somewhat confusing and muddled. The performances from the principles was adequate, although I had difficulty at times understanding both Fishburne and Reeves because of their \\"muffled\\" deliveries. Both - yes, BOTH - have done better work in the past. I suppose a big pay check was the reason for their decision to get involved in such fluff!This is one of the films that will not \\"age\\" well. Its use of contemporary terminology and fears about present and future technology will be meaningless in a few years. Thus, the film, no matter its current popularity, will not make anyone's great films' list.For all its Academy Award-winning SFX the flick was no more satisfying than a video game. A less successful film of the early 80's came to mind after I saw \\"The Matrix.\\"Can anyone say \\"Tron?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie, not the car","review":"I finally got around to watching \\"The Matrix\\" a couple of years after everyone else. I give it a mixed review. The notion of manufactured reality was its strong point. A weak point, however, was the film's anarcho-messianic theme. In between these poles, there was a rather ho-hum formulaic plot, akin to that of, say, \\"Top Gun.\\" I must note that there are strong resemblances to a film which I'll bet few Matrix enthusiasts have ever watched. That is Alexandro Jodorowsky's \\"The Holy Mountain\\" (1973). Just about everything in \\"The Matrix\\" that is disgusting to watch seemed borrowed from the Jodorowsky film, as well as Neo's transformation into some sort of messiah at the hands of a magus figure. (\\"The Holy Mountain\\" may be available on some web auction sites - check it out.) The music at the end was good, but that's not to say I want to hear it booming out of some teenager's car every time he drives by my house.

I watch this on DVD everyday and just gape time and time again at the beauty of the \\"Pillar Scene.\\" Some of the shots and moves are so unique that one has to wonder how two people could cooperate enough to come up with this.

I was a Star Wars fan years ago. The Phantom Menace dissapointed me because of plain characters (no real motivation), no sense of wonder or adventure, and a silly story resollution.Instead, I realized that matrix was a movie to think.

The acting, the writing, and even the special effects were awful. I know most people were impressed with the SFX, but I didn't think there was anything special about them. In a movie that has good special effects, you forget that what you are seeing is fake, but that never happens with The Matrix. The SFX was so bad, I had to laugh out loud at times.

Together, they fight Agents, or basically the programs that try to kill them (they're just men in tuxes)I have to say, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

The problem is the lead actor. Reeves is certainly talented for some roles, but this hold-on-to-your-seats movie is forced to drag him along. A complete mismatch.A powerhouse action movie like Matrix deserved a strong lead with charisma and masculinity, not a \\"pretty boy\\" actor such as Reeves.

This motion picture combines special effects, mind ploys, exceptional sound, directing, and acting, to create an amazing action packed movie.

The effects are great, the story is pretty good (the idea is especially interesting and discussion-invoking), but the characters aren't very interesting. The worst part is that you never learn about the supporting characters before they're blown away.

At my friends house, watching on a DVD player, it was almost a surreal experience. And then I bought the video version. It was still great, but the non-action scenes started to get boring. Now, after the third time, I can't stand it any more. The action sequences, the special- and visual-effects, are simply stunning, the premise entertaining, the actors appealing and their acting not bad. But for some reason this movie just doesn't have much rewatchability value.Keanu Reeves was good, Carrie-Ann Moss was gorgeous, Laurence Fishburne was fun if a little too self-absorbed, and the agents were fun, interesting characters.

To take a smart idea, then decide to fight the virtual representatives of the Machine with guns is ludicrous. They had a chance to add a smart end, but they failed hard! How can you fight a non-physical being with guns. Would have been so much better had they tried to create an infinite loop or logical conundrum that would have caused the Matirx to overload or crash.

Yes, the special effects are incredible, but for the love of pete people, Total Recall already did the whole what we see may only be illusion concept (and Descartes did it much further back with Meditations on First Philosophy). If you want to watch a mindless sci fi shoot 'em up action flick and still think you are smart because it has such a \\"deep\\" meaning behind it, then by all means see this movie. Otherwise don't waste your time. The fact that Keanu is front and center on the cover ought to say something. And if you just want to see Carrie Anne Moss (sp?), see Memento instead.

I found the characters one dimensional, the basic plot ludicrous, and Keanu (though blessedly silent for much of the movie) in a leading a horrible mistake. If this machine intelligence is intelligent enough to construct this alternate reality, enslave all but a handful of humanity, and manufacture mechanical hunter/killers, doesn't it seem likely it would be able to breach the manmade perpetual night or at least find a more efficient power source than human batteries?

Most of it derives from concepts and theories portrayed in several Star Trek and Outer Limits episodes.

I really wish he would have taken the blue pill."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A new style in in visual FX\\" (?)","review":"Matrix is an enjoyable action - sci-fi film with an original argument, but the backstory is very similar to the one on The Terminator saga. This film proves thant simple technology still can deliver good visual FX for example: I never imagined that the special secuences were made with the actors hanging on wires with motion control cameras over a green screen. However I never understood why did they call that secuences like \\"A new Special FX style\\" maybe because that sort of of secuences have never seen before on a movie (only in TV commertials) Anyway if you are a sci-fi fan (and even if you're not)you should better give an eye on this movie; the DVD version is more enjoyable than ever and is the best way for watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent and psudo religious.","review":"To be fair to this movie, I have changed over the months.

Good idea... what is reality?, butpoor execution. Left the question to engage in too much violence that had no otherpurpose. Perhaps the move makers realized that the audience would be too limited,excluding teen age boys and young men, and so switched to standard blood entertainment.Even science fiction has to be believable within its context; Matrix isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"widescreen format: a hoax.","review":"I love science fiction movies, and I think the matrix is one of the greatest movies in this genre. However, I was dissapointed when I buyed the DVD version and discovered the horizontal top and bottom black bars displayed on the screen actually hide parts of the picture that are viewable in the standard version (you can watch scenes displayed in standard format on the DVD's special features). I conclude that DVD technology is great, but not exploited in full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great special effects but little else.","review":"I had to give it one star, the system won't let you give a zero. This should have just been a computer game instead of a movie. The premise for this movie is just as silly as most of the games I've seen. But I suppose there are enough high tech computer generated special effects, kung-fu fighting and superfluous gunfire to keep the short attention span under 25 crowd happy. It's a torture, however, to watch Keanu Reeves at his wooden worst uttering lines like \\"Whoa!\\" and \\"Whut?\\". (Along with \\"Excellent!\\" and \\"Bogus!\\" weren't those also his lines in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure?) I'm sure that this film was a tremendous financial success and will spawn countless sequels and immitators, but all it really reminds me of is some bad acid trips I took in the '70s. \\"Whoa, what is reality, man?\\" \\"Whut?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative drivel","review":"Let's start with the plot; it's basically Dark City (a GOOD scifi film) without any of the good stuff about Dark City. The entire nonsense philosophy that everyone thinks makes the movie so deep is hundreds of years old and stupid to boot.The acting was subpar. Keanu Reeves couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. The other actors, while competent, were not particularly good or entertaining.The special effects were good, and that's the reason I gave it two stars. Some awesome computer work here.Overall, a piece of crap. Do yourself a favor and watch Dark City or The Truman Show instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical computer novice","review":"total lack of computer & scientific logic by the producer director and script writer, not to mention bad acting bu the main cast"},{"rating":"1","title":"derivative","review":"This would have been a great movie if I hadn't already seen it before.

If you like good movies, do not waste your time seeing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow motion masking a bad film","review":"Contary to what has been written about this film, I don't see anything ground breaking, but only cliche'. The reluctant messiah story is as old as Buddha, Jesus, and Burt Reynolds in the Longest Yard. Even worst, it takes forever to more this tired story along. I felt insulted as a viewer with average smarts by the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" reference.For all the CGI hype, it is just that. Slow motion bullets with trails have been done years before in \\"Sniper.\\" I am surprised that the few scenes of over the top gun play where the good guys never get hit still plays with the young who seem to love this movie. There is nothing visionary about taking bad Bruce Lee knock-off fight scenes and put them to slow motion.Production value and cinematography is a disappointment too. Under exposure, and bluing doesn't create a mood, but does creates good night light of two plus hours of sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Get My Money Back?","review":"There's very little I can say about the movie that I liked, but I'll try.

However, a drawback is that the action is terrible it is totally like chinese movies one guy could actually shoot everyone by himself and he is totally open to gun attacks.

I knew alot of my friends did not like this and so did alot of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie kicks cyberass!","review":"The Matrix is quite possibly the best movie I have seen in the last two years! I enjoyed the superior cinematography and special effects. I have heard that the Matrix is only the first installment in what is supposed to be a trilogy. With a strong showing at the box office, I believe that this rumor could be a fact. To those who say that Reeves is a lowsy actor, you get up on stage and try it! Let me remind you that he has been the focal point of many hit films and a few that even got recognition from critics and film review boards. You must see this flick, it is cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you suffer from paranoia, do not watch this movie.","review":"The MAtrix is probably the best movie I have seen all year. I am a huge Stare Wars fan, but let me tell you this movie puts Star Wars to shame. The story is excellent. I am a writer myself and I only wish I had written this one. So, Keeanu Reeves isn't a very good actor, so what, the guy is getting better. Look at Brandon Lee, it wasn't until the Crow that he found his niche. I believe that Reeves has found his in this movie. Lawrence Fishburn is in top form for this movie. I would suggest that anyone watch this movie, except maybe those who suffer from paranoia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix DOES have you...","review":"After watching countless movies in my life, I've really come to a point that I believe we all know what to expect in each movie even before it's shot. The same storylines, same structure over and over again. So, in the quest to find that novelty, the original movie, the original story, something that hasn't been done over and over and over, I was kind of honoured to be offered this movie to watch. It is surely a 5-star winner. Get it, or miss the opportunity to relive the definition of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely the best Sci-Fi film to date","review":"I was blown away when I saw this movie in the theaters. Now I get blown away everyday by it. This should come with all DVD players. The visual effects are amazing, the fight scenes are well coordinated, and the sound is surreal. Unfortunately it's only in widescreen which may be annoying to those with smaller tv's but it still is amazing. The plot is very complicated so don't miss a clip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"techno-savvy movie with a great cast-save one.","review":"The matrix was an extremely entertaining film. The key was this for me: In todays motion picture industry, it seems that George Lucas's ILM can make anything appear before our eyes, but in the Matrix-the effects actually seem original and groundbreaking. The plot was not as good as Reeves's \\"The Devil Advocate\\" but was certainly above average for a film of this genre. I give it four stars, with a recommendation to anyone except those rediculous nitpicky reviewers that compare everything to the best movies in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movies ever made!","review":"This movie was absolutely, totally, 100% perfect in ever single way! I'm not even going to make an effort to explain it all, its just not worth trying! The FX were... there is no word to describe them! I know that once it comes on tape I will watch the entire movie beginning to end for as long as I live! When it comes on tv, I'm going to tape the movie, and then I'm going to retape it with all the action sequences! There is no replcing this!

You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Graphics, good story line, good acting and a lot more","review":"The Matrix is an excellent film. The graphics are just out of there and the acting performed by the actors is very good but what i can't get over is how excellent the story is. I mean whoever came up with the story must be a genius! The story is a little hard to follow at the beginning but it all falls into place if you follow the story carefully. i've seen many movies but this is without a doubt one of the best movies i've ever seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Another's Point of View","review":"The Wachowski Brothers did a terrific job in making a film about such a topic not usually discussed: the realness of reality. The special effects are mind boggling, including a new technique known as \\"Bullet-Time\\". Invented for the Matrix specifically by a genius of a man by the name of Mr. Gaeta. A movie that will have you thinking all week about the realness of your spouse, your job, your car, the food you eat, and your friends. A must see for deep-thinkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no middle-ground","review":"Viewers of this film fall solidly into 2 categories. 'loved it' or 'hated it' depending on how much you love grand conspiracies, and stories that make you either suspend belief or disbelieve. The Matrix is a wonderful techno-fairy-tale, follow the white rabbit, be swept down the rabbit hole, believe or cease to exist. I (along with all the rest of the coppertops) think it is thought provoking, exciting, and if you're willing to accept the different reality you have to accept it completely. A wonderful offering, and I look forward to the remaining 2 films in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SuperCalaFragaListicExpialy-dope flick!","review":"For all y'all who don't know. Dope means tha bomb. Bomb means the baddest ever! Critics will say it wasn't original, idiots will say it's not worthy of the title \\"film\\" and was a waste of thier $$$. Loosen up would ya? The Matix is the best Sci-Fi movie to date since Terminator 1 & 2. The fighting choreography was so phenomenally constructed, the newly introduced graphics was superbly enhancing. The acting? I wont even bump that. It wasn't almighty and superb, sensational and smashing, yet it was adequate enough to warrant my 5 star rating! It is a must see. Anybody who insults this movie just cannot comprehend what sci-fi means or the depth of hypothetical thinking. Every friend I know who hated this movie has re-seen it by my recommendation and has ended up thanking me. I just bought a DVD Player and now await the best purchase of my life. Matrix on DVD - Widescreen, Dolby Digital Stereo... oh yeah!!! Can't wait for the sequels. 2 thumbs way up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hong Kong action flicks, Japanese Anime, Cyberpunk","review":"The movie strongly reflects its influences: Hong Kong kung fu films, Japanese Anime and Cyberpunk fiction. It's definately not your bland, boring Hollywood studio action movie. The synthesis of those above elements with a comic book look produces an unique and thrilling film. This is especially true to the viewers people unfamiliar to the above elements. Actually, it's almost a Hong Kong kung fu ('wire fu') film with a Hollywood budget. This is strongly reflected in the hand-to-hand combat, the shoot-outs and the liberal use of slow motion action (which has been transformed innovately into 'bullet time').Want more of the same action? Go get some Hong Kong action movies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gggggrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaatttttttttt","review":"This is by far one of best movies that Keanu Reeves has ever made.

Let me tell you, this is probably the best movie I saw all year! (Not including post-september movies). I go to the movies at least once every 2 weeks, so I have seen it all this year, and nothing can top this movie! The other 2 good movies of the year were \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Blair Witch\\" but this, this is one of the coolest movies ever created. I'm so glad that this new technology was used in this movie, and not some cr@p like star wars.

But let me tell you--the Matrix literally made me drool!I've read some of the other reviews here at Amazon, and I'm so surprised by the poor reviews. I'm sure we all agree that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor on the planet. I like some of his movies, and dislike others. Yet I cannot imagine any other actor in the role of Neo. He was perfect! He and the rest of the cast were ... words cannot describe. What a movie! What a concept! I've never seen anything like it!!I especially liked the still/moving action sequences--and the kung fu fighting scenes. What an ending!!!! I loved walking out of the theater excited, thinking about how Neo stopped those bullets, and talking about this great movie with my husband on the way home in the car. How could any science fiction lover not be absolutely mesmerized by this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This was the second worst movie i saw this summer (the first was Austin Powers)the acting sucked and there was no plot.

I recomend The Phantom Menace instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

With Dolby digital, it sounds like bullets are flying through the living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new wave Sci-fi movie","review":"Well, I guess it is old now but I am always surprised how much I like this movie the more times I watch it. First time I concentrated on the hand to hand combat too much but if you can get past these guys playing patticakes with eachother, this is a great movie. The scene where Keanu and Fishburne spar is still hilarious and the set looks like it came straight form 'Fist of Legend' but it is still fun. I lked his training sequences overall. The whole computer world never really appealed to me but it's a ton of fun trying to figure things out. The shootouts are great and all of the acting is top notch. Even Keano Reeves is pretty likeable.There are 2 commentaries but the making of was a look into something that is as interesting as it gets. Getting a glimpse of Woo Ping set up his action is great and even better trying to figure out what goes on in this guys mind. I hope we get a new special edition one day with a long piece on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.35:1 Aspect Ratio Stinks","review":"Buy this on VHS.

The story line has great potential, but the movie falls short of expections. If you have seen the previews of this movie, you have already seen the over rated graphics.

The dialog tries to be futuristic and intellectual, it's so bad it comical The makers of this flick should hang their heads in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a joke","review":"First off the \\"fight scenes\\" are stiff and slow, if you think they are good then you have never seen good kung-fu flicks, where wire-fu is done right. Wire-fu is an art, but this is a joke. Also thee gun fights are dumb. Watch the JohnWoo film HardBoiled and you will know what I am talking about. Second the story has been done a million times before, and everytime it is better than this. The Truman Show, 13th Floor, and Dark City all handle the \\"None of this real\\" theory better.

Everybody has raved about this movie and aside from some of the very good digital effects, the plot is completely bad and Keanu Reeves is the worst actor this side of William Shatner. Besides the point the story is a complete rip off of Grant Morrison's comic book \\"The Invisibles\\", which is infinitly better than this movie could ever dream to be (this is for you Grant, buddy). And the ending where he flies off after making the phone call is so absolutely LAME! Perhaps Keanu's moves in the movie seems \\"Faster than a speeding bullet\\" thanks to the breakthough of digital technology, but his acting sure isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's try this one again, dad...","review":"For whatever reason, Amazon didn't like my first review, so I'm going to try this again: for all of you who think that The Matrix is so great, I'd reccomend you check out Grant Morrison's comic book The Invisibles.

This isn't a daring or original movie, just a watered-down version of an intelligent story that began unfolding in 1994."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This movie is bad, and I don't mean \\"bad\\" in the sense of \\"funky bad\\" or some kind of negative slang for \\"good\\". It reeks. A ridiculous plot, saddled with some of the worst acting in living memory it stumbles along with dialogue that seems to have been lifted directly from bad \\"Friends\\" episodes. Every time my eyes began to glaze over there was some startling special effect to wake me up, but that's just not enough. A movie needs to do more than simply keep you awake. For those who thought Armageddon and ID4 were good pictures you won't be disspointed. For the intelligent human however and especially for science fiction fans, this movie holds absolutely nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"Nothing but special effects.

Like other over-budgetted action-fests today, the directors are afraid of introducing anything original or imaginative into the plot as the typical viewer is likely to reject it as being \\"off-kilter\\" in some way or another. This would also introduce the risk of losing money, as these kind of films are purely commercial. So you wind up with a cliched bag of special effects and hackneyed dialogue that would make most people that haven't grown up on \\"Riki Lake\\" cringe. Moronic considering all that could have been done with such an idea. I give it two stars only for several of the spectacular effects that, on their own, would make some magnificent pieces of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie without a brain","review":"This movie could have been so much more if only the writers used their brains.

It takes what could have been a truly compelling idea and predictably suffocates it in mediocre acting, ludicrous shootouts, and special effects overkill.

The dvd has a lot of cool extras, like commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss and the directors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SF","review":"The matrix is an effective and interesting film. The reason for this is that it is succesful at two levels. The first level is that it creates an artificial world which it gradually explains. This world is based on an original view of the future and is a plausable basis for an action film. The second level is that this is an effective action adventure film set in that world. The dialogue is effective for an action film and not embarrasing. The plot is taunt and gets you in.The roles are all played well and both Keanu Reeves and the female lead are great. The action scenes are tremendous and you can watch them again and again.This film will no doubt have a number of follow ups and make the cast and director a lot of money. This they richly deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best science fiction movie yet !","review":"No cheesy storyline or special effects here! This is science fiction of the next millenium!

PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE. Ever since I saw this in the theater I have been obsessed with it. I bought it on video, and now I'm in the process of buying the Propellerheads album, because of their song in the movie 'Spybreak'. Laurence Fishburn has got to be one of the best actors around today. The special effects are absolutely incredible and the story line is top-notch. All I'm waiting for now is The Matrix 2 and 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what it seems.","review":"This movie was truly great. I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. The visual effects were unparalleled and the action was breathtaking. The idea behind the scenario was very good but I would like to stress a little thing : the idea of \\"false perceptions\\" is not unheard of ; in fact the authors merely adapted a French philosophical book intitled \\"Méditations Métaphysiques\\" (Metaphysical Meditations for not French-speaking people)written by René Descartes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected.","review":"This movie was saved by the special effects. The theories presented will appeal to the internet conspiracy junkie. Dead spots, the mad max underworld, dandling storyline left me flat. Predictable plot. What was with the old lady? Without the special effects this would have never been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a shoot-em-up movie if you have a brain.","review":"This is the type of movie that really makes you think about what's real & what's all in your head. There is violence, yes, but those that say it was made just for the violence obviously must not have been able to follow the plot. Very thought provoking & a GREAT movie. Saw it in the theater twice & already have it pre-ordered on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix did for the '90s what Star Wars did for the '70s","review":"When movie historians look back on \\"The Matrix,\\" it will rightfully take its place alongside ground-breaking science fiction juggernauts like Star Wars, 2001 and Planet of the Apes. \\"The Matrix\\" redefined action movie cinemaphotography and sound, setting new standards by which all others will be judged. Many will copy \\"The Matrix,\\" but it will never be duplicated. The cast is compelling, the direction revolutionary and the story thought-provoking and refreshingly free off cliches. Musically, the movie is just as dynamic, producing an original score and soundtrack that blend perfectly with the visual aspects of the film. Somehow, this movie becomes more intriguing each time you watch it. Reeves was tailor-made for the part and Fishburne is wonderfully understated. Moss is beautiful and, well, a bit nasty. There's only one problem ... where do you go from here? Mind-blowing! Simply mind-blowing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written, Acted, and Produced","review":"This is one of the best Science Fiction videos I have seen. The effects are stunning, but not overdone (in most cases). Perhaps the best effect in the movie is how they managed to mask all of Reeves' poor acting...he actually is bearable in this film! The story line is straightforward, and is blisfully absent of the 42 plot twists that most movies these days seem to feel are necessary. The only complaint I have about the movie is the over-the-top violence. I am not squeamish by any means, but a couple of sceenes in the movie left me wondering, 'WHY?' The DVD has the added 'follow the white rabbit' feature which allows you to see how a certain effect was done while in the movie. When you see the white rabbit, click it, or press ENTER on your remote to see how the effect was produced...wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me out of my seat","review":"I was never a big Keanu Reeves fan, and hacker movies always seem to be somewhat on the lame side, but I was dragged to the movies by some friends, and I can't think of a single reason to regret it. It was great brain candy: awesome visual effects and cinematography, an intriguing plot and all the action I never thought I'd see. I saw it again that same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of \\"flash\\" with no content","review":"While special effects were well done, the acting, story content, and overall picture quality were generally lacking.

Others did by choosing to see Phantom Menace instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This is the coolest movie i have ever witnessed! Getting this on VHS is not good enough as the movie itself is too much for a pathetic VCR to handle.~~~~~~~~~~~~~okay, basically if the whole fake reality is real them we are living in a computer generated dream world designed to keep us under control to turn a human body into a battery for the use of AI(artificial intellegence) machines. A scary thought yes but with the help of some renegade humans who escaped from the matrix, the \\"agents\\" are gonna be put on a run.~~~~~~~~~~~~~I would explain more but as no-one can be told what the matrix is, you'll just have to get it for yourself untill the truth is clear to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Looking, But Boring","review":"I know hardcore sci-fi fans will probably be upset by this. The Matrix isn't a great movie. It's a cool looking movie with great effects and everything. I found the movie to be very hard and uninteresting to get into. It's not an easy movie to like. Keanu Reeves is his usual bland, wooden self. He doesn't do anything new here. I just think the film could've been a little more entertaining. I know die hard sci-fi fans will hate me for this, but this just isn't interesting enough to get into. Hard to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie to see!","review":"This is by far one of best movies that Keanu Reeves has ever made. I think that the special effects were great. I could watch this movie over and over and I believe that any other viewer would agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robots vs. Kung Fu","review":"This movie combines one of the best story lines in the sci-fi genera with the most original special effects and camera work ever. The plot is very thought provoking, volumes could be written on the scenario suggested in this movie. If you not in the mood to think, the Matrix is still the movie to watch. Incredible visuals and action scenes with the best gunfights and kung Fu ever. The directors seamlessly integrate the story line into the action, avoiding any drops in the energy of the movie. This movie is what DVD was made for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix","review":"A superb and thought provoking spin on life as we know it. Superb visuals and 5.1 soundtrack, with house-shaking explosion effects ! . If you only buy a few DVD's a year this HAS to be one of them !"},{"rating":"2","title":"hot and coool","review":"No matter who criticizes this movie ,I like this. Because it is exciting and cool. I'd like to recommend you this movie. And the people who don't like the story line must enjoy the special effects ,I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been so much better...","review":"Yes, the effects were incredible. Yes, the concept was mind-blowing. Yes, Trinity & Keanu look really great in leather & vinyl. But the script - the SCRIPT! and the directing! And the casting! had so much potential, and fell horribly short. Keanu, I'm sorry, I just don't believe you as an intelligent computer hacker. You blew that in \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.\\" Lawrence, you're a great actor, and with a slightly better director you wouldn't have sounded so laughably melodramatic. And whoever wrote the script, you've obviously seen a lot of X-Files episodes, but you really need to go beyond the TV-audience-pandering dialogue and avoid the overly melodramatic. It's could've been a killer movie, but it just fell short, which makes it all the more disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I took the red pill !","review":"The Matrix is simply the best film i've ever seen. Keanu Reeves gives a stunning performance as Neo and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus. It left me thirsty for more and I was absolutely breathtaken at the special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-Fi Adventure","review":"This is one of my favorite sci-fi movies ever. Whel the Matrix Revolutions may be better than this, that does not mean that the original one is no good. In fact, I really go nuts over it. I like the story, too: a young software technician named Neo gets a visit from mysterious woman named Trinity who he embarks and an action journey with. Should have won fifteen Oscars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetically draws you in until you're unable to pull away","review":"This is the best movie I have seen since The Devil's Advocate (and no, I am not a Reeves groupie). Disturbing enough to keep you thinking about it for awhile. Interesting and with enough depth to make you want to watch it again so you can catch it all. Keanu Reeves was perfect for the role--he is not a great actor, but the character didn't require great emotional agility. His straight face and somewhat monotone voice worked. Moss was the best part of the movie. She brought an intensity and believability to the whole thing that just keeps you watching. My only complaint is that for such a good story and great action scenes the soundtrack was awful! I can't wait for the sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"No one can be told what the matrix is. You have to be shown.","review":"No matter what you THINK you know about the Matrix, you know nothing. It's everything you fear and nothing you expect. It's slavery and freedom. It's scary reality. I recommend this movie to anyone who is sure that there is a conspiracy, but don't know who's responsible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks!","review":"The product arrived when expected! And in perfect condition!! Will purchase from this seller again. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not as original as I presumed","review":"I am a big fan of this movie...unfortunately as the sequels came out it progressively went downhill, yet still enjoyable. I was always amazed at what an original idea this was until I watched the Japanese anime film \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" from 1995 (the manga [jap. comic] came out in 1989?). There are so many similarities taken from \\"Ghost...\\" even down to the fast trickling green code writing and the head connectors to \\"plug in\\" to the net. Still a great movie though but not an original masterpiece that I thought. Everyone should see \\"Ghost in the Shell\\". Ghost # 2 is coming on DVD in December and I'm looking forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"$72 for one disc??","review":"This is not a review of the movie - the Matrix is by itself an interesting subject - but instead this is review of what's available in the package you get.I had The Matrix on DVD from back when it first came out. Somehow, when the son moved to College, I lost my Matrix DVD, so I finally decided to replenish my collection and get, what I thought was a 2 disc version with more behind the scenes stuff.Instead, I get a single disk, with the excat same content as my old (collection happy - buyer is not), a poster, some pictures and a frame of the movie blown up. Is that worth the additional $50 (at least)?? I don't think so. But the quality of the DVD is great - as the old one. However, the box, pictures and posters will soon be archived under T for Trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure entertainment","review":"Although I didn't find this film to be as profound as many of the other reviewers did, it is certainly clever and very smartly written. I was impressed at how smoothly the Wachowskis managed to fit the conventions of martial arts films into a technological context. The story is pure comic book--and I mean that in the best sense of the word. A seemingly average guy meets some mysterious types who introduce him to the reality behind our everyday world and becomes a superhero to battle the evil he finds there. One of the most interesting facets of the story is the fact that our heroes exist in two worlds simultaneously--in one they are superhuman, while in the other they are nearly helpless."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS DISC DOESN'T WORK ON MACS","review":"The movie is great, when I watched it on the big screen. Too bad I can't watch the DVD. I purchased a new Apple Powerbook with a DVD-ROM, and because the makers only wrote the special features for Win machines, I can't even watch the movie. The disc is useless. The Powerbooks are back ordered meaning a lot of people have purchased one. Maybe makers should start waking up and writing these discs for all platforms."},{"rating":"2","title":"There will never be a better movie.","review":"The Matrix is too good for a rating. If I had to give The Matrix a rating it would be the best possible.I watched The Matrix a few days ago and the story line was so fascinating it has been on my mind ever sence.In the movie Neo (Keanu Reeves) asks Morphius (Laurence Fishburne) \\"What is The Matrix?\\". And Morphius said that The Matrix is not something you can put into words. And that he would have to see it for himself to know what it is.That is how the movie is too.There is something I can't explain about the movie The Matrix that is mind boggling.There is not and never will be a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything old is new again","review":"The Matrix takes on a future world where mind experiences are induced by software, not the senses. This premise ought to have been fascinating, but this very Hollywood treatment is nothing but an old fashioned shoot-em-up, with silly kung fu fights, hilarious logical inconsistencies, and a cinematic superhero who, true to formula, finds his magical powers just in time. Ho hum. Skip this one unless you like assault rifles discharging ammo by the bushel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw Dropper","review":"WELL SNICE EVERYONE THAT HAS REVIEWED THIS MOVIE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE I GREAT JOB ...

If only they would have spent more time on the developing the plot and less time on special effects. The very shallow development of the story makes for a mediocre movie. If all you care about is great special effects, explosions, and gun fire you'll love it. Otherwise, there are much better sci-fi movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incongruous Story Line","review":"If the creators had spent as much time on the story line as they did on special effects this might have been a pretty good SciFi flick. The characters are capable of morphing into \\"virtual reality beings\\" to survive various assaults but, for some curious reason, they fail to use that \\"power\\" to their best advantage. I'd rate the computer generated special effects, while not entirely flawless, as a seven out of ten. But the rest of the work appears fairly conventional with no real surprises for the viewer - more like a video game than a feature film piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really makes you think.......","review":"This movie can be summed up in one word...Wow. It makes you think and question our everyday life. The \\"bullet-time\\" effect with Neo was one of the best special effects in the whole movie. It makes you want to move like him and be like him. They writers made many clever explinations and theories about what happens in our lives. For example, they explained deja vu in a way you would never think of. Anyway, it makes you wonder if we are really here, if we are actually in a real world. All the points that they made fit in together very well and almost never contradicted each other.\\"What is real? How do you define real?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reason to own a DVD player","review":"If you don't have a DVD player yet, this disc is the reason to get one.The digital sound is so clear and crisp you can hear every single bullet casing tinkle on the floor. The music soundtrack is loud but not deafening.What really make the disc stand out are the extra features. (Curiously, there are no movie trailers included, although if you have a DVD-ROM player, you can access the website directly.) There is a feature on the making of \\"The Matrix,\\" but that's only the beginning. The \\"Red Pill\\" feature is a short feature on the way they filmed \\"bullet time,\\" which is the slow motion yet not slow motion film technique. The \\"White Rabbit\\" feature is the best; the entire movie runs, but at certain key sequences -- those where you really want to know, \\"How did they do that?\\" -- a white rabbit blinks on the screen. If you trigger the DVD remote, you get whisked to another short documentary on how the scene was filmed.As for the movie, it's outstanding as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"First DVD experience","review":"Matrix is the first movie that I loaded into my new DVD player. The visuals and sound tracks far surpassed the VHS movies that I am used to. The movie is fast paced, and a startling concept. I've watched the movie six times and have not found any glaring future-tech blunders that usually ruin these types of movies. I find Matrix to be a very satisfying future/sci/tech movie that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie + Amazing Bonuses = Must Buy","review":"This is a very cool movie, but not necessarily something I would want to see too many times. However, all the extra features in this DVD are very cool. It really adds to the life of the movie. It defintaley makes this DVD worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely awsome movie.","review":"This movie is an absolutely awsome sci-fi flick with some of the best special effects I have seen in a long time.

It has a great story and the best action sequences i have ever seen.

I would recommend it to anyone...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I have ever seen!!!","review":"The Matrix is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. I think that Keanu showed some of his acting skills in this movie. THe Watchowski bros did an excelent job of using anime type effects in the movie to give it that feeling that i was just awsome. I loved it.

However, I didn't like how the reality beyond the Matrix was so dismal and gloomy. It sends almost a subconscious message that \\"ignorance is bliss,\\" which is a dangerous idea for democracy. Other than that, this is one of the best films in this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woh, man, thats a lot of bullets","review":"Since when does no-talent acting and lots of guns make a great movie? Ok, it had lots of special effects to keep you from realizing it was missing a plot and real acting, but then so did What Dreams May Come, and nobody is calling that great. Come on, if this is the best movie of the year, then I really feel sorry for the film industry. Maybe for the sequal, Keanu can just stand there for an hour, jump around in slow motion a few times, and shoot a gun. At least we won't have to pretend there is a story. There was nothing original about this one, even the so called original story idea has been floating around in science fiction literature since at least the 40s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention Mac Users!","review":"This is the only DVD I have come across so far that will not play on a Mac equipped with DVD. The fine print on the back of the box says so! I also tried it and it's true; it simply doesn't work! Pretty sad if you have one of those nifty IMac DV machines.For a film about a computer hacker exposing and breaking down the establishment, this is really ironic!Don't get me wrong; I love The Matrix. In fact I think it was definitely better than The Phantom Menace. Nevertheless I forced to give it one star because it is the only DVD I have come across so far that won't play on a Macintosh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stylish mess","review":"This film is so dull and boring and is a major dissapointment after the brilliant Dark City. It clunks along at a very slow pace every now and again throwing in a fight sequence to releive the boredom. It tries too hard to be too many things. It never reaches the mythological, adventurous or down rite fascinaiting levels of the four Star Wars movies. Neither does it bring home a \\"man against machines\\" message that the Terminator films do. The Matrix looks good just like Keanu Reeves. But like it's star it has nothing to back that up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over...","review":"Heavy handed new age metaphor drowned in a blinding overkill of special FX. Really clunky script, too. Stereotype characters from casting central, horrible cliches trying to pass as archetypal figures: Joseph Campbell's \\"The Hero With a Thousand Faces\\" as visually interpreted by a fifteen year old boy with a \\"QUAKE\\" fetish. Totally masturbatory shoot out sequences too, hard to believe that this film hasn't been skewered by the public in light of all those school shootings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun From Beginning to End!!!","review":"Dodging of bullets, fighting agents... All in a days work for Neo(Keanu Reeves). This action-pack movie (Released in 1995) is funny, serious, scary, and TOTALLY OFF DA HIZZLE! The Wachowski Brothers do it again! It takes place when Morpheous(Lawerence Fishburne) tells Neo about the Matrix, and the rest, well, is history! Though it was made 8 years ago, and I've seen it over 4.5 billion, zillion, kagillion, times, I still love it!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Derivative but good","review":"A lot of the reviews of this very entertaining film mention the various sources it draws from: other films, comics, \\"cyberpunk\\" fiction (particularly that of William Gibson.) All this is true, but mostly on a superficial level. The real source of the foundation concept of \\"The Matrix\\" is the brilliant 1968 Sci-Fi novel \\"The Futurological Congress\\" by Stanislaw Lem. I'm not talking about some kind of coincidental parallel here. Read the book (one of the best SF stories ever written, by one of the most influential SF writers ever) and you'll know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"special effects are good, but...","review":"if you love special effects and aren't real concerned with boredom for the mid-45 minutes of a movie then buy this now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"One of only 2 videos I've rented in the last few years that I couldn't finish watching, because it bored me to death. The big problem was that you simply don't care about any of the characters. You don't like them or hate them. They are not interesting in any way. So in spite of a good plot idea, and good special effects, the movie still managed to be VERY boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for people who like these kind of movies","review":"According to the commercials and previews before this movie came out, it look real cool with a lot of action. But when I saw the movie finally it didn't have a lot of action as in the commercial. Not till the end is where there's action, but the battles don't last long enough in the movie and there isn't enough. The plot wasn't that interesting either.The only thing I thought was cool was the special effects and action scenes.

It is beautifully choriographed and there is a brilliant script. Although i found the film ended a little abruptly.

It seemed to be just another one of those overdone sci-fi films. When I saw it I was amazed by its ability it take ancient philosophical ideas, like Plato's analogy of the cave and present them to a modern audience. There also seem to be many Christian themes creeping into the fray as well. This is a very cleverly written movie with some great filmwork to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've ever seen!!!","review":"This is a smart, stylish, exciting movie.

Toss in some great actors and searing superhuman action, and you've got just about the best movie of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For All","review":"Giving this movie just five stars just doesn't do it its justice. It should be given at least ten. This movie takes all of the others in the past that explored the same idea and blows them completely out of the water. This movie will be a classic for ages to come. The special effects of this movie were fantastic, and to think that they even had to invent new ways to film just so that they could get the right shots. It kind of makes a person feel good knowing that they have seen the best movie of the century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"I am not a Reeves fan but this is by far his best work. SciFi has been lacking somewhat here lately but the concept and originality of this movie make it a welcome addition. Fishburn is outstanding, the rest of the cast are good but the special affects make the difference. If your a SciFi fan but are tired of the same old stories (time travel, alien invasions, Star Trek or any other concept that has been thouroghly run into the ground) then this is a must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one word for this movie: GREAT !!!!!!","review":"Outstanding special-effects and great sound-effects in the Dolby Digital 5.1 format makes this movie to one of the greatest, most spectaculair productions of the past century.

This film has a story line that I had a hard time believing in, and I can't even say that the acting of Keanu Reeves made the film any better. I have never really been impressed with Reeves abilities, but I am less impressed now that ever.I loved the special effects though. They were spectacullar. I found myself rewinding the action packed scenes for a second go-round. The effets themselves probably could have made up for an actors short-comings, unless of course the acting was of an extrodinarly low caliber, such as was the case with Reeves.As I said I forced myself to give a 4 star rating. That is because the special effects were wonderful and the other actors and actresses have a fair amount of talent. The story line, although I wasn't convinced it could happen because there were to many open ends, was very orginal.

The Wachowski brothers have certainly done a remarkable job here (and the DVD is not short on extras either!). But I couldn't watch the whole movie more than, say, twice. I can watch the fighting scenes as many times as I can take, but not the whole movie. Sure the first or second (or even third) time you're eager to see it all, to find out what's going on. That's why you want to hear every little word spoken. But after that, the film bores you, and watching again any scene but the fighting ones becomes impossible. That \\"sssymetry\\" that characterizes the Matrix, is the reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Matrix(Blu-ray)","review":"I purchased this blu-ray to upgrade from my DVD. The Picture transfer is great,BUT the audio was a poor excuse for a Blu-ray. This is the worst blu-ray i have come across since the first release of Terminator 2 on blu-ray. If you want T2 on blu-ray the skynet edition is an excellent upgrade!! Warner Bros. needs to do the same and upgrade the audio to a 6.1 DTS for one of the best action movies of all time to truely experience the dynamic sound that The Matrix should be watched with. Until then dont waste your money on this Blu-ray if you own the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Together","review":"We all follow difference of circumstance as words create different meaning through subject of double dotted truth may not always round towards higher stature but meaning of latent sunlight in the dark matter of universal roots of truth"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix makes you believe the unreal.

It was the whole concept brought fluidly to the big screen that makes me give the Matrix 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"This is the reason DVD exists. The creators put a lot of effort into it and it pays off. I hope future DVD releases are of this quality. The Dolby Digital track leaves nothing to the imagination.

Everything is done so well. Unlike some reviewers below, I have had no formatting issues. Maybe they should check their equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Rip Off.","review":"This movie is good. It just has one problem which makes this movie stink. Most of its ideas were stolen off of Jack L. Chalker's books titled the Wonderland Gambit. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen type movie. I liked it but they shouldn't steal others ideas without permission or compensation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mess","review":"People thought Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey was confusing. This movie takes the cake. I'm a smart guy, I have a graduate degree, but this film just seems to lack any substance. It's all Kung Fu fighting and special effects thrown in for good measure. The second Matrix film isn't any better which I saw at the theater. The film doesn't come across as clever, nor intellectual and it isn't even a very good action film or science fiction film for that matter. I know a lot of people seem to like this mess of a film, but save your money. I don't really think it is a film that will be regarded like 2001 A Space Odyssey 20 years from now. I'm afraid it may be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks! Wachowski Brothers suck!","review":"Talk about copycats! This movie has no ORIGINALITY! Its like stealing and combining Terminator 2, Japanamation, and John Woo movies all into one! The \\"Bullet Time\\" sequence is the only scene worth mentioning. Just because it has a ton of cool FX doesn't make it a good movie at all! The Wachowski Brothers need to think of something creative instead of BITING nips and pieces of other people's ideas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary Philosophy","review":"Nice try. I liked this film better the first time when it was called TRON. Stupid philosophical schmaltz passed off as the real thing. Is the idea of illusionary reality a new thing? For fans of the Matrix it may be. Go read some books and find out how watered down this movie really is. I hated it all the more due to its tedious marketing and hub-bub. Tron had Jeff Bridges, the Matrix has dumb-face. Tron had GOOD computer special effects that were unlike anything seen before. Matrix has off the shelf effects that we've seen before in about a thousand video games. Is this a film or a video game intro? A bunch of worhtless garbage. Go buy it and tell your friends how great it looks and sounds on your Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"total ...","review":"extremely bad writing (what is this ridiculous religious subtext mixed in with insane inaccuracy and \\"my way or the highway\\" dialogue???), extremely bad acting. the special effects are not very good and are often very out of place (the only reason people liked them is because they are a-plenty). a horrible effort. the only thing worth some merit is that some of the action sequences pack some punch. other than that, says nothing, does nothing, and isn't worth anything. not recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Classic","review":"I've always liked the movie. It's a modern classic with heavy doses of subtext if you know how to read it. The DVD itself is adequately entertaining. It includes the movie, commentary and a short \\"Making of ...\\" style documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid sci-fi","review":"i gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because, well, Keanu Reeves. But despite his predictably and consistantly horrible acting, it is a true modern sci-fi classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Verry entertaining.","review":"The film is set in the future, aproximatly 3000 AD. The world as we know it is \\"normal 2000AD\\" -known as the Matrix- but this is an illusion as the humans are bread as batteries for machines. There are renegade humans, intent on freeing the other humans from the Matrix. The story centres on a man recently freed from the matrix, destined to destroy it. Other than that watch it and find out for your self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the classic they would have you believe","review":"Superb special effects. Intelligent plot-let down by sledghammer dialogue. Average to poor acting. Superb photography and camera work. The Matrix isn't quite the classic I had been lead to believe, it really is a mixed effort. Yet, compared to George Lucas' latest travesty/merchandising campain, it really is a good effort. Worst point: Casting of actor who played Damien in that moronic aussie soap Home & Away. He was bad in that and he's even worse in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea poorly executed.","review":"The movie started with an interesting idea and great promise. But it turned out to be just another \\"blow 'em away - body count movie\\" that Hollywood loves to churn out these days. I'm not an anti-violence type, it just gets boring after so much. It turns into \\"cheap fill\\". The movie had the talent and the budget; they just blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie","review":"This was the worst movie I have ever seen (next to Eyes Wide Shut). Keanu Reeves should not be allowed to act, period. Granted the effects were good, because it wasn't seen before, the plot sucked, the acting was even worse. This is one movie that I do not wish upon anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dud","review":"If you want to see a clever, action-packed and truly witty sci-fi classic then watch \\"Total Recall\\". In its action, its scripting and its philosophic sophistication, \\"Total Recall\\" easily dwarfs this pretentious and self-regarding piece of idiocy. The acting is indifferent. The action is barely solid. The \\"philosophical\\" treatment of the Cartesian apperance/reality problem is elementary. Even the effects are nothing special, in spite of the massive budget. And why does the chief villain have to mince every sentence like a constipated Nazi? The awful dialogue contains such lines as this -- \\"Do you believe in fate?\\" -- \\"No...Because I don't like the thought of being controlled.\\" The immense popularity of this mindless and overlong bore is mystifying, but then again, what can one say considering that the majority is always wrong? It seems to be aimed at the core audience of cybernerds and computer geeks, upon which it has numerous enthusiastic fanatics. To be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix","review":"This was purchased as a gift, so I have not personnaly seen it. However, it was very well received and appreciated. The four star rating is because I have not seen it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down.","review":"i have to admit, when i saw the this movie the first time i was stunned by the great visual effects and the amazing martial arts. watching the movie a second time however, i realized how annoyingly pathetic the dialouge and plot is. it seems as if the writer just wrote a story to justify the special effects, not as if the visuals support the plot. there are huge gaps that are left unexplained and are just justified because \\"this is the science-fiction and who knows what might be possible in the future\\". and by the way, reeves is a terrible actor and it is very tiring to listen two his dull voice and ridiculous lines for 2 straight hours. this movie is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"i VERY MUCH DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS","review":"I did not understnad this movie.

But shame about the film, mediocre acting,very ordinary photography ( I was hoping for something on a par with bladerunner here )....a B movie with ingenious special effects....Edward Muybridge must be smiling to himself up there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good with an exeptional storyline","review":"An exeptional Science Fiction movie needs to provide many key aspects, many of which the Matrix has forfilled. One of the key qualities the movie owns is a storyline which is not only unique and original but captures the imagination of the audience.The action scenes of course provide the basis of the movie,and although this is a common fault of the modern film industry, fantastic technology and correography back this up. To sum up this still does not compare to the all time greatest sci -fi film of 2001 but is worth a watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Visual Experience!!","review":"This movie is a monumental achievement in visual effects. Despite the wierd plot and development, this movie still makes for an exciting visual roller coater ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, PRETTY GOOD!!!!!!","review":"I thought this movie was fantastic, except all the unnecessary talking of crap on a pile of more crap. The fighting scenes ruled and the action was perfect. All in all this movie was 4 stars for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only for the action","review":"This is a very, very well put together and interest grabber movie. I liked this movie not only for the action, but for the plot also. \\"What is real\\" and \\"Free you mind\\" are both mind-triping thoughts. Most defenitlly a movie to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolowa","review":"The Matrix was unbelievable. The special effects were great, The acting was incredible.I question why hollywood had not discovered Carrie Anne Moss ( who played trinity ) long ago. She is an extremely talented actress.Keanu Reeves was actually great in this film.And we can't forget Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus.I usually don't go for this kind of movie. But it had alot of spiritual messages behind this film.My hat is off to the Wachowski Brothers who directed the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome stuff. The best sci-fi of the decade, and it shows what rubbish The Phantom Menace was (under any other name but the Star Wars franchise it would have been seen for what it is - over-inflated and boring). THIS, on the other hand is definately the way forward. I am glad to hear Matrix II and III will be with us soon (not soon enough! )Great stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Film for Gun lovers. Cultish.","review":"This movie has lots of guns. They have big guns and small guns. I personally like the Matrix better than reality. Lie to me as long as you tell me what I want to hear.

Keanu Reeves outdoes himself in this one, as does Laurence Fishburne. But the one we really need to pay attention to in the future is Carrie Anne Moss. Her portrayal of Trinity was both strong and vulnerable at the same time. The brothers have done it again. The FX were superior and didn't overtake the movie. Watching some parts of the movie I found myself holding my breath or gripping the arm rests! I'm actually going to see the movie for the 10th time this evening and I'm looking forward to it as much as I did the 1st time. I can't wait! If you have a chance to buy this movie, please do so. I promise that you won't be disappointed. I'm acutally going to buy the DVD--and I don't even own a DVD player yet! I live in Seattle and we still have the Matrix playing in a couple of theaters. And the movie is still packing people in on the weekends. This movie is FANTASTIC! A TRIUMPH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning - It'll blow you away","review":"Is saw this movie in theatre 4 times, just because it's one of the greatest SFX-movies ever. An instant classic for it's good story and starring actors. Just sit down, turn out the lights, and be amazed by this action-movie-of-the-year. You won't be dissapointed, unless you don't like sf-action, then you should buy Disney's 'Bambi' (great too...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Technically the best","review":"I've grown up with movies starting in the 50's, with the all-to-obvious special effects, until now with Matrix. I was blown away. And the extras on the DVD showing how they were created didn't take a thing away from the wonderful complexity of what they created."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film Ever","review":"The Matrix is a truly magnificent film! From the very start I was excited, intrigued and downright gobsmacked as to the depth and feel to the film. I truly loved this flick. The funky urban feel that it had, and the effects incorporated into it were loveable. You really felt that this was going to be a good film right from the start, and I tell you now it doesnt dissapoint. I have heard some people say it wasnt what they expected and that they didnt like it but I think those people couldnt of understood the film. The concept of the film was astounding and the directors were truly instrumental in the thinking of the plot. A very clever and believable story line, especially in the mad capped corrupted world we live in nowadays. The Matrix..........it came, it impacted and by god I friggin loved it. All who has eyes should grab some popcorn and sit down and watch this flick. I cant say any more than that !"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie was fantastic!","review":"I would have to say the the Matrix was a phenominal movie!

This movie is a definate \\"must-see\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix","review":"I have never been a fan of Keanu but this one is the best I've seen him do. Of course Fishburne is a big help. Couldn't beat the special effects and it actually has a great twist of a plot. Give us more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check it out","review":"While this movie isn't for everyone, it's definately worth it for anyone who makes time to check it out. This movie twists your perception of reality until you can't quite remember whether up is down or reality is what we know. While some of the scenes are a bit too violent, the special effects in them make up for it. It's not good for an impressionable audience because of the content, so don't just let your kids go out and rent it before you've seen it. This is one of my #1 all time favorite movies, and I'm not big into sci-fi (I didn't like \\"Blade Runner\\" all that much). I love it and I can't wait to see it again (hopefully I'll get a copy for Chrsitmas! ). Finally, whoever said that this movie influenced the whole Columbine disaster obviously didn't see the movie because the big black trench coats? Only in one scene and not that big a deal. I would've forgotten what they were wearing if no one had made it into a national issue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a sci-fi flick","review":"It would be misleading to say that the movie is just a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece. The essense of the Matrix is profoundly philosophical and spiritual. It actually makes you think about things that other movies try to make you forget about: the reality of this world and how you can personally change it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Maybe it was just me?","review":"OK Maybe it was just me, but I was REALLY confused when this movie ended. I guess maybe I was really tired but I don't understand?! Why was every flying around, going into the crappy world anyway?! I didn't understand it and it was not an intellectual movie either!! There were no long serious themes going on in this movie, nothing earth shattering. I think that it was an action flick, nothing more nothing less. Don't expect any more. It said nothing long lasting, and was in no way a classic, ok it had cool special effects but so did a lot of bad movies. OK, I am sorry to be the odd one out and say I didn't like it but I didn't! I don't think this one is worth it, maybe a rental. Make it a Blockbuster night :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"1999's Worst Offering","review":"How so many people loved this film, I will never know. It was AWFUL! I had to walk out of the theater during the ending (the \\"I love you\\" scene, how anybody can even LIKE this film after seeing that scene is WAY beyond me). Gag me with a spoon. Oh, wait a minute, there IS no spoon. Maybe if this film gave itself an injection of self-mockery, it would have been worth the time, but alas... For those who hated this film, see \\"Fight Club,\\" and I promise, you will not be disappointed. It is sort of the thinking man's \\"Matrix,\\" at least as far as style is concerned.

Big deal! Sets are stolen from \\"Metropolis\\", \\"Brazil\\" and \\"2001\\". Script is stolen from Hindu scripture. Acting is stolen from \\"The Pretentious School of Something Important is Going On Here, Ha Ha.\\" And Keanu Reeves is the worst actor ever to appear on film, besides also-rans like Martin Milner. The only exhilarating moment of this ponderous, stupid movie is when the Oracle (oh, what a surprise, she's a cookie-baking, cigarette-smoking blue-collar woman) tells Keanu, \\"You're cuter than I thought,\\" and then, a moment later, \\"You're not too bright.\\" I wasted two hours of my life with this movie and am spending another five minutes to warn others to STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever?","review":"I am saddened and dismayed that I wasted over two hours of my life trying to understand this worthless set of pictures they call a movie. I openly admit that I didn't understand it, but what on earth is the point of a movie that 1% of the population can easily comprehend? The special effects were highly overrated. With what computers can do today, why was anyone shocked at the \\"great\\" effects? Everyone says they understand the movie, but do they really? I may be the only one that didn't jump on the Matrix bandwagon, but I'm proud to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top gimmickry","review":"Thin storyline, poor acting and very very boring.Stunts and techy was good but film had no depth.

The story is easy to figure out (a greek philosipher came up with this theory along time ago) and the effects, well, they were to laugh at. They were the worst special effects I've seen. They look so fake. Even the film's highlight was unippressive. You could see a little black outline around the girl when she jumped up and paused in the air. I don't know why everyone thinks that so good. The reason it gets two stars is because it tried to be original, but sadly it's taken a story that has already been told and hollwoodized it. I'm not that easily ammused Hollywood.

The series steadily goes downhill with each additional release.When The Matrix made its debut, it was all the rage. And rightfully so!It was revolutionary, it was fresh and most importantly, it was cool!The special effects were usually top-notch and the characters were good, displaying decent acting. My favorite character was played by Laurence Fishburne, aka Morpheus (sp?). He was strong, and strongly desired by the opposing forces.The action was good, but the effects, especially the slow-motion, dodging ones, were off the hook.It was good, but the steam simmered as the series went on.4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a minute!!","review":"Don't buy this video yet! I saw Matrix several times in the theater and loved it but...IT IS NOT THE SAME ON VHS!!

Check this out at your local $1 theater or buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie breathes life into the Sci-Fi genre","review":"On top of being a solid action movie, this movie definately brings something new to the world of the sci-fi movie. After Lucas did it with Star Wars back in the late 70's, the Wachowski brothers do it in the late 90's.

A super clean transfer, and great sound. This moive is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"Ok right off the actor Reeves is not a good actor. Worst of allhe was suppose to be this martial artist but he had no movesperiod. The way they exagerated the fights was horrable.

Keanu does his best to look disoriented (that's a real stretch for him I bet) and Fishburne spouts sayings like a 21st Century disciple from Yoda Community College.Of course, many of today's filmgoers don't need any more intellectual stimulation than a stylized Keanu running around in an overcoat with a gun, so this DVD will be a huge seller.

I admit that science fiction is not my favorite theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's A Matrix of Plot Holes!","review":"One of the characteristics of bad science fiction is the use of a fundamental premise that is unscientific.

They got their wish but the movie lacks so much.The plot is far too complicated and though, perhaps easy to understand, go nowhere. There are too many things going on at once, and the FX simply get in the way of the action. They distract from what seems to be the main point of the movie. On top of everything else, the casting was done very irresponsibly. Keanu Reeves is incredibly hard to take seriously ever since his fantastic outings as Ted in the Bill and Ted movies.

An exhilarating, exhausting, immersive ride through some imaginative filming and unimaginative writing.Complaints about Mr. Reeves can, in my opinion, be more than cancelled out by applause for Mr. Fishburne, who is nothing short of magnificent for the first half of the film. Hugo Weaving is also a great surprise as the inhuman Agent Smith, and should be raking in cash for his next few roles, if there's any justice in this world.Give thanks, please, for the moody and perfectly-placed soundtrack, the clever SFX, and the enthralling fight sequences. Niggles 'The Matrix' may have, but, while you're watching, you won't have the breath to criticise. And that's all you can ask from an action/sci-fi movie. 'Blade Runner' it ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Buy if you are using a DVD player on a Mac.","review":"The movie is one of my favorites, the special effects are out of this world and I can't wait to see something else from the people who made this movie.A word of warning though to anyone who plays there DVD's on a Macintosh Computer. The DVD is not formated for the Mac, which is very upsetting when all you can look forward to is watching this movie on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Nice Features, Excellent DVD Transfer","review":"I have to take exception with some of the reviews written aboyt this DVD. The transfer from film was excellent,(NO Grain that I can see and the sound quality was excellent). The special effects are truly OUTSTANDING!!! There is a scene where a bullet comes straight at the camera that makes me jump everytime. I consider this DVD a MUST BUY! The only thing I can fault the DVD for is where they put the layer change,(right in the middle of a word). True you only miss the 'n' in the word 'in' but it could have been done 5 seconds either way and avoided this. If you are looking for a GREAT movie this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"badass","review":"Only a 1,000 words; well, the Matrix was the best movie I've seen in a long time, and I watch a lot of movies.

I've seen it three times since it came out and am still going back for more. I think it would appeal to anyone who has ever pondered reality and come to the conclusion that it's all completely subjective. The sci-fi element of the Matrix is well-conceived and believable to anyone with an imagination although some suspension of disbelief is necessary. Despite the fact I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies, I was very drawn in by the use of martial arts here: it's appealing to think we are all physical equals contingent upon our mental power. Finally and importantly, the acting was excellent and the cast created engaging characters. So many people I know look forward to the sequels with great anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever Made","review":"Everyone should buy this movie...it is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made.

Heck, when I found out this movie was coming out on DVD back in September I went and bought a DVD player and full surround sound system.The story is very good -- even though ideas and themes in the movie are borrowed from many sources, the execution of the story is enticing and refreshing. The action sequences are top-notch and are matched to a quality soundtrack. The special effects are not only great, but they do not steal from they show -- they only enhance the story.The combination of story, action, and FX make this film fun to watch over and over -- it never seems to get boring. This is a classic and Cyberpunk at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyber-punk cinema at its best","review":"The matrix is a wonderfully crafted movie with eye-pleasing special effects and an engaging storyline.

It just isn't my choice of genre. So, when everyone praised this movie and all of its special effects, I was skeptical. I have to admit, though, the special effects blew me away from beginning to end, and the plot was surprisingly good too. I first saw this movie on VHS and immediately wanted it on DVD...the DVD definitely adds a lot of dimensions that you can't get the full effect of on VHS. I highly recommend this film for everyone, not just for sci-fi or action fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the coolest movie ever made.","review":"Buy it. There are films which will make you think more, although this has an intelligent script, films which will grip you more, although this is extremely engrossing, and films with more eye-candy, although this contains some fantastic effects, but there is not another action film photgraphed and directed with this much panache, and it is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD problems","review":"This is a great movie. You'll really get immersed in the world they portray to you, however you may want to buy the VHS version. The creators tried to jam pack this DVD full of extras, but it causes the movie to freeze at inoppertune times. You also cannot access all of the extra features. The manufactuer is aware of these problems & intends to re-release the corrected DVD mid-end Jan 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new movie for a new era","review":"Keanu Reeves and Lawerence Fishburne star in a woderful cast.

Within the first half hour I thought this movie was going to be one of the worst I'd ever seen, but as it progressed and everything started to make sense, it turned out to be one of the best action/sci-fi movies I've ever seen. The DVD is packed with behind the scenes clips, music only track, commentary track, and scenes that show how they created the special effects. This movie is only the beginning of what future action/sci-fi movies will bring us in the new millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix","review":"This movie is pretty cool.. there are a lot of action scenes.

The script was written by someone who has no knowledge of laws of thermodynamics. I wish I could talk about that more without giving out anything of the movie... Add the great(!) acting of Keanu Reeves: and you have a good comedy with great visual effects. How can a professional actor not be able to say a decent \\"wow\\"? Look for that while watching and...Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated...","review":"Aside from some amazing special effects this movie was poorly directed, poorly acted and poorly written... it was so bad that no one could even consider it for an Oscar.It's great for high school kids and anyone who watched \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\\" and was blown away by Reeve's performance of a moron.. which wasn't that hard because he plays one in real life.If you like things that look \\"cool\\".. you'll enjoy this. It has some pretty neat visual and sound effects.. but in the end.. it's all \\"eye candy\\" and a stupid story that doesn't make a bit of sense.If you have high standards in great filmwork.. go see something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars - You've got to be kidding!","review":"The only reason I gave it 1 star was because 0 was not an option. I love SciFi as long as there is at least an element of believability in it, but The Matrix had a lousy plot, no semblance of reality or possibility, and completely boring. One would have to be totally wasted to enjoy this movie. The highlight of the movie was the credits signifying the end of this sorry movie. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but doesn't deliver","review":"At the base of this film is the simple concept that everything around us is a computerized hologram (aka The Matrix), masking a less-than-ideal real world. It's an idea I too have thought would make a good movie, as I'm sure a lot of other people have. It's not too difficult of a concept.But the movie keeps explaining it. And explaining it. And explaining it. Over and over. Apparently they think the viewers are very very slow. I was sitting in the theater thinking \\"Okay, I get it! Move on!\\" and then they continued explaining it for about another hour. Keanu Reeves plays someone is isn't very smart because it takes an hour to explain simple things to him.And I guess it has good special effects. But I'd think any movie that relies on special effects will soon appear dated, since anyone will be able to recreate them on home computers in several years.To me, this movie seems like a good idea that didn't develop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayebe Bill Gates Would have Been a Better Star?","review":"snore snore. I wanted to like this film. I was psyched for an intelligent VR themed movie. THis was NOT that movie.All I know is that the future consists of sunglass-wearing leather=clad slo-mo folk. Why they dress this way is beyond me. I guess jeans and tee shirts do not exist in the future.Oh, and those sunglass wearers was already done in the OMega Man--it was goofy there and is more goofy resurrected here.This was a sadly thought out, ill-conceived filmIf Bill Gates had been the star, it would have made it 2000% more exciting (and that is a sad commentary)Not surprisingly, most of the \\"positive\\" reviews have to do with the EFX.

It was directed and written by Larry and Andy Wachowski. The Matrix is about an computer hacker who goes by the name Neo (Keanu) . He's been searching for the answer to the eternal question: What Is The Matrix ? Later in his quest , he finds a hacker named Morpheus(Laurence) who tells him what the matrix really is, its just a computer program. Morpheus then shows Neo the real world out of the matrix , but the reason why Morpheus needs Neo is because he believes that Neo is the one who will stop the machines and give them their freedom. My Favorite scene was when Neo went threw training. I think this is a really good movie and you should see it.Also Recommended: I also enjoyed the Matrix Reloaded and the Matrix Revolutions"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very original movie","review":"i thought this movie had a great story. it can b a little confusing if ur not paying attention. the story is a good one all the same. it may not have quite as much action in it as the second or third movie, but it was more captivating then the others. i liked lobby scene were Neo and Trinity completely destroy an office building lobby. i think if u r going to watch the matrix, watch this one first and it will not be as dissapionting as it's sequals........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for everybody","review":"This film is simply perfect!I think everyone can find in it something he likes: some the philosiphical aspects, some the action, some (girls) just Neo.

There is an overall emotional depth I really appreciated. Hero and villain are excellently portrayed. Even the very textures and colors of the visual aspect captured on film are gorgeous. The only problem I had was in the 'construct' when Morpheus is explaining things to Neo. They didn't need a reference to cold fusion, and should have further elaborated on the scorching of the sky and the machines' inability to leave the planet.

A very good movie but not amazing. I loved this movie but I dont understant the people who bill it as the greatest movie ever. The movie has a very good, yet very complex plot that at times is hard to follow. Great action scenes and extreordinary acting make it a four star movie.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne, he was a bad mother; shut your mouth. The special effects don't really do it for me either. The idea of several cameras set up to capture a fluid action isn't a new one. This was the whole idea behind the advent of the motion picture camera, so just get over it people please. There are so many other quality pictures out there so just pick those up instead. THAT'S IT I'M DONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be hated for writing this!","review":"At a time when Hong Kong has forgotten what made their films great, Hollywood thought they'd try to remind them with The Matrix. Anyone who's seen Iceman Cometh, Dragon From Russia, Saviour of the Soul or countless other Hong Kong classics will be able to pick out scenes re-created in The Matrix. One of the kings of Hong Kong, Yuen Woo Ping, does a good job with the action and the effects are excellent. However, what the film lacks is the real core that made films like Saviour of the Soul great. The mixture of humour, action, suspense and romance simply doesn't click in The Matrix. Everyone is applauding Carrie Ann Moss's character, but Michelle Yeoh combined fighting ability and femininity far better in Royal Warriors or Project S. The Matrix is visually terrific, but as cold as ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but no people","review":"This flick is all computerized special effects and characters who are as bloodless as the computers. That is, the effects are fun but the people are of little concern, since they have no reality -- being involved instead with leaping great distances through the air, walking on walls, and dodging bullets. The plot seems to involve the premise that everyboy has been created or controlled by a computer somewhere. The principals, who may be human beings, lie about hooked up to a computer aboard some sort of vehicle. What we see on the screen appears to be what's going on in their brains. Then there are other human-like creatures trying to hunt them down. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburn sort all this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix","review":"The Matrix is, without a dought, is a well writen science-fiction movie, with it's freaky sounds and great speacial effects, it's guaranteed to nock your socks off.

This is also the best sci-fi film available on DVD. The film is kind of a mixture of the Terminator and Dark City, but still seems to be very original. The action scenes are some of the best since John Woo's Face off, and plays in well with the fast beating soundtrack. Why should you buy this film? The special effects are incredible, and look fantastic on DVD; the story is well written and has some enjoyable twists; the film is well acted and the direction exceptional; the DVD as loads of extra features, with truly to many to list; its an outstanding movie.

Most flicks put all the action on the surface. The Matrix layers the action over a plot with deeper philosophical implications: What is reality? Is the physical world, as I know it, all that there is? Am I in control of my life, or am I under the control of something above and beyond me? Is this greater power good or evil? The film borrows heavily from a syncretic mix of world reglions, most notably Buddhism and Christianity. But the overarching themes of the film are definitely Christian. But beyond this, the film is a technical masterpiece. The visual effects are stunning. In fifty years time, I think the Matrix will be looked upon as one of those seminal works that changed the way movies are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply terrific!","review":"\\"The Matrix\\" is the most wonderful film I have ever seen, (even better than \\"Dark City\\" and the \\"City of Lost Children\\").

And some of the dilaogue (not the acting, the dialogue) was kinda cheesy, but when you take a story like that and put awesome special effects into it (meaning no matter what you do, you can't tell its actually not real) you get something that is just a blast to see. A word on the Format, i haven't actually seen it on DVD, But i noticed it did a little squeezing on the actors on Deep Blue Sea, which is a movie that rocks but i wish it had this movie's FX.

As a member of the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism), with a persona in the Italian Renaissance, I was most anxious to see this book. It was all I expected! The first third of the book is Italian fashions from most ancient times to Vecellio's own period, which is the period of my persona. In no time at all, I'd found several costumes I want to recreate. The only drawback is the lack of color, but the drawings show considerable details."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good source for period-accurate16th Italian/Venetian fashion","review":"Despite what some may tell you, this is actually a VERY good source for late 16th century Venetian, and to a lesser extent Italian, costume, especially if studied in conjuction with a study of the portraits of the period. Vecellio was a Venetian born and bred, and also had first hand knowledge of Italian fashions outside of Venice.

If you already own \\"Salesman\\" this is a worthwhile investment for sure, if not get \\"The Greatest Salesman in the World\\" instead.

DO NOT BUY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the extra twenty bucks and get the Champ!","review":"My wife gave me this a while back, and I never had a successful flight. It's hard enough learning to fly without ailerons. This model will set you back even further with a non-conventional rudder/elevator hybrid, and a rear-mounted propeller that may be better for crashes (questionable), but simply isn't the way most planes are configured. Fixing the control strings when the tail got smashed was too much for me, and I sadly threw it away. Then I read about the RTF Champ, which sells for $90, and is made by the same company. Fantastic plane to learn with. I've crashed it dozens of times with no substantial damage. True, no ailerons, but I've mastered the plane and am ready to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor control","review":"The Firebird Commander is a sturdy plane, but is hard to control. The V-tail acts as both rudder and elevator, but provides little control. I had to modify and extend the V-tail to provide more control surface. Out of the box, the turning radius was probably about 200 feet.The climb rate was less than desired and the plane should probably have a more powerful motor.This is a beginners airplane, but there are other models that might be more suitable for a beginner, not the Firebird Commander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and Fun!","review":"Last week for my birthday I got a Firebird Commander 2.

It is easy to control, and fast to learn how to fly. This is DEFENETLY a beginner plane!The battary charges for about 3 hours, and although the owners manuel says it flies for about 15 minutes without a charge, mine can go hours before recharging.I recommend you fly this plane in winds from 3-7 mph, and in an area of about 100 yards.I hope you buy this plane because it is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but fragile","review":"This was my first RC plane. It was easy enough to learn on, though \\"learning\\" can be the most expensive part of any RC hobby. Please let my mistakes help you avoid some sorrow and expense. To fly this plane, you will need a very large open area. I used a soccer field or a hay field. Stay away from trees, houses, and power lines. Do not fly if the wind is stronger than 5-6 mph. Strong winds will make this plane crash faster than anything else. Finally, purchase extra back wings. You will need them. They are the only weak link in this particular design. Above all, have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst plane ever!!","review":"The flight characteristics regarding this plane are the worst I have seen! Out of the box it would not fly, it will roll left no matter what input you give it to counteract it. I have tried to trim it and to make sure all flight surfaces are level and even.The lack of separate elevator and rudder control makes this a poor choice for any pilot.

I am going to toss the plain in the garbage because the remote control, with only two channels, won't work for anything else.

In fact, the movie this novel inspired, \\"Field of Dreams,\\" succeeded in three-dimensionalizing and transcending this awful source material, and is well worth seeing. But whether you've seen the movie or not, skip the book.HOWEVER, if you like to read unintentionally hilarious prose, if you like ridiculous similes liberally sprinkled over every page, if you like lifeless characters behaving bizarrely without reason or motivation, you might get a kick out of this thing.

If you look down upon people who are oversentimental and nostalgic, then this book is not for you. But if you do understand the game and how it is a symbol of America and of youth and memory and peace and beauty, then buy a copy of this book.

Kinsella for the first time after being a long time fan of the movie, then you're in for a treat. Of course, if you expect it to read like a novelization of Field of Dreams, then you'll be disappointed.The story is a deliberate and passionate journey of a man following a crazy voice in his head to build a baseball field in place of the crops on his Iowa farm. He risks his family's livelihood for the sake of a dream, and because he loves his wife, daughter, Iowa and baseball. The writing is leisurely as if stretching back across the 20th century from the very time of Shoeless Joe Jackson.

Also, the book and the disc versions contain way too many similes. It seemed like every other word was a figure of speech. Give the reader/listener some credit.

I just feel it is so FAKE....well it is Fiction after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Shoeless Joe\\" had hard time staying interesting","review":"Like many of the people here, I too had to read this novel for school. Never seeing the movie \\"Field of dreams\\", I didn't go into it already knowing the ending.'Shoeless Joe' starts off like most novels, kinda slow. Unfortunally this makes the reader think that it will soon start to pick up and become an interesting novel. This is not so. The story drags on yanking the reader in different pointless directions. I have a book report due for this book tomorrow, and I'm only 3/4 way through the book. I have lost interest in it and have only made it as far as I have because we have to read it some days in engilsh class. Even then I have a hard time keeping my attention pointed to the novel. I always thought keeping the reader interested was a large part of writing a good novel, apparently I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"What a disappointment. You know a book is bad when the movie is actually better than it -- light years better, actually. Whoever wrote the screenplay took the few good ideas in the book and focused on them. They also kept some of the poetic / purple dialog. Just enough to not overdo it. The book overdoes everything. When compared with the movie script, it reads like a rough draft. The nerve to put J.D. Salinger in it. Like he should ever be associated with such low-grade art. Treasure the movie, don't bother with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites.","review":"I read this book several years ago and being the baseball nut that I am thoroughly enjoyed it. I saw the movie \\"Field of Dreams\\" before I read the book, and though they are quite different, I enjoyed them both. As with any book that has been made into a movie the book goes into more detail, and that is a good thing here. The book is a quick read and would make a wonderful beach book for the end of the summer.Darren L. PareAuthor33 Summers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Whimsical Baseball Book","review":"Loved the movie and loved the story in the book even more. The whimsical writing that some have called lyrical was very distracting sometimes. The insertion of J.D. Salinger into the book was classic! This book helped me to remember why I love baseball so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sassy dame","review":"I love this CD. It came extremely fast to NZ and a bonus too as I was expecting only one cd not three!While Dvorak is currently my favourite, other composers featured here have been growing on me.Never been a Cello devotee in the past, but I am enjoying this new phase of my musical listening.The late Ms du Pre plays with vigor and assertiveness, yet manages to convey those moving and sublime moments when needed.Most enjoyable. Thanky you"},{"rating":"2","title":"I THOUGHT I had heard these concertos,,,","review":"UNTIL I was fortunate enough to have heard them performed by Jacqueline du Pre!!!ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!! Her superb playing, along with truly masterfulinterpretative skills, just \\"comes pouring out of the speakers!\\"Also, the orchestras were obviously truly inspired by these opportunities to perform and record with one of the greatest musicians of all time.The sound quality is excellent, as is the separation and clarity of both the soloist's and orchestral performances. The overall dynanism is also top notch - I found I had to lower the volume substantially from my normalsystem loudness levels.I've enjoyed this set so much I'll probably wind up buying everything from Amazon that EMI has produced with Jacqueline du Pre's name on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dupre is simply the best celloist who ever lived and played","review":"If you've ever heard any other artist perform the Dvorak Cello Concerto and then listen to Dupre perform it, there is no comparison. It's amazing how she was able to literally exude the music from her body, and then through her cello. It's breathtaking and moving. There are many parts in the Dvorak concerto that when they crescendo it moves one to tears. She was a gift from somewhere else in the universe and there's been none like her since."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT DISC","review":"Excellent disc, on every aspect, sound, interpretations , everything, choral fantasy is just amazing.

She was in movies before such as Mystic Pizza. This is a great movie because it is great watching movies back at the dawn of the 1990s and how 1980s it looked. This movie released in 1990 made over a 100 million dollars. It had a good story and Richard Gere and Julia Roberts did a fine job at acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I would like to see a psychological analysis as to why PRETTY WOMAN had such an impact. Did it tap into some masked desires, women to be prostitutes, men to get away with dating them? Yikes. Julia Roberts plays it as if being a hooker was a career choice she discussed with her high school guidance counselor (\\"Well, I also like accounting, but that requires college and I wanted to make money right away!\\"). PRETTY WOMAN? Prostitutes end up pretty infected, pretty beaten, and pretty murdered, not married to Richard Gere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"In response to another poster, the pre-release criticism not really about what is or is not on this disc. It's about the fact that studios want to milk the audience dry by re-issuing every DVD with new special features every few years. A movie comes out on DVD, people who liked the movie shell out money to own it. Fine. Then the studio comes along, throws in a few special features, re-issues the DVD, and expect people to buy it up too. Not just people who didn't own the original DVD, but those who did as well. And this time, not only have they done that once, they've done it twice! Put all the cards on the table; put all the special features on the first release, and then leave it alone. Stop trying to get the audience to pay for the same movie over and over. It's not just a question of what may be on this DVD, it's a question of why wasn't this all on there the first time. Why does this one need to be released three times, and when will it stop?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie ,The orignal no extras in it !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best pretty woman dvd out there.I like the orignal theater version which this is.

What is romantic about VD, rape, jail time, pimps, etc?What does this film say about relationships between men and women? I know this is a popular film, and that scares me even more.

It's just as great as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always fun to watch.....","review":"I just recently purchased the 10th Anniversary edition of Pretty Woman. Of course, I watched it the first night I had it home. Once again I was impressed by the charisma of Roberts and Gere. They are splendid together. Julia Roberts: a funny, vibrant actress. Her laugh is almost contageous. The scene when Gere snaps the top of the necklace holder on her hand is great. Gere: Smug, but likeable. They simply work well together. Other movies I would reccomend are, \\"It Could Happen to You.\\" This is also very predictable, but a good movie. Also, \\"The Story of Us\\" is another good movie.

I'm happy to suspend my disbelief in the name of entertainment. The problem is that I think I pulled something having to suspend so MUCH disbelief for so long. If you're a sucker for any kind of romantic movie you will enjoy this movie. Everyone does their best. My issue is that there are so many superior movies of the \\"happily ever after\\" genre that you could go your whole life without seeing \\"Pretty Woman.\\" Try something more creative like \\"The Night We Never Met\\" or even \\"You've Got Mail\\" where character development and plot are given much more work."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no way in hell that this movie is getting near my house.","review":"As one of the masses who just loved looking at Julia Roberts' pretty in this film, I always knew the story was toxic and not at all sane.

A sleeper among men, most of whom when asked will tell you Pretty Woman (or notting hill) are their favorite movies ever.That is certainly the case for me. However, although i am getting used to the \\"added scenes\\" of the 10th anniversary version they do not add to the story and tend to \\"change the softness and gentle feeling\\" present in the original version.If you are shopping, i recommend the original version not the anniversary edition.

We watch it often - its at the top of our favorites list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time, Buy the Regular Version","review":"The orginal release is a well-edited movie filled with some excellent sub-themes of self-worth, self-image, true selfless love versus lust, as well as a great visual lesson on real friendship versus friendship built on using someone for personal gain (the two prostitues vs. the billioniare and his lawyer).I rate the original movie five stars. However, this new edition is a GREAT disappointment. The additional scenes do not even match in lighting, etc. and create a poorly edited version of a great story. The 'extra features' are sloppy and seem just tossed in to 'add value'. I'm guessing the studio did not want to spend the extra money to get the cast to sit down and do some meaningful interviews.SAVE YOUR MONEY! Buy the orginal version on DVD or Video."},{"rating":"1","title":"A glorification of prostitution","review":"What could be more fun, romantic and glamorous than prostitution? Radiant Julia Roberts and handsome Richard Gere show us a world where streetwalkers are sweet, healthy, funny, charming, sassy and destined to live happily ever after. Yes, with Hollywood we expect to suspend disbelief, but this film shows no hint of the reality of sadness, brutality, desperation and boredom that define the lives of real prostitutes. Why do we need to make the world's oldest profession appear to be the world's most rewarding? Pretty Woman brings us a prostitute who never encounters pimps, drugs, disease or prison --- just fun, fun, fun ---- as her \\"career choice\\" earns her jewelry, designer clothes and eternal love.

Previously I considered prostitution to be a symptom of many of the ills in society, like loneliness, emotional neglect, addiction, inequalities in wealth and access to education, but now I know that prostitution can be fun - in this movie it's fun for the prostitute and it's fun for the client. Also, in the past, I suspected that there was more to life than money and good looks, but 'Pretty Woman' set me straight on that one: boy, was I wrong! Money is the most important thing in the world. It even makes love possible. Having been taught so many important lessons about life, I think it only fair that we, the viewing public, reward the producers and stars of this film with many millions of dollars - it might even be fair to call them prostitutes too, and to consider ourselves, the audience, as their clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohh, what a cute movie! Not!!!","review":"I hate this movie. I hate how it romanticizes prostitution. The average hooker walking the mean streets of america is a drug addict whose last resort to pay for her habit, is providing services to brutal, deviant scuzzballs. It would be a wonderful world if even one these girls experience even a fifth of what the Julia Roberts characters experiences and the men they service bare some kind of a resemblance to the Richard Gere character.

What about the cover art? Why'd they have to go and change that? I know it's all about marketing, but \\"Pretty Woman\\" was originally written in pink, and there were full-body shots of both characters.

Then take Cinderella and put it into the modern world. Those two combinations make this perfect Gary Marshall film. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are one of the best onscreen couples in the history of film. The movie really makes you feel for the characters. After the film, it is almost like you know Vivian. Comedy is everywhere as well as romance. All the performances are wonderful and the plot really grabs you. This is a definate film for anyone. See it."},{"rating":"2","title":"something new","review":"Pretty Woman is my favorite movie and I thought I almost knew it by heart. What a surprise when there were two additional scenes in this video that I had never seen. They really helped explain the romance of Vivian and Edward and progressed the movie. The additional \\"stuff\\" was just that, but the movie did not fail to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poosie","review":"How this movie bought back memories of when I first viewed it and it is still just as enjoyable.It also had extra scenes which was a nice bonus.My favorite memory of it was the script which had a lot of very profound lines that I had remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Movie ratings are always very subjective, with one person's gem being another's trash.

If you are out to play movie critic you will find lots of problems. 4 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid At All Costs","review":"I am such a fan of the ORIGINAL Pretty Woman film. In fact, I wore out my VHS copy, which I now wish I had held onto. This is a completely runied version of that film. It is like they took two totally different movies and blended them into one. When the added scenes show up, you know it because they just don't fit and pull you right out of the story. Not sure why they didn't just give the viewers a choice of watching the original or the new version, but they don't. It would actually be fun to see these deleted scenes if they were simply an extra bonus feature. I resent having garbage that was once on the cutting room floor now shoved down my throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selected B Roll Warning!!","review":"For those of you who love the original cut of this movie avoid this version at all costs! I received this version as a Christmas gift and I started to watch it one Saturday afternoon. One of my favorite lines was missing almost right off the bat. Instead of \\"Lights, lights would be good here\\" the two main characters discuss condoms and safe sex. It goes downhill from there. Some beloved scenes are just gone. This is a gritter look at Vivian Ward and her life as a prostitute. The glossed over lovable Hollywood romance now has a darker side - a side I did not like. I have seen B versions of other movies and those were OK. This was the first time that the rhythm, feel, and overal essence of a movie has been altered so dramatically. This selected B roll is a very different movie from the Pretty Woman that I know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Original Film, so disappointed!!","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am utterly disappointed that two versions of this film are not offered on these DVDs.

It keeps my Nano around my neck, as opposed to sliding off onto the floor when I turn in my chair and the silly thing's on the desk, and it keeps it handy when I want to change my selections. I feel much more secure since it is so small, at least it has a \\"keeper.\\" I drop it over my head in the AM and away I go.

The movie proved so popular with my family that somebody has absconded with our original video copy so please, please, please guys, get it out on DVD will you so I can get another copy (DVD's are easier to hide 'cos they are so much smaller than the old video).

I have wanted to see this movie for a long time but because it is sort of hard to find I guess I forgot about it until one day I saw it on TV. Me and my 17yr old brother (I am 34) sat and watched it one afternoon and thought it was hilarious. I watched it again with my 7 and 9yr old daughters a week later and we all thought it was great.

The clock looks very cute, and the horse makes a good galloping sound before coming out and going neighhhhh, so that you know its coming and the child have the time to look for it. It is also good that there is a little light sensor that automatically turns it off at night.edit:Unfortunately, the clock stopped working after about 6 months - the horse would come out and not retract, or would not come out at all. Eventually, the horse just stopped coming out at all. My child never abused (or even touched for that matter) since it was always out of reach.Oh well - nice idea and cute clock. But for the price I would have expected something more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After reading this book, I was disappointed in the respect that half of the content was a shop tool handbook more so than a boat joinery manual. Yes, the ideas and suggestions were valuble, but you should already know this going into boat construction.A few of his suggestions pertaining to using an inverted circular saw as a \\"make-do\\" table saw is down-right dangerous at best. (page 38)His chapter on \\"Woodworking Projects for the Home\\" was a nice addition, but I'm trying to figure out what it's doing in a boat joinery book?In the end, I'm glad I purchased the book as I gleaned a few ideas from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much in this book for someone looking to change the interior of their sailboat","review":"I thought this book would be full of ideas and pictures demonstrating interior changes to a boat. The author talks about his boat a lot, but has very few pictures or drawings that show the work that he has done. I expected to see multiple designs of new galleys, new heads, etc. Instead, you only get a few drawings and few new ideas. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal boat builder's companion.","review":"My review must be at least 20 words long, and repeated words don't count.

I am a huge fan of the Gundam series, I thought this would be a rare treasure but it isn't. I opened the case and the disc was marked as disc one but where in the hell is disc two? I then put it into my blu-ray player and began the movie, and right off from the start the plot just moves way too quickly to stay interested as you usually do in most of the Gundam series. I just didn't get the same feeling as I did with every other Gundam DVD I have seen. I would describe it as more of a feeling of disgust. This puts the franchise to shame. I do not recommend this to any Gundam fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gundam Classic!!","review":"I'll start the reveiw by saying that this is coming from a long time gundam fan.

Until a man with a metal mask named ironicly Iron Mask(Another Newtype), wants to kill all of humanity, and have a supernatual society.

The first 1-2 chapters set the stage, followed by a few difficult but tremdndously powerful chapters focusing on arcane philosophy or individuals. Then, in the second half, things become magnificent.There are observations in thsi book which are humbling; there are quotes which are devastating, there are anecdotes which are representative of the entire morass the 60's and Communism have bequeathed us. Many of our policy makers, senators, representative, and journalists should read this book. I only fear that they do not have the basic intellectual infrastructure to understand it, especially as it points a very incriminating finger at them.One can only hope that our western culture will survive enough for another renaissance; it is clear we are entering a very terrifying time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Geniuses of Our Day","review":"Length:: 6:27 MinsI'm always been a huge Dr. Dalrymple fan so it was a pleasure to read this book a second time for the purposes of review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I usually do not mark in my books out of respect for, almost veneration of, books.

Theodore Dalrymple is not just very smart; he is incredibly wise. This book is now on my top 100 recommended reading list.He demolishes liberalism by exposing the results of liberal policies often from his own life experiences of world travel and work in Britian as a prison doctor and as a physician at a hosptial serving a poor population. He brings to these rich life experiences penetrating insight. His prose is compact and articulate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously not everyone is going to like your book","review":"It's rare you see such gushing praise for an essay collection, more impressive is the average length of these Amazon reviews. It seems the reviewers like to look at their own words as much as this author does.I didn't like this book for a simple reason. There are better things to read than varied complaints and woes about changing times. Sure, sometimes it is good but these lopsided views.... he is as focused on discontent as he is verbose.If that sounds good to you, buy this book..... most people have stuff to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing glimpse into DIY media","review":"Jamming the Media is packed with concise, useful information. The format of the book is designed to treat media types in a consistent fashion. At the end of each chapter, Branwyn offers starter Kits and Resources. The information is invaluable. An excellent writing style, cool format, and great references make this book a nice addition for anyone with an interest in media.Topics covered: zines, music, multimedia, broadcasting (\\"pirate radio\\"), shortwave listening, media pranks -- this is a funny chapter, and electronic publishing.The book was nothing like I expected. I expected a traditional treatment of using the media. Instead, this book has helped open whole new avenues of media expression. The book is not a how to manual; it is a how to think manual.

The 2nd season is just as incredible. Frothing at the bit to see the 3rd season and more. The writing and the acting are the best. This series is addicting to both the 20' crowd and the 50's age group, as well. The storyline is full of twists and turns you can't predict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I really enjoyed the second season of Breaking Bad, it's definitely one of the craziest shows on tv. All of the characters do all the wrong things for all the right reasons, even when you can't believe what they're doing. I really loved all of the characters in the show except for Walt's wife. I wished at least one of the characters would have told her off. The whole show (but especially near the end) she acts like a total b*tch but no one calls her on it. I just found it very annoying and frustrating. The acting in the show is collectively superb, and they really maximize the genius of the original script. I can't wait to watch the 3rd season to see what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy messed up show!","review":"Very entertaining show! Sad to see the effects of the world of Meth. I would definitely recommend this show to friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but it's not good subject matter","review":"Well written, and funny in spots, but I am not a fan of the subject matter, which is drugs and dealers.

If we can watch it whenever we want we kind of start to take it for granted, or at the very least appreciate it less. I have this dilemma with just about any type of media, is it worth paying for it when I can watch it free on youtube? But Breaking Bad had me so totally drawn in that I didn't even ask myself if it would be worth buying. It was, and I did. Vince Gilligan created a universe so real but so unbelievable that you have to see what happens next. Season 2 really picks up the pace and, along with season 3, it's just one \\"I can't believe it\\" moment after another. Just when you think, \\"there's no way they can top that\\", they top that. I just don't know what I'll do in this long wait to season 4.

He draws and plays music and seems to have a childlike view of the world. He writes love songs and bangs chords on the piano like there is no tomorrow. He creates most of the artwork for his records too. He use to record stuff on a boombox. These tapes circulated around and Johnston ended up influencing Kurt Cobain and then recording a record with The Butthole Surfers. He's been compared to people like Brain Wilson and Roky Erickson. Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse has recorded his songs in the past. Linkous and Johnston were destined to collaborate. The result seemed more layered and complex than some of those early bedroom tapes. \\"Power of Love\\" sounds like Foreigner on LSD. The song \\"Mountain Top\\" is a feel good song, meant for driving on the open road. \\"You Hurt Me\\" sounds like Biz Markee. Let love be forever or fear yourself.

The fact that these guys can't play a riff worth a damn doesn't help either. I was so disgusted with Life on Display that I threw it out after listening to it a few times.

Unfortunatly, \\"Come Clean\\" was one of the greatest albums of all time in my opinion and Puddle of Mudd just didn't step up and fill their own shoes this time. There are a couple of good songs, but when compared to past songs like \\"Blurry\\", \\"Conrol\\", and \\"Drift and Die\\", this alblum sucks. As a stand alone album, this is not that bad, but as a sophmore album from what I thought was an awsome band, it is sorely lacking. Don't buy this album if you are already a Puddle of Mudd fan. If this is your first time listening to Puddle of Mudd, trust me and go back and buy \\"Come Clean\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm....","review":"i am a fan of puddle of mudd, but this is horrible. the best song is the 1st single \\"away from me\\". no songs on this album compare to the old \\"She Hates Me\\" or \\"Blurry\\". its not worth the money. but the production is good and the audio sounds clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album for the Puddle of Mudd fan","review":"This is my third album from Puddle of Mudd and it sounds great (somehow I missed the initial release of this album).

First you had the Brilliance of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains. Then came STP and Candlebox who were slightly derivative but great nonetheless. Starting to get ugly, bands like 7 Mary 3 and Creed were to follow and finally you have utter waste like Nickelback (\\"I like your pants around your feet...\\" nuff said) and Puddle of Mudd. The faux-grunge is recycled every few years and with each new band it becomes more and more watered down. Not buying it? Look at lyrics alone. Read the lyrics of Nirvana (sheer poetry), Pearl Jam or even Candlebox. Now read the lyrics of ANY Puddle of Mudd album and compare. At least the first album had a couple of somewhat catchy tunes. What does Life on Display bring to the table? Nothing. I think it actually leaves a vaccume. Sorry guys you're a day late and a dollar short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better the first time I heard it...","review":"This album was definetly better the first time I heard it back in the 90's, by a band called Alice in Chains. I cannot believe that a group of supposedly talented musicians could come up with a CD full of such garbage. On this album absolutely 0% originality is achieved. Basically it sounds like a mix tape of really good 90s rock music. Of course, to the ear it sounds ok, but when you realize that every sound and every sentence of lyrics you hear are things you've heard before, put into a blender- it's pretty bad. This CD is for sure going to start the bands downfall (if they were ever actually high enough to fall). They should be embarrased with this release. Don't waste your money on this. If you must hear it download it. Support good music, not this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Ok I know they had strong links to Fred Durst and the fast dying genre that is nu-metal but I never expected this. Whilst some of the material on Come Clean was poor, there were obvious standout tracks such as Blurry and P*** it All Away plus more that were very listenable to.There is not a single track on this album that I enjoy listening to. It's all the same, the same whiny 'I hate my girlfriend' theme all the way. It's absolutely abysmal unlistenable to bilge.What were they thinking when they recorded it who on earth could enjoy this. Listening to it makes me feel ill and confirms my suspicions that Puddle of Mudd could well be one of the worst bands on the entire earth. The only reason I haven't given it no stars is because I can't.Avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"nirvana = nirvana, PoM=PoM","review":"alright, lemme get something straight, these guys do NOT soundlike nirvana, except for wes on away from me. puddle of mudd isn't the most original band, but their not a ripoff of anybody.they have a lot of alice in chains influence especially in nothing left to lose. however, i hated spin you around. the hoo-hooing sounded like he was singing rooster and a raffi song at the same time (u know raffi, the children's singer).so, anyway, i would recommend this to any hard rock fan with a fairly open mind.

It always thrills me when I see bands like this fall out of favor, but I have learned that it usually has nothing to do with the music itself. Their \\"PIMPS\\" (record execs.) find a band with a better looking lead singer and groups like this get thrown into the dumpster. So what happens? the music doesn't get any better, just the way the band looks does. Isn't that what boy bands do? Well if I must say anything else about this album it would be boring, bland and what ever else I can think of to describe music to sleep to.

I was familiar with their first album, but never bought it because I thought they sounded way too much like a rip off of Fuel and Nirvana (both very good bands). I purchased \\"Life On Display\\" because the single \\"away from me\\" although talentless, seemed to be stuck in my head. I was hoping the rest of the cd woud be good as well, but no it is the worst album I have ever heard and whats even more pathetic is they arent one of those bands that intentionally makes \\"unorthodox\\" music. The songs have no catch to them whatsoever, and the lyrics are worthless.

These songs all sound so similiar and it really is hard work dragging yourself through the whole album. The tracks 'Cloud 9' and 'Freak Of The World' are ok but apart from that, there's nothing to write home about.

I found Expensive People to be somewhat disturbing and random, but since it was written in an autobiographical format, this style is in keeping with her main character. Even though you know how the book ends before you're finished, Oates does a wonderful job making the end somewhat unexpected.

I liked her writing style although it is different and more disjointed that nice, neat and literary writing. You are taken into the head of a demented young man who not only thinks but writes strangely, and that's hard to wrap around, but interesting in that you can really identify, which can terrify you once you figure out the history of him.A few reviews here say the book is predictable, although I was almost certain of the ending once I got to it, I wasn't sure it would end the way it did. I won't give anything away (I learned long ago not to read the reviews on amazon.com before I read the book, as people are wont to give away endings) but I will say this book was captivating and worth a read. Not perfect by any means, but it certainly kept my interest up and wasn't the same old story you usually read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankenbase","review":"I purchased this base for a Savage 110FP 308.

The acting is good and the characters are interesting, but the movie is so slow and then they rush to an ending that isn't set up very well. Then all of a sudden it's over. Are we supposed to feel bad for somebody getting 15 years to life after he contributed to the deaths of several innocent people? 15 years?! He got off easy.

This and \\"Set It Off\\" have got to be the best homie movies out there right now, in my oppinion. Dead Prez gives bank robbery a heart if that makes any sense. This is not a mindless action flick.

Add to this a great Mancini score, and you have a great afternoon flick. Kick back and enjoy the show. This is Audrey at the peak and one of Cary's last hurrahs.

It is one of the few suspense movies that challenges the best of Hitchcock, and actually comes out on top against most of them. The going back and forth on who Grant's character is and what he is really up to will keep you guessing the whole movie. You want to believe him, even though he is constantly caught in a lie.

What a huge disappointment it was beginning with the opening titles. There were scratches immediately visible and then the Mancini title song began skipping...THE FILM USED FOR THE TRANSFER TAPE HAD BEEN BROKEN AND SPLICED! Numerous vertical lines appear at times throughout the film, scratches appear regularly and the entire film has several spots where it was broken and spliced resulting in missing lines of diaglogue. The only good thing I can say about this tape is the color print used was decent enough, although several reels had a somewhat faded look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charade is great!","review":"I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes a mysterious romance, because that's exactly what it is. My dad and I watched it on TV, but it was already past the beginning so we didn't even know what the movie was. We enjoyed it a lot, though. You never quite know what's going on until the end, which is a suprise. The whole movie was just a well-thought out story that kept you watching. I really think that Charade is a great movie for a lot of different kinds of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audrey Hepburn gets lit matches dropped on her? Wow.","review":"No, this film doesn't have the fascinating thematic explorations that lurk under the surface of Mr. Hitchcock's thrillers, but that's like criticizing a delicious hamburger for not being a filet mignon. Director Stanley Donen and writer Peter Stone deliver an entertaining caper film that nicely balances humor and suspense, neither facet undercutting the other (for example, Mr. Grant's continually changing identity throughout the course of the film is both witty AND mysterious). And don't let the fact that the movie is a star vehicle for two of our most famous romantic leads fool you. There is certainly romance, but the film is gritty and violent when it needs to be, too (see my lit matches line in the title). All in all, this is a terrific entertainment that delivers the goods. And, of course, Criterion's DVD extras will you keep you busy for a couple of hours after the film is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish, lively and fun","review":"Criterion is always expensive---it's up to you whether worth the extra bucks. As for the movie--what can you say about a true classic? It's a clever though not brilliant tale of a woman who discovers her husband led many secret lives--and so does her purported White Knight. What works best here is the charismatic cast. Despite the difference in ages, Cary Grant proves why he is Cary Grant---and Mark Wahlberg isn't. Audrey Hepburn, in this supposedly staid period, sizzles with sexuality, crawling over Grant's lap. The dialog is witty, the plot not bad. Matthau is a bit over the top. If you want to see how a clever, engaging movie can be ruined, check out the remake with Wahlberg called The Truth About Charlie. The plot is destroyed. There are no choices of the heart to make at the end. The Hepburn gamine charm is gone, the magnetic Grant replaced by wooden Wahlberg. Stick with the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"d3k edition","review":"The print of this DVD (produced by d3k) is terrible--it is not clean and it has lots of minor splices.

It spans four genres: suspense thriller, romance, chick flick and comedy. All and none, in a way.As a particlar flair of the US cinema at the time, like Billy Wilder's Irma la douce, same year, it has been filmed in olala Paris, to a Henry Mancini score and theme song. Olala Paris has the sex appeal of Playboy bunnies, equallly forgettable Ersatz.Acting has been better by all, they seem to miss US film canteen culture after work. Except for some rude style of speech and behaviour - a well-known reactive uncertainty of operating in a foreign language environment - Europe seems of little inspiration, and the local US Embassy the only safe haven in such.

Both DVD's have beautiful anamorphic widscreen versions of Charade with very good picture quality.

All in all, a witty and delightful caper that pays homage to Hitchcock while also serving as a very stylish send-up of the spy-movie genre. (P.S.: The on-screen chemistry between Hepburn and Grant is irresistible.) A triumph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!","review":"Although Charade has been criticized as \\"Hitchcock lite,\\" this film stands on its own. Criterion presents a beautiful transfer of this great flick, featuring Hepburn and Grant, alongside a scene-stealing (and young) Walter Matthau.The only other film I can think to compare this to off the top of my head is North By Northwest (comparison obviously inspired by the Hitchcockian feel and presence of Grant), but don't think of it as derivative. It seems at times that screenwriter Peter Stone was trying to out-Hitchcock Hitchcock with the endless plot twists, but unlike the trend in current cinema, each of the twists seems reasonable and believable. Also, the plot twists add to the story, rather than being conventional sensationalism.In short - a classic film and not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get me Wrong, GREAT Movie.... but Bad DVD Quality","review":"As I love this movie , I was really disappointed with this DVD: The SOUND is TERRIBLY BAD.

The plot, set in Paris, is fairly complicated in the Hitchcockian mold, but before it's over we can figure out the real crook. (My lips are sealed.)

The problem is that somewhere in her dead husbands life is a million dollars and there are three men would kill to get it. For the men there is a mystery-suspense that rivals any good Hitchcock.

For those who remember this film fondly, it's time to watch it again. While both actors are easy on the eyes, they can't combat the terrible script and its stilted dialogue. Both Grant and Hepburn seem embarassed by their dialogue.Charade does manage some visual style (difficult to imagine a Hepburn film without it), but borrows heavily from other films and never finds a consistent tone, giving it a strange and unwieldy effect. Directors Stanley Donen and Alfred Ziesler adopt a Hitchcock intro and theme (watch the neo-James Bond credits), but fail to deliver on the goods. Walter Matthua, as Hepburn's U.S. government contact is the only player showing some spark.I would only recommend Charade to seriously hard-hardcore Grant and Hepburn fans.

I will place them in my bookcase and they will look so much nicer than most speakers. They problem is that I have not been able to find on the internet the actual speakers that go in them. I think they are available in a set but I just want two of the small size that fit these holders. The set has speakers of several different sizes. So, I will have to go to a local store and find some that fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome looking, but caution buying","review":"Awesome looking product, looks like real books. But the engineering design is dumbfounding. Why built a product for only a specific speaker. And i did a search and cant find where the speaker is sold anymore. But i did find a solution: take a jig saw and cut the bottom where it curves and make it straight. Then a small satellite speaker can fit in it. I purchased the Acoustic Research MC2.5W (2.5\\" mini speaker) and it fits in it (barely). I think 2.5\\" is the largest that would fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most lyrical version recorded!","review":"The voices are beautifully lyrical, balanced. The music is tonally brilliant.

It goes through the basics of guitar playing step by step and the cds are useful as well.

To me, the highlight of the movie was tracks where Barry mixes traditional Bond thematic elements with tunes based upon the Duran Duran theme (such as the Wine with Stacy cut). However, the album to me and others is rather disappointing, as it is missing important parts of the score. Others have mentioned Bond's arrival at Zorin's estate, Stacey's arrvial, the Fanfare, and Bond dangling from the Zorin Airship. Personally, I was looking for the music from the State Office Building rooftop scene is my favorite cut from the movie, the main reason I bought the album, but that is also missing from the Soundtrack CD. I imagine if Capitol Records ever comes out with a more complete soundtrack album from this movie, there'd be a high demand for it from fans like myself, but don't hold your breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry in the Bond scores...still mssing great tracks","review":"While this score is one of Barry's greaat masterpieces, and is now even better remastered, it is still missing crucial tracks, like Bond's arrival at Zorin's estate, Stacey's arrvial, the Fanfare, and Bond dangling from the Zorin Airship. I hope in the near future, the albums will be released again with the missing tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great under a Garmin!","review":"I ordered this to wear under my Garmin Forerunner when running. I have pretty small wrists so the Forerunner slipped a lot unless I really tightened it down, and that caused problems with it losing battery contact (tightening the strap causes the face to pull away from the back slightly). I noticed one of the reviews here mentioned using these with a Garmin, so I decided to give it a try.First off, I couldn't find it on the product page, but you do actually get two wristbands. That probably seems obvious, but I wasn't sure.I ordered the black pair and they are very soft and cushy. When I put my Garmin on over it, it allows me to set the strap at a much longer length (so no more problems with the battery contacts hopefully). Best of all, my Garmin stays exactly where I put it! No more flopping around my wrist.I am very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item did not come as pictured","review":"The wristbands are fine as far as quality, but they did not come as described. They are shown with the emblem, the \\"M\\", but came with the word Mizuno written out and a different, triangular symbol on it. So you really don't know what you are getting. Much more branded looking and not what I wanted. Two starts because functionality is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"Unless you have wrists like a small child, these are crap. I would not recommend these to friends. TOO SMALL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mizuno Wristbands","review":"Like most people, I wanted these to wear high on my forearm near the elbow during ball games. These are perfect for that purpose as well as for using them for their original purpose: wristbands/sweatbands. These are the normal style wristbands and they are very soft. The only thing wrong with the product description is that the \\"M\\" logo is not on these; instead (better yet) they have the modern Runbird logo that is on all of Mizuno's products. Regardless, great bands for utility purpose or fashion accessory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Active boys need this!","review":"My grandson is 6 years old and is very active.

Like much of Skousen's work, \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" is really just a collection of half-formed ideas, personal biases and fear. The scholarhip of the book is shaky at best and the one scholar, Georgetown University historian Carroll Quigley, who Skousen claimed endorsed Skousen's ideas in the book, did everything he could to distance himself from Skousen.[...] to the 1971 issue of the journal Dialogue, where Quigely denounces Skousen's ideas and calls him dishonest.\\"Skousen's personal position,\\" Quigley wrote, \\"seems to me perilously close to the 'exclusive uniformity' which I see in Nazism and in the Radical Right in this country.

It is a sad world we live in when authors believe that only lesbians are having donor insemination.

Instead, they're clear with a wavy piece of color running through them. That makes it very hard to see the color against the various parts of the Chinese Checkers board. Also, the spots for the board are very shallow, so any bump of the board will send the pieces rolling into new spots.The checkers board is strangely colored and hard on the eyes. The pieces also feel extremely cheap, making it much less pleasant to play on than a separate checkers set you can buy for a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I bought this item thinking that the storage tin with the built-in playing board was a great feature. I ended up returning it for a refund because the holes aren't deep enough for the marbles to be properly seated, so any slight knock of the board causes all marbles to fall off of their divots. In addition, the holes are so close together that adult hands must move very gingerly in order to avoid knocking a nearby marble out of its place when moving another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap game pieces","review":"Bought this at K-Mart for $7 and returned it next day.

That she dared to play the Bach shows us her \\"chutzpah\\" and her daring -- which are components of her playing the rest of her life. She risked everything in every note she played.

It not only shows a more serious side of blink 182, but it exhibits music in great versitality. So many FX. and different beats, and different pitches are used (in a good way). Many albums sound have a hit song or two, but then the rest of the tracks, well, suck! But this self-titled album is full of great tunes.This CD.,if not their best, shows guitar at it's highest, drums at it's highest, and bass at it's highest. With great lyrics, great tunes, and amazingly talented musicians, you can't go wrong if you buy this album.In a nutshell, buy this CD. It has many different genres, and sounds fresh.

Probably they realise that they have to sound better in this album now that a lot of band is trying hard to compete with blink 182. My personal favourite would be I Miss You and Down.

It's a big turn around, and I hope you enjoi it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"this is a great cd. it's not your usual blink stuff...sounds more like box car racer, but it's unbelievable. they took their music to a whole new level. buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD CD","review":"THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF BLINKS BEST CDS I LOVE EVERY SONG ON IT IF YOU DONT HAVE IT YOU BETTER GO OUT AND GET IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the old Blink 182","review":"There's only TWO good songs: Feeling This and Obvious. The early albums like Dude Ranch involved Blink 182's music classified as less EMO. Blink 182 used to be punk rock, now what happened to them? They turned pop and not punk. That is what you get if MTV owns your music, and the early 90s would be the best years of your life if you cared about when music didn't suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remark","review":"this is not a review, just wanted to let people know that good charlotte is an awesome band, so that guy Evan Andrew does not know what he talking about.

Travis Barker who i think is the greatest drummer ever shows off his skills big time. Every song has a unuiqe beat. The fills and solos are amazing. the solo at the end of the last song was played on 2 drumsets then combined to make an unbelievable sound. If u get this cd make sure u get Boxcar Racer and the Transplants(Travis plays in those bands as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink182","review":"Blink182's late 2003 release, which was known to be Untitled, was hyped up to be the new Blink 182. This revamped version of the pop-punk band turned out to be very disapointing. The lyrics are changed, but overall, the songs arent very amusing. Blink182 were known for being walking hard-ons. They made people laugh with there music, which was a rare trait to have. This \\"new\\" blink182 changed thier lyrics to be more \\"mature\\", and wanted to make the songs more full, by dubbing in 3 or 4 guitars at a time, as well as harmonizing with thier own voices(which last time I checked, is impossible to do). Overall, this CD was nothing amazing. Sure it had some catchy songs, but overall it was dissapointing. Nowhere near as good as thier previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I remember when Blink was good...","review":"Now, maybe I've heard enough of this Emo/slow punk crap where I just don't care about it anymore, Blink USED TO BE PUNK!Now, I'm not some random guy who started listening to Blink 182 when they were popular (for the old fans to yell at), and I'm not *that guy* who was at their first show and never want them to change (for the new fans to yell at). But, well, Blink 182's CDs were the ones I would stick in the CD player and play when I needed some energy, because it oozed out of their music.I think \\"Dude Ranch\\" and \\"Enema of the State\\" were their best albums, and I've been a Blink fan since Cheshire Cat. I'm listening to this album right now, and all I think is something I should be listening to when I'm depressed when I get dumped by my girlfriend and get kicked out of the house and my car breaks down and my dog dies... you get the picture.Ahhh, I remember that Punk Music thing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"um..","review":"i like blink 182 very much. i have some of their other cds like enema, and take off your pants, etc. i like the way they were immature and \\"punk\\". this cd...OH NO.

Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"This what happens when it takes a year to record","review":"I consider myself a die hard Blink fan, but this album was pretty bad.

I thought and still think they really changed their sound, but there are 2 or 3 tracks on this cd that do sound like old blink. Even though i didn't like it at first, after listening to it for a while, i found that i liked it more and more each time i heard it.

Blink 182 have grown up on this album putting all childish lyrics and joke songs aside. I love the childish lyrics and the joke songs but therre is just something more here. Didn't think blink had this in them. This is probobly there best album since dude ranch having some of the best blink songs ever written.

I loved their previous albums, cheshire cat, dude ranch, enema, and take off your pants. But...this album, I'll admit, I tried VERY hard to like it cause I love Blink, but this thing is just a big mess. Mark and Travis sound horrible, the tunes are horrible, the lyrics are horrible, I just can't stand it.

This one really shows that the guys have matured and have gotten away from...well, everything else they used to write about.

I think this one is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the same","review":"this is still a very good CD, I like it alot, but it is not the old blink 182 way too serious.

It is extremely disappointing. I love the album on CD, but on this pressing, it has poor dynamic range, is muffled, and sounds poorly EQ'd. Looking at the vinyl, one can also see that it is a very shallow cut, likely contributing to all of this.It's pretty clear that this was not properly mastered for vinyl, and they did a piss-poor job of cutting it. I suspect this may have been an attempt fit the full album, but it's only 3 sides. If they would have split it more and properly mastered it, it may have been better.Just stick with CD. This vinyl is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"blink 182's strung out presence.","review":"this cd isn't very good at all.now, i am not a blink 182 fan,nor a fan of pop punk at all.this cd, i think, has nothing todo with punk rock at all.this band should have stoppedputting out cd's after enema ofthe state.the only reason i give this cd2 stars is because of travis'sinnovative drumming.the guitar + bass isn't very goodat all. real simple and is justa filler-sound.eh i dont know, this cd was a bad idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOAH!!!!","review":"I woke up this morning with one thing in my mind, getting the new Blink album! I got it and all I have to say it's like nothing you've heard from blink 182... for those who like boxcar racer you will be satisfied however the little girlies who liked them just because they made a video naked won't probably like the new stuff because it is way more artsy! And this is a good thing! and bonus Robert Smith sings on the second last song i think! but honestly i would have expected a cd that still had these anthems like rock show and what's my age again? but i'm glad it seems that they are finally a bit more mature, and it reflects a lot on the cd. You have a lot of pop sounding riffs but they arranged it in way that it doesn't sound so pop and makes you happy! If you would have to buy 3 cds so you get to know Blink182 well I'd suggest you first Dude Ranch, Take off your pants and jack it, and finally this cd and then you know by what they have gone through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously","review":"the \\"emo\\" genre has gone far enough. everybody clames that everything slow and serious is emo. blink182 is not emo. they are one of the most influential punk bands in american punk history. this album is s step forward for both the band and the fans. true fans of the band will embrace the change from immaturity to seriousness [as all of them now have wives and families]... it's a great album, especially from one of the best bands around."},{"rating":"2","title":"musically mature...? well, we have to think about that","review":"too many experiments... it doesn't even sound like a pop-punk. But i like it tho. you can feel the new side of blink that u have never felt before. its gonna be a love-it-or-hate-it record for sure. in addition, there are no 'all the small things' tunes on this album. also there are no 'adam's song' thing on this album either. so, if ur expecting those kinds of music, u better not risk ur money to face the change of blink."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK not Great","review":"I have said this many times before, but I think blink peaked at enema of the state. This cd is good, but not great. It still contains a trace of old blink sound. However, some of the songs are too artsy and veering to far from the standard blink that people have grown to love. I remember in an interview Mark Hoppus once said \\"you are either going to love this new cd or hate because we are trying some radical things we haven't done before.\\" I think I fall somewhere in-between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This is by far one of the top three of Blink's CDs.

I give this album a 4 because the lack of the Riffs and happiness in there songs but it still is a great album and all bands must try new things. the album would be better if they mixed the past with the new, they have done this with Feeling this and Go.Great album but could be better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh how they have Matured","review":"One of their best albums yet!

There old cd's were fantastic, Dude Ranch, Enema of the State, and even Take off your pants and Jacket. But this is absolutly dreadful. Are they trying to get kids to comit suiced or something. I dont think anyone wants to hear blink 182 complain about life. What happened to the type of music that made u smile and made u happy and made u think that you should live life to the fullest. And i dont buy that whole \\"we wanna be mature now\\". Please, you can still be mature and right GOOD music and upbeat songs. I was looking foward to buying there cd, now im gonna go outside and burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album SUX!!!","review":"It's obvious that Blink-182 has enough money now...from putting out a certain style of RADIO-FRIENDLY music to increase their fan base...that they can put out a cd like this and be ok with it. It's a slap in the face to everyone who became their fan based on a certain style of music. This new \\"grown up\\" album SUX worse than their old stuff, and everyone thinks it's great just because they have a name everyone recognizes.(?) SHEEP!!! Not only are the lyrics boring, but so is the music. It's not fun...it's not the Blink they sold to us to get on the charts... and I know they lost at LEAST one fan.I returned the cd and demanded my money back.

Don't waste your time or money on this worthless piece of crap! What happened to the good ol' days of Dammit, Rock Show, and Whats my age again? Where is the humor? The fun? This CD sounds like like something my dad would listen to! This is NOT punk, hell, this is barely even pop. Will somebody please tell these guys that they are not talented enough to be so serious!? They are trying way too hard to be \\"grown up\\" when the only thing that made them famous was their \\"immaturity\\"!! The only reason i gave them 2 stars is because i have always liked these guys, and because \\"feeling this\\" and \\"violence\\" are good songs, im not sure what happened with the rest...

Too bad you high schoolers missed out on the fun blink. Check out those other albums I listed instead... or if you want some new music listen to some Against Me! Be prepared though, they are punk, so you might not be used to that kind of music yet.The guys from poway who's dream was to play music for fun onstage at Soma and make people laugh now live in million dollar mansions, rancho santa fe i would guess, with just one dream, make as much money off you as possible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW (as in it's terrible)","review":"I have only listened to this cd a couple times, and that was 2 times too many. I was a pretty big Blink fan before I heard this cd. I don't care about whether they are punk rock or not (they're not) as long as the music is good. I used to think the music is good. I don't mind stupid lyrics and untalented musicians (Travis is good) as long as the songs are infectious and amusing. However, I guess the boys got tired of being called un-talented and got tired of hearing how much they sucked live, and have tried very hard to become \\"artists.\\" Bad idea. This cd is so bad. I really can't understand how it's popular. It's slow, annoying, not catchy. And there is a long part where a girl reads a letter out loud, to no kind of rhythm or anything, it's just talking. Now who in their right mind could call that music, and even more, enjoy it?! Wow. Please, go back to your old style of music, good lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mall Punk Veterans Get Old & Complain","review":"Why is it that when white suburban kids get a pop-band together, whether it's Mall Punk, Nu Metal, or Rap Rock, they inevitably make whining albums about how rough life is.

Blink 182 have seen their album sales decrease with every new album release, so they felt it was time to \\"mature.\\" To Blink, maturity means whine and complain over now cliche \\"Mall Punk\\" guitars. I suppose if you are 14 years old and yer grounded for a week, this might be a decent enough, parent-friendly album. Wait, they have tattoos and lip piercings, so their music MUST be pretty tough, right?

It has Anthem part II (live in Chicago) and another one which is a kind of rap, without lyrics, and with a disgusting melody. I think they were under pressure to finish this record that's why the songs are not so elaborated and well composed.The last Cd, which the boys did without pressure was Enema Of the state, just listen and you will realized, enema was record without samplers and all that stupid stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"I have to say that I was a Blink 182 fan back in the day.

And for the last time this is not Punk. Where is the outrage, politics and rebellion?

But as there popularity grew, there songs and there music changed to suit MTV. There albums got progressively worse, and this was te last straw. This album would hav got 0 stars from me if not for the albums two saving graces, Miss you, with its excelent accoustics, and stockholm syndrom, going back to there more hard core roots.

All there other albums i must say i did not like at all only a few song but this album is there best. Travis shows why he is one of the best drummers in rock just lissen to fallen interlude. best song on the album is I miss you is great song i love mark's voice in it he is alot better then tom so go get this if you want to hear blink 182 all grown up and no more poop jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Another amazing album from Blink182. I am never let down by them, and this just proved my point"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROX!","review":"I must say this is my favorite CD ever.It has the best music on it and I just love it when they bring out a new video and everyone else is like, \\"Have you heard that new Blink 182 song?I love it.\\" Then I would say,\\"Duh and It's not new I've known about it since their CD came out.\\" Haha I just love being ahead of the crowd.But anyways the CD is much more mature and dark than their past CDs but I really enjoy it and I like every single song I never skip any of them.If you like Punk Pop type music with some rock you will love this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than what I expected","review":"Blink-182's new self titled CD was different than I expected. Its a good album but not like The Enemy of the State or Take off Your Pants and Jacket. Buy it anyway. You will be glad that its been 2 years since their last record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink grown up","review":"If your reading this, then you should know that this is very different from the kind of blink you heard in \\"Enema of the State\\" and \\"Take off your Pants and Jacket\\". this new album sounds like a grown up, matured version of the band we all know, sounding a bit more like Box Car Racer. I guess it's easy to see why someone would be disapointed with this album(being a big blink fan), but you have to give them a little credit, this album has some awsome songs. Songs like Obvious, Violence,and Stockholm Syndrome show that blink can still make good music, even if it is a little different. Feelin' This and Go sound a lot like blink's old work, which is defiently good thing. I give it a 4/5 becuz it is not their best(which would be Enema of the State or the Mark,Tom,and Travis Show) but it is a step forward for blink, and hopefully it will stay that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink-182 comes back!!!","review":"Actually when I first heard Feeling This single I became in shock... I was like... MY GOD THAT'S BLINK? I'm Blink-182 fan since Buddah, but Blink's style changed a lot in this last album... but c'mon Blink is Blink! the songs are great!!! except for The Fallen Interlude lolll... but whatever you like blink or not I recommend this a lot... believe me you won't be regret when you hear all the great songs they prepared... like Feeling This, Violence, Obvious, I Miss you and an awsome drums in I'm lost without you... c'mon be serious BLINK-182 LIVE FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have been a fan of Blink 182 since Cheshire Cat and have liked everything they've put out since then. To be honest, I dont care for this album. There were a few good songs but overall I dont like the new style. I did buy the album because Blink 182 is one of my favorite bands but this album is my least favorite. I believe the album is good it just not what I like to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLINK 182 review by Carl of The Sharps","review":"I thought the cd was pretty awesome I think this just might be the best cd that blink has ever made if you don't have it I strongly recommend you pick that up at your local record storewith love,Carl"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink 182's new CD is good.","review":"The new CD is a fine work, that really shows what they can do.They even harmonize voices, which is something that they have'nt done in past albums.I reccomend this CD to anyone who likes music that is punk/pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink Grows Up","review":"This album from Blink is a rather large change from previous albums. It likely represents the bands growing more mature and as a result has alot cleaner sound to it. This is a good thing as fans who were with them from the beginning are growing more mature as well. Fans who hopped on board after their last album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, will likely be disapointed as the style has undergone a large revision.The album has a more solemn sound to it than previous albums, much like that of Blink-182's recent side project, Boxcar Racer. Even with the more solemn and mature sound the album is still alot of fun however, with songs like \\"Feeling This\\", and \\"Go\\" to keep the pace to a modernate level.The bottom line? Fans looking for old style crude Blink 182 songs with lyrics about incest, bestiality, etc, will be disapointed, they arent on this album. Fans who, like the band itself, have grown up, however, will enjoy this album imensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!","review":"Hey all you people who dislike Blink-182!! This album is more mature from all their other albums, so go buy it!!! You have no idea what your missing!! The second you put this cd into your cd player,u'll luv it so much u'll want 2 listen 2 it over and over agian!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"comon guys!","review":"hey comon now why is everbody raggin on blink for this cd!? at first i thought i hated it. i kept listenin to it over and over and im getting to really enjoy it. sure its not good fast punk like there old stuff or funny but they took a chance and i congradulate them on that. i admit i really dont care for the fallen interlude but hey i think its got a nice beat and i thank them for making somethin that everyone hates. no they did a great job ive been a blink fan since they started BEFORE DUDE RANCH yes they had a cd before dude ranch you just cant find it but i have it! well i hope this helps go and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"this is a totally new sound for blink. for those of you who have been follwing them since the beginning you know how much of a difference this is. and i like it! they have really matured as a band and its nice to hear that they can be grown up, yet still be as immautre as they want to. the song with robert smith is really good, and i miss you is one of the best. all of the songs have a different style to them, which is good cause you can differenciate between them all. its so good to hear a new sound from an old band."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album shows blinks true colors","review":"This album is awsome. Yes its a lot diffrent but they changed for the better. They probably lost some fans to this album but then again they gained a lot too. Each song has a lot of meaning to it. Unlike their other albums they really took time write each song to be the best ever. my Favorite songs on this Album are #7 the fallen interlude, #14 im lost without you, #3 miss you #5 stockholm Syndrome, and #11 Easy Target. This album doesnt have any funny songs but it was all for the best. If you would like to hear the best written blink album yet then buy this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an awesome Cd","review":"The new Blink 182 cd was very good. I'd recomment it to anyone, it has a variety of songs that talk about just the whole sex deal to actually living without a person. Listening to the lyrics help people realize that sometimes their not the only ones alone in the world. Their cd is exceptional and will win the heart of anyone over. IT...[ROCKS] AND YOU SHOULD BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Christmas!","review":"Blink 182 have been working all year on an album that wont disapoint. Slightly different to the last album, Take Off Your Pants And Jacket, but hey, thats Blink 182 anyway. They always seem to change, and for the better too. More mature with no joke songs on this album they have worked all songs to perfection. Mixing and adding different sounds to the tracks they have openend their minds to all possibilities. Using 3 bass guitars at one time, screaming across an empty room into a microphone, playing the reverb of the vocals into a shower and a whole lot of other wierd techniques to create the best music they could these boys certainly earn the title \\"musicians\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album is one of the best yet!","review":"I think that the album has a box car racer style to it. The feeling and emotions put into the song make the lyrics sound very strong. My favourite song on the album is miss you. For all blink 182 fans i say GET THE ALBUM ITS PHAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"THis is the worst blink album they have ever made, there other albums are so funny and brilliant but this one is complete crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!??!?!","review":"do not even add the words punk to associate to this band. they are pop. im reading reviews about the mature lyrics... i guess theyre talking about such deep and inspiring lyrics as I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this){I love all the things you do} / {I wanna take off her clothes} (I'm feeling this)wow.. im pretty sure that sounds pop to me . real punk would not be on mtv. real pop would not be on trl or geffen records. they are with the exception of travis a bunch of posers who know for sure they would never dare play their music at a \\"punk\\" club because they would get their whinny asses kicked. i dont know why the cures singer would grace their untalented asses with his presence. if you want real punk(not pop) listen to dead kennedys MISFITS samhain TSOL Shai Halud anti-flag AFI"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS","review":"wow this is bad. i own buddah, chesire cat, dude ranch, enema, mark tom and travis show, tojpaj and those r all good albums. if it let me i would give this cd a 0 out of 5 stars. all the members of blink r married except travis(hence travis is the only good 1 in the band) so they wanted to be more mature. they did a great job in making a terrible, mature cd. none of these songs with the excpetion of \\"go\\" r anything liek their old stuff. songs liek \\"The Fallen Interlude\\" and \\"I'm Lost Without You\\" r some of the worst songs i've ever heard and never would have expected blink to come up wit crappy songs liek that. i dont c how anyone can like the record and not liek britney spear's music and nsync. i suggets mark tom and tarvis should go bakc to the way they used to be or call it quits and break up as a band beacuse this SH*T SUCKS"},{"rating":"1","title":"I STILL THINK THIS CD SUCKS","review":"I APOLOGIZE 4 MY LAST REVIEW I DIDN'T FULLY HEAR THE CD BUT I STILL THINK IT REALLY REALLY SUCKS THERE R A FEW SONGS THAT ARE OK BUT I STILL HATE IT AND HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEM.

They're an awful live band. Tom Delonge has the most annoying voice ever. Mark Hoppus makes can't play decent bass to save his life!! Their is nothing about this band that stands out other than the drummer. The drummer is exceptionally skilled. He's wasting his talents creating forgetable music like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet CD","review":"Everyone says how its changed and its not Blink 182 anymore, but no matter what they sound like it's still Blink. They just chose a different path. And it might appeal to some people, and might not to others, but if your a \\"True\\" Blink fan like you say you are, then you wouldnt put down any of Blink's work. I have heard about every song by them, and I've liked them all, but these songs are special theyre so different. It shows The daringness of the band, and boldness, and I think this is their best CD yet.This Cd is the kind of CD you don't get tired of.Overall you should by this, no matter what people say about the new sound, it is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinkrules6969","review":"I am a total Blink fan and have every one of their CD's. This is by far the worst one yet. Yes, they progressively get worse with each one, after Dude Ranch, of course. I am willing to bet that only one of their songs from this CD will make it on the airwaves, the rest is over emotional garbage. And what's with all of them thanking God on their CD? So they found God and love? How nice! This CD is awesome if your are in love and expecting a child. For the rest of us true punk fans, forget it. Ahhhhh, how cute that the blink boys have grown up and got in touch with their feminine sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink losing it???","review":"Humm...

I can understand that they are getting older and such but they should really stick to what they do best and that's write songs that are quick, catchy and funny, not this slow, boring, depressing music that frequently appears over the album. And what is up with that monologue between tracks 4 and 5, makes me want to go to sleep. This album is their worst so far and that includes their first albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pura estrategia marketinera","review":"Indudablemente en algún momento despues de \\"Take off..\\" se sentaron Tom, Mark y Travis a charlar con su productor.Se dieron cuenta que habían llegado a la escena varias bandas como Sum41, Good Charlotte, o The Ataris que podían hacer musica que sonaba parecida a la de ellos y con bastante exito.Dijeron: muchachos vamos a tener que cambiar; porque sino se nos va a acabar el negocio. Ya no somos novedad. ¿Que tal si nos hacemos los serios y los duros? Podríamos tener un sonido mas seco, con un poco mas de percusión y seríamos mas creibles.Basta de intentar ganar mas plata!!!! Me defraudaron. A su disco a lo sumo se lo voy a comprar a un pirata en mp3.Son peor que Justin Timberlake!!!!Mucho peor!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"This cd mixes what made the original blink original and this horrible experimentation with different styles. It's punkish for most of it, but falls apart with beats and slow,long songs, not popular with older fans. This cd proves they are sellouts of what could have been a real good punk cd and not some more bubblegum rock that our youth is fed. Like Good charlotte and simple plan. The worst groups. Anybody that buys this cd better have a backup cd after hearing this for more than a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"So lazy they have to butcher an amazing song","review":"I'm glad that Blink-182 stopped making music, because they felt like they could get away with writing generic lyrics and music. By the way, Stockholm Syndrome was a horrible cover of an amazing song by the band Muse and doesn't even come close to matching the original. Do yourself a favor and by Muse's Absolution album instead. It has that song on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT PUNK ROCK!!!!!!!","review":"I hate blink 182 and other bands like them. They claim to be punk rock and the fact of the matter is that punk is dead and it is because of bands like this. Stop watching mtv and go to your local record store and pick up some old school punk, better yet if you like 182 then dont because i dont want any more posers out there making the scene even worse"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink 182 is the Backstreet Boys of Punk","review":"Note: This is a review of the band as well as the album.That's right. You heard me. I compared your favorite \\"punk\\" band to a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. Now why would I go and do a thing like that? Probably because Blink 182 is a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. I can't begin to comprehend why so many people like them. They're just a bunch of stupid frat-boys who sing about their exes and humping dogs. Even songs that show the slightest bit of potential are ravaged by De Longes grating vocals. The fact that they've recieved so much attention from sell-out programs like MTV and TRL should prove the point I'm trying to make and quell any arguments immediately. So please wake up and buy a real punk album like \\"London Calling\\" or \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink 000","review":"I love blink 182 i own all of their albums but this one i have to review.

Also it sounds way too much like Box Car Racer, but I think the stuff is pretty good now, not worth getting for a causual Blink fan like me, but its still pretty good.If you are a blink/box car racer fan or pop-punk/emo fan you will like this alot, if not you should probably stay away cuz the CD isnt much like Feeling This and I Miss You."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, not maturity please","review":"im sorry guys, I am probably one of your biggest fans, and I like the courage in your experimentation, but (in opinion of course) i have to say that the new style is not cool. The songs dont contain a tenth of the hilarious, catchy, get-stuck-in-your-head lyrics that made your must-have albums \\"Enema of the State\\" and \\"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\\". So, I can understand why you want to cover up these meaningless words with that blaring, droning sound that has appeared in this CD. \\"Feeling this\\" is like a sad tribute to those classic punk anthems that got me to what is now my senior year such as \\"What's My Age Again,\\" and \\"Give Me One Good Reason.\\" I wish you guys would go back to what was gold and stop trying to be so grown up. Being a young punk is so much more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Blink at its Best!","review":"Man, Blink 182 has changed in this album. But, in this case, change is for the better. I have been a longtime Blink fan, and this is different than anything else i've heard from them. The only problem I have with this album is that some of the songs are very dark and have weird beats and intros(example:Obvious, The Fallen Interlude) But, overall it is a solid album. The best songs are Feeling This and Asthenia(the NASA transmission is cool) So go out and buy this CD. I'm sure, if you like this kind of music than you'll love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink at their best","review":"You may hear that this album is not the same old Blink, and you are right. This is the old Blink that you knew and loved...even better. The music is at least as catchy and twice as good. The top songs on the album are listed below.1. Feeling This- very catchy song, good intro for the album3. I Miss You- this album's version of \\"Adam's Song\\"4. Violence- unique song, after you hear it you'll put it on repeat5. Stockholm Syndrome- catchy song about paranoia8. Go- FAST song about domestic violence11. Easy Target- Travis proves in this song that he really is the best living drummer in the world14. I'm Lost Without You- very strange, long song, but strange and long in a good way- a good way to finish the masterpiece that this album is"},{"rating":"2","title":"mmm... blink...","review":"so for blink's new album, there is some pretty good ish on it! everyone says that blink experimented on this album and they were right! there are interesting riffs, some old skool bass lines, and crazy drum fills. so all in all this album rocks! my favorite songs are feeling this, down, GO, and Im lost without you. so put down that Fender Stratocaster and buy the new album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink 182* puts out a kick ass album again!!","review":"I love this Cd, just like all the others, blink 182 rocks.

The boys have grown up and those of us who\`ve grown with them will definately enjoy that. From start to end the cd is genuine and amazing. The beats Travis has thought up is enough to go buy the cd. Put that with incredible lyrics and you have 14 tracks of greatness. NO collection is complete with out it.LOVED IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"change is good","review":"I think this is the best album Blink has come out with in a long time. It is a more mature sound for them and some people dont like that, they say they arent the same funny blink 182 everyone knows and loves, but just go to one of their live shows, and you will see that is not true. This cd proves what an incredible drummer Travis is with songs like \\"Easy Target\\". Mark and Tom also come out with some of their best lyrics on this cd, definetly more complex then songs like \\"F*** a dog\\", funny as they were, needed to take a break. In this cd blink 182 strays away from the more popy sound of TOYPAJ (thank god) with songs like \\"violence\\" and \\"stockholm syndrome\\", and even shows them experimenting with things never heard on a blink cd in the song \\"the fallen interlude\\". Personally i think this shows where blink is headed with their music, and i cant wait to see where else it will take them. Anyone who really listens to this cd cant possibly be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best blink 182 cd","review":"The worst cd i have ever bought. The only decent song is the first track. I'll be surprised if they get another single out of the cd. All the other songs are slow, and use a lot of synthisizers and drum fills.

This CD is fine if you like all that good charolit crap but if you liked there old you proabably wont like this one.

Blink 182 has no place in the Emo scene and should stick to punk rock because that's what there best at. The new cd doesn't talk about doing your mom or your dog, having fun and just living life, its all depressing without humor or energy also as a side note if you say that they have evolved then i don't know what your smoking because i say they have regressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is crap","review":"i have been a blink fan since chesire cat. all of their albums have been really good like dude ranch, enema, take of your pants, but this cd is terrible. they changed their sound completely which sucks. they should go back to their old ways. dont buy it its not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"big dissapointment","review":"this CD is a VERY big disappointment and is not worth buying.

Sorry to all the Blink fans, enjoy your band, though how you can i do not know, but to all the people considering it: No. Don't touch that order button. DO NOT CLICK.

I love all their CD's, especially this one. You should definately go out and get this CD if you dont already have it. Ever since I first heard their first single off it (Feeling This) I was higly anticipating the release for this CD. By the way, Feeling This...great song! I dont know what it is about this song, but I just absolutely love it. It is definately one of the best songs on this album. My other favorite song from this CD is 'Go' Thats just an awesome song with such a deep meaning, and its very catchy. This is a great CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney","review":"This is Blink 182's best album!!! I absoletly Love it!!! They have really great songs. Their best ones are;1.

Obvious- awesome song!! \\"its times like this, when its obvious\\"4. I'm Lost Without You- the last song of the album, but still good \\"Are you afraid of being alone Cause I am, I'm lost without you\\"5.

It has Everything, including a really cool Linkin Parkish Interlude..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The crackaphilly","review":"I reckon that blink182 is the ALL TIME best punk band slash watever they are but they should keep rocking on coz no one can bust out drum solos like travis and the guitar and bass just sound ace together so rock on"},{"rating":"1","title":"farther from the blink","review":"I didn't really like this new stuff blink is trying out. The only thing good on this cd is \\"All I Know\\" with Robert Smith, with the possibility of there newest single \\"I Miss You\\". CD after CD it looks to be downhill for the blink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Music","review":"i bought this cd because i like blink and there sound, even if it is simple. I have played guitar for 6 years, and i know for a fact that i can play twice as good as Tom plays on this latest album, and porbably better. Wouldnt you think that in all that time to practice he wouldve gotten better? Or at least looked up the definition of the word 'solo'? The music is alright and the lyrics are good, but i just dont like how simple the music is. I have the same problem with Green Day and Nirvana, but i think those bands are more talented than Blink 182 is right now. i dont intensely dislike the cd, but its not constantly in my changer. My fav songs are Go, Easy Target, and All of This. I love The Cure, and i think that Robert Smith is great in the song, even though the lyrics dont match his style. its alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink 182","review":"Having ALL ther previous albums i was expectin alot of things wen i purchased the cd.After listening to half the album i must've thought.. its pretty good so far.Then near the end of the 4th track i must've froze wen THAT LETTER was being read and thought... dis is krap..but then wen those strings strucK on trak 5,i truely realised dis is defenately a blink albuM! Its 1 of those albums u gota listen 2 a couple of times 2 undastand how good it is. U instantly recognise that they're musik has evolved(4 the beta if u ask me).slightly heavier then \\"Pants n jacket\\" + a lot less suger coated.My favourite traks r Stockholm syndrome,down,go and Here's your letter.The down side is that the Insert lyric printing is totally crap and you cant read much of the writing. Also not enough songs,too short. (Probably bcos they spent most of there recordin time fukin about). Ther bes stuff yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow..","review":"When I first put the cd into my player it shocked me, after feeling this it was not what I expected at all. It took me another listen to really get into it but once I did I realized it was well worth my 15 bucks. It was new and interesting. I've never heard a sound like this and I think it will inspire people who were sh*tting on them for \\"selling out\\", that they are actually good musicians and they deserve respect. Selling out is such a lame turn, if a band gets makes an artistic change its probably because they wanted to try something new. They completely remodeled their sound, this C.D contains hard rock riffs, with some cool vocal experimentation. It's almost every rock genre combined. --- 5 stars best purchase of the year"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blink CD yet","review":"This is the best Blink album yet. They have evolved from garage punk to a style that is unable to be characterized and eludes categorization. Such an evolution is comparable to bands such as the Beatles and Radiohead. I would compare this album's multiple dimensions to that of the new Savestheday album \\"In Reverie.\\" If you like good music that isn't hackneyed and trite, this is the album for you.Standout tracks include \\"Here's your letter\\", \\"Asthenia\\", and \\"The Fallen Interlude.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"this cd is great. blink has changed their style, but its great...1.

The sound itself is more comlplex than the older Blink-182 music, I think it's a much better produced album than any of their other ones. The incorperation of the piano at parts was nice, and ditching the traditional Blink-182 guitar style every now and then was a good move too. I liked the CD, but it's alot more of a \\"downer\\" than their other music, that's for sure. Definitly one of their better pieces of work, but it's obvious that people expecting old-school Blink-182 will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the harsh critics of this album...","review":"I can see how this album would make some diehard pop-punk fans upset. However, this is among the best albums released this year. While the sound is a bit different than that of past albums, and the lyrical content is more downbeat, this CD is indeed a masterpiece. In my opinion, Blink-182 can always go back to writing their beautiful, vulgar, three-chord music, but they took the risk at making this album and it turned out wonderfully. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because of the nostalgic value of Cheshire Cat, Dude Ranch and Enema of the State. After a week of listening to this CD, I can't distinguish it from the rest of Blink's spectacular albums, because it's a solid part of the history and evolution of the band. This disc is amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Box Car Racer 2","review":"This CD is pretty good, but its nothing special, its just a Box Car Racer CD. most songs are pretty boring and sloppy. Mark hardly ever sings, Tom's vocals arent very good here. There is only one song that sounds like Blink besides Feeling This and thats Asthenia. All the songs are trying to be sad and serious but few succeed. If you like Box Car racer more than Blink, you will be happy with this CD, if you like old Blink you wont. By the way if you like \\"Feeling This\\" keep in mind its the best song on this CD and none other sound like it. others that are pretty good are:\\"I Miss You\\" (but it gets boring w/o the chorus),\\"Easy Target\\" (but Mark trys a bit to hard to sound hardcore in the chorus, which is the only good part)\\"Im Lost Without You\\" (but its too long and has hardly any lyrics, its very repetitive and has the most random out of place drum solo at the end. its 4 minutes too long)Recommended for hardcore fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Blink, but I don't like this album.","review":"I own every blink album since Cheshire cat, and I've been a fan since '98 when Dude Ranch came out. I'm not the type to start hating a band just because they get popular.However, I'm also not the type to blindly praise everything the band does. In this case, I would have to say that Blink has changed radically from what its original sound was, and I, for one, am not diggin' it. For those of you who like the new sound, that's fine. But its not the Blink that I know and love. Even the songs that have the old Blink \\"sound\\" aren't very good. Go buy the new Less Than Jake instead :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink Strikes Again","review":"The newest, self titled Blink 182 CD is the best yet. It reallly shows off their new style of Alternative Rock.THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL BLINK FANS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So what if it's diffrent?","review":"Yes, this cd is diffrent from blink's other stuff like Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but it's a great album. Sometimes bands want to do a diffrent style and all people do is whine but really, it's worth checking out! Also I suggest blink's other stuff because they truly are a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Grew Up","review":"I very much liked this album. The lyrics, instruments used, and overal production of the album are great. Tis true that this is not a typical Blink album, but that's what makes it so good. It shows how good of musicians they actually are, and how much they've matured since their earlier albums. If you compare Dude Ranch to this album you will see a major difference in the music as well as the feeling you would get from listening to the album. Overall, this album is must for any Blink fan, or any fan of good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink 182 has had some growing up","review":"Blink 182 has matured and come people say they don't like this BUT i think its for the better. They still joke and they are their still hteir goofy selves thay just have better lyrical songs and the instrumental is amazing. It's not just groing up they have money. I think its their best album yet.I say everyone should go out there an buy it and support them instead of pirating so their cd will top this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical blink","review":"If you are looking for the same blink album you bought two years ago this is not it. But that is not a bad thing. On this album Mark, Tom, and Travis show how good of musicians they really are. The use of multi tracks and keyboards is not your typical pop/punk style but it works. And if that isn't enough then you should at least take into consideration that they got Robert Smith of The Cure to be on their album. That's impressive.Another cool thing is that in the booklet that comes with the cd not only are there all the lyrics but little anticdotes about the writing or playing of each song. It's interesting to know what the boys were thinking when they wrote their songs.Certainly worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not what you would expect","review":"I think this Cd is pretty good, but it is not what you expect to see from Blink 182, it shows how they have really matured as musicians. The song Feeling this is a really cool song and is similar to the old Blink. This cd also is much softer in places than the other albums. I myself can relate to some of the lyrics in the songs, like I miss you, but this is definately not what i was expecting although it is a pretty good cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink 182?? nope this isnt them","review":"this is Box Car Racer, they must have labeled the CD wrong, there is no \\"Blink\\" type song, the closest and best song on the CD is \\"Feeling This\\" the other sucks and lack structure or originalityBlink has gone from Pop-Punk, to Pop-Emo now"},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf is this........","review":"OMG .... for everyone who says this is actually good. WOW!!!!!!!All I say is that wow this blows. The only good song is \\"Go\\". Feeling this is decent. For all those posers who say this is blinks best album ... this is totally not!!!! Their best album is \\"DUDE RANCH\\" with their old drummer, Scott Raynor. He was their best drummer ... travis blows ....

I had heard that Blink 182 had matured and were coming out with a totally different feeling to their songs. I had hated them before, and I still hate their music now.Anyways, so a friend actually bought this crap. You people think this is mature? ARE YOU INSANE? This is crap clearly directed towards lonely teenagers! That's not mature, that's just flat out conformist garbage.You want mature? Try just about any Iron Maiden or Black Sabbath. It will change your music views completely.

And not for the better. Sure, they've grown musically but what happened to the music that made you smile? What happened to the poppy melodies? What happened to the guitar? And the crazy album titles? What happened to our dear neighbour Bob who humped the dog? I dont know but one things for sure, they arent here. Blink have officially SOLD OUT. They no longer care about the music, they only care about sleeping on their huge piles of money. Who knew they would ever stoop down so low?

Their old albums (i.e. Buddha, Cheshire Cat, and Dude Ranch) are some of the best examples of punk rock ever made. However, after Dude Ranch, it became clear that the band wasn't a punk band anymore. This album isn't bad considering the type of music it is (mainstream rock), but it is NOT punk. Not in the least. Either start playing punk music again, or stop calling yourselves a punk band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the Blink of an Eye (or) They got Married!","review":"Mark still rocks and always will, Travis was always dodgy and Tom has been increasingly losing it. What happened? My favorite band ever is now Metalica, three brilliant bloody albums and then this self indulgent RUBBISH, its broken my heart. The album is not bad if it was by some creepy Scandinavian band or cheesy New York neo-punks but this is Blink! However I hope people buy it so the labels will pick them up for another try, no more babbies, no more Cure, no more flippin domesticity, the only redeaming bit was Travis giving a shout out to his Divorce Attorney, now only if Mark and Tom could cut him loose too! jhvanrenns@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever.. \\"let's 'borrow' Nirvana's logo, and play pop!\\"","review":"The logo on this cd is a rip off of an old Nirvana patch.

Well, i'd say they did a pretty good job of that. Im probably the biggest fan you'll ever meet, but im not in denial to the fact everything they release is the best in the world. Honestly, Enema of the State is probably their best. But all bands have to grow up. All 3 guys have kids now, and they're growing up. The new CD is nothing like their old stuff, and may take a little getting used to. But they spent almost a year recording this CD, and really put alot into it. I can only imagine what they have in store for the future. As for the CD, This CD is amazing. The drum beats alone can make you speachless. \\"I Miss You\\", and \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" are two of the best songs on this CD. If you've ever had doubt buying this CD, take the chance. If you don't like it, i'll personally email you and apologize to you for wasting your money.

I love the song 'Feeling This' and all of their previous albums. But... this one isn't just isn't like Blink-182. Their last cd, \\"Take off your pants and jacket\\", was a good mix of good old immature Blink-182 with a new flavor of maturity. I didn't like the cd at first but i began to realize how well the new songs complemented the rest of their material for a little more mature song writing. I was expected more of the same with their lastest cd. However, I was disapointed. Some of the songs just plain suck. It sounds a lot like Boxcar Racer does (if you don't know Boxcar Racer is basically Blink-182 without Mark and sounds a little more mature and not as upbeat) but this cd just left a bad taste in my mouth... It just doesn't seem like a Blink-182 album. I need my funny, immature ubeat songs too. I say listen it to this before you buy. You might like it, I know i didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"my opinions..","review":"im sorry but this album is not blink 182 at all. dont get me wrong now it doesnt suck incredibly bad though...but it wasnt what i was looking for in blink 182. this album is way too slow and emo. its incredible if you listen to dude ranch or cheshire cat and then play this album its so different. i think this album is much reflected on box car racer. get one of their more previous albums :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new Blink","review":"Though it does not sound the same as the rest of Blink's albums it still has that Blink-182- touch. I really loved this album. I have been a fan of thier music since the beggining and if I must say this is thier best album so far. I highly recommend it to others who are wanting to buy this album. They have done things with the music in this album that they have never done and that many artists have not done. So there it is my thought of this album. Everyone should buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New sound is dissapointing!","review":"The first song, Feeling this, is the best song on the CD because the chorus has a little bit of their punk roots. However, the rest of the CD is not so great because I spend the whole time figuring out what kind of band they are trying to be. Blink 182 has come out with some awesome CDs in the past but this one is really dissapointing because they have completely gone away from Punk. But if you don't like Punk to begin with, this may be the CD for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is boxcar racer","review":"I'm gonna agree with joe on this one, enthusiastically. There are about 3-4 good songs on this and mr. hoppus is in everyone of them. This cd has completely lost touch with all of there others, almost every song is extremely slow, and some of the chorus's and versus' are just plain bad. This sounds much more like a boxcar racer cd than anything. Slow doesn't mean bad, their previous albums had great slow songs like addam's song and stay together for the kids, but these are just plain bad. It doesn't help that tom takes lead vocals in probably 10 of the 14 songs. Number 12 \\"all of this\\" is a joke. I wouldn't recommend buying this album, since you've already heard the best song from it on the radio. I believe blink has lost all touch with who they were and all the frieken pink on the cover of the album pretty much sums up how bad this album is."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW TIME FOR NEW SH*T","review":"To Holden McNeil,I have just read your review about the new blink 182 CD, and im just wondering... have you actually heard any of the songs. Or are you one of those people who onlly listen to what you have to say and that only your opinion matters. Don't get me wrong sir, every one is titled to their own opinion, and growing up listening to blink 182, I think this CD shows that not only has the band matured but also displayed serious maturity on the way the record has been recorded. before critizing an album i'd suggest that you listen to it first.A Devoted FanP.S. Why are you so afraid to put your photograpgh on the web??? what do YOU have to hide???

I've listened to Blink 182 for so long now. All their albums are great. I believe every artist and band have different facets to them. Its just human. Its up to the fans to like it or not. No one is really forcing you to listen to it. Blink 182 has songs that no other Punk bands can even touch. Their music is just truly amazing. Theres no substitution. Nothing else can come close.But just to say if you truly are a Blink 182 fan, you'll love this album. It shows a more serious side to Blink 182 so... More hearfelt songs.Listening to Blink 182 for so long, has helped through alot of things. I truly thank them.I just have to say it again, if you are a true Blink fan, get this album... every track is great.

I went and bought it and it was the worst 10 bucks I could of spent. This album shows the mature side of blink who are obviously trying to be more like boxcar racer.

I was told by a few people that this CD was awesome, but I couldn't agree less. In art, let's say you wanted to make a sculpture, and by doing this, you decide to make it out of pop cans, bike chains, and old car parts. Metaphorically, this album is nothing but that. Just a sculpture of junk. The guys in blink have definately strayed from their roots and adopted new styles. I know this means growing up, (notice the irony) but the fun of blink's music before was that it poked fun at the idea of growing up in the least serious way possible. I know this is a turning point in blink's career, but at this point, I feel that they have turned away from their roots, and if they abandon their roots altogether, I will be the first to abandon them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angry rantings do not a CD review make...","review":"While this is not a review in itself, I have taken the liberty of rating it as I see fit.

Im Lost Without You - great way to close out a great album 10/10overall BUY THIS NOW!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real Blink","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have been a fan of these guys since the very beginning. I have everything from Flyswatter to this CD. I can honestly say anything before \\"Enema\\" was worth listening to. Once Travis joined the band (although he is one of the greates drummers of all time) they seem to have taken a turn for the worse, and this album proves it. There is really only one song I like and that is \\"Go\\". The rest of these are just terrible. Instead of expiermenting, they should have just gone back to their old more punk like style. Most of these songs are slow and sad. If you want something like that go listen to Alkaline Trio, whose songs about relationships and death are far better then anything off this CD. I give it two stars, cause I still like these guys, and maybe they realize the mistake they made."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing great","review":"Well, im not a fan of blink 182, but my friend bought this cd and i asked him to burn it for me just so I could see what it was like. Now I've heard plenty of their older stuff, outside the singles, as my friend is really into blink, but to me theyr nothing special, and they got famous for saying curse words in theyr songs. But theyve sorta matured in this album. I dont like more than half the songs on this album, theyre too poppy(in fact the only song I like is the one with Robert Smith because I love the Cure) but I can see a pop-punk fan loving this cd. I dunno, im gonna stop rambling on about this, it probly doesnt even make sense, but I hope y ou like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I am extemely disapointed,why would they change their style.The only good song is feeling this.I can't think of a word to discribe the cd.I sold the cd after i bought it.Remember people,listen to a cd before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was looking forward to this cd for months but it is a huge dissapointment. it is compleatly different from all their other stuff. it has a boring title. it is way more hard rock wich is bad. i was afraid that it would happen. i hope they go back to their old style on the next cd but i doubt it will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagurizing Nirvana will NOT get you your old image back!","review":"I really enjoyed thinking this band was as good as Nirvana after seeing the Nirvana ripoff logo they had plastered on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink","review":"i am really into punk music and i had never heard of Blink 182 but my friend said they were punk so I listened to the self titled cd. It's a good cd but it's pop punk. punk is a political movement not some love song which is what this cd is. Feeling This is about wanting his girlfriend Violence \\"like violence you and me forever and after\\" All of This is about wanting a girl Obvious is about a cheating girlfriend I Miss You is about missing his girlfriend. So if you are into real punk then i don't recommend this but if you like greenday, New Found Glory, and other pop punk bands then you'd love it. I also listened to Dude Ranch and if i was forced to listn to Blink 182 I would listen to Dude Ranch."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"i bought this cd and i was so excited to get home and throw it into my cd player. on came \\"feeling this\\". good song, kinda catchy. the rest of the cd just SUCKED!!! i thought this would be some kickass cd. boy was i wrong. the only good songs are \\"feeling this\\" \\"violence\\" and \\"asthenia\\". the wrest of the songs are just not blink 182. they have completely changed thier attitude if you ask me. what happened to the \\"I wanna f*** a dog in the a**\\" attitude. they have become this angry pissed and depressed punk band. actually, thier not really punk rock anymore. thier not really any genre of music anymore. and i thought enema of the state was bad. too bad they cant make a dude ranch part 2. that would be awsome. dont buy this. i beg you. save your money for a britney spears cd or something worth it. peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Houston we have a problem.","review":"I was the biggest blink fan until this, if you liked blink because the actual music that they used to play then you are not going to like this. This is different and overall bad, there's hardly any fast/energetic songs in here, most songs are slow and dramatic... with weird beats and sounds... after a while the sound gets boring and it repits itself too much.At first I tried hard to like it, but you can't just like music that you are not used to.I feel sorry for all the people that think this album is awesome just because the name blink is there, other new bands wouldn't have sold a copy with this album.At the end I put 1 star on it, if this is \\"growing up\\" then it surely sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what i expected","review":"umm..lets jus say its not what i expected...i mean c mon, nothing lives up to enema, but thats just me. but i love this cd, its awsome...everyone should buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Words to describe","review":"Although Blink-182 has been known to goof off and mess arounf with their albums, this particular one has shown almost a complete changaround for them.

My friends all said it sounded at lot more like Box Car Racer, and solidly emo, but, still, it's hard to know what to expect. After having listened to it thorougly, I can only recommend that you don't view this disc in light of Blink's past efforts. The humor is still here, but it's darker, and more intimate. It's worth picking up for any emo fan, just to show that Blink is looking to be on the right track. The music is getting away from the simplicity of their past work, and that's one of this disc's most appealing aspects. If you're a die hard Blink fan, this might not appeal to you, but for those turned off by the pervasion of the recent albums, check this release out. It's definetly worth a second glance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent cd , good move","review":"Im impressed ,this cd has some great songs and the band has matured . I like this darker/mature sound with them . What that kid was talking about duran duran should be ignored , normally teens try to pretend they grew up in the 80's and sware they are from the uk , very weird trend the new gen. is doing . I really enjoyed this cd and i think it has some well written songs . I hear the new video will be the song ''i miss you '' ...... What a great album ."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD YET!!!!!!!!","review":"this cd is amazing, i have been a fan of blink since day one, and i have always loved them for making asses of themselves. they used to make penis jokes, and they used to be really perverted, none of this shows in their new cd. i kinda wish that they would have a hidden track of them being asses, but i love their new sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink-182","review":"Lets get the obvious stuff outa the way...this is not your average Blink cd. They have become more alternative than punk, but thats not a bad thing. They also have matured too, and thats probably what I'll miss the most about them. They have always been able to make me laugh and for them to be mature is somewhat of a letdown, but I'll get over it a few days. There are some very awesome songs on this cd. Its deffinately worth the price. When I first heard this cd I was about to cry because I thought that I had lost the Blink that I had once loved so much, but then after a few listens this album grew on me and I loved it. While it is far from the greatness of \\"Dude Ranch\\" its still good. Easily their worst, but still pure greatness. And for their worst to be this good you know they Blink-182 is a great band. Stand out tracks are: \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" \\"Here's Your Letter\\" \\"Violence\\" \\"Easy Target\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great","review":"The Cd is great.

I listened to and have some of blinks other CDs, however this one is different. It has a wide range of sounds, alot of with are new. There are alot of deep lyrics, some of witch can make you close to tears. Alot of the songs can pick you up, pump you up, or calm you down and thats why I love it. No two songs sound the same and there is possibly ONE filler song, unlike most CDs in stores today which consist of mostly filler. You can see a more mature and musically developed Blink182 in this CD. Every one should have a copy of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used to hate em, now they're alright","review":"First off, I would like to state that Robert Smith is NOT a sell out like the other person who wrote a review said. The cure has always been all over tv and even has been on Mtv. Oh no.... Anyways, Blink-182 has really grown up and Robert Smith probably respects that and that's why he worked with them. Also, their music is well written on this album. I used to HATE blink-182 because I thought that they're songs never had any meaning and were just stupid, immature songs about stupid things. On this album, however, songs like \\"Lost without you\\", \\"Here's your letter\\", and \\"Always\\" have sentimental value and are written in a more mature state. I think they've finally grown up - and I like it. Their new direction is a very good improvement from their old stuff. Old blink fans may not like it but other people will."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dunno, man","review":"When I think blink-182, I think fart jokes, songs that consist entirely of swear words and talk about [...]. I don't think slow, emo-sounding music that depresses me. When I got the newest blink-182 cd, I can't even tell you how disappointed I was. This is not the blink-182 that I love. When I listen to them, I want to laugh. I like the idea of Dysentary Gary being my favorite song from Enema of The State. I love listening to a song and hearing \\"your mom's a [...].\\" With titles and lyrics like these, you can't help but laugh. Everybody talks about growing up and says you have to do it sometime. Why? Obviously, people enjoyed the image these guys had before. Why did it have to change? Don't get me wrong, the cd was pretty good. However, I would appreciate it a million times more had I heard it from some new, up and coming band. Not from the three immature guys I fell in love with 7 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far Blink 182's Best Work","review":"There arn't enough words to describe the beauty of this CD.

If you don't own it, you're crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink-182","review":"Blink have had the same style since they started all the way up to this record. Audiences (mainly teenagers) could easily relate to their lyrics about school, girls, and typical problems that teens face. with this record however, Blink have definetly tried somthing different. The songs are more serious and the pop-punk sound we're used to from previous Blink records is gone. Most of the songs sound more like alternative-rock than punk, both music wise and lyric wise. Tom sings most of the songs and has a very serious tone. Its hard to relate to most of the songs because of their complex lyrics. This would have been a great Boxcar Racer record, but its a below-average Blink record. Changing their style was not a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"different is better","review":"This has a different sound which is great. It is wicked good. You can tell that this band has grown up and matured since the last CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink has finally totally GONE EMO","review":"I remember the first two blink albums were both so good, they were considered \\"pop-punk\\", like punk, but not as serious. Then they released \\"enema of the state\\", which made them superstars, and even though they started to lean a little more towards a growing genre of music called \\"emo\\", they stilled stayed true to their loud, fast punk roots. Then they released one of the worst albums of all time- \\"take off your pants and jacket\\", on this they openly embraced emo on songs like \\"stay together for the kids\\" and \\"what went wrong\\". Now, they have finally deserted their punk roots and gone to the worst musical genre of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink on Valium?","review":"I am a huge fan of blink, but what the hell is this? If I wanted to fall asleep I'd listen to Sarah McLachlan. When I pop in blink, it's because I want to get pumped up and laugh at the world. It's like summer at the beach on CD. This is certainly not the album for that. This is the \\"I'm scared, lonely, and depressed\\" blink. There are no songs like \\"Voyeur\\", \\"Reckless Abandon\\", or \\"Don't Leave Me\\". Maybe they aren't having fun as much as the past, because they sure aren't singing about it. Perhaps someone got a synthesizer for Christmas, because piano and violins are largely present now. And what's with the depressing chick reading a love letter? There are some exceptions, like \\"Feeling This\\" and \\"Here's Your Letter\\", but by in large it is the most mellow blink album to date. I never thought I'd use the word \\"mellow\\" to describe Blink-182.Perhaps the album is called Blink-182 to remind you just who it is you're listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Blink's CD so far","review":"I knew it. Always I liked groups like Beatles, Pink floyd and other groups that experimented with their music and did not remain touching the same kind of music. I did not like Blink until Travis Barker jointed to the group and I think that Blink will be not the same group ever. I hope that the next CD experiments more and Blink's punk fans adapts to the evolution of the group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, they really have changed","review":"and theyve gotten worse.

I Think So!","review":"I think in a sense Blink has gone a little emo on us, but that's not bad. This actually my first blink-182 album and it totally rocks. I have heard some their earlier song like Whats My Age Again? All The Small Things and First Date and they really are cool songs and i do what to hear some of their older stuff. But when i compare those songs to songs like Down, Stockholm Syndrome, All Of This, etc. they don't compare. blink has indeed grown up and matured and i think thats a good thing. Overall this album rocks. Blink is definately one of the pop-punk bands around."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLINK IS THE BEST!!","review":"blink 182 is my favorite band and I am on my way 2 getting all their CD's.

They have evolved their music and grown so much.Some songs that stick out to me are \\"I miss You\\", \\"Obvious\\", \\"Violence\\", and \\"Down\\", and \\"I'm Lost Without You\\".But those are just songs that stand out above songs that are by no means average, every song on this cd is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"i really miss the old blink","review":"I can't explain what i felt when i listened to the new blink 182 cd.

I loved Dude Ranch and Cheshire Cat, but when EOTS was released, i was so freaking [...]! The same with TOYPAJ. However, when i listened to this album (having low expectations), I was blown away. Tom sounds better than ever, and Mark is right up there with him. But i must give proper respect to Travis, who, IMHO, is the best drummer i ever heard. All in all, a fantastic album, and a significant departure from all the fart, sex, and.... sex jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"liked the old style.......but still an alright cd","review":"this cd wasnt at all what i was expecting, i was really hoping and looking foward to a cd alot like their previous albums. this wasnt at all what i was expecting i meen if box car racer came out with a new cd and this was it i wouldnt be suprised at all! they really changed styles from a fun pop-punk to more of a serious rock with an emo edge. the only pop-punk style song on the album would be \\"feeling this\\" and even that song has more of a different style/feeling to it. but i would still recomend this cd, it still has sum good songs on it, like said before, if u were a fan of there previous albums then listen to this with an open mind cuz if u dont it wont be at all what u want to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my Blink back :-(","review":"Whoa. I think I'm still in shock. Okay, so maybe its more mature. Maybe its the \\"dark side\\" of Blink 182. But maybe i dont WANT it to be :-( I respect the changes Blink THOUGHT would be good, but to me it sound like they're just trying to keep up with the all-too-new and rising Emo Punk scene. Some fans will back up Blink, giving excuses that its a \\"grown up\\" version of them, but I don't think that's good enough. Blink 182 DEFINED pop-punk. Why try to step away from that? It wasn't the jackass stuff they did that drew the audiences, it was the MUSIC! Bring it back blink! Some of the songs still have a little sharp hint of what-used-to-be, put it to good use next time. Make the next album title \\"We're Back.\\" I'll be waiting.But for now, I'll just stick with good ol' Finch or somethin'. See ya when you get back Blink.

Too bad.. I really do like Blink, or at least I did. I'm a fan of catchy, 4 chord punk rock sing along anthems. This album does not feature that at all. Sadly, that Blink has probably left the station on a one way trip to oblivion.

If you're looking for whiny emo like Boxcar Racer, this isn't quite it. If you're looking for adolescent punk rock like \\"Buddha,\\" this definately isn't it. \\"Feeling This\\" definately has a different feel, from Travis' hardcore drumming to Mark's bass chords to Tom's screaming to lyrics about love (not sex), it's different. \\"Fallen Interval\\" shows Travis' love for experimentation (think The Transplants meets Sublime meets Crystal Method). \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" is a great song, and \\"I Miss You\\" is almost a more mature version of a \\"Cheshire Cat\\" song. But the real gem is \\"All Of This,\\" featuring none other than the amazing Robert Smith of the Cure on vocals! Basically, this album is much more mature and sophisticated than anything the band has put out, and while it's not punk anymore, these are some awesome pop songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is amazing","review":"I am So totally impressed with this new cd. I have been a big fan for a long time but some of their songs were so immature and I was expecting to at least here a little bit of that on this new album but I was very surprised when I heard it, you could almost wonder if it was even them. But they are still totally awesome and sound a little more grown up. I would highly suggest picking this up somewhere (its definently worth buying)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid Album","review":"Blink 182's new album is not what I expected at all, I thought it was going to be another pop-rock album like there last one TOYPAJ. I would have had no problem with it being like that, I thought it was a good album. But this album is much better then what I had thought. Some of the songs sound more like boxcar racer then they did blink. People say they sound the same, just boxcars more mature, i hear a difference. Overall this is a good album, on the i will be listeniong to for a while. The only songs i dont really like are The Fallen Interlude and Astenia. Other then those songs, its a great album and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stereotypically Different (Amazing)","review":"For a long time I was always concerned with fitting in with the popular crowd and mindlessly going along with their \\"Blink-182 Sucks\\" \\"Blink-182 is gay\\" slogan.

Their old stuff (punk with a bit of pop) really cought my ear... the songs were fun to listen to and they were up-beat.But what they have come up with on november 18th really pissed me off...three quarters of the songs on the album have a hint of disco-like sounds and 2 or 3 of the songs arent even sung by blink...its horrible.Ever since Travis experimented with the transplants his drumming is tottaly different, i found it was offbeat and i thought he might even have just pulled some of it right out of his butt right then and there. \\"feeling this\\" and \\"I miss you\\" are the best songs on the cd, \\"Down\\" is very repetitive and so is \\"Im lost without you\\".In conclusion this cd is a big dissapointement, to me and probably other people out there that expected much more from blink than what came out on november 18th.Is this the end of blink we used to know???"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album","review":"Alright, this album in one word: \\"growth\\" It may take some getting used to, but anyone who appreciates hard work and musical maturity will enjoy it.The album is very experimental, and the uncoventional methods they used to record really stand out and give the album a very unique vibe.Blink has been my favorite band for a damn long time, 7 years or so, and this is definatly their best release so far. Now I love old Blink, new Blink, serious Blink and funny Blink, I love everything about them, because they are a truly great and talented band. All of you who say they are a different band because they changed their sound, or they dont have jokes and stuff on it, you dont know what youre talking about.

First, there are only three songs that u can listen to completely before switching song. Second, they have very crappy songs such as violence and obvious. Buy any blink cd except this one, i would have given them a 1, but they have 3 excellent songs that saved them from my bad rating. If u are going to buy it, buy the one with the explicit lyrics, the clean one makes no sense (worse than this one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"credit","review":"ok, so the music world has progressed. so what, how boring/how much would you rip them if all their albums sounded like one. Its called getting older. With age comes maturity(sp?), which is what blink 182 have done here.

Plus Robert Smith(The Cure) provides guest vocals, that rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rad","review":"This CD is seriously kickin'.

But after a few listens i realised the tracks stockholm syndrome and violence were very good. But this the truth is blink have go way away from what everyone liked, their energy etc. I also happened to go to one of their latest shows which contained no jokes...NO JOKES IN A 182 SHOW!!

I never thought they would change their style that much. I mean usually they would have really funny lyrics and be totally joking all the time. Like swear and so on, but in this album none of this is basically present. In 'Always' Tom is so emotional when he sings the chorus. There are even some songs that are linked with each other, for example, \\"Easy Target\\" being followed by \\"All of This\\".But overall Blink is definitely improving their whole music. What was started in 'ToYPaJ' is merely being continued in this album!!! Go Blink. Best album ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally back to the basics","review":"This new album is great...

I really should send this to the Wilton Company in Illinois, even though this was manufactured in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pan","review":"These are fairly good quality pans, have straight sides, and perform well.

They do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid pan, crisp corners and edges.","review":"I was a little bit hesitant when buying this pan because the corners are so sharp I was afraid the cakes would not come out properly. I was wrong! As long as I butter and flour the pan, the cakes come out every single time. The corners are so perfect and the edges are so crisp. This is a GREAT alternative to using round pans, gives a new look to my cakes.I've washed this pan in my dish washer about 5 times already and it still looks brand new. I made an upside down cake that had caramel in it once, and the caramel stuck to the bottom of the pan a little bit, so I let it soak in water overnight and washed put it in the dishwasher the next day, it worked really well. Just butter and flour before putting your batter in. No problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Karajan completists need apply","review":"This is by far the weakest of Karajan's 4 (!) recorded Beethoven cycles. The performances and orchestra are rather bland, and the sound quality is quite bad, with significant tape hiss and muddled frequency ranges throughout -- perhaps if this were 20-bit remastered to current standards, it would be more competitive. Only recommended for those who *must* have all 4 of Karajan's sets -- it's not truly terrible, by any stretch, but it's mediocre, and at this price you can do far better elsewhere.If you're looking for a \\"vintage\\" (1940's or earlier) Beethoven set, try Furtwangler (my personal fave), or perhaps Toscanini. For beginners who just want to hear Karajan's Beethoven, stick with his middle 2 cycles -- both the 60s and 70s sets are outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on Your Kids","review":"The book was well organized, but if one's children are active boys between the ages of 5 and 11, then this book is probably not for you.

I also ordered with this book, \\"Tokyo for Free\\" and \\"Little Adventures in Tokyo\\".

I found this dvd to be an excellent addition to my collection. It\`s really informative, and told me about the first black newspaper in the U.S. and thet earliest civil rights movement which had started in this city long before Martin Luther King and Rosa Parkes. This documentary is emotional, because it shows the neighbourhood and locals pre and post Katrina, and you really the sense of loss and displacement on a personal scale. I have visited other cities and states in the U.S, but there is NO WHERE as unique as the Crescent city - it\`s laid back, the people friendly, amazing cuisine, and unique architecture, which just emphasizes the tragedy that this city\`s suffered even more. If you are interested in African American history or just love N\`awlins then this dvd is a must !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to go to New Orleans.","review":"I have watched this documentary over and over; then I loaned it to my grandparents to watch and they simply loved it, it was hard for me to get it back from them.

Thrillers are supposed to thrill. This book doesn't. The long tedious descriptions of uninteresting characters serve only to break up the unemotional dialogue and by-the-number action pieces that pop up occasionally. The protagonist might be the least-interesting main character I've read about in quite some time, and the villains are even more boring than the protagonist. In a WW2 thriller there should be Nazis to root against, but the SS-members depicted here are not threatening.This is a great book to read when you're trying to induce sleep.

Come on Hollywood these were real, historical people in extroardinary situations not bleary eyed monsters from b-movies! The demon possession scene-Jesus had an echo/reverb-effect on his voice, interesting use of something unecessary. The best film on Jesus is still the one called \\"Jesus\\" by Campus Crusade starring Brian Deacon.

In nearly every scene, Jesus is portrayed as a robotic zombie hopelessly lost in a stare. Christ's stilted speech patterns are quirky and uncomfortable. Absurdly melodramatic. It all comes off as creepy, weird, and without any humanity. My children hated it and came away disliking Jesus Christ and most of the characters. I regretted having them watch it.

Although there are long periods of silence throughout the film, and Powell appears a bit weak and slow to respond at times, it makes an excellent attempt to tell the story with very believable, although sometimes embellished, human settings and responses. The passion is particularly human and emotionally powerful. The singing and dancing at the Last Supper, combined with the scenes with Judas and the high priests, the denial and repentance of Peter, and the reactions of the soldiers, the crowds, and Jesus' mother Mary at the cross are magnificently acted and seeringly realistic. This video should be shown on Palm Sunday or Easter every year. There is none better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful. Ahead of it's time in story-telling.","review":"I'm not even religious, but if I ever wanted to perhaps explain Christianity to another educated person who was curious like myself, I would have recommended this movie. Even for film-making sake, the outstanding direction and story-telling were a tad ahead of its time. Not to mention the all-star cast. Almost every \\"heavy-hitter\\" is here, from all different acting backgrounds, which made this a treat to watch the complex clashing of acting styles that added to the movie, rather than water it down. This is a movie for ALL people, no matter their religious belief. Simply enjoy this for the story and the acting alone. Definately a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus of Nazereth","review":"I think this is still the best film on Jesus Christ yet. I have had this film in one form or another for years.

I saw this for the first time when I was really young and it made a very good impression on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film on the life of Jesus","review":"I have seen this film many times over because I love it, and cannot get enough of it. The actor (Robert Powell) played the role of Jesus very well, and depicted the life and character of Jesus just as I imagined it from the bible. The bible seems to come alive through this film, and the story of Jesus touches my soul very deeply, from his Baptism to his miracles, his interactions with people, his last supper, passion, crucifixion, death and resurrection. Although I would have liked his resurrection to be portrayed more dramatically as in the bible, I still consider this film to be the best on Jesus, far ahead of many others I have seen. For those who hunger and thirst for God in their souls, or for you who need a renewal of faith, please watch this film. It has a profound effect on my life, and I am sure that it will also change yours. May God bless you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie about the life and ministry of Jesus ever","review":"I'm on my 2nd DVD and now it's skipping again. I would buy another one in a mano-minute but with all the new high tech TV's on the market today,it needs to upgraded. Does anyone know if they are going to digitally color enhance this movie. It's such a dull hue and really needs the touch up that most older movies gets. Also, it would be great to have special features like \\"the filming of..., outtakes, conversations with the actors today, those who are still living, with their opinions and thoughts about filming this movie. What are they doing now? I would pay whatever they asked for this Enhanced DVD and/or the Blue Ray version and I don't have a Blue Ray DVD player but I that could maybe accidently purchase one. Remember it's always better to ask for forgiveness than for permission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus DVD","review":"This is a great movie. I wanted it for my library.

I had hoped for better."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long.......too edgy","review":"Zeffirelli should probably stick to Shakespeare where he has a guidelines so that his scenes are not so long one's attention span is sorely tested.

The sacrefice is for the director like a walk into a park. Jesus talks allways like a powerfull prophet (but Christ was bethween the simple mind peole, wasn't he?) not like a man with people. All in the film is beautiful, but beauty outside is not sufficent to analyze the figure of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Jesus Film","review":"This is a good jesus film.

I would reccomend this movie for all ages above five."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE one to own!","review":"I've watched virually every movie and mini-series that has tried to capture Jesus' life ... or \\"God\\" in general. As much as I love \\"The Ten Commandments\\", and the \\"Passion of the Christ\\" is great in its own way, \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" can't be beaten in 2 ways. It hits all the major life events you would expect in a story of Jesus' life, and it's supporting cast is unmatched. James Farentino as Simon Peter. Anne Bancroft as Mary Magdelene. James Earl Jones. Laurence Olivier. Ernest Borgnine. Stacey Keach. James Mason. Anthony Quinn. Christopher Plummer. And Robert Powell as Jesus actually drew a tear or two when relaying life messages we're all familiar with fron The Bible. This is a great addition to any collection, and if you plan on only owning 1 movie about the life of Jesus, you can't go wrong with \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with the poor quality","review":"Despite following Amazon's troubleshooting instructions to the letter, the DVDs to this movie kept freezing and skipping.

I would recommend watching Jesus of Nazareth by anyone who truly wishes to learn more of the story of His birth, life, and interaction with His disciples--and how He was so cruelly crucified, ultimately for all of mankind's sake--then, who wish to thrill at how death could not overpower and contain Him, because they believe Him to actually be Who He claimed to be--the Son of the Living God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus of Nazareth DVD review","review":"This DVD is one you'll want to have in your collection of favorites to watch again and again.

Gotta get it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"J of N","review":"This mini-series reflects the spirituality of Jesus like no other film.

I wish that the studio could have preserved the original master film so that a blu-ray was possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"The greatest story ever told! Need I say more? The only problem with this movie that I can see is that the movie industry needs to clean this copy up and re-master this version to Blue Ray form. The DVD has ok sound quality; however, the picture quality pixilates because the movie is so old and filmed in the dark ages. This version is definitely a softer or less violent version, but it's a long and more in-depth comprehensive version of the story. The recent Mel Gibson version (Passion of the Christ) is more of a realistic and true to the times violent version not recommended for kids.

All films seem to fall short. Yet I think, out of all that I've seen, this one comes the closest to what should be expected and required of a movie on His Life. I think Mary was protrayed wonderfully, and so was Joseph. I grew up watching this version of Jesus' life, and I have come to find myself sometimes picturing Jesus with Robert Powell's face :) He did a great job, some play Him to stern, others too carefree, this by far is the best choice for Jesus. This movie is long, but the time never bothers me, I love to watch it over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tribute to our Lord","review":"I think this is the best film on Christ, even slightly better than \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" which has lots of sentimental value. This is a masterpiece & HIGHLY recommended! If you're not a believer & you want a good introduction to the life of the only one who can save you, this is a great way to begin your journey. The master tapes that this dvd were produced from must not be in the best shape; I have found that several of Artisan's releases are very spotty compared to the clear view provided by others. This has a lot of blemishes for some reason; maybe it couldn't be cleaned up any more. For quality of the film though, you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praises from Manila","review":"Jesus of Nazareth was first shown in Manila when I was only 13 yrs. old. It was shown in movie theatres (not on TV) but people did not mind spending the entire day just to see this magnificent movie. Until today, no movie came close in bringing the life of Christ the way \\"Jesus of Nazarteh\\" did. Franco Zeffirelli superbly to showed the mixture of the divine and human Jesus, and political turmoil in Palestine at that time. Robert Powell was simply magnificent. Manilans are still talking up to now how Powell kept his eyes from winking throughout the film.

Even though the mini-series ran for 6-hours, each moment was gripping and powerful. The cast is superb -- Peter Ustinov, Olivia Hussey, Sir Laurence Olivier, and especially Robert Powell who brilliantly captures both the humanity and the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth. This is Franco Zefferelli's masterpiece. From beginning to end, this production is full of dramatic moments that will forever stay in my mind.

Jim Caviezel should have won an award for this film!Jesus of Nazareth - THE ultimate movie on the life of Christ. Robert Powell takes my breath away!

Robert Powell did a magnificent job of portraying the Saviour with dignity and reverence. This is a very moving and inspiring film to watch, as I was moved to tears during certain segments. I have this movie on VHS and would like to buy the DVD version in the future. This is my favorite version of the life of Christ because everything in this film seems more realistic than in earlier films on Jesus. I also liked the fact that Zeffirelli did not use any showy special effects. It is a shame that they don't show this movie on prime time TV during the Christmas and Easter season. This magnificent movie could bring one closer to Christ and should be seen by all, Christian and non-believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST film on Jesus ever!","review":"I've watched this many times and have given the videos to my family as well.

While made for TV, this is far beyond the usual TV fair. Cast includes many major motion picture stars who deliver some great performances.

Sadly, Berry is widely promoted as a Catholic author, yet there is nothing Catholic about this book. In fact, the book is generally critical of Christianity and Western Culture.

There are better Christian faith and ecology books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Rant","review":"Berry does two things with this book that I do not like. First he talks about the goodness of the indigenous peoples, completely ignoring all of the bad things that they did.

Frick, young Fischer-Dieskau and Wunderlich are an excellent team. Ladies' vibrato is more then ideally maybe and Schech sounds not much seductive as Venus but both remains in idiomatic classical range. As only available recording of clear styled \\"Dresden\\" version in mid-price it is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The voices just weren't up to the job. The orchestra did not tone down its volume, so the singers, already at the top of their range, had to sing at the top of their voices as well. This is a danger with Wagner.

The speaker states,\\"If you play the fat black note of her body/anywhere upon her intricate staff/it only sounds like her.\\" And the word-music Behn composes within this compelling book only sounds like her.She has all her poetic instruments in tune. Through rhyme or playful word trills or long melodious movements of thought and sound, she playfully and painfully pushes words to their limits to confront and question their beauties and their frailties. Behn is a maestro here who understands the power of language, and at every turn--even in its griefs, its failings--she finds the music there. A stunning collection of poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real thing","review":"Behn's new book is magnificent. Poem after poem, hear such clarity of complication, such intelligence, such heart. If this book doesn't win ALL the prizes, I'll be surprised. On the other hand, it's a book that in all good ways doesn't seem to care about prizes. It's ambition has some eternity in it. Any serious reader of poetry will cherish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book by a Good Author","review":"This first-person narrative provides a very scary look at London, waiting for the plague in 1865-66. Although not a participant in the actual event, Defoe presents newspaper and personal knowledge to portray the everyday lives of Londoners in this terrifying time. Telling of the exodus of the rich and the desperation of the poor who could not afford to leave, Defoe gives us a bit of a look into what it might have been like to live at this time and into what a force religion played in attitudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and at times quite grisly","review":"What I like best about DeFoe is that he is very readable and can hold your attention for hours. Sure, he can contradict himself at times and he does have a flair for repetition and while he is not above pointing out the obvious, DeFoe is extremely interesting. \\"A Journal of the Plague Year\\" contains all the things DeFoe is noted for including a sharp eye for detail and sly humour.

Overall it's pretty interesting but, unfortunately, some of the details and head counts will be lost on modern readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"So realistic you forget you're reading fiction","review":"Daniel Defoe put a lot of research into his 'Journal of the Plague Year,' yet it doesn't read like a history report. Rather, this is a novel so realistic you can quite literally feel what it must have been like to have lived in London at the time of the plague. The facts as he knew them, both from reading and interviews with those who lived through it, are revealed to us throughout the narrative. You get every detail of the plague, from the symptoms to the hysteria to the steps the government took to help insure the safety of the people. 'Journal of the Plague Year' is a fascinating and imminently readable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I generally enjoy older books but this was very boring. I was interested in it for its historical information but I found myself skimming the pages. Lots of pages of mundane details. Skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to be a better printer than anyone else","review":"Hard to find manual on how to print photographs and other work, for student or teacher. Includes outline for study, teacher's answers, projects, and bibliography.Covers graphic arts, letterpress and lithography, intaglio, silkscreen, composition for printing, many kinds of offset plates, the process camera, pinhole and other cameras, and other things I don't understand. Many diagrams. One of a kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this one for the academics.","review":"I had high hopes for this book but was regretably disappointed. This is not a good guideline for writing a screenplay. Instead I found an acadamic study of the history of comedy that had me skimming soon and often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgence published.","review":"I was attracted to this book because I work as a writer and actor mostly with comedy. What a horrible book. Why don't I write down all my favorite movie moments (not just comedy), throw in a few populist tips and bind them together with a whole load of other peoples ideas and....voilá!! I have a book published! That, in my opinion, is what Andrew Horton has done. Terribly self-indulgent and doesn't set up any coherent criteria. Anyone who has done McKees course, read his book or stuff by Sid Field, Christopher Vogler, etc. will not be missing anything by not buying this book. He may offer some useful insights but they are lost in a chaos of useless references. The writer comes across as well meaning and passionate but I found his book frustrating and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Helpful Book","review":"Laughing Out Loud was a wonderfull book that I found very helpfull.

This is not his best book, but you can find in \\"The Photographer\\" a Pierre Boulle's leitmotiv : the absurd obsession, that grows up to the drama. A French photographer who has been wounded during the war in Algeria has always wanted to take THE picture and has never been satisfied. But he discovers that one of his friends wants to murder the President. So he decides to help him in order to take a photograph of a dying President. Cynical and nervous but could be more => 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"I brought this blow dryer because I was tired of blow dryers that didnt blow hot enough and needed constant comb replacement.

So this product could be better. Iam not fully satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content, great concert, but we want more !","review":"What an awesome concert ! The songs are great, the band members are perfect. Very good mix of songs by both leaders Rick Davies and Roger Hogdson. I saw both of them in concert and now I can live the magic between them back in the early 80s.Of course, essential hits are missing on this DVD : \\"Take the long way home, it's raining again, lover boy, and many more\\". But the choice and mix of the songs for the concert is very balance starting with the great and unique \\"Crazy\\". Also included are classicals like \\"Logical song\\", \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Breakfast in america\\" and \\"Good bye strangers\\". The interview footage (half before and half after the concert) is one of the greatest i've seen on a DVD even if it has a short playing time. Additional videos from less commercial songs are a great addition to the content of the DVD. The only problem is that we want to see more of these great artists who created a unique music style. They have so many great songs missing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now, THIS is the crime of the (new) century","review":"What a rip-off.This disc opens with \\"School\\", then proceeds to mirror - RIGHT DOWN TO THE RUNNING ORDER - the previous compilation (A&M 25th Anniversary Series \\"Classics\\" volume 9)This band had fewer than 10 top-40 hits. It's inexcusable to leave ANY one of them off. It's downright criminal that the beautiful ballad \\"My Kind Of Lady\\" from the \\"Famous Last Words\\" album is left off this and the previous collection.I know the band wasn't all about singles and chart hits, but this track deserves to be on any \\"best of\\" or retrospective of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super.","review":"Supertramp was another one of those bands that I had no idea how many good and recognizable songs they had until I got this collection. I mean half of these songs could be on the radio at any given time. Songs you've heard your whole life, and might know the words to, but didn't know it was Supertramp. They may be hard to catagorize, but they were everywhere in the late 70's and early 80's. Included here are numerous hits, but my favorites are \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Give A Little Bit\\", and \\"It's Raining Again\\". \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" is another great one also. If you know any of these songs, you should like them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supertramp proves it again","review":"Excellent collection of an often overlooked band.

I recently bought this 'Very Best Of' compilation and did not regret it. I like basically every song on here (Take the Long Way Home is my personal favorite) and they even threw in 'School'. Hooray!I like the fact that all the old bands are making a comeback (The Logical Song is pretty much overplayed where I live) and that hopefully this phase of rap/hip-hop and greenday wannabes will end.I will close with 3 words:Buy This Album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The logical compilation of Supertramp tunes","review":"I remember listening to Supertramp when I was just a little boy in the early eighties. I didn't know the name of the band. I just knew the famous catchy tunes and the signature BeeGees-type voice of its singers. It's Raining Again and Give A Little Bit are the songs I really remember getting hooked on. I just love the theme and sound of those songs...and more.This compilation is probably the best Supertramp greatest hits album they can come out with. Its got all the big hits, the highlights are: Breakfast In America, a sweet little pop song; Goodbye Stranger, another sweet pop song that the lyrics of will play back in your head everytime you read the title (ok, you can stop now!); The Logical Song, a logical choice, this song was one of Supertramp's biggest singles and it is possibly their best written song; From Now On, a nice sing along; Its Raining Again and Give A Little Bit, for the reasons listed above.RecommendedA-"},{"rating":"2","title":"best service 5 star","review":"i recommend if you look at the items she sells she backs her product and offers great service, i will buy from again if i have the opportunity... thank you again... jim"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best Of Supertramp","review":"Great classic hits.

Great Seller and will be purchasing from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A search for accommodation is reached.","review":"I have liked Asaro's combination of hard SF with a touch of romance. She doesn't let me down in her here. The tension and contrast of the two societies, sort of mirror images of one another, is well done. She also realizes the difficulty of politcal compromises and the problems involved. I can't wait for her next novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sometimes the science and war distracts","review":"Of course someone with degrees in Chemical Physics is going to focus a good deal on the science in her fiction but sometimes the details can be distracting to those of us who don't have such degrees or a great love of heavy science. But Asaro's societies are still complex and well represented. There are actually three space-age societies: Skolian, Eubian, and Earth Allied. Only two of these, Skolian and Eubian, are dealt with in any great detail and they are almost polar opposites. Almost because both are really oliogarchies. Here the battle is between two races of \\"improved\\" humans -- one telepathic and one with almost no ability to feel at all. Allied Earth is somewhere in between and in fact, I get the feeling that Earth may be the big problem that hasn't reared its ugly head yet in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent narcissistic fantasy","review":"Do not buy this book. After reading a short biography of Dr. Asaro, I purchased Primary Inversion, Catch the Lightning, The Last Hawk, and Radiant Seas. I had hoped that she might be another five-star writer of hard science fiction (i.e., in the same league as Benford, Bear, Clarke, and many others). She is not: compared to her betters, she only rates one star. She writes like a very smart fan who, after years of gorging on books, movies, and television, now presents us with a collage of her favorite scenes and characters, using formulae from a writer's workshop. This book should appeal mostly to lonely, powerless (perhaps abused) lost souls seeking to escape their painful lives with a few hours of adolescent narcissistic fantasy. It will NOT appeal to the reader who is seeking a novel with an original, intelligent, carefully-crafted plot and interesting, complex characters. Try Cryptonomicon, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"Good read--ties together several other books in the series if you have read them in random order."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Asaro Book","review":"If you like sci-fi you'll love Catherine Asaro. The Radiant Seas is the best of the Skolian Empire novels, in my opinion. Talk about star-crossed lovers, Sauscony is the heir to the Skolian Empire and Jaibriol the heir to the Highton Aristos. Sauscony and Jaibriol have married and are living in exile, by choice, with their children. From out of the blue Jaibriol is taken and compelled to be Highton Aristos ruler. This forces Sauscony to assume leadership of the Skolian Empire in order to rescue Jaibriol and bring him home. My favorite scene in the book is when the assembly hears boots in the corridors coming their way, Sauscony appears and immediately takes her place Imperator. She is ready to rescue her husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sci-fi book series.","review":"Read 1, you'll want to read the rest. Great Sci-fi series. The family the stories are centered around grabs your attention & holds it from 1 book to the next. Read all of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Nebula nominated novel is comperable to Bujold's books","review":"Radiant Seas surpasses her previous novels in quality. I highly recommend reading Primary Inversion first, since the plot continues between these two stories. Soz remains one of my favorite characers, who grows as she ages through the book's many years. The most frustrating part about Asaro's novels revolves around her horizontal plotline, since it might take her several novels before she returns to the Primary Inversion plot thread. The consequences of Primary Inversion clearly guides The Radiant Seas' story, and The Radiant Seas similarly creates scenarios for another novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most peaceful albums ever recorded","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this album in the Amazon catalog. It is an old friend that has been missing from my life since my vinyl album went by the wayside.The duets alternate between Almeida and contralto Sally Terry followed by the guitarist with flautist Martin Ruderman.The repertoire includes some of the most beautiful Spanish melodies you could ever hope to hear. This album is a great way to relieve stress. Although it is a chestnut, Duets With The Spanish Guitar would be at home in any new age music collection.I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is not what you get","review":"The title is Duets (that means two to me) with Spanish Guitar. I thought that meant two guitars--safe assumption. It turned out to be a guitar and flute. O.k., no problem. What I didn't expect was to have a soprano solo on the CD as well. I am totally displeased that the write-up didn't mention this because I certainly would not have ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting mood music","review":"I first stumbled over this LP over 20 years ago, and long after losing the record, the memories of Brazilia replayed and repeated its melody in my mind.

It is barly more than a pamphlet and should not be considered a book. What information is in it is more on the scientific level and not really designed for the layman.

I keep it in the car for the commute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"Arctic Monkeys' debut album was so intensely good, this album was one of the most anticipated records of the year for me. The anticipation was only amplified upon the hearing of the first new single, Brainstorm, which sounds like it could've been one of the best tracks from Whatever People Think We Are. And that song delivered as the opener, but I kept growing more and more disenchanted over the course of the album. By the last song, I realized, \\"I didn't like this album at all!\\" The songs are meandering, laborious, and boring, taking all that was good about the Monkeys, all the energy and attitude, and throwing it away for irritatingly listless atmospheric ventures.This is a classic case of Sophomore Slump. Let's hope they come back with a third disc as mindblowing as their first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big deal, simple music for simple minds","review":"so what, they sound a little like the strokes, killers, and the bravery mixed together and I dislike all those bands especially the killers.

Now that I have \\"Favorit Worst Nightmare\\" I have come to realize that this is a band that will out do their previous work...THIS CD ROCKS!!!!!Buy it yourself and you will NOT be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album from an excellent band","review":"Hype is unfair to everyone involved, be it the artist being held to lofty expectations, or to the fan, who rarely can have expectations met. Arctic Monkeys are trapped in the Hype controversey which is unfair, and ignores the band's talent and ability. Their first album was amazing, and with catchy hooks for a fun night on the town. Some liked it, others didn't. This second album will most likely not change anyone's mind who did not like the first. First, the band chose a darker sound with a harsher edge, hurting the fun aspect of the first album. Then there is the issue that there are nothing quite as catchy as I Bet You Look Good On the Dance Floor. But that would again put them into an unfair expectation category to judge them by their past album. As an album, this is a great record, the music works, tight production, and feels like something to put in your car when out on a saturday night with friends. An excellent album. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW I REALLY LIKE THE MONKEYS!","review":"I always heard about the furor the ARCTIC MONKEYS was creating with their sound...So, i bought FAVOURITE WORST NIGHTMARE...AND NOW I REALLY LIKE THE MONKEYS!

Absolutely pathetic, by the numbers, average acting, sad overall movie. Pitt's character was very emotional and powerful. Convincing delivery. But oh my gosh, Juliette Lewis whined and cried so damn much my nerves have permanent damage from all the grating. Her lawyer was just a weak whimp.

It was a challenge just to get to the end of this movie. For one there is much too much cursing, but wait...that's not all. The story isn't interesting at all, in fact, it's down right depressing. The acting is B class at best. Which was a huge bummer. I was surprised how bad this movie really was since some of my favorite actors are in it.

I would have enjoyed this DVD if it wasn't for those long speeches she gave, some that had no relevance to the show. I get that fans that look up to her might enjoy hearing that stuff, but I just have to say that not everyone is interested in hearing a whole book on her adventures in Madison Square Garden.

The author seems to explains everything with minimum sentences. Sometimes, I read those signs and I don't have any idea about it. Author did not explain it. I think author should expain every sign in an equation to make sure students can understand that equation. Another problem is the mathematics in this book. Many book would give references in the end. But this book expects u know everything( mathematics and some field and waves, without giving any references. The worst part is example. Author did not explain examples completely.

While it is an acceptable depiction of the actor's life, I was disappointed to see how the author padded with book with detailed information about the plots in Rock's movies. I don't need a rehash of movie plots; I wanted information on Rock himself, or if discussing his films, the backstory behind them. Anybody who is a fan of Rock already knows the story lines to his movies.The author does provide an interesting argument about how Rock contracted AIDS, believing it to be from blood transfusions when he had his open heart surgery, rather than from unprotected sex.If you want an overall general biography of Rock Hudson, this is a good choice, but not the ultimate Rock Hudson biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck with this...","review":"This game was a major dissappointment, but the first few hunts were kinda fun (but challenging) so I gave it 2 stars for that. It was almost impossible for me to shoot the first thing in the game because of the difficulty. I figured this would be a spectacular game because I love Alaska and everything about it, including the wildlife there. I was very wrong! Every time you have the right animal in sight, a wolf or a bobcat attacks you and you die and need to start over. Not to mention, male moose can be fesity too and ram you and eventually kill you. However if you don't have the tags for them, you'll get a warning and if you get enough of those then you go back to the lodge. Don't even get me started about how hard it is to shoot a snowshoe hare going 30 times faster than you are.I don't reccomend this AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Dissapointment","review":"While not being an obsessive fan of the Cabela Series, I have been a fan nonetheless. Most recently I enjoyed Dangerous Hunts for the PSP, and though rather short and limited in scope, it was a fun game to play. I expected a great deal more with this game, but instead felt like it was a big step backwards. This time you are able to navigate via vehicles throughtout different regions in Alaska (trucks, snowmobiles etc), but the control is quite frustrating. The animals/game are less than engaging and the game itself it outright boring. One fun feature is the shot cam where you follow your fired round from barrel to destination in slow-motion. Otherwise this is a game that I find to boring to finish, and feel as though you may just want to hold out until the next Cabela release which I am sure will be better....I do not think it could be worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game","review":"This game was a little tough for my son to figure out but he loves it.

His storytelling is flowing and never overwhelming or boring.Yet, I found this book a bit less miraculous than \\"The Alchimist\\". What can I say, that is my first love, thus I will compare everything I read from Coelho, with it.The search is as ancient as it is modern. The author writes so clearly of a pilgrimage that every human being makes, be it in Spain, or in Mecca, be it in a forgotten road in Albania. What one finds, is the lost self. \\"The Pilgrimage\\" is written in a style that makes it easy for the reader to find the same wisdom that the pilgrim finds, the artistry is fine and delicate, though the relief is more ridgid and stubborn. I guess it is that parallelism of physical and spiritual, pride and humility, flesh and soul.I enjoyed reading it, yet, Coelho, I want to read another \\"Alchimist\\" and this wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of the Alchemist beware!","review":"I loved the Alchemist and was sorely disappointed with this book.

This book is too diferent and the others books that I read because all the time gave advices but this book it was different because when I was reading and I finished each chapter I analyzed everything and the same time I remembered something important in my life. The best thing that I learned in this book is that we still our goals, we need to make effort, to have time and the principal faith in God and we are going to do it. Also, it was great to gave a opinion in different ways like love, death, enthusiasm, marriage, etc. I guess that we always need to express what we feel in everything I mean, we need to say everything that we think,want,etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Comments on This Book","review":"I wrote a review of this book in Feb 1999. Since that time I have walked El Camino, October/November 1999. I must say that Coelho's book has prompted many Brazilians to make the adventurous trip. However, most of the refuge hospitaleros had criticism of the book, not only because of the mystical content, but because he did not finish the journey by walking. On the other hand, they also critize bicyclists. I still don't like the mystical part, but he has made people think about the journey and that is a positive point. It's also good for Spain in its attempt to promote culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spiritual story which left me thoroughly confused.","review":"I did not particularly care for the overly dramatic and spiritual presentation of the subject.

I imagine how Paulo felt when he traveled the road to Santiago de Compostela, many good and bad things happened to him. I think he was lucky to find a good guide such as Petrus. He could learn many things from Petrus. To me the most interesthing parts were the RAM exercises, I'm practicing these exercises and they're helping me to have control with myself. I give my congratilations to Paulo for his grand courage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"Silly, very silly. The Pilgrimage is a ridiculous confection of half thought out semi spiritual nonsense. Paulo Coelho claims to have walked part of the route, catching a bus through the mountains of Galicia, in search of his 'sword' in the company of a male spiritual guide. He enjoyed plenty of out of body experiences and wrestled with a dog, which was of course the devil himself, not one of the thousands of wild dogs in Spain.This book will and does appeal to a large section of society, and if your bookshelves are groaning under the weight of dream interpretaion and past life exploration books, then take a look at your Feng Shui advice guide and throw them all out and replace them with a slim volume of the Pilgrimage, it has it all - even tranced out dancing in a castle. I wonder if Paulo paid the 4Euro entrance fee to join his fellow Knights Templar for that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanctimonious BS","review":"Unlike other work by Coelho, this has to be one of the most tedius books I have ever read. I really don't know how it got so widely recognized. Emperors new clothes perhaps? It's tone is smug, patriachical and condescending and very very preachy. The exercises are trite and unnecessary. You would have to be a born again or live the fantasy life of a medieval Knight templar to find it engaging. It is self-serving, santimonious Christian-Missionary-flag-waving of the worst possible kind.....unless it is actually tongue in cheek Athiesm in which case...well served. If not, leave it on the altar...I mean shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Occult","review":"I think I read somewhere the author is Catholic. Can't be a very good one or know much about his faith. I got this book on kindle for my husband after we both watched The Way, hoping it would add to our knowledge and desire to make the pilgrimage. He didn't even finish reading it. It has numerous strange brain exercises the reader is asked to try (and even physical positions, like curling into a near fetal position, face down, arms extended by sides). The last straw was the request to imagine Satan, the devil, in your head...that was the last straw. Catholics do NOT invite Satan into their heads; it is nothing less than dabbling in the occult which is always detrimental to one's soul, and a good source for nightmares. It has nothing to do with prayer or meditation on higher things. Very sorry we spent the money on this book; I would not even give it away. Into the recycle bin it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING BUT INTERESTING","review":"I read The Alchemist by the same author, which, i liked very much and so i was very excited to read more of his books. I read the Pilgrimage next and found it disappointing and lacking the surrealism and mysticism that made me crave for more. The story is interesting in that it's about the author's pilgrimage. I found it long and almost tedious to read through his journey, feelings, and thoughts. I was relieved to have finished it. The good thing about having read this book is it made me want to take the pilgrimage as well - not for any soul seraching purpose but for travel and adventure.

His books are not for those who are seeking a 'good read'.The act of reading his books including 'The Pilgrimage' is a soul searching act in itself. It becomes an act of self discovery. I read his books very slowly and try to experience every line. And it really does not matter what religion you are. His feelings are universal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful awful awful. Just plain awful!!!!","review":"This book was just painful to finish. Pointless new age pseudo religious drivel. Coelho goes on a Catholic pilgrimage, wrestles with possessed dogs, hangs out with magicians and then dances around in castles pretending to be a knight Templar with his equally loony mates.This is supermarket spirituality at its very worst. A pointless book unless you are one of those \\"All organised religion is bad so lets just make it up as you go along\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirtual....","review":"If you're looking for another Alchemist this is not the right book for you... it is about Mr. Coelho's personal experiences, it is written in the first-person, and it is more spiritual. But its events are so mind-boggling that you can see where the author's inspiration comes from for his literary masterpieces. It gives you a profound respect for Mr. Coelho and his achievements. It is NOT FICTION. It contains \\"Meditation\\" exercises at the end of nearly every chapter. The main aim in my opinion of this book is to remind us of the mystery of the world and that not everything is clear to us as humans, but that despite this, it remains our duty to fight for what we believe is right. Most importantly, this is not a self-help book nor does it spoon-feed you theories about life... DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS about its deeper meanings...but read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel book, interesting personal perspective","review":"This was Coelho's first popular book, and as such denotes his evolving magical style. It is about his trip in the Santiago de COmpostela trek that goes from east to west across Spain. I found the travel perspective of the book to be fascinating, and since I read it I have thought many times about doing the trek myself.As for the personal revelation the author encounters in the trek, I foudn them interesting, not overwhelming. The lessons learned are presented in many different books aside form this one; what makes this book a little special, I believe, is that the story involves the reader in such a way that the lessons are driven effortlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"a new age version of the legendary journey to Compostela","review":"I discovered this book during my first journey on the road to Compostela in 1991. All the young Spaniards had a copy in their back pack. The author created a New Age delirium giving the path to Compostela an image of witchcraft and the occult. During my three journeys on the road to Compostela ( 91 95 96) I happened to have met some of the key characters the author mentions in this book, and they were very unhappy with the author's version of the Compostela experience as well as with the use of their life. I disliked how the pilgrim gives up the road for a bus ride at the end of the book, which is a \\"sacrilage\\" once you enter such an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilgrimage","review":"To whoever likes to read: I read \\"The Pilgrimage\\" Paulo Coelho's highly book.

The details in this book do not enhance and bring forth an awesome plot or anything like that. They're just there. Like great blocks of granite thrown by a giant's child, they're just there. They don't form a pyramid, a great monument, or anything. They exist just because--there's not much of a reason for such excessive detail. It's kind of like Stone Prince. Barely better.

Besides that marvel of engineering, both of our units have intermittent functionality, which means sometimes they work but most often they don't.

Secondly, I had purchased these heaters because of the wall-mount feature. I thought that would be cool to have them out of the way. The problem was that the back got extremely hot (couldn't even touch surface without discomfort). I called the company and they said that it was safe, not a fire hazard. However, upon calling two people (one handyman, one person in heating department at Lowe's), they did say it was a fire hazard, that the drywall and wood couldn't get that hot behind it. I was extremely uncomfortable mounting it to the wall because I was afraid I would burn the house down! It just did not appear to be as safe as the company was saying it was.

The series is set in and around Los Angeles. Dave, a death-claims investigator is looking into the death of Paul Meyers, a truck driver. Someone placed a bomb under the truck and it blew up with him one night. Dave learns that Meyers had been doing nightwork to make extra money. Who killed Paul Meyers? Was it Silencio Ruiz, a gang leader who was sent to jail on Paul's testimony, and who vowed to kill him when he got out of prison? Was it Bruce Kilgore, a teacher, with whom Paul's wife Angela was having an affair? Does it have anything to do with Paul's nightwork? The plot and the characters are strong. Hansen is an excellent mystery writer. It's just too bad that there were only 12 of the Dave Brandstetter mysteries written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper fastener never needs refills!","review":"Every desk in America needs one of these! It's not JUST that you don't have to buy staples. The value is in the staple-related miniature injuries that just can't happen. I work in a juvenile detention facility. We aren't a warehouse for sorry souls, we educate our kids on life skills. Sometimes we give informational hand-outs. We have self-destructive kids who use staples to carve on themselves. This inexpensive little gadget interrupts that cycle of self-harm and infection at its root! We try to keep one of these on every housing unit.

Also, the new heating pad has the \\"PetMate\\" name stamped on it, but came in a box that had a generic brand name - No mention of \\"PetMate\\".

Jenifer and Eric are solid leads. Their romance is not super hot, but it feels realistic (much more so than many romances). Jenifer is undestandably hesitant to embark upon an affair, and her journey into love is beautifully rendered. There's also a lovely thread about Eric finally coming to feel like he fits in.The mystery is woven seamlessly into the romance, and there are plenty of little details that add to the book's charm and realism. A warm, highly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific spy thriller","review":"Matt Helm is sent to Sweden to kill a mysterious Soviet agent.

I wasn't so sure when I first got it. It's way bigger than I was expecting, but turns out, this baby can really turn an egg. My hubby likes over-easy eggs, which aren't always the easiest to turn... but this spatula delivers! Also great for use in other recipes that require a spatula. If you've never used a nylon spatula or you're sick of the residue buildup on silicone spatulas... you have to check out OXO's nylon line. I still like my reguar OXO nylon spatula the best, but this one can definately hold it's own.

Unfortunately, his talent is wasted here. Absolutely anyone could have been plugged into these roles to make your average \\"funny tale of redemption\\" movie. It's unconvincing and predictable in equal amounts. If you don't see all of the plot points coming from a mile away, you may not be old enough to read this yet. And I'm a big fan of Nike, but their rampant product placement throughout this one will drive you up the wall. Did they finance the entire film or what? At least it's not a crass or mean-spirited film in any way; it might make a good enough date movie to stay in and watch. But considering the lack of chemistry with the actors, it's formulaic nature, and the fact that it's just not that funny, you could do a lot better than \\"Run Fatboy, Run\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon Pegg Good! ...Movie Bad!","review":"Being a huge fan of Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz (Especially Hot Fuzz!) I was expecting more of the same brilliant British humor...Instead I suffered through another boring, predictable, 'childish-lazy-bathroom-humor' type of movie. I kept thinking, \\"It has to get better\\" but it never did!The jokes were extremely lame, or the humor missed completely; it was absolutely painful at times to watch. And sadly, the \\"human connection\\" that should be felt in a story-line such as this was totally unbelieving or non-existent.Simon Pegg is an excellent actor and he managed to \\"save\\" some scenes with his facial expressions and comedic timing.

The only way I would watch this movie again is if someone paid me $50 AND provided snacks. My sense of humor spans the entire spectrum of funny and I didn't laugh once.

This is great fun, it is a heart warming movie that even though it falls within a lot of the rom com cliches will give you a great time watching it. Seeing Hank Azaria as a bad guy is great, his character in this movie is not as caricaturesque as some other antagonist he's portrayed before so you don't get as much \\"free laughs\\" from it.

Wendy Makkena (from Sister Act 1 and 2) is a very talented and very funny actress - she has the Brooklyn-thing down pat (she's all big hair and snappy wit). John Hickey is also well cast as the suicidal object of her affections. The film has Makkena following Hickey down to Texas to fulfill his deceased lovers' last wishes in his hometown. Like I said, the film is fast-paced and almost every frame holds your interest. All of the surrounding characters are as colorful if not more so than our two leads (look out for the twin waitresses at the Texas coffee shop). The actress who plays the deceased lover's aunt is also great in her scenes. Charming and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Witty, Utterly Endearing","review":"I happened across this movie while looking for another. The description made me give it a try.

Travis drags Rhonda on a mission assigned by his dead partner, but it is Rhonda who fights for a sucicidal Travis to find a reason to live. This movie is well written and directed. The actors did a good job. Travis' angst and depression are not allowed to swallow the viewer because it is matched by Rhonda's zeal, pep and vulnerable determination. This was really a good movie. No big stars. No big budget. Just a heartfelt movie that never bores and makes you care about the characters. I took a chance ang bought it because of the write up on Amazon. It was money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Dissappointing","review":"Here is a road movie about two people with nothing in common who become friends after one sees the other, naked on a bridge about to commit suicide. She finds her self drawn to him and hence follows him unexpectedly to TExas so he can go on a scavenger hunt. Sounds really neato, wacky, and oh so hip no? Well if you said \\"No\\" you'd be right. The friendship of these characters just appears to a certain extent. The scavender hunt is played out by listening to tapes of the mans recently deceaced boyfriend who is sending him off to heal him after his death. The emotions and reactions seem more for plot than for reality. For instance, a person in the movie will get angry and walk away although this doesn't fit with the scene, this is to set up the other person having a wacky adventure trying to find them. I watched this with a few friends and we saw what it was going for but all agreed it had really missed it's mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"I TOUGHT IT WAS A BETTER MOVIE","review":"BUT IS NOT SHE IS A GOOD ACCTRESS ,BUT THE WAY THIS MOVIE ITS BEEN MADE, IT MAKE IT A SHORT STORY, WAY TO LONG , NAD IT IS KIND OF STUPID TO FOLLOW , A TAPE RECORDER ALL ALONG, TO END UP HEADING NORTH, DISSAPPOINTED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"What I would like to know is why the fact that black men do not go to church is such a bad thing.

Even if he is concentrating primarily on the black man, Mr. Kunjufu's examination of the smaller male numbers in the church can apply to the mainstream, namely white, population. Perhaps a follow-up should be written to encompass the entire American public.The book offers suggestions that each contemporary church should consider in attempting to draw the men into the fold.

(Every combination of religion was represented, by the way.) Mr. Cohen tells the truth. With Kosovo (what a surprise) starting up again, it is important that a writer of Cohen's abilities lead us back to the reality of the war in Bosna and Hercegovina.

Don't even read those one-star, phony reviews.","review":"This book is a great book whether you are a newbie player, intermediate, or even an expert. It has everything from how to take over the seas to which unit combinations work best in certain situations. It has civilization-specific strategies, and even a behind-the-scenes look at Ensemble! For all you single players, it has extensive campaign walkthroughs.Not a single page of strategy? Lol! I own this strategy guide and Prima's, and this one is BY FAR better. There are only three explanations for the people who wrote those phony, one-star reviews; they are complete newbies, they have never played the game before and have no clue what they are talking about, or they are authors of a rival strategy guide.Need the best strats for AOK?

As often happens in the perfume world, a perfume house can't leave well enough alone and \\"improves\\" the scent by reformulating it. Reformulations are rarely improvements(or even necessary).

You can still hear the same sound that Rumors Laid Waste had in March On Electric Children, but I cant hear any of it on Burn Piano Island, Burn. The dual vocal rage of Johnny and Jordan seems limited on this album, and the ultra-catchy/sexually pumped songs are at a low. I would only pick up this album if you're a hardcore Blood Brothers fan and want to own all of their material. If you're a new fan who's trying to find out what the band is like, pick up Burn Piano Island, Burn, or better yet, get the Soiled Doves album with it and play them both one after another.

The plotting and characterization were solid, but not particularly novel. The \\"extras\\" added to the plot are in the main eccentric and interesting, as good mystery cameo players should be. Ms. Jance's protagonist was somewhat disappointing--a suitable sleuth, but some of the backstory just didn't work for me in this one. I'd pick up another Jance if I were in the airport and needed a good read, but I wouldn't go out of my way to locate the rest of this series. What do you get when you cross a dash of Christie, a dash of Hammett, a trace of Paretsky, and a lot of those modern \\"suburbanesque\\" detectives....something readable, certainly, but not quite a top flight mystery.

It took me a while to figure out I had to change the audio settings to be able to watch it. The second problem is the movie is divided in chapters and it doesn't play them all automatically.

I am an American who was saved in a little, dusty Brazilian church years ago, and my soul has never forgotten it's first home or language.Central Station shines in its ability to capture the ache and isolation that all people feel. The two characters grate against each other, but as time passes and troubles mount, the hardened and scarred areas of their hearts are what wear away, and they are able to love each other without pretense. The ending left me weeping unabashedly. Tears streamed down my face and my heart felt shattered. Sometimes, loving someone means putting the other person ahead of you to the extent that you suffer greatly.And yet, the pain I felt was good. I rejoiced as they each remembered the day at Bom de Jesus.

She feels obligated for a young boy whose mother just died and after \\"selling\\" him to an unsavory orphanage she retrieves him. Dora's plight is filled with her own pain of the \\"drunkard\\" of a father who abandoned her and the death of her own mother.

It's unbelievable how Salles (and Montenegro) were able to shift back and forth between hard-edged cruelty and enlightening poetry in such a graceful and unexpected way. It arouses surprising reactions in the spectator, as a work-of-art should. It is wonderful to discover the little-known Brazillian inlands, and how they unfold to new depths, which may as well reveal to be the spectator's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental, but still intelligent","review":"This film is definitely better than Life Is Beautiful, which won the Best Foreign Film Oscar the year it was nominated for that award. It's like a somewhat more palateable, less brilliant version of Victor Babenenco's Pixote (which is also set in Brazil & deals with the country's abandoned youth).The main reason to watch this film is Fernando Montenegra's great lead performance. Her character is a cynic, and that cynicism helps disarm us as we're made to watch a little kid suffer. What could easily descend into trite emotionalism doesn't, mostly because of her work. The film's got an epic feel even though it's well under two hours long, and we get a good sampling of Brazillian culture (including some surprisingly incisive skewering of the country's religious preocupations). Overall, it's a film that is eminently watchable (and thankfully never slides into artistic pretention), and I would highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully pleasing adaptation","review":"The storyline for this children's version of Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' is charming and comprehensible, and the illustrations are outstanding, with an almost dreamlike quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storyteller Review","review":"If you don't understand the concept of space time continuum there is no way you'll get the concept of this book, but for those of us who do, I must say this is an interesting take on story writing as well as a good way to tell of the separate lives of the characters. I found the styles of the three different stories in this book very interesting because I've never read a book with such differing tales in one volume before.This was a very easy to read book and just all around entertaining. I think Erik did a good job with it. I would classify The Storyteller a YA piece with some very good mysterious qualities. I love a good mystery, why not three in the same book?J. Gunn, Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaplin's Masterpiece","review":"\\"Modern Times\\" (1936) endures as Charlie Chaplin's best feature-length film. A serio-comic look at the machine age and the Great Depression, it recaptures the effortless spirit of Chaplin's Mutual shorts while toning down the pathos of his previous efforts. In fact, the film's episodic structure is a delightful throwback to his early two-reelers. The inspired chemistry between Chaplin's Little Tramp and Paulette Goddard's Gamine forms the heart and soul of this cinema classic - beautifully evoked in the memorable closing shot. Chaplin's ingenious utilization of music and sound effects is topped by the Tramp's famous \\"gibberish\\" song. No matter how many times you have seen it, \\"Modern Times\\" remains an unforgettable film experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Chaplin satire.","review":"Chaplin's pantomime grace and suave elegance was lost after his last silent film was released.

Management was always out for another way to squeeze more work out of employees (speeding up the line, constant surveillance, trying out a feeding machine so that staff wouldn't need a lunch break). Chaplin ends up with a nervous breakdown, unable to stop performing the repetitive motions of his job even when not on the line. Upon discharge, he's jailed after being mistaken for a strike leader (Communist), gets a recommendation from the Sheriff for breaking up a takeover of the jail, loses a few more jobs via bumbling, and meets a sweet young thing orphaned during the shooting during a melee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: not the original version","review":"Before someone else has to learn the hard way, I wanted to point out that this is NOT the original theatrical release of Modern Times, but the hack-job edited version Chaplin put together later in his career to appeal to the resurgence crowd. It's rather shameful that this isn't noted on the packaging. If that's is the version you prefer, than you'll be happy. The restoration is lovely, and most of the edited parts are available as bonus features. But for those who want to see this film as it was original released, it's best to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"a genius at work","review":"Absorbing the genuis of Charlie Chaplain is always a good investment of \\"recreational\\" time.

A competent but uninspired performance of the Saint-Saens is by far the highlight. But Britten's _Ceremony of Carols_ is sung in German instead of the original Middle English, and it comes off as something of a fiasco.The absence of liner notes means that you won't know what the choir or soloist is singing at any given time, so much of the subtle word-painting will be lost on most listeners. All vocal soloists are unidentified.I've recommended this recording only because it is at present the only one of the Saint-Saens available. But it's high time for something better.

He did not waste time condemning them, instead he persuaded the reader to look at their side of the argument as well as his.The book was written fairly and honestly with Miller adding a lot of personal information that I am sure was difficult to write. He should be commended for having the courage to write this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Important Book to read","review":"This book is truly special.

It can be used as a self-study guide or as a manual for educators teaching elements of logic to schoolchildren. It is very clear and consequent and gives the basic idea of propositions and syllogisms. The theory is framed in an unusual game that makes it much more understandable. As always Carroll's examples are a little bit absurdic but this is exactly what makes them humorous, attractive and involving. The book is also a great brain teaser for readers of all ages. Unfortunately it is not as well known as Alice in Wonderland but it has been translated into many foreign languages. I widely used the Russain translation when teaching logic to schoolchildren in St. Petersburg, Russia. Currently being a doctoral student in the States I try to introduce it to my colleagues."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ain't Wonderland","review":"Some books you read to relax, some to learn, and some...well, some will make you think and wonder and grow. This is one of those.The problems here have been around for more than a century, and yet they are still as effective in teaching logic as the day they were written.If you are getting ready for the LSAT, this is not a bad place to start. If you just want to tease your intellect, this is a great source for hours of amusement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't download this book!

This book has good ideas that are themed by the month or topic; there is also a \\"game\\" section. I would recommend this more for youth groups or Sunday morning groups. My group meets under a slightly different format, but I am still able to use some of the lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"There is only one thing I like about its recording, the orchestra. Dramatic idiom at its best, with the London Phil. But Kennedy is VERY messy especially in the third movement with his spicatto, its very uneven. Also, in the third movement, the passage of sixteenths with randomn octaves is so horrible out-of-tune I can't bear to listen to this recording. Much of the time, you cna't even hear the violin, it is subdued, exactly the antithesis of what Elgar meant for this concerto - for the violin to be a story teller. Well, the \\"sage\\" must be on something, because it is soooo sloppy. As a concert violinist I know these things. Don't buy this recording. Menuhin's his okay (he has a great tone), Heieftz is to apathetic, Zukerman takes to many liberties and cheats by not playing certain octaves - I hear that Hahn has made a recording. Shaham will make one soon, I hope. But until now, i haven't heard a very solid interpretation of this lovely and haunting concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy soloist performance and terrible recording","review":"I agree with reviewer ts9641. Kennedy is very sloppy (also during the final movement's cadenza during the fast loud passages he has upper harmonics that come lashing out and hurt my ears. This is due to a combination of poor soloist technique and the poor distant recording technique. Kennedy does do well during the slow movement and creates an ethereal feeling. However, one can't escape that the overall recording is terrible. I had to turn the volume way up to even hear the violin at the proper concert level but then when the orchestra gave its tuttis, the orchestra was way too loud. The overall recorded sound was too distant and muffled and lacked details. However, the orchestral performance is very good, so I give this 2 stars instead of 1. I'm going to try the Heifetz, Hilary Hahn and Tasmin Little recordings soon and I will update this review with comparisons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good cd","review":"I can sense a little hardcore on this cd but overall it sounds pretty much like metal.

Really good cd for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"from what i heard from this album im so surprised that a band is combining elements from mostly metal/hardcore and the punk edge is awesome too - i know good metal when i hear it and this rapes any of those new metalcore bands, a nice surprise from a young talented band - the music is full on metal awesome riffs, melodies , solos - and vocals go from punk - i dont even know there just all over the place !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"This, as far as my opinion goes, is the most talented and original band to surface in the last 5, maybe 10 years. Incredible album, mind-blowing live show. These guys don't miss; each member is a complete master of his craft. The album 'Kezia' works as sort of a situationist-concept album. Kezia is a girl to be executed and the album tells the story through 3 perspectives. Prision Guard; first 3 songs, Priest; second 3, Kezia; last 3, and the Finale. In general, I'd say the first half of the album is more pummeling and the second half more melodic, but the entire thing, every bleeding second, is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Rocks","review":"After hearing just one song online, I knew I had to order the album. Covering influences as diverse as thrash, emo, punk, prog rock, math rock, etc. Protest the hero blend them all to create a really unique and compelling sound.The album missed out on a star because of production finish and the fact that they definately have a better album in them. I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtuoso's","review":"Heres a completely unexpected album. Protest the Hero blew me away when i first heard \\"Nautical\\" on purevolume. It was technically proficient, and gave me that awesome feel you get when you hear something genuinely cool. I bought their cd the other day, and listenning to the whole thing, I instantly decided that this is one of my favorite cd's of all time. Every song feels epic and has constant time change ups. And dont even get me started on the drum work....this guy is tight. If you are a fan of Avenged Sevenfold's \\"Waking the Fallen\\", then you will definetaly love this. I think a new sub-genre of \\"epic-metal\\" has began. Buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kezia Review","review":"This album is an epic masterpiece. The band has increased the complexity and metal influence 10 fold from their last album and they still retain their punk speed. Be warned, the album is A LOT heavier than a Calculated Use of Sound. It has extensive use of double kick bass and is more similar to metal than punk in that respect, but it is definitely a must have if you appreciate punk metal or appreciate music in either genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Purchase","review":"After picking up on the band Misery Signals a month or two ago, I went in search of similar bands and found Protest the Hero. If you're into overlaid rhythms that are complex, PTH is a solid investment. Some of my favorites on the album include Heretics and Killers, She Who Mars the Skin of Gods, The Divine Suicide of K., and A Plateful of our Dead. The entire album is a solid listen from start to finish, and truly shows off their instrumental skill via their entwined melodies. However, perhaps best of all, the band has a lead singer that doesn't rely on screaming! A refreshing change from the generic, bland, gutteral screams of the achetypal metalcore-esque band. Nice math rock sound with heavy undertones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good place to start","review":"Works pretty well on red slime but didn't touch the hair algae. Admittedly my tank has an over-abundance of algae but I was hoping for a little more. I like that this product is all natural and it did have some effect on the red slime algae so I think it's a great starting point in the algae battle. It did not hurt my inverts, fish or corals (soft and hard)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Past The Sound - It's A Treasure","review":"Yes, they are old recordings, but that's part of the appeal. I've spent twenty years listening to the digitally recorded Mitsuko Uchida and Daniel Barenboim sets, so this took some getting used to for the fact that it's more distantly mic'd and with thinner frequency response, but after a few listenings as background music, they become light, lovely raindrops. A plus is that it includes works that are often neglected in sonata collections, like the little pieces Mozart wrote when he was five and six years old. This may not be your first choice unless you like to start with old recordings and move to newer ones, but if you are collecting more than one set, don't miss Gieseking."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy the sound of static, buy this!!","review":"The sound quality is so poor in this recording that it is difficult at best to enjoy. I suppose if you play your music at extremely low volume, or are used to listening on a poor quality stereo (think victrola sound), then maybe you could get past the static noise. Quite a shame, considering what a masterfully performed, complete set this makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a balancing meditation","review":"I really like the convenience of various time options, because sometimes you just have 10 minutes! Several chakra cd recordings do not offer shorter times. This is a great chakra balancing CD, and worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to \\"treat\\" yourself","review":"I've been on an Akshara Weave CD kick recently. The description for this CD hooked me and I am so happy it did! The meditation I did while listening to this CD was awesome. The first track, I was able to easily follow which chakra was being targeted by the music. After that, I'm afraid I had trouble hearing the \\"key\\" that would tell me the music was switching to another chakra. But that's OK. I quickly gave up trying to track the music and went through each of my chakras at the pace that felt right to me. Wonderful! Did I mention I am a huge fan of Akshara Weave?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next step in training evolution","review":"Donaldson should be required reading for all trainers. Blanche Saunders, the Monks and Carol Lea Benjamin were fine in their day, but it's time to take advantage of the latest, best learning theory out there.Donaldson puts that theory at our fingertips. We used to think, many decades ago, that the only way to train a dog was through force. Pack and dominance theory changed a lot of that for the better in the 60's and 70's; now it's time for the next stop in our evolution as trainers. This book is not about some pie-in-the-sky ideas -- it's as practical and essential as food and water.The only thing I would take points off for is the same thing some other readers have mentioned: the writing style is a little disorganized. Overall, however, this is a wonderful book. As it circulates through the dog-owning population, I'm sure it will become a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical guide for most aggressive dogs","review":"Desensitizing dogs with distraction and extremely gradual socialization is a joke for most owners with aggressive behaviour dogs.The problem with this its impossible to control the environment around the dog sufficiently to control its exposure.It is unrealistic to expect a dogs to be buddy's with every dog that passes by.Too many trainers are hyping tactics designed to increase their puppyclass sizes instead of practical advice for walking a dog for exercise.This book is great advice e for owners with way too much time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Money and Time","review":"I was so excited to receive this book and couldn't wait to start reading it. I was totally bored within minutes. The author is extremely disorganized and critical of what seems like the entire world. The use of so many big, obscure words is totally unneccesary and pompous. I currently own six dogs of various breeds and have been involved in animal rescue and training for many years. I got the feeling that the author really doesn't know dogs at all! I wasted my money and will probably throw this book away because I wouldn't want to sell it to anyone and have them disappointed too. I wouldn't have given it a star at all, but that wasn't an available option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unprofessional!","review":"Author seems unaccredited and ignorant. She is forcing her opinion on us without any concrete facts. While I agree with her on most topics, they are just plain common sense. But it would be a better book if she had facts and statistics to back up her claims.Please do not use the word \\"cuz\\"; do not use more than 1 exclamation point, or random capitalization.This book is very hard to read. It is hard to decipher whether she is for or against something, it varies from paragraph to paragraph.I only read this, for a class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical","review":"Because I do not have a degree in dog psychology I found this book to be very difficult to understand. If the author had written it to the common dog owner it would have been useful. I'll donate my copy to the library and maybe I can re-claim my loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy ,save your time and money","review":"According to Jean Donaldson, anything that you do different from her style of training is wrong. She will refer to you as an amatuer trainer if you use any style of training other than bribery with food to train the dog. My experience in training is with Hunting retrievers, and obedience training, along with some field work with a Police Service dogs. Now if you want to walk around smelling like a big piece of liver, and have the dog pretty much run the house, than buy her book, and get set for a uncontrollable dog. She is jumping on the band wagon of another trainer(name wont be mentioned) who thinks the dogs should train the owner. Many of which have attended my training course, and the owners were much happier now that they had a trained dog. Donaldson needs to get out of the office, and into the field of training, real dogs, real life situations with dogs. So Save your money, and invest the money on a good training book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required before people are allowed dogs!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a trusted trainer after my rescue cattledog bit my mother-in-law. I chose to order it from the library instead of rushing out to buy it...my mistake. That dog bit again (perfectly predictable--there really is NO such thing as an \\"unprovoked\\" bite) and I chose to re-home her because I did not have the dog-experience to keep her safe. I'm telling you this cautionary tale to emphasize that Culture Clash WILL teach you how to help your dog adapt to living with humans. Jean Donaldson has the dog's best interest at heart, and her advice shoots from the hip. If you prefer your dog advice sugar-coated for easier swallowing, keep reading about \\"alpha rolls\\"; if you're ready for reality, buy this book. One warning: get a second copy now, because you'll want to loan it to friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly outstanding book on dog training and psychology","review":"Whether you are a seasoned dog trainer or a new dog owner, you will absolutely benefit from reading this book. Jean Donaldson displays a true understanding of the canine mind, combined with a common-sense and practical approach to dog training. Most importantly, her writing style is entertaining enough to keep you reading zealously til the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading about this book on a couple of e-mail lists I subscribe to, I decided to see what all the buzz was about. I was very disappointed in what I found. I was so put off by the author's arrogant attitude -- I'm right, anyone who thinks differently is stupid -- it was difficult to get through the entire book. As others have already pointed out, the lack of an index makes the book useless as a reference. And it's scary to think that an inexperienced owner with a really aggressive dog could be guided by her recommendations. My favorite books on dog training are written by Carol Lea Benjamin, and Donaldson's book has done nothing to change my mind about recommending Carol's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad author with good ideas","review":"Jean Donaldson is the most arrogant, condescending, and insulting author I've ever read. If you read this book BEFORE owning a dog you're safe but anyone who has had dogs in the past should be prepared to be attacked for past \\"sins\\".Donaldson's ideas are terrific. Her methodology is completely logical- she doesn't need to resort to name calling to convince readers that she's right. Obviously we're reading the book because we're looking for a new way of doing things, we don't need to be scolded on every page for the way we used to do things (which by the way was taught to us by professionals like Donaldson - if anyone deserves to be scolded it's her own colleagues!)If you're like me, and have trained dogs in the past using the \\"method du jour\\", I'd skip this book and find a different Positive Reinforcement book."},{"rating":"2","title":"REQUIRED K9 READING","review":"REQUIRED K9 READING and the FIRST BOOK you should thoroughly review on you canine companions.

It may have some good information in it if you can stomach reading through all the negativity. I grew very tired of reading how \\"stupid\\" us people are. She literally repeatedly used the word stupid and I found it insulting to the point that I quit reading the book and I am returning it to the bookstore. Any useful information would be difficult to refer back to due to the fact that the table of contents is so vague. You have to read through information that I found tiresome because I don't have any interest, for example, in reading in detail how to teach my dogs to play tug of war. Jean Donaldson has very strong opinions, and as you can see, I have very strong opinions about the negative way that she chose to write her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In praise of praise training","review":"The only thing amazing about Ms Donaldson's book is that anyone would put up with her caustic and defensive writing style. She puts forth nothing new for us behaviorists and trainers though still manages to say it in a way that is both condescending and pretentious. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Methodology Clash","review":"The Culure Clash by Jean Donaldson can be broken up into three parts:The first of which is a statistical rendering of dog psychology which, to me, is very dry. Although well written, the first several chapters do little to actually shed any light on what really motivates canines or how to predict their behavior. The second third of the book over-emphasizes the need to positively reinforce behavior with treats and walks to the point where the text degenerates into kindergarten-level drivel. The third portion of the book seems to have been written with a thesaurus in hand, citing the pitfalls of under-socialized dogs while never advising any useful socialization techniques for adult dogs. Given the high accolades afforded to this book and the recommendation to read it given by trusted dog trainers, I was disappointed in the lack of useful content.The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending and downright insulting.","review":"I was really put off by the tone of this book even in the first 10 pages. It's clear that Jean knows a lot about dogs, but she comes across as a holier-than-thou know it all that does nothing but ridicule anyone with a point of view other than her own. What is the point of insulting your readers who are trying to learn something new? To that end this book is worthless.Much better alternatives would be the excellent books by The Monks of New Skete: \\"How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend: The Classic Training Manual for Dog Owners (Revised & Updated Edition)\\" and \\"The Art of Raising a Puppy\\" They spend less time extolling the author's own points of view and instead actually talk about dogs in a way that doesn't make the reader feel like an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"was not happy with Culture Clash","review":"I was so excited to get this book and after calling all of the local book stores and finding out they were all out, I had to order it and wait 2 long weeks to recieve it!!

Let me say up front, I have not read this book. But I am using a behaviorist from the most reputable vetrinary school in this region. Since my initial consultation, my dog has attacked me numerous times, biting me two times severely. He challenges me constantly.I am medicating my dog with Paxil, although there are no efficacy studies for aggressive dogs. The trainer who called all this stuff a \\"fad\\" in his review of this book is voicing my fears when I started this \\"non-violent\\" technique. If my dog could laugh, he would laugh at me when I drag him to his quiet room after he attacks me.Maybe for some dogs, the new \\"non-violent\\" approach works, but for highly aggressive dogs, I believe this approach might be very dangerous to the owner and fatal to the dog.And I am sick of trainers dismissing the other techniques as dated, or cruel, or medievel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horse- what!","review":"The reader who gave this book 1 star and called it horsehockey recommends books by Carol Benjamin and The Monks of New Skete. Both of these authors condone violence against dogs in the name of \\"training\\" and I do NOT recommend them for anyone who does not want to hit, strangle or hang their dog up by the neck until it passes out.Culture Clash is for intelligent readers who want to train with gentleness, using proven training techniques. They WORK, but only if you use them properly.Anyone who can't get a dog to learn using these techniques is doing it wrong, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female late teens from Dallas, TX","review":"When I read this book I felt I was being lectured to. The author seemed to think that only she knew the right way to train dogs. She presented a good argument for what she said but there were so many contradictions in her book that I became confused and doubtful. The reviews to the book on amazon.com were so different it added to my confusion. The good part is that it caused me to do more reading to understand what was being said. I found other books that spent all their time telling how wonderful their way of training was with little or no practicle advice. The books that helped to get a better understanding and didn't spend all their time saying how wonderful they are were written by Carol Benjamin, The Monks of New Kete, Karen Pryor and a new author Captain Haggerty who is very funny and explains so many different things."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's not the head of Behavior & Training for nothing!!","review":"This book is at the very top of my must read list for clients. I completely disagree with the previous review. Jean donaldson is one of the best, most experienced trainers out there. She is also in charge of the Behavior & Training course at the SF SPCA. To put it bluntly, she knows her dogs! As a professional dog trainer who works with aggressive dogs regularly I can tell you that her methods DO work. If the other reviewer had problems it was probably due to inacurrate application of the methods. After all, training is a mechanical skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"A new way of understanding dogs from the dog's point of view. The book is brimming with empathy, humor, and understanding. Jean Donaldson is above all a very PRACTICAL lady - and her approach is very functional - it works! I particularly liked the insight that biting is natural behavior for dogs, i.e. that even the \\"nicest\\" dog will bite and it is therefore extremely important to train bite inhibition with ALL dogs. Donaldson also reminds us that dogs have no sense of morals and that they see a large percentage of the world as \\"chew-toys\\" or \\"food\\" (even your italian shoes and gum on the sidewalk), unless they are TAUGHT otherwise. The last section on practical training is brief, but extremely well written - if you follow this program you will end up with a recall proofed against virtually everything (yes, I've tried it). I recommend \\"The Culture Clash\\" to everyone interested in dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I am furious at myself that I wasted my money on this book!

I read this book and learned a lot about my dog, as well as my own training approach. The dog and myself are having relapses, so I will be revisiting it PRONTO. This book is helpful.

I can't recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Only Ever Read One Dog Book...","review":"...this should be the one. Jean expresses what many of us have suspected for years about the relationships between dogs and people. She gives the reader a dog's eye view of things, which we can use to decipher why dogs often have such a hard time fitting in to a human household, and what we can do to help them adjust - without the need for punishment and fear. Read this if you love your dog. If you are disappointed with your dog's behavior, and don't know what to do, understanding is the first step - this book will get you there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs just want to have fun!","review":"This is the best first book for any new dog owner. It helps one understand the mind of a dog. Once the basics of \\"dogology\\" are down, the owner can move on to training the new pet.

Using her methods and insights, my husband and I raised the best behaved and happiest dog I know (I'm not biased or anything :). But that aside, her points were pivotal in our mindset in raising our dog. I read everything out when we decided to get a puppy and Jean's book was the easiest read and best book to guide our training. My husband still refers to her book 7 years later. We've loaned it out so many times that it's dog-eared. I'm so glad she's put out a 2nd edition because the last person never returned my original. We've got a new puppy to raise and I'm so glad I'll have the latest edition to brush up my mindset.

It totally blew my mind. Previously I had only known of the \\"jerk\\" method of dog training. I never imagined that dogs could be trained using positive methods. The fact that the idea of operant conditioning etc were first proposed by BF Skinner in the 50's makes me wonder why it took so long to make it to the main stream.I have used many of the methods I learned in this book with my two adopted dogs, one of which is aggressive, and have had outstanding results.IMO this and Karen Pryor's \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\" are the best books you can ever read about dog psycology and training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just opinions & where is the science?","review":"After reading just 10 pages, I decided that it would be waste of my time to read more. First, she states that dogs are incapable of observational learning. Well, I just wrote an article that talks about observational learning in dogs by citing scientific peer review journals. So, J. Donaldson didn't get that right. Perhaps the research about observational learning in dogs came after she wrote Culture Clash. Second, she states that dogs are incapable of abstract thinking, etc. Now, how does she know that? I doubt that there is any research to date that is able to tap into a dog's cognition. Studying human cognition is complicated enough. But dogs? Anyway, for someone who is into science, this book is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"behavior seeker","review":"This book has been a great eye opener into the minds of our dogs.

While I did appreciate her insight in some areas, I was turned off not only by her style of writing, but also by her \\"unforgiving\\" and \\"all-knowing\\" premises. Too often good advice is obscured seemimgly by a desire to blow her own horn. It is unfortunate, because I belive she has alot of insight. Nobody has all the answers, and I believe that in her heart Ms. Donalson knows that, but it does not come through clearly on most pages. This book can add to a trainers knowledge and be useful, as long as, one does not treat it as \\"the dog training bible\\"; which I believe that the author thinks that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescention Clash","review":"Ms. Donaldson's book drips of condescension. For example, on page 61 she tells the reader to \\"pound this into your brain: dogs are animals.\\"If you think your dog is a person, and you need a pompous author to point out to you over and over that it is not, this is your book.If you are a dog lover who wants to develop healthy and fun behaviors between you and your dog, every other book out there is a better choice.In addition to the number of wonderful dog training books out there I recommend you consider reading Stanley Coren's book \\"How to Speak Dog\\". He will explain all the things the dogs ears say by their various postions, he will explain the meaning of head position, tail movement, lip curl, etc. Mr Coren is respectful to both animals and to readers.His book is especially valuable when you see your dog interact with other dogs. No book on training will tell you what your dog is thinking like Mr. Coren's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally an intelligent, scientific training method","review":"Someone said this book would change my life, and as one who is always up for a change, I bought it. It did. I was lucky enough to read it BEFORE I brought home a HUGE Newfoundland puppy. I have followed her methods to the letter and have found her behavior predictions to be 100% accurate and her methods to be nothing short of magical (science so often appears magical!). My puppy is now 10 months old, 90 pounds, and does everything she is asked to (including running to and sitting on a laser pointer dot) I don't own a choke collar, and she has NEVER been yanked, jerked, pulled, or yelled at. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, EVEN IF your dog is already older and ingrained in bad habits or sloppy obedience.

It does have some very sexy girls, but almost all the scenes are nothing but girls alone on screne dancing. There is vaguely implied lesbianism in two scenes, but nothing nearly as sexy as in other recent videos. Even the single-girl scenes are very tame by current standards.

Hard to stand through the film. I wouldn't recommend it for adventure-film-freaks. Frankly it's boring. Still it's not a \\"bad\\" film. But I bet: noone ever saw that film twice.

The dialog consisted of 90 percent swear words, worse than I ever heard in the Army. I had called earlier to ask if this was a family film, and the SIFF lady said \\"Yes, of course!\\". So I took my folks, my brothers and sisters, and my aunt and uncle visiting from Montana. My uncle arrived at the early scene where a woman strips naked, and he turned around and walked out. The rest of us sat there stunned, unbelieving the garbage we were watching. I thought it would get better as the movie progressed, but no luck. We should have walked out.

Lacks any depth","review":"In my opinion the more advertising in a magazine, the less you can trust its content. I didn't do an ad pages check but I imagine Vegetarian Times is about 75% ads. I primarily picked it up for the low cost investment ($7) to inspire some vegetarian meals and it satisfied that goal. However, between the ads and \\"lifestyles advice\\" soundbites there are painfully few actual recipes and approaches to cooking and even many of those are hawking merch from the advertisers (e.g., \\"1 30-oz can Muir Glen Crushed Tomatoes, 2 cans Eden Organic Beans\\"). As an experienced cook and conscious consumer, I find this unsettling. It's not a BAD magazine, per se, just kind of a waste. You're better off buying ANY vegetarian cookbook, even if you don't know how to cook, and flipping through this at the store (you can read all the lifestyle tips in 3 minutes)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetarian Times","review":"We've received 2 issues so far.

I find the recipes in Vegetarian Times are super simple and delicious. Lots of great ideas! They usually have a couple of other useful articles in relation to healthy/organic living, as well, one of them leading me to try a fabulous rose facial cleanser that I don't think I'll ever go without now that I've started using it. They also include a few different recipes for specialty diets, such as gluten-free, vegan, etc. When I ordered my subscription, there was some sort of special, so it was only $7.

I'm getting it for a 2nd year and look forward to more recipes.Also, just a comment on buying magazines through Amazon. I will probably never do it another way again.

This is an OK thriller, but the illogical actions of the \\"hero\\" ruin any realism.

And too often, incidents are initiated for dramatic effect, yet never followed up on or referenced again in any true manner (the run in with the FBI agents in the car and the resulting aftermath is one example). Overall, a quick read but with no depth and requires a complete suspension of belief and logic.

But the funny thing is that Charlie, the protagonist, is a really bad guy. He's a thug, a wiseguy, a murderer, and yet you can't help but root for him.I love Gischler's writing style and some of the things he writes make me guffaw out loud which makes people on the train look at me funny, but it's like I don't even care because I love that he can make me laugh. :-)I gave this only 4 stars because it was a little slow in parts.

In other words you have to find a windows 95 thats never been updated, 16 bit, and never connected to the internet if you want this cd to run."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to build","review":"Son was 5 when he got this and he loved building it.

What happened to the women? Elizabeth is sorely underused; Diana is barely present; Sara is nowhere to be seen. These roles are all played by fine actresses who bring humor, class, and pizzazz to what is otherwise a Hardy Boys story. Bring 'em back!

This, in my opinion, is not practical for 21st Century American theatre. No doubt it was respected in its day, of course...but NOW is no longer \\"its day\\".

In fact, they arrived at the Derby in a schoolbus: a handful of friends who had known each other since high school, who were in it for a good time and a way to bond.Funny Cide's journey to the most well-known horse race in America is fast paced, funny and irreverent as many of the people closely associated with the colt.

The first 6 chapters are basic material for any curriculum on programming. The chapters that follow mention difficulties but give no techniques that can be applied. Nothing in this would enable a person, previous unprepared to do so, to write a real time system.This book says it eschews mathematical formalism for practical utility. What it lacks is both a formal foundation and practical utility. The exercises (completely without sample answers) are terribly thought out. The description of difficulties of real time job scheduling are a list of known problems and some references to other papers.

Boy, what a pleasant surprise; this is FIRST-RATE suspense/spy thriller which takes place in the early days of wartime Britian but before Pearl Harbor. It's about a Danish sea captain who's forced to follow two missing and suspicious passengers while his ship is being temporarily held by the British.

The style is sloppy, redundant at times and overly general when it needs to be specific. Linkages are may times vague and not born out by actual material, causation is then implied. A lot of the book is more \\"guilt by association\\" then guilt by actual evidence. This book could have been researched and written to be much more precise, clear and organized.Many other books do a better job bringing out the hidden side of history. Unfortunately Sutton is not one of those books. For the price asked for it, I could not recommend him as a valuable source.If a paper back version selling for $6.95 ever comes out, then and only then could I recommend spending any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Campaign Workers' Must Read ..

The two things that really bothered me were thedefense of the Indian caste system and his, seemingly, racist views towards white people.There is ample evidence that the Indian caste system has been a great tragedy for thelow castes of India and it seemed strange how much he defended it. On this point, I thoughtthat Vivekananda was immensely more enlightened. Then he kept making remarks about \\"white\\"people, almost always in a derogatory manner or at least with a sense of some lingering bitterness.Perhaps, the fact of British colonial rule still weighed heavily on him. Maybe he is agreat saint, maybe not, but that's my opinion on as much as I read (which wasn't too much)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music! with some suggestions ..","review":"Big fan of the Buddha Bar series .. always the best music for all kinds of late night chillout sessions.

I'm way too old to do ecstacy, but, as I listen to this I get that Peter Gabriel sense of \\"I love to be loved.\\" Indeed, this is all mood enticingly seductive and relaxing. This sets you in a very different fram of mind and should never, never be listened to while driving a car, or operating heavy machinery. Get yourself parked on a sofa, a bed, the bloody floor for that matter with someone you want to squeeze, and take the ride.Techno culprits Ben Hassan and Riccardo Eberspacher and Mars Lasser are featured, and whoever this DJ producer is has done an intoxicatingly good job blending the sirens' calls.

Pretty much any song that someone will ask for-- whether for processional, recessional, bride's song, pre-wedding mood music-- is in this book.

Over the years, however, I have come to realize that it is far from a great performance. Santini's conducting is cool and detached, de los Angeles tears her voice to shreds in an attempt to sing \\"dramatically,\\" and Bjorling really just shouts the role of Pinkerton.Much better is the 1966 recording with Scotto, Bergonzi and Barbirolli, and best of all is the 1954 recording with de los Angeles, di Stefano and Gavazzeni. In fact, this latter is a \\"Butterfly\\" for the ages, stripping the music of its overdone dramatic traditions and instead focusing on warmth, humor and musical values.

Seib's efforts to set the career of BIG SIX in a broader context is laudable, but misses the point for a book this brief and this short. Some people devote their lives to the history of the world's greatest game. Seib is not one of them. The mechanics of his prose will not put you to sleep, but do not linger in the mind either. But the glaring error of this book is selling Christy short. Seib can bring himself to devote less than two pages to one of the greatest World Series performances in history, where Christy spun three shutouts. While some baseball books devolve into pitch-by-pitch tedium, more detail here is demanded.If there is a better Christy book out there I will consider reading it.

Not only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control, he realized that he was a role model for others, not only the young kids that idolized him, but the everyday american worker. To know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field, his charity work, volunteering for WWI at the age of 37, gives us a better insight to the individual.The book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game, before the Black Sox scandal. He knew it was going on, tried to warn others, but no one would listen.A great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time.

The idea of the game is not to beat the game as quickly as possible to get to the end, but to explore all avenues of every choice you must make. If played properly, it will keep you in stitches, and on your toes for hours. Robert O'Reilly, (who rightfully earned Best Actor for Multimedia presentations) as Gowron, leader of the Klingon Empire, and mentor of this Federation training program, is magnificiently fatherly and funny at the same time. When you play this game, you honestly feel as if you ARE Pok, the initiate to Gowron's mentor.

I had hoped that in 2012 it would have already been established that those of the African continent and their descendents are not animals.(Do not tell me they are grouped together because they are by the same author. We all know very well that the title of a book is the first thing that jumps out at you.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like","review":"I'm sure that Ms. O'Connor is a good actress, but this movie wasn't good.

I am going to have friends in Germany acting as tour guides, so will not need to heavily rely on the Language Translator, but will be nice to have when on my own. Fairly easy to use with a printed key guide on the inside cover. There are pre-programmed phrases that are categorized and very easy to convert to any of the 8 languages available on the translator.

This translator is small and it is easy to carry around, but that's where the Pros stop. The translator simply does not contain enough words to be useful. I have been living in France for a month and I have tried to use the translator on several occasions, without luck. There have been many instances in which I've been in a store or in the Metro and I needed to translate words; I was not able to do this because of the translator's limited vocabulary. It has gotten to the point where, if I come across a word I don't know, I don't even bother to use the translator.Instead of this translator, I would highly recommend just buying a translation book.

It expresses an understanding of the independent power of the human mind that was pivotal to the scientific revolution, and that continues to shape our everyday perception of our own human reality. The subsequent history of philosophy is largely classified according to how it responds to this work. This is an excellent translation, and it is helpfully bound with Descartes' Discourse on Method. It is cheap, and well-manufactured, and is the textbook I normally use when teaching this material."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is...I recommend a book with more commentary for beginners","review":"The bare translation...with little to no commentary.

He has only a handful of points, a few of them interesting but the majority pure academic fluff, and he spends over 100 pages just reiterating his ideas and logic behind them. It seemed like a modern editor would read the manuscript, and whittle it down to a maximum of 25 pages.

This is my absolute favourite. Schabel is tremendously powerful and dynamic without being crude. He is delicate and treasures the smallest notes. His music sparkles and flows.It probably helps a lot that Schnabel's piano teacher was Czerny, whose teacher was Beethoven himself.

I will simply note in passing that, contrary to one reader who has left his thoughts behind here, neither Latter-day Saints in general nor Richard Hopkins in particular deny the deity of Christ. Nor do they exalt Satan to equality with him. Nor do they deny the concept of divine grace. They view such things somewhat differently from Protestant fundamentalism or evangelicalism, but that is all. A little precision here would help a great deal.

She Who Remembers lacks in the opulent detail of Auel's work - the fauna, flora, survival strategies including hunting, gathering and tool making, etc. This is a garden-variety adventure. The romances of Kwani, the protagonist, are shallow. The setting does not envelope the reader, transporting you back to a different place and time.

Seriously, Cash's singing voice--while barely there--is pleasant as ever, and the arrangements are well-done in an instantly-forgettable sense. Your ears probably won't even notice that they've been there. A few tracks provide a little novelty, including the schmaltzy Johnny Bond-Tex Ritter narrative, \\"Here Was a Man,\\" which Cash puts across in his usual convincing manner. Only Cash could make such kitsch sound dignified. And there's \\"Figgy Pudding,\\" which sounds like an outtake from a Doctor Demento Christmas CD--fun, though the silliness would work better for me were it not so obviously planned.

If a soprano Charlotte doesn't bother you, a shrill one certainly would. Many people love her, but in all of the recordings of hers that I have listened to she was too shrill for my ears. She is the only reason that I don't give this recording 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I'm an American who has in Germany for 15 years. I bought this CD 10 years ago as an afterthought, not knowing anything about it. I felt slightly guilty that we only listened to English Christmas music during the holidays, and since my husband is German I thought I'd get one CD with traditional German songs. This CD surprised me with its lush instrumentation and clear-as-a-bell vocals. Definitely a bargain for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"OXO Pancake Turner","review":"Already owning the original spatula by OXO in this same color I thought this pancake turner would be a nice addition. It's a little hard to maneuver at first b/c of the size difference between this and the original size but once you get used to it, much better. I sometimes have a bit of a hard time sliding the spatula under the food, so I'd say that's a minor downfall. But considering it's size, it's great for taking a whole group of fresh baked cookies or goodies off a baking sheet and works great to transfer pizza too!If you've never used a nylon spatula or you're sick of the residue buildup on silicone spatulas... you have to check out OXO's nylon line. I still like my reguar OXO nylon spatula the best, but this one can definately hold it's own. And the price is pretty impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a CD that's refreshing?","review":"Once and awhile a disc comes along that is just the whole package: plays easy in the car, and has something to say about real life (note tracks #4, and 10 for example). Tracks 3, 10 echo God's call on our lives; would play well on AC/CHR radio formats. The best compliment is that you won't get tired of listening to it because it has the right mix of light gospel/pop with some serious lyrics that speak directly to you.

The ink is incredibly cheap but will likely clog your nozzles if they are not maintained regularly.

Marriner and the ASMF's sense of tone color and shaping of sound are so dynamic that they bring the music to a state of life that is rarely seen. The interpretation of mood and theme are brilliant, and the tempi are solidly judged.

It is hard to believe that he can even act."},{"rating":"2","title":";0)","review":"I didn't know what to expect with this new extension of Criminal Mind called Suspect Behavior, after watching it based on the first couple of episodes I'm really into it, this one has a different feel from the original Criminal Minds. the story lines are good thus far and keeps your brain alive and entertain with the breakdown of personalities. As for the casting I know Forest Whitaker's body of work but was surprise that he moved over to TV, he is very good in the series but my only problem is I tend to get attached to these shows when they decide to bring big name actors to it, but after the first or second season they are gone, so I hope he does this show for awhile. And my biggest surprise was Janeane Garofalo I defiantly was shock to see her in a drama mystery series but she is holding her own, and as for the rest of the cast great work.

He didn't comment too much about it at the time, and now I know why. One word describes this package, \\"appalling.\\"At times, it almost seems like this is supposed to be a parody of the original. Garofalo manages to consistently sap anything worthwhile out of any scene she appears in; I don't know who told her she can act, but they lied to her. The scripts are weak, and the direction is inconsistent. If someone hadn't seen the original, they certainly wouldn't want to bother after seeing this mess.

My highschool days were marked by change (3 highschools) but music was the lynchpin that kept it all together, helped us make friends--you went to each other's houses and played music. But this was the album I played when I was by myself, all the time.

What I didn't relize is there is no \\"cross-bredding\\" of ships. You can't have a Galaxy Saucer with an Akira body with Defiant Nacelles. Also, they have four presets for each part, and not a way for you to design a totally new saucer. As aforementioned, since there is no cross bredding, you cannot make a new class. And, one of the true low points of the game is, since you are an admiral, not a captian, you just send the ship out and your \\"capable\\" crew does the rest. No Control, no nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really Bad","review":"This game is BAAAAD.

It's so hazardous, almost everyone plugs into an alternate virtual-reality prison world. There's a government though and there's outlandish politics behind the prison computer system welfare and prisoner population control.Director Phillip Roth and his crew pull it off very well here, using natural lighting and skillful tricks to portray a very oppressed future where particles of radiation and pollution have exterminated any chance or scheme for social improvement.Darkdrive is visually appealing and the story is audacious."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Honestly, I am still trying to work out the plot.

The story is great and the acting is great too. It's very mysterious and dramatic also very spooky. The characters are very real. You must feel very bad for Agnes and Oliver.

The lengthy first disk contained virtually nothing out of the original Dickens novel. The characters behaved and spoke their lines as if they acting in a contemporary period made-for-TV melodrama. Oliver's father's wife seemed to trying out her lines for a voiceover as Disney's Cruella Deville. As far as a realistic portrayal of early Victorian life, viewers should remember that any man who took an umarried middle class woman's virginity was not, and never could be, a gentleman. The prtrayal of the Beadle and the other characters in the workhouse scenes were farcical. I ceased to watch at this point.

This is much more practical (and looks better). It was easy to install, although be careful - I almost installed it upside down!

When I do laundry there are perma press items and other clothing I do not like to dry completely so I put them on the hanger and hang on this to finish drying. Saves me steps to the bathroom where I was hanging on a shower rod and also unclutters my bathroom from hanging clothes. My draw back is I wish it was a bit longer to hold a few more hangers. Otherwise I give it 4 stars. We did mount it with the special screws to make it more secure as it was not in the stud and it would be nice if they had added such screws with the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent rack in laundry room and closet","review":"Got this model for our laundry room and love it.... it looks good and is very practical for hanging shirts/blouses right out of the dryer.

It is based on ideas and principles suggested by Bateson and Erickson. At times the book suggests that just about everything is a metaphor (Bateson's viewpoint), as opposite to a chair being just a chair - the only merit of this observation is that we assign meanings to objects and experiences in our lives and thus to a lesser or greater extent they are colored by our perception. The book also emphasizes Erickson's utilization principle, namely that the therapist should attempt to use client's metaphors to help the client solve the problem.The authors then guide you through methods and techniques of selecting appropriate symbols, constructing metaphoric stories and ceremonies. There are other books that go in greater depth on creatic metaphoric stories and which for that purpose may be more useful than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"filter","review":"tiene bbuen terminado el envio fue rapido es el artuculo que se pidio al onstalatlofue correcto bien artuculo lo recomiendo altamente"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Manga book ever!","review":"I can't believe this series has ended!

In an interesting twist Hollywood actually makes the Senator with a conscious a Republican. Can the apocalypse be far behind?Still this is probabbly Wil Smith's best acting to date, if for no other reason than he doesn't get to rely on his smart mouth.

Will Smith, Lisa Bonet and Tom Sizemore (amongst the others), are acting too hard. They weren't convincing enough to make me feel like they were real characters. Again, the action was great. But the acting was contrived and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit much ....","review":"This movie reminded me of why I don't watch slick, big budget, big star hollywood movies. Slick is the operative word here. Far too slick. The camera work was disractingly slick. There were far too many convenient coincidences to make it believable. As the movie went on, it steadily diverged more and more from reality. If all of these high tech spy tools exist (call me naive, but I doubt it) I doubt they would all have been brought to bear to such a degree on one hapless guy. The NSA geeks sure had hard time catching Smith. That's because, despite all their whiz-bang gizmos, they were mostly a bunch of incompetent oafs. Lots of gratuitous chases were thrown in to wow the audiance. It was hard to get up the mental stamina to follow the plot, since I didn't really care about the fate of the good guys. This just isn't how you pace a movie to artfully develop real suspense. It was quite a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Jerry Bruckenheimer over-drama","review":"Again, Jerry Bruckenheimer makes the believable unbelievably over-dramatized, i.e. Con Air, Armageddon, etc. Why is this guy still making movies?

This one's a poor excuse for a thriller. The script's half as clever as it wants to be, and Will Smith's one-liners don't help any.

I found this taut thriller even more suspenseful the second time around; moreover, it has assumed a chilling plausibility--probably because of now being able to 'tour' various world capitals at street level on Google maps. Will Smith and Gene Hackman (and his cat) have a marvelous on-camera chemistry; and whereas some of the 'hot political thrillers' that I have seen of late fall flat or run out of steam at the end, \\"Enemy of the State\\" packs a wallop that really delivers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemy of the State","review":"This is one of the best movies I have seen. With Will Smith being a D.C. Lawyer running into a college friend who slips him an assasination tape of a congressman made via bird watching video equiptment near a lake. The NSA is hot on Smith's trail, with John Voight leading the pack. Will Smith takes the aid of Brill, played by Gene Hackman, who was recommended by an information dealer who ran jobs for Smith for his court cases. With a great cast, non-stop action, and a couple hoots and hollars, this movie should be the example to all the directors of all government-based action movies. I thank the director on his stunning work, the writers giving a complex story, and the scoring guy, who made an outstanding soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Terrific movie with a lot of suspense and action.

And never have I gone to a local cineplex, paid full price for a ticket (as well as treat my girlfriend) only to fall asleep during the show. Well this stink bomb did the trick. Maybe its not fair to say its all bad since I slept through a good 30 mins of it, but I found it predictable and not original at all. Will Smith's smart-@#% remarks were fresh and funny in Independence Day but now they just irritate me. How many times can he play the same stereotypical character? Id like to see him do some serious drama, for he has at times shown the ability to do so. This movie just falls flat. Run, jump, watch out theres a helicopter. Yawn. Ive seen Xfiles episodes with similar story lines that put this to shame but did it with a small fraction of the budget. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Money, no story, no characters, no sense.","review":"This movie lacked any level of credibility.

The main draw of the film other than the excellent, all-star cast (Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Gabriel Byrne..) is the clever use of editing and camera technology to draw suspense and awe to a viewer. Smith's paranoid performance is the best of his career (hated him in ID4 and MiB) and Gene Hackman (good guy finally) basically reprises his character from The Conversation in his best performance of all his seemingly endless action-thrillers. I think this is Jerry Bruckheimer's best film yet.. intelligent, witty, suspenseful, well-acted, well-directed, polished."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great movie.

This movie was outstanding. I have already bought it and have watched it about five times and have yet to get bored with it. All other supporting characters give terrific performances. I was thrilled with this movie from beginning to end and I believe that anyone who loves a great action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat needs to at least rent the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemy of the State","review":"This movie is a kicky, knockout thriller. A solid two hours of pure entertainment. An all star cast list including Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Jack Black, Seth Green, Jamie Kennedy, Jason Lee and many more piece together a heart stopping action packed and original four star production."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nail biter","review":"I am not a Will Smith fan, but he is tolerable in this film as a DC attorney whose life is turned upside down by the government as they try to get back a tape from him that he doesn't even know he has. He turns to Gene Hackman for help after his career is ruined, he is forced out of his home and an old friend is killed. Seth Green and Jack Black are also memorable as two of the NSA agents tracking Smith.There is a bit much violence, the movie is deserving of the R-rating but there is suspense galore, lots of crazy gadgets and makes you wonder what the government is really capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - in Blu-ray HD","review":"This is a great video with a very good story line... caution with kids, there are a couple of violent and graphically violent scenes (close-up shoot out and a guy gets hit by a bus--you see some of the aftermath). The suspense and technology demonstrated reminds me of The Net but this is faster-moving.

Some good acting by Regina King. But the plots were over to long and there was no fun just watching the film, and plus the thrills were worthless, it was like going to a store and on to home. Thats what this movie shows. And I have to admit it there was some good things I liked, like when Will Smith runs off trying to get to his home to tell his wife that someone is after him,that was a good scene. But overall the movie isn't worth seeing, but that's my opinion. C- **"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure for the Evasive Number 2","review":"The formula for any Will Smith movie is to have him say \\"Damn\\" every six line of his dialogue and give him really cute humor, no matter what the situation is. This movie was totally unbelievable, honestly. For instance, Big Willie Style running around Metro D.C. in the winter wearing only boxer shorts. Not to mention countless errors both in editing and directing. On to the plot, the entire American government is evil (it can happen), mind you are villains are Jon Voight, who I can swallow as a villain, but Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, Barry Pepper, Jake Busey and Seth Green?! Is this an action movie or a poor man's Kids in the Hall? Gene Hackman is always good, but I don't even think Lex Luthor can help the Fresh Prince in this over price bucket of trash.Hey we should all just get Jiggy with it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose the Characature now?","review":"When this movie was released, the \\"Evil Right Wing\\" Republicans were so blantantly portrayed as facists that they were almost parodies. No more after the horror of Sept 11th (I am a survivor), it is Will Smith's wife (The wonderful ACLU Attorney) who it turns out is the characature. When she just brushes off a Republican Senator stating on Larry King that there are 1000s of foreign nationials in america who hate the USA. She calls him a facist.....what would she say now?? I guess that would depend on if she had a loved killed in the Sept 11 attacks. Afterall, ACLU lawyers seem to have the conscience of serial killers when it is innoncent men women and children kiiled who are no relation to them. But nevertheless, this movie is too disturbing to watch now that the real world has overshadowed the liberal elite version of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Inaccurate","review":"This movie is HORRIBLE. It is another example of Hollywood's distortion of facts. There is absoulutly NO WAY the NSA or anyone else could do the things that this movie professes that they can. No computer in the world, no matter how powerful, can \\"rotate\\" a fixed image. Not to mention the fact that there is no way that there are cameras everywhere! By the way, satellites are retasked in a matter of HOURS, not seconds. There is not a single facet of this movie which I consider to be valid. I had to stop watching it because I was so disgusted. Please! Don't encourage the production of more movies like this one by buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, but not good, actioner","review":"I didn't like THE NET, nor do I like ENEMY OF THE STATE. Both have your typical hard-workin', tax-payin', common-sense citizen hunted mercilessly by wealthy white folk with far, FAR too many resources at their disposal.Plot holes are vast and plentiful here, such as \\"If these guys are so good, why didn't anyone check out the conspicuous camera box right across the launching dock?\\" and \\"If these guys can do that much to one man already, do they really need a bill?\\" Plus, you also get, \\"With digital photography and editing, who needs two people in the same place at the same time anyway?\\"What makes this movie rise above the usual B-movie muck is...well, not much.

Caan gave a good performance. Two things kept me from giving this 5 stars. First a scene where Gig Young keeps a nervous Arthur Hill in the office doing paper work is moronic, and second, this movie screamed for a expanded role for a female character. The actress who played Caan's love interest was unattractive and void of talent. When you watch a movie like this you almost have to have some nudity and gratuitous sex to give you a reason to watch it a again and again. Oh well. What did work was the team of Caan, Burt Young, and Bo Hopkins...no one was Rambo but no one was an idiot either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thriller Elite - NOT!!","review":"I remember The Killer Elite.It was touted as a martial arts extravaganza, with then-famous martial artists from the seventies filling several roles and appearing in an ultra-exciting climactic fight. It would surely go down in history as one of the best martial arts movies ever produced.Unfortunately, things did not work out that way.Poor editing left several exciting fight scenes on the cutting room floor.

But, sadly, it isn't. The fight scene on the ghost ships of the East Bay is laughable. Ninjas go after the 'good guys' with swords. They get shot to pieces. Who would do that?This is an 'essential' film as determined by Amazon? I'd say not. Besides, Mr. Essential Video has it wrong on where the ghost fleet is.

Caan embarks on an odyssey to return to form and kill his former compatriot. Also starring Burt Young (Rocky), Bo Hopkins, Gig Young, Mako and Arthur Hill.

It's simple, a 6th grader could teach themselves Spanish with this book. Open it, read it, and memorize it. I had a terrible time with French and was not looking foward to learning Spanish, but I picked it up immediately as I went along with this book. When the semester was over, I spent the summer reading the rest of it at my leisure. As far as the other reviews go, I'm not sure what the problem was. It couldn't be explained any more clearly, perhaps they are moving too fast? Take a day for each page or something, whatever works. If you're not picking it up, it may be your study techniques and not the book. If you want extra practice, get the workbook.

Maybe the previous reviewers were unaware?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for a learning tool.","review":"This book is touted as a beginners volume yet it fails to perform as specified. The contents are poorly written and few examples are given to help in the learning process. To further complicate the learning of a new language, Puntos de partida provides very little explanations and direction to ensure sufficient comprehension and understanding of the Spanish language. Unfortunantly, this review can speak for most Spanish text books on the market as my Universities Spanish program has realized. Puntos de partida will not help the beginner to learn Spanish. It will deter the beginner to seek further understanding and learning of the Spanish language. This is unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are trying to teach yourself ....","review":"then this book is NOT for you. I tried to teach myself Spanish (I didn't know any) and this book just did not work out because of its poor construction.

The examples are not very helpful either.However, I took a private introductory class and then returned to this book.

TAKE THIS ADVICE...if someone gives this movie to you for free; tell them to keep that crap because your time is more valuable to you. Sure, the cover is cool (which is why I gave it 1 star), so maybe it would be okay if you take the DVD, shred it immediately, and then cut out the freaky girl's face. The closest this piece of crap comes to The Reservoir Dogs is if you put dog crap in your left hand and this DVD in your right, they would be indistinguishable...even Quentin would not be able to tell the difference!One more thing, anyone that would give this crap more than one star must have been in the movie and needs the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time and $3.00","review":"This is one of the worst films I have ever rented.

The female vocals, though heavily synthed, are sweet and draw you in. These are complimented by the wide array of instruments that were chosen and used quite well (heavy in the piano\\\\stringed instrument sounds with effects).

It is the only IR thermometer that I found under $250 that had an adjustable emissivity. Since not all surfaces radiate infrared equally, this can be a very important feature. The model 561 also can accept K type thermocouples for use in making contact temperature measurements. As an added feature, this model comes with a special K type theromocouple mounted in a velcro strap for wrapping around pipes for direct contact measurements. The plastic case is nice, too. I researched every model of IR thermometer under $500 for a month, and this was the best that I found. The only drawback is that the switch that changes between Celcius and Farenheit is inconveniently located inside the battery compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluke 561IR","review":"Easy to read display, We will use it in the field, As all fluke's instruments, they are very reliable and accurate, my only observation is the K thermocouple reading does not have decimals, it give you full numbers, this feature would give a big plus for the instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality professional IR Thermometer","review":"I did extensive research on IR thermometers, how they work, they various fetures, reliability, accuracy, ease of use, and practical application around the home.

With the Fluke 561 I can now properly adjust my refridgerator-freezer so it produces ice-maker output correctly (need ZERO degrees F. in freezer) and my refrigerator isn't freezing the food (34-38 degrees F.). I can check my stove and oven temperatures, most food surface temperatures (not internal) and best of all I can verify the my Air Conditioning/Heat Pump units are producing the correct temperature ouputs to keep my family comfortable.

There doesn't appear to be any unifying theme or logic behind the films included in the book and the reader may suspect that the book is simply a list of every single foreign or cult film the author has seen. The whole project might be redeemed by some good writing, but even that is lacking, the capsule reviews mostly consisting of a synopsis and the author's opinions. The synopsis is redundant for those who have seen the movie and a spoiler for those who haven't. The author's opinions are occasionally provocative, but for the most part, uninspired.

I'm sorry, but a 13-year-old singing \\"Good Lookin' Man\\" makes me think of Jon Benet Ramsay. And the photos that come with the CD, where she's kind of tarted up, are creepy too. I almost kept this CD just for the first song, but in the end I got tired of jumping up to turn it off when that song was over, and sold it back. Save your money.

I don't think I could have done it without the strategy guide that came with it. Also, I found that one of the puzzles didn't work in the way the manufacturer probably intended.

The only problem is that I didn't care what happened and it didn't keep my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Amazon Instant Video \\"experience\\"","review":"I would love to write a review of my Good Will Hunting \\"experience\\" but my Amazon Instant Video failed to play the dozen or so times I attempted to watch within my rental period. At exactly 24 seconds into the movie it would shut down and freeze. Very disappointing but not the first time that something like this has happened with an Instant Video rental. So my one star rating is for Amazon Instant Video service and not the movie Good Will Hunting (which is excellent)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest!","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time. Williams and Damon are at their acting peak. This is the type of movie that you can watch a couple of times a year and still enjoy each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top 10","review":"Another great film which is one my favorites. I've seen it many times already. It's a got a great cast. With a very inspiring story. A movie that's got a little bit of everything from comedy, romance, drama and action. Watch it if you haven't done so yet. Glad to see its availble on blu ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! One of my favorites!","review":"No frills, only a few special features, so if you want the extras look elsewhere. The version I received was a Canadian distribution version (I had the Canadian film rating on the back of the case, which I think is kind of neat). This is not a problem because the DVD is in English and French, so no worries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Some will call it boring, and it is a bit slow going.But the story is excellent and well told.By far Robin Williams' best work in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie & teaching tool","review":"matt damon and robin Williams are fantastic in this classic and it works as a great tool for teaching healthy masculinity to men who lack examples of wholistic examples of manhood in the face of a socio-cultural squeeze on the main character that would ordinarily lead to the usual, predictable, disappointing results, but with the help of a mentor, turns it around. Great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinker","review":"Very enjoyable ...great writing with a good message. Nice cinematography.

All the other Blue Ray disks that I ordered work great. I see no scratches, smudges, or anything. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why this movie was so liked.","review":"I saw the movie in a theatre with a friend because I liked Matt Damon in The Rainmaker. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I thought the movie was boring and that Damon's character was way too negative and hard to take.After hearing that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the screenplay, the only thing I can say is \\"don't give up your day job\\". I thought this was a terrible waste of Robin Williams talent because he has been in several good films.Anyway, I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but I thought this Movie was far overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've always enjoyed Robin Williams ... until this movie","review":"I had no preconceived ideas about this DVD. All I knew was that Robin Williams was in it, so I expected to be entertained. But it was ages before he turned up and by that time a story that started off promising had become unbearably slow. I also got fed up with nearly every second word of the dialogue being the f word and started to wonder just how brilliant this young man really was when he clearly had a vocabulary every bit as narrow as that of his best friend. I've given the movie two stars simply because of the excellent acting. Maybe it's just me. I loathe books about teenage angst (I find them boring) and there was definitely plenty of angst in this movie. I watched it with my husband, BTW, and he was every bit as bored as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential hollywood product","review":"The most overrated movie in years. Contrived, shamelessly sentimental, and above all cliche-ridden. The perfect example as to why you should take Amazon.com's \\"Essential\\" label with a grain of salt. (Van Sant's \\"Drugstore Cowboy\\" is much better than this dreck.) If you think this has \\"emotional depth,\\" you probably find \\"Hee-Haw\\" enthralling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pee-yoo! A profane and obnoxious bore.","review":"This film was offensive from the beginning and only got worse. An interesting premise and some talented actors get lost in the morbid facination with cursing and shallowness of character. The accolades given this film are simply misplaced. Don't waste your time. Get a real film like Brother Sun, Sister Moon to be inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good will Hunting - Not so Good","review":"I was excited to see the movie based on the actors but the language was foul just to be foul. It completely ruined the movie for me because of it's constant use of the \\"F\\" word. Enough already. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"That this piece of trash won any awards at all says a great deal about the awards themselves. From what I have heard this movie was written by a couple of college students. That is not surprising because it seems like it was written by a couple of drunken college students. It was predictable, inane, stupid, boring and just downright awful. The acting was attrocious with the exception of Robin Williams, who put forth one of his most believable performances ever. My favorite bad line was (quoted from memory) \\"Do you like apples? Well, I got her number how do you like those apples.\\" What tripe. What rubbish. If wasting celluloid was a crime then this movie would be criminal. Please, don't waste your time watching this film. Life is too valuable. Spend your time more fruitfully: clip your nails, clean your kitchen, even watch reruns of the Brady Bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullness, thy name is Good Will Hunting","review":"Despite all the hype about Good Will Hunting, I was dissapointed. The movie dragged along and tried to be oh-so-deep-and-witty.The message seemed to be \\"Don't worry about your own actions, society is at fault.\\"And am I the only one who did *not* think that the 'apples' scene was hilarius?"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the mop to the top!","review":"This film shows one of the best reasons for a society - like ours - that has space for those who are in the bottom of society going to the top, or at leist those who want to. This has good acting and good producer realism. This struggle of a janitor to get out of his humble Boston circumstances to the top of the educationational centers of our nation by his supreme knowledge acquired at a library is astounding. It has excellent dialogue, is character driven and has realistic background. It's a bit too word raunchy for smaller kids, and is best for adult audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug sentimental puerile pap...","review":"This movie grabs & assimilates every smug sentimental cliche ever to appear in film or print. The scenes between Damon & Driver are as artificial as could possibly be imagined. Williams heaving up massively shallow platitudes (one more time) is the crowning touch. How depressing that so many found in this film some form of significant human statement. It simply shows how deeply we continue to regress as a culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only person in the whole world who hates this film?","review":"THIS FILM IS SO BORING!!!While the acting performances are good, there is never even a hint of action in this self-smug piece of American junk. All that happens is some stupid cleaner gets good at maths, visits a therapist, and, erm, that's it really. Unless you're a greying 50 year old with an interest in people talking to each other for two hours, this film is NOT worth paying for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely over-hyped","review":"While I think it's great that two young guys could win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, I was so disappointed in this movie. The only thing I enjoyed about it was Robin Williams. The rest of it was boring; I found myself reading a magazine and picking up a Sue Grafton novel while my boyfriend watched in earnest as Will kicked some guy's butt and smarted off to his court-appointed shrink."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth it","review":"After seeing reviews and the commercial on television, you would think this would be a good movie, especially with the great Robin Williams. But, after I rented this movie I find it filled with trash talk that takes away from what I thought the content would be, among other things. This is really, to me, not a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope... sorry","review":"I turned on the VCR and the TV; I plugged the tape in; I stretched out on the floor with my wife; I wished I had cut my wrists instead. I wasn't impressed very much(although I liked the Nova at the end; I had a '68 Nova myself... loved that car)with the juvenile dialogue (do people really curse that much?), the seemingly token romance, and especially with the dramatic, climatic, inspiratic break through scene at the shrink's office. Months of rebellion quelled with one pathetic admonition? I don't think so. And besides, the pain Will was feeling isn't about blame or quilt... it's about the pain. Sorry, didn't work for me. (I would have given this zero stars, but that wasn't an option)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Will not enough talent","review":"Mr Will Hunting has it all.He's a genius. He has an eidetic memory. He can beat up people. He's a fast talker that can out duel a Harvard student. He's charming. He can woo women. He knows more math than Gauss, Euler, Poincare, Hilbert, and Ramanujan combined.He is the modern day Leonardo Da Vinci for academians and for women's hearts.But, how can we, the average schmoes, take this movie seriously, when Mr Will Hunting cannot bend spoons? C'mon writers! What a glaring omission!Clearly a character this talented deserves to have telekinetic powers!For more entertainment and >>realism<<, I recommend watching old episodes of MacGyver or the Pretender."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to succeed in mathematics without really trying","review":"This movie is okay to watch the first time around--but too annoying to watch a second time--or to even reflect on it afterwords. Anybody who has even the vaguest understanding of what it means to do original work involving higher mathematics will find this film ridiculous. Yeah, some people are indeed brilliant, but they apply their brilliance to incredibly difficult problems that had frustrated other brilliant minds before them. Einstein had to let all other duties and family responsibilities slide while developing general relativity. Brilliant and ground-breaking theoretical work is hardly possible as a part time hobby. Nor do professors at big name schools like MIT fawn over the work of even their most brilliant graduate students or post-docs--let alone the facile scribbles of self-educated janitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating downgrade upon second viewing","review":"I'd seen this film years ago when it came out. I remember liking it ok. Now after just rewatching it, I can see many weaknessess. Its an average film, in some ways maybe below average. I liked Robin Williams in this role. The rest was all pretty lame. But people grow, and this was a decent effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile nonsense","review":"This movie really deserves 0 stars. Whoever wrote the screenplay obviously knew nothing about mathematics and mathematicians. Damon's character is supposed to be a mathematical genius, yet it seems like he doesn't really know any mathematics and is just faking it. I doubt whether Hollywood filmmakers have the maturity to make a movie about a mathematical genius that is realistic and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Unfortunately the powers that be in the Academy Awards business were blinded by the money generated by that worthless movie, TITANIC. If any of the voters had any sense they would have opened their eyes and noticed the brilliance of Good Will Hunting.Good Will Hunting was funny, emotional and intelligent. That other movie was long, cheesy, predictable, and lame. Good Will Hunting had an exceptional cast, great writing, a good story, and something to think about. If that's what you are looking for in a movie than Good Will Hunting is your movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fantastic","review":"This movie shows the damage that a life of abuse can cause. It shows the recovery of a young man in need of someone who loves and cares about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good film!","review":"Okay, think about this. First of all, the film was supposed to take place in South Boston, a section of Boston where primarily, working class Irish Catholics reside. And guess what? They swear there, a lot! Okay, I thought I'd like to share that with you all. The plot of GWH is a bit contrived. We have seen similar themes before. However, it is well-acted and holds the viewer's interest. My sole complaint is Robin Williams. He has four different accents during the film, and not one of them resembles a South Boston accent. Get someone else to do it next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiffy one!!","review":"This is like my favorite movie. It's just good. I like the plot and all. Movies should be made like this one....you know, have morals. anyway, for those who haven't seen this movie...I advise you to watch it. it's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD MOVIE AT ALL!!","review":"This movie did not appeal to me at all. I am not offended by the use of swear words in movies but there was so much in this movie that it just got annoying. Curse words just lose their impact when they make up three fourths of the script. I am a male and especially didn't like the scene where Matt Damon and Minnie Driver were in bed and all of a sudden you see Matt Damon's head slowly going down on her. The implication was really disgusting. I nearly threw up just thinking about what he was doing. Keep in mind that I am a perfectly straight guy. I didn't even care whether Matt Damon's character got a life or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!!!!","review":"Not that anyone cares, but I have never liked Robin Williams as an actor. This movie only proves my point. It was just, well, BORING!That's all I can say. See it for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This was the most over-rated movie. There was not one original thing about it. The moment when it was finally over was bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"My sister rented this \\"movie\\" during Thanksgiving for the family to watch. We mostly talked over it. Then we took it out and watched something on TV. When is Hollywood ever going to learn to talk without gutter language. It's starting to get boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible movie","review":"This was the stupidest waste of time I have ever seen. Thank God I didn't go and pay $8.00 to see it in the theater. I nearly committed suicide after realizing that I spent $4.00 to rent it. This movie had no point. I highly reccomend that no one waste their time seeing this, but if you must why don't you pick up Howard the Duck, and maybe a couple foriegn films!! The only thing in this movie that kept me awake was Robin Williams. Thak God he was in there or else I might have put my foot through my T.V. This movie REALLY sucks!!!DON'T PAY MONEY FOR THIS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"no plot, waste of Robin Williams acting skills, and by the way do people really say that word so much? It became purposeless (if it serves one to start with) as it was overused & abused."},{"rating":"1","title":"A melodramatic disappointment.","review":"This is a great concept/story, and the set-up is good. However, the film takes a nosedive shortly after beginning, with tiresome and cliched characters and melodramatic scenes -- the \\"apple\\" scene being the exception. I think this movie is vastly overrated and filled with manufactured angst. I could not wait for it to end...and then I thought the ending was unfitting. The movie must serve as a sort of litmus test of personalities: those who love it and think it's brilliant, and those who, like me, think it's dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant film.","review":"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Matt Damon does full justice to his 'troubled genius' character, with Robin Williams giving him excellent support. Ben Afflect is good too, as Damon's friend. Gus Van Sant's direction is flawless, as he builds up Damon's character. The movie is touching and meaningful, with the ending being the icing on the cake. If you want to see a truly inspiring film, this one is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not your fault","review":"Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who sess through things like this. This story was pretty good, about a genius who hides his talents under a tough guy exterior. And the one scene that I really liked was when Matt Damon has his breakthrough with the \\"It's not your fault\\" scene. The movie should've ended then and there.Perhaps I am a little prejudiced, I can admit it. I thought this movie was hyped up to be something it couldn't live up to, and it was to me. This was before Bennifer, the Academy Awards, and all the who-dumped-who gossip. All those things shaped my opinion at a later date. Matt Damon is clearly the brains behind the operation, and he got the recognition he deserves, but Ben Affleck is a dingbat who just likes to party.Still, the movie is long winded at times and left me feeling restless the one and only time I saw it in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is beutifal!","review":"This movie is so cool...Matt Damon is good actor and sexy. I like when he hit that other guy in the face! He is soo cool. aND HE CUSSEes alot!! That was funny. I like how he beat people up and he was so smarter then everybody else and he looks cool. ... This movie has an important message about being smart and cool and I love it because it rules. Gus Van Zant is the greatest directer EVER, becuase he made PsYCHO too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am just an old prude...","review":"but this movie was ruined for me due to the constant use of the \\"F\\" word and other crudities. I did not like any of the characters very much. Generally, I enjoy Matt Damon's acting a great deal, but \\"Good Will Hunting\\" in my view is one of the most overrated films of the past 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great all around movie, entertaining for all","review":"this was a very well done movie, it is a wonder that matt damon and ben affleck managed to stay relatively hidden until now. Robin Williams outdoes himself in this role."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my personal favorites","review":"Good Will Hunting is one of the most moving and intellectual movies I've seen in a while, while still having plenty of comedy and some romance. It definately deserved more awards than it received. It is also enspiring to know that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote this movie when they were my age. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever","review":"Good Will Hunting has it all. It has one of the deepest meanings to me. This movie has brought my friend and I closer together. All I can say is see this movie and you will be forever changed. Your life will be filled with joy and happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD WILL HUNTING IS REALLY GOOD","review":"Not many people like this movie but i did. i do like matt Damon but i thought it was good regarless of weather matt was in it or not. But minnie driver should not have been in this movie other than that i luved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tortured Genius","review":"This is a wonderful film that very thoughtfully explores the life of a young genius who hides his light due to childhood abuse. The story develops gracefully and is never overly dramatic. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good, but all the other actors come through exactly when needed. I plan on seeing this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's The Problem?","review":"Some of the negative reviews posted here seem to have neglected an important element of the film: guys who live in the slums of south Boston actuall DO say the F-word as often as it's employed in this movie. Anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. I can understand if people are offended by it, but it's a realistic portrayal of these types of kids and their lifestyles. Personally, I thought the movie was very well done - but not perfect (it's only Hollywood, after all) - and that both Damon and Affleck gave credible performaces. Any movie that's as universally praised as this one will always receive a certain amount of backlash, but in this case I don't think it's warranted. It's an entertaining 2 hours, unless you're a Rambo/Terminator fan, and delivers a feel-good (if predictable) ending. With all the crap out there, you could certainly do a whole lot worse than Good Will Hunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's not your fault \\"","review":"I enjoyed this film very much, a powerful \\"see again and again\\" film. I am sure that there are a lot of Will Hunting's out there-tough guys who deep down inside are scared stiff and in great emotional pain.My favorite scene is when Robin Williams-Will's therapist- breaks through to Will's vulnerable emotions. \\"It's not your fault\\", he says. A very hard scene to do, for he had to say that line about seven times in a row-and yet he had to be believable. And he was!Great acting!Damon and Affleck are great actors in it-and bravo to their hidden writing talents. Minnie Driver was charming, all good roles in this filmA must see film-language a bit too rough-but forgiveable.I would recommend it to anyone. I am going to school to be a counselor myself,and this was really something to see the patient-therapist repoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coming of Age Story","review":"To anyone who has ever felt down, left out, or that they don't belong, this movie is ideal. With Matt Damon being a problemistic genius dealing with his brilliance and his troubled childhood this movie addresses a lot of aspects of youths today. From rowdiness, to hanging out with friends, to moments of solitude and sometimes just aimlessly driving around, this movie defines our restless generation and shows that we are not just a bunch of MTV freaks who can be classified as a pop culture generation ignorant of anything going on around us. Coming from the particular age group of the characters in the movie (college years), I completely relate to the characters in the movie- their quest for self, for love and for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Williams shines","review":"I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be a very tender and wonderful film. Robin Williams and Matt Damon light up the screen. I really felt this was Williams break out role as a serious actor and he showed a lot of range (though he was also great in The World According to Garp early in his career). He totally broke away from the manic comedy routines that can exhaust you and become tiring. Ben Affleck was just poor and a piece of wood as usual but what are you going to do? I guess they were a package deal back then (he and Damon)Mini Driver was also very good. Also Stellan Skarsgard was good as Williams childhood schoolmate who made it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites...","review":"I really like this one. And I think it's Robin Williams best, non comic films, as well (agreeing with many reviewers).Yes, there is profanity but in my opinion, if there wasn't, the story wouldn't be completely there. I think it was put in the script because it shows people, who are perhaps in the dark, that just because those who SEEM to slack off and those who seem to be unintelligent punks...are really smart. Now I know, I know people are saying that if they use all of the profanity, they certainly are not showing their intellect level. Well, the real life reality is that many people do use such verbal use of profanity. Not to say it's right or wrong, but people do. So the use of profanity by an intelligent punk is nothing sort of reality.I recommend the flick..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Film","review":"Cruising by amazon.com, I only thought it appropriate that I offer some small contribution towards the 'Good Will Hunting' review.This movie is highly inspirational, pertinent to the issues of modern society, and has the inherently warm undertones of any successful film.Questions of the modern day education system are evoked, romance and the strengths construed from loss are touched upon, and juvenile stereotypes are challenged.I could watch this film countless times and ponder the implicit themes without losing interest.It truly made my otherwise monotonous Monday night a joyful experience.Check it out. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 10","review":"This film is one of the better films of the late 90's scoring second on my list of top ten (second to Schindlers List) Matt Damnon and Ben Affleck give phenomenal performances, as well as Minnie Driver, Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgrd were all astounding as well. I strongly feel it was cheated out of Best Picture and Best Actor Academy Awards (I mean come on, Jack Nicholson wasn't THAT great, besides, he already had two and Titanic.............well, it speaks for it self) Matt Damon is a bright new star on the edge of his career and will definetly be a name that will be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars easy!","review":"I wont explain the whole story here as many others have done so already. But I will say that I think it's incredible how the two best friends in this movie, and the two best friends in real life wrote the script for this movie! It's a very good story with great acting, particularly by Robin Williams who needs just as much credit for his acting ability as he has for his comedic sense. This is one of my favorite movies and I recommend it whole heartedly! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might relate to it, and even though you're not a New Yorker, you'll start saying \\"how do you like them apples?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that makes you think......","review":"A must have. Good Will Hunting takes you through Matt Damon's role as a headstrong, working-class genius who has run-ins with the law. Although this movie is recommended for everyone, people that use mathematics or psychology as part of their regular life will strongly benefit from the content of this movie. Also, those that live in the Boston area will really enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top five, no doubt","review":"Ben Affleck and Matt Damon wrote a fantastic screenplay for this film and supported it with immaculate performances. Affleck plays a young man from south Boston who despite growing up poor and with a poor formal education to match it, he ends up a genius solving nearly impossible proofs at MIT. The only drawback to Damon's performance was his phony accent. It seems like he tries a little too hard to get it right. There is not one bad performance from the entire cast. Robin Williams gives a good performance as a sort of father figure to Damon and also his psychiatrist. Affleck gives a terriffic performance as Damon's best friend and fellow hard-nosed \\"Southy.\\" Although I have not seen Minnie Driver in anything else, I definitely think her performance in this film was impressive and would have no qualms seeing her in other films. This film joins my top five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Hurting!","review":"If this movie had a point besides a Matt Damon and Ben Affect ego-trip,could somone please explain it to me!They write the script so they get to star in it! I felt ready to for the movie to kill off both of them just to end this abomination.The jokes were unoriginal and were very boring and unfunny.Just watching the charecters act and spout terrible diologe almost put me into a coma and left me emotionally numb for several hours after watching it.Oh,and the gentle opening scene with the tender music and faceted shots could almost fool me into thinking this could be a good movie instead of the moldy flith that is this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and Unreal","review":"I swear I must've heard the word F-U-*-*. (You know what comes next) 20 times in ten minutes! Not only does this movie degrade itself with excessive strong language, but sorrily degrades mathematicians too! Those people work their whole lives at becoming what they are, then a non-educated little janitor comes and put them to shame!!! Yea, right!? How on earth could Damon and Afleck have possibly won an Academy award for bst Screenplay? IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!! Don't even rent this to satisfy your curiosity. STAY AWAY FROM GOOD WILL HUNTING!! Or you won't be so GOOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...","review":"Hollywood hype wins out again...somehow convincing millions that this is a great movie. Honestly, my husband and I sat there, astonished at how predictable this film was. Worthy of academy awards? My cats could roll better film in their litterbox! There's not much to say about it, as there's not much to it. A very basic story line that may seem compelling to a young child, but not suited for children as the language can be kind of harsh. This film is definately worthy of neither all the awards it received, nor of all the hype. Go outside and play a game of touch football, you'll have better spent your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good will HURTING!","review":"This always happens! A terriply bad movie gets aclaim because it has an (un)interesting idea.True a new math genius from humble beginings is a good idea for a movie,but the idea is never expanded upon and the plot falls apart and the viewers never notice and they heap tons of false prise on it! What is my interatation? An overhyped blob of moving images in which we,the viewers are fooled into thinking this is a good movie! Did anything happen in this movie at all! Or I'm supposed to belive that these people in this film are \\"actors\\",who \\"act\\".Also this is an obvious ego trip of Matt Daemon and Ben Affilct.Did you know that in addition to staring in this \\"film\\",they have also wrote the script and boy did they ever make their charecters humble.Why,in this movie they can have sex,swear,defy athority,be geniuses,fight(and win!),drink alot,etc.All because they wrote it into the script to satisfy their adoulesent fantasies.Hollywood,don't make another movie like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good movie - very entertaining","review":"I really liked Good Will Hunting. I think this movie's intention was not to create cinematic history or surprise the audience with plot twists and turns. I think perhaps it only meant to strike a chord with any viewer who has ever felt alone. Did it speak to me? YES. guilty as charged. It IS a feel good movie, but along the way you get treated to great acting from Robin Williams, good acting from Matt Damon, Minnie Driver and Ben Afflect, and a genuinely funny script. If there is a weakness in the plot it is that boy genius/floor scrubber is a little hard to swallow. But this is ,after all, the movies and I contend that a little artistic liscence should be granted in such matters. The relationship between Sean (Robin Williams character) and Will (Damon) is what this movie is about, and it unfolded with a grace that more experienced writers could not have managed. Kudos to Affleck and Damon for beating the odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice to watch","review":"The movie did not appeal to me at all!!! There was just way too much cursing for me.

Too bad.I love this movie because it shows a person can be reborn. Will was able to get over his hard childhood and become something great. Robin Williams' character moves on past his wife's death. Just goes to show you CAN teach old dogs new tricks... Everyone can get something from this inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"Awesome to have a dig copy with Blu-ray for such a low price. One complaint: Digital noise/film grain present a bit. This film was made in the 90's but looks very poorly taken care of. Universal could have done more than simply upscale the DVD version of the film for this releaseBottom line: if you like the film, get this. Its a ridiculously cheap Blu-Ray and you get a dig copy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to think.","review":"I thought this film was about learning to think, make decisions. Will was a genius, but could not make personal decisions - he was either a follower or being groomed by the professor. Will could not even decide whether he loved his girl friend; which points out that love is intertwined with our decision making process. In my mind, the psychologist, played by Robin Williams manages to get him thinking for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all the most brilliant people go to Harvard","review":"Matt and Minnie hooked up during this film before a public break-up on Oprah ... but they simmer in Good Will Hunting. A math protege who works as a janitor in Harvard, Damon is the tortured math savant who connects with the equally tortured widowed shrink Robin Williams. The class struggle between Matt and Minnie break them apart when she leaves Boston for Stanford in California. When Will breaks free of the controlling mentor college professor (played by William Hurt) he takes off to find his girl at the joy of his therapist. It's brilliant and if you love Boston and scenes of Harvard, dodn't miss Matt and Minnie in this Academy-Award Winning film."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All Time Favorite","review":"I never get tired of watching this movie!!

All the actors are at their best in this touching and funny drama. For those who have already seen the move, this DVD is worth checking out - very generous in the extras department. The running commentary is wonderful and a deleted scene between Chuckie and Skylar is hilarious and offers a side of Chuckie not much seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product problem","review":"The fiilm is excellent.

This movie deserved all the publicity it got and more. All nine oscar nominations. (Plus I think Matt Damon is the hottest person I have ever seen in my life.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but cut the cussing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved the story and normally I give great films five stars but the devastating bombardment of the f-word so many times (over 150) made it lose a star. Matt Damon looks exactly like someone I know back home who lives just like Will Hunting does in the movie. It's like someone just took a video camera, filmed that boy's life, and gave it a movie title. However it's a great story. The song at the end credits is great also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Movie","review":"Good Will Hunting received a lot of hype, but I just don't think it warrants it. Robin Williams is excellent and deserving of the Oscar he received for his roll in the movie, but the rest of the cast just had no appeal to me, even Minnie Driver, who I believe is one of the most stunningly beautiful and talented young actresses of our time. I'm not one to get offended at foul language in a movie, but this movie has a lot of it and I believe it is totally unnecessary. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My vote for Best Picture of the year","review":"This is a great movie. A great script, great dialogue, delivered intelligently with care.

I saw it for the first time on DVD yesterday, and not a dry eye in the house. I thought the movie was great, but what fascinated me (and my friends) was the ELEVEN deleted scenes that were added as bonus materials.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see","review":"Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver shine in this touching story of a misunderstood youth in the working class section of Boston, Massachusettes. Damon stars as the genius Will, a Harvard janitor, who represses childhood memories of abuse, and settles for stagnating in his working class life, when he could put his talents to use and make a life for himself and girlfriend, Driver. Robin Williams also stars as the man who breaks through Will's shell and makes him realize the that Will can do anything if he would just realize that what happened to him as a child was not his fault. Get out the hankies both men and women!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie Hunting","review":"Please skip this movie if you do not like Robin Williams or think Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are just pretty boys. Although a little sappy at times, this movie lets you see that it is never too late to follow your true destinay and that we alone control our lives, even if it takes someone elses guidance to show us.Robin Williams plays, masterfully, in his Oscar winning performance as the psychiatrist who is more like Will then he would admit. The characters are at times complete opposites of what they start out as or what they offer to the other characters.A true gem of a film. Did I mention Damon and Affleck wrote it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie, bad DVD","review":"No real issues with the film itself, but this disc is awful.

The difference is that in \\"Amadeus\\" you can hear the genius of Mozart, but in \\"Good Will Hunting\\" Matt Damon projects intelligence and there are suggestions, but no demonstrations, of Will's genius. It is an excellent movie, expecially when cleaned up for TV. It is probably Robin Williams' best role.There are comic moments that bring out the absence of demonstration of Will's genius. One is when he goes to the girl's dorm and she tells him she has to get the \\"proton spectrum\\" of ebolamine. I never heard of a proton spectrum, and what Will presents to her is not any kind of spectrum, rather it is a structual formula for what appears to be a complex ringed alaphatic molecule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canadian Version","review":"If you look closely on the picture you can see the French translation. Would have preferred that this was more prominently noted (I didn't become aware of this until I received it). Can I live with it?

At the time of this review, the digital copy version is now the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"Now I saw this movie when I was pretty young, but Good Will Hunting was the most unrealistic drama I have ever seen. The dialog is ridiculous and the acting is terrible. Robin Williams saves this film from being 1 star. Has anyone ever met a genius janitor. I don't think so. The seen where Matt Damon and Ben Affleck get in a fight with two other college students at a bar is a joke. Ohhh let's have a fight and see who can say the most clever line. Give me a break. Spare yourself and rent something that could happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic equivalent of a gas station sandwich","review":"I watched this movie because Robin Williams played a role in it. I dislike both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but I was willing to give it a shot regardless.It was horrific. It's like someone crashed together A Beautiful Mind with Finding Forrester but left out the heart of either. The protagonist was totally unlikeable, and the lines that were built up as revelatory, genuine, and inspiring were in fact cliched garbage. Robin did what he could with the lines they gave him, and I can't really say any of the leads performed poorly in the film, but what they delivered (however adroitly) was trash.If you want a totally mindless movie about someone smart winning some respect in spite of his ridiculously obnoxious personality, then go ahead and buy Good Will Hunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over","review":"I have rarely been so bored at a movie theater. I literally fell asleep for about half an hour, so perhaps I missed something, but I doubt it. Robin Williams overacted. Matt Damen is in love with himself. The movie had no life to it. I'd rather nap at home for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Robin Williams even there?","review":"This movie doesn't deserve award(s) status. I was channel surfing and joined the movie when Robin Williams was sitting in a restaurant booth with another actor, when I couldn't help but notice the too many back of the head shots during the scene... then it occurred to me... I don't think Robin Williams was even there for the shoot! And, he wins a best suppoting actor award? So, I started big time noticing the number of back of head shots and really bad editing to cover actors' \\"awayness\\" and clearly, this movie sucks. If you're interested in trying to poduce a movie, you should watch this one if you need a good, \\"hell, i can do that\\" kind of encouragement. And again, the # of awards? Was there no movies that year or something? This movie sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"very overrated","review":"i didn't get all the hype about this film.i find it to be just another run of the mill film.a big waste of Robin Williams's talent.as for Matt Damon&Ben Affleck a couple of 2nd tier actors.the cursing is wasted it has no place.just throwing words out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Now I see why it took me 13 years to watch this movie, it's just as bad as I feared it might be!

Personally, I have nothing against swearing in films, except when it becomes a distraction, as it does here. When I start thinking things like \\"Can't these people say a single sentence without the F-word,\\" or \\"Who the heck wrote this stupid script,\\" then the magic of the movie experience is lost on me. It's a decent story, though a bit contrived, but the swearing definitely ruins it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was.","review":"Thought I was purchasing a full screen dvd of the movie.

Now, I guess because it's called \\"Captain's Chair\\", it doesn't have DS9 but it does have the Defiant. Overall, I think that the TNG Interactive Techinal Manual is better when it comes to information and more detal. What this has that I didn't see in the TNG Manual was the interviews with the cast. That's right, when you explore the ships, you can find on the capain's chair a button that will have interviews with George Takei, Michael Dorn and so on. They talk about why they wanted to work on Trek and other things. Every ship has an option a tour that can be given by one of the crew voiced by the real actors, but it's only voice and you don't see them.

It was showing it's age.However, I bit the bullet, after reading many reviews...and got this nice radio.It's Great!. Simple to setup and use. The sound on both AM & FM is just Great. It just the right size to fit in my nite stand.And minor hiccup to me is not being able to switch to any preset memory station after being awaken by... (in my case)the \\"Wake-up alarm\\" mode of music. It just stays locked into that awake station for 60 minutes.It's easy to rectify, turn radio off then on.There's no remote, so if you're used to a remote it'll seem a little different at first.There are a few other things I had to get use to, but overall I'm glad I bought this little wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Radio","review":"I needed a new alarm radio as my former one had very poor reception.

It's just a very expensive ordinary analog radio with a nice display."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Junk!","review":"Before buying this radio I read the glowing reviews here and also a favorable comment in Consumer Reports, so I was surprised and disappointed that my experience was so different. It does not receive four of the five main AM stations here in Denver. One comes in very well, two with a lot of interferance and two not at all.I talked to BA's technical service and tried their two suggestions: rigging a wire antenna and moving the radio to different locations. It didn't help much. Their comment: \\"Some radios just don't work well in some locations.\\" I have three other cheaper radios that do work in those locations. The easy controls, presets and rich tone are nice, but if a radio doesn't perform its basic function, for me it is a piece of junk!If you do decide to buy this radio, I recommend you get it from a local store and not on line. The BA reseller, Antonline, is not up to Amazon standards and has made returning it a difficult hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, with AUX feature","review":"This radio has great sound. In the SF/Bay Area, I can get enough clear stations to fill all 20 presets. The AUX feature is very useful for listening to MP3/iPod. You need to get a male-male 1/8 (mini) cable. The product doesn't come with one. There is an older model without the AUX feature. No place clearly differentiated between the model with the AUX and the model without (even Amazon), so when I ordered it, it was kind of a shot in the dark that I was getting the model with the AUX feature.Ding against: when you're listening to the radio (or AUX), you can't see the time. It would be nice if the radio automatically went back to displaying the time while playing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than anticipated","review":"I purchased the Boston Acoustics Receptor Clock Radio for my fiance as a birthday gift. He had wanted one for some time, but had not gotten around to buying one. He had said it would be a nice thing to have beside his bed. I was skeptical, but decided if it was something he wanted then I would find one for him. This radio is amazing. The sound is spectacular, and it is very clear. I would never have guessed such a small radio could put out that quality of sound. The single front speaker combined with the rear base subwoofer is far supperior to bedroom radios. I can honestly say this radio is worth the price and I would love to have one for my office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Positive Relationship Building Questions","review":"I rated this product a 2 because this game is designed to be played be a husband and wife but the questions are questionable.If you are looking for a romantic evening you don't want questions like, \\"have you ever had sex with a co-worker, at work?\\" Many of the questions do nothing for building relationships.

By far, the Greek Tragedy in New Translations' version of Sophocles' Antigone was the supreme. By offering an introduction, mythical background, appendix, and author's note, the reader is able to easily become aquainted with the background surrounding the play's storyline. The version captures the original spirit of the play in the spelling of the Greek names, and in the whole body of the translation itself. The perfect edition for those studying The Antigone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great play; dreadful translation","review":"Having taught \\"Antigone\\" for years in various translations, I thought I'd try the Dover Thrift Edition. It's a disaster; it's unteachable. It's a Victorian translation that renders the play into contorted, archaic, unreadable fake Shakespeare. The Dover Thrift Editions have in many ways been a real boon for college students, but don't bother with this one. It makes me suspicious of the rest of Dover's Greek drama translations."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those of you considering using Dover's Antigone in class","review":"Although the Dover Edition of Antigone is inexpensive, the translation is very archiac. I used this book last semester in the hopes of saving my students a few dollars, but we found the translation to be so difficult that the time spent in class \\"translating the translation\\" made the book less of a value than I had hoped. I recommend a more modern translation for those of you who are considering using this text in class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Translation","review":"I found this edition (Dover Thrift) by following a link for paperback from the Braun translation. The publisher reviews on this page indicate it is the Braun.It isn't: it's the Young translation, which is not workable for my classroom because of it's difficult \\"KJV\\" English. Now I've wasted two weeks in planning my Greek unit, and any hope I had of using Antigone is shot.Teachers: avoid this translation unless your students are advanced. It's isn't worth the money you save."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the acts?","review":"Ordered this for my child for school assignment. Assignment was to answer a series of questions for each act. This translation does not identify where each act begins and ends. Does that mean it's a purer translation?

It's not too hard to read, and it's pretty short (!), so you could read it in a day probably. This play will have you questioning what you would do in both Antigone's and Creon's situations, so you know it's pretty good. And the important question: who's the tragic hero?!? I'm still deciding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense- depicts internal struggles and desperate measures!","review":"Antigone is a terrific play.

I read it a few months ago, and the few themes that I could remember then I can barely recall. Wow, it made such a lasting impression!

I have two dogs that love to party outside and I have a backyard with a lot of places to get dirty, so when I saw this towel, my first reaction was, I have towels, but I do like it.So I went ahead and bought this towel, even though it was a little pricey, I just had to try it. Well, as it turns out, it was a good purchase. The design of the towel with pockets for your hands is actually very helpful when cleaning off dirty paws and other bits. It's probably even big enough to dry off a whole big dog if they had short hair. But for a little clean-up it's excellent.It's a nice size and easy to store. If you are looking for a convenient way to keep dirty dog paws off your Berber carpet or Tibetan wool rug, you will probably like this towel a lot. You might even want two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and entertaining","review":"If you're tired of the immorality in the majority of today's books, this author is just what you've been looking for. D.E. Stevenson is a great storyteller. She makes you want to keep reading about these people forever. You care about what happens to them. Yet her books have an underlying philosophy that is optimistic and uplifting. I highly recommend all of her books. You can't find this kind of quality storytelling in today's bestsellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Martial Arts Inspiration!","review":"The best thing about this book is that it doesn't talk down to children. The author is careful to point out when she is telling a popular story and when she is telling history, and for this reason I feel her writing simultainiously gives children an acurate and traditional understanding of the roots of the major Asian martial arts traditions.Younger children will get much from the illistrations and will love to have it read to them. I teach Northern Shaolin (Kungfu)and this is the first book I've seen that makes the important connections between fighting, performing, Chinese Opera, and the Movies. It is sad that so many other books think they have to tell children that martial arts isn't about fighting. As if children would believe that anyway. Teaching children the true roots of Asian martial arts leaves plenty of room to communicate all the other important values we cherish, like appreciating great art, and reading good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stars? No way!","review":"This compilation is awful. First of all, I love the sound of Rockabilly, but the genre needs a serious injection of originality and this cd is proof. Every single song is horribly cliched, you know, \\"go cat go\\",\\"kittens this...kittens that...\\", any reference to a cadillac, it's all there. I knew going into this that not all twenty or so songs would cut the mustard, but I would have been satisfied with 7 or 8 decent songs. Redoing classic music isn't necessarily bad (look at all the great modern surf groups), but this stuff is bad. If you want to hear the same song played over and over by groups whose only distinction are different names, by all means, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magenta Comes Over","review":"My daughter and all of her friends at our day care center love this video.

I'm extremely happy with my purchase - only one thing: I ordered a new one and the packaging looked kind of beat up when it arrived. It could be because its been sitting around on a shelf a long time, because I don't think they're making Blue's Clues video tapes any more. Since he's been born, I've watched my share of Blue's Clues (On Demand), and this is definitely one of the better episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"EWWW","review":"Smells like a old woman's perfume!

Lisa Samson knows how to approach real life and death issues with such gut-wrenching honesty, humor(the zany, quirky, off-beat kind that I enjoy,) and hope. Lisa Samson always gets to the heart of the matter and makes me examine my own life. This is one great book, all about this journey we call life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Living End","review":"I am a big Lisa Samson fan, and enjoyed this book.

Disappointed because a Elmo video did not give you any good ideas on planning a birthday party??? (Did you also get the one on hair to see if you could get some ideas on a new hairstyle?) The bottom line is Elmo is adorable and my son LOVES these videos and wants to watch them again and again. ...and he is learning about all kinds of things throughout the series. YES! it is the same Elmo's World that we have all seen on Sesame St., that is why it is titled \\"Elmo's World\\"!! Why are you even surprised? I recommend these videos for TODDLERS highly. Someone mentioned that they find Mr. Noodle annoying. He is trying to entertain your child, not you! ... as Elmo would say \\"silly parent!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Video","review":"This Elmo's World video lives up to my expectations. My 10mo. old loves anything elmo, especially the Elmo's World videos. The format is the same as in the past videos, three segments all dealing with interesting and educational topics. I love these, because I know he is learning the whole time he is watching it. (And we watch it over and over again!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Games\\" episode has both of the Mr. Noodles together!!!","review":"My almost 2 year old loves Elmo's world and this is one of her favorites. The video has Birthdays, Games, and Pets ( all from this season of Sesame Street). My daughter will sit glued to the TV for Elmo, which helps me get a bit of peace to get things done without my \\"little helper\\". Best part of the video are \\"Birthdays\\" where you get to see baby Elmo (my daughter loves that part) and a great explanation of what birthdays are. In the \\"Games\\" episode you get Mr. Noodle AND Mr Noodles brother Mr. Noodle together to skip rope (heaven for my daughter - she loves the Mr. Noodle segments). This one is a must for all Elmo fans. My one complaint is that I noticed that the birthday episode has been edited... you don't hear the traditional b-day song Elmo sings to Dorothy as you would see it on regular TV. That is why I subtracted a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not of my region","review":"I ordered this one with three others and this one came with a region limitation.

It is not a separately made movie just copies from the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elmo goofed","review":"I used to think Sesame Street is always very educational but no longer think so after sitting through this video (painfully, I might add). To put it mildly, it has no real content and not much worth to remember. Worse yet, it seems awefully long for a Sesame Street tape. The usually curious and lovable little furry red guy spends the entire time goofying around. Watching that stupid Mr. Noodle is most dreadful, boring and a total waste of time. I failed to see anything educational in this film. On the contrary, it sends the message to its young audience that having fun and being funny mean being brainless, silly and stupid. Even though it is supposed to be for 2-5 year olds, they are intelligent enough to know the difference between wit and stupidity, sensibility and absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aqua Real 3D","review":"I purchased this item for $10 from Comp USA.

I emailed the company and was informed they were disappointed as well and Volume 2 would be a great improvement.Well guess what! Volume 2 and the remaining volumes photo quality is poor and not as clear as those on the companies RZM Web Site. I admire the concept but what were they thinking! Perhaps printing on a higher quality paper might have helped.Do not waste your money is my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money for a few pictures.","review":"Don't bother with this one, it's a thin, overpriced volume with only moderately interesting photographs and uninformative captions. Apparently, the publisher intends this as volume one of several, which, given the qualities of this text, sounds like shameless profiteering. The entire catalog of photos, including those yet to be published should have been offered together in a single volume for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic and Unendurable...","review":"...just like a typical Tim McCarver broadcast. Never one to not let his endless explanation get in the way of your enjoyment of the game, this one picks up where his others leave off. Don't get me wrong -- McCarver's knowledge of baseball is obviously exhaustive -- but his titanic ego comes roaring through here in spectacularly dull fashion. Folks, this is the guy who hinted in the also horrible \\"Oh Baby, I Love It\\" that he helped mold Bob Gibson into a HOF pitcher (Gibson, as the story goes, once told McCarver during an unwelcome trip to the mound that the only thing McCarver knew about pitching was that he couldn't hit it). If you buy that, then you might as well buy this, too.For a much better book on the same subject, try Keith Hernandez's \\"Pure Baseball\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to know about the battery","review":"When I first bought this book I thought the title was just a gimmick and that this would just be another half hearted attempt to explain baseball to wives and girlfriends everywhere. Well I was wrong. The info in this book even I at times find hard to follow. The only problem I have is that Mccarver spends 3/4 of the book explaining pitches and hitting counts. Balls are good for hitter, strikes good for pitcher. Its not that hard to figure out. I thought he would explain baserunning and outfielding the same way he explained the battery. He did not so I gave 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An immense amount of baseball","review":"McCarver pretty much covers all the bases in this book. He talks about everything, pitching, hitting, fielding, managing, running, broadcasting, etc. I was overwhelmed by the book, eventually skimming through the last 50 pages, and intending to pick it up again next season. My criticism is that a few pictures could've helped a lot, especially with describing how various pitches are gripped, and the motion of those pitches. I especially liked the fact that it's new. The best baseball books are frequently the newest ones - a book on baseball strategy written in 1975 will not be as meaningful as a book that names Clemens, Maddux, Mac, Griffey, etc, to point out which players do things well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great baseball book","review":"Tim McCarver knows baseball. He knows how to play it, how to announce it, and, as the title indicates, how to watch it. He shares his knowledge in this book, which in both interesting and well written. I recommend it to any baseball fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edited this thing?","review":"This book needs an editor. Did they just let McCarver ramble on and type what he said word for word? You literally drown in McCarver's stream of consciousness. There is no organization of thought. Ideas do not flow from one topic to the next. I gave it two stars because I feel there is information to be found in this book if you are willing to wade through the rest of the mess. It's not McCarver's fault, he's a baseball guy, not a writer or publisher. Check it out from your local library and save yourself the money.

I wish that I could find a book that on Intelligent Design that speaks to people my age without assuming they have no prior knowledge of the topic: this suggests that we live out our childhood with our ears blocked and eyes closed. Any child raised in a Christian family will be somewhat aware of what going on. We don't need to hear about Mrs. Homily and Mr. Axiom; rather we need a bible in our hand and a mature argument in our minds. I have often been called upon to defend the account laid out in Genesis against adults who were far better informed. I would like a way to defend myself.No offense meant.

Allow me to explain, I give it the 4 stars because it is awesome if my legs are really itchy from all the hair trying to regrow, but I don't feel that it prevents the ingrowns, maybe it helps to soften the skin to allow the hair to break through, but I find I achieve maxium results by exfoliating and then using the product.

I still have dark spots, none of that improved (perhaps it would work better on the face?). It helped my ingrown hairs some, however I still had a significant amount.

Some reviews say the product didn't work as great as expected; I suggest they be more liberal with the application. I noticed results after 3 or 4 days of use, but when I applied more (2 pumps instead of 1) I saw even better results.

Neither the amazon.com listing nor the product website provides a full list of ingredients, which should have been a red flag but I took a chance because the price compared favorably to my usual choice, the ingrown hair serum sold by European Wax Center which actually comes in a nearly identical bottle. However, this product unfortunately contains parabens, and it seems disingenuous to advertise it as \\"natural.\\" While there is still question around just how dangerous parabens are, there are enough other endocrine disrupters I'm potentially exposed to every day that I don't need to voluntarily add another one, especially when I have alternatives readily available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"Obviously, this product works for some people - but it definitely didn't work for me! I bought it at the spa where I get my Brazilians - it was highly recommended, so I had high hope for it...plus, for the price I figured it must work. Wrong! It did nothing for my ingrowns...in fact, I kind of think it may have made them worse. I thought I would have to stop getting waxed they were getting so bad! I decided to try a different product (fyi - Tend Skin) and seriously - no more ingrown hairs! I don't know if this is a testament to what a great product Tend Skin is or what a crap product Prince Reigns is, but either way I will never go back. Now I'm just trying to figure out how I can get rid of my half used bottles of Prince Reigns..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"I bought this product because I have ingrown hairs on my bikini line and have suffered from them from many years. I bought this product not expecting a miracle, but atleast a little change. I am almost done with the bottle and i see NO change or difference at all.

I often had one or two on my stomach that would be there for months as a huge inflamed red thing that wouldn't go away. I'd tried alternatives, like Bump patrol and bikinizone which didn't work that well, and pfb vanish which worked slightly better. However, after applying this for a few weeks my chronic ingrowns disappeared (leaving an inch long hair coming out) and didn't come back (or if i did get another big one, it only lasted for a few days). I've also started using an exfoliating brush, one that is very stiff and you use when dry. That, combined with princereigns has gotten my skin back close to normal.

You could touch it without the Kevlar glove and not get burned. It took just as long as a regular iron to heat up and curl the hair but the curl was not very tight and fell right out.

After using this curler my curls were bouncy and lasted for a very long time. The curls looked very cute and peicey even after I ran my fingers through my hair. I didn't use any styling products to preserve my curls, just some biosilk. At first I didn't like that it didn't have a clip to hold the hair but this makes it so you don't get any kinks in your ends. This also means you will be using two hands to curl your hair. My arms were killing me when I used it. I accidently placed mine on a plastic bag and it melted onto the curler. When it cooled the plastic peeled off completely. The curler also has no on/off light which puzzled me because it is a basic feature on most curlers. I really do like this curler and wish I bought mine on Amazon for this price. I paid 117 for mine, grrr!

Each of the stars gets a fine solo shot. Sinatra's MY KIND OF TOWN is best known but Davis\\" BANG BANG is reminiscent of the best of Astaire and Dino's ANY MAN WHO LOVES HIS MOTHER should have become a Mother's day classic standard.

Odd that it is not better known, given that it stars the 2 biggest songsters ever (Frank and Bing), and 2 others close in the running (Sam and Dean)..Peter Falk is terrific in pre-Columbo days doing a similar role, this time as a head Mafioso. He's terrific and absolutely hilarious. The plot's excellent, but the show stopping tunes are real blow-outs! The 2 funniest are \\"Mr Booze\\", done in a relgious revival scene during a police raid, and \\"Style\\", both which must be seen and heard to be believed! Frank's \\"My Kind of Town\\" is also among his best solos ever! And the 1920's costumes, scenery, cars, etc. are also great! So, don't miss this one! More fun here than in a baker's dozen of similar films!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T LET THIS UNMEMORABLE MUSICAL HOOD WINK YOU","review":"This musical mix of murder and misadventures between rival crime gangs is agreeable and serviceable. And not very memorable. Frankie isn't acting (give Peter Falk that credit), andit's nice to see the Rat Pack teeming (or is that \\"teaming\\"?) again. Even Der Bingle makes a welcome appearance. The highlight is as vulgar as it is mind-numbing: Sammy Davis Jr.'s rat-a-tat-tatting number in which he dances with various guns, blowing away this and that and offering Sammy Cahn-Jimmy Van Heusen's genius as proof that musical numbers can sometimes silence an audience, if only until their jaws lock back in place.

(if i put them in my review, i'm sure this won't be printed) Dean Martin and Sammy Davis i never really thought as movie stars but more like nightclub entertainers. I respect their work but like all the other Rat Pack movies, this one sucks also.To me, it was just a stupid movie that made no sense, has no value and doesn't contribute anything to the movie musical.

The two songs by the Coffin Daggers are expressive, energetic, ironically humorous, beautifully played, and lovely sounding. They are thick with gorgeous guitar distortion. The rest of the songs are not in the same league, and sound like simplistic garage rock. It makes more sense to get a Coffin Daggers CD. Even the Volcanos (whose own two CDs are sparkling and exciting) sound boring here in a rip-off of the old standard \\"Church Key\\" they call \\"Bad News.\\" I have listened to this CD several dozen times and the bad vibes have grown strong.

Then when I got to chapter 22, my attention was finally caught and I finished it a week later.I do agree that there was way too much rambeling throughout the book. Also it seemed like the aurther was trying to rush the last pages and then there was not enough description. I didn't enjoy the last 5 pages because of that and I felt the story should have ended just a little bit differently.The ending over all was good, but the rest of the story just ruined that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling Alice","review":"I found the book interesting..but weak in content. I can't compare Alice to Ann (whom I've never read) so have an unbiased outlook. I enjoyed most of the historical material; but didn't appreciate how they were all put together. The thing I found most disturbing was the page stretching...there was so much rambling I'm afraid I had to skip a lot of it from boredom. Sometimes I even had to reread a page to figure out where the subjects were. I'm sorry...I loved the idea and the subject matter, but this was not the enjoyable read I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book, though interesting, was not very well written.","review":"The Silver Wolf was not as good as I thought it was going to be. The beginning seemed to be very dragged out, and because of this the end appeared to be somewhat rushed. None of Alice Borchardt's characters were very well developed at all, and the some of the grammar was very poor. I would not recommend this book;although it was interesting and had a great story line, it was poorly developed. However this is just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Having read the books by Sysan Kriniard, I thought that I would get a story line in a similar vein. The main character of this story was very unsure of herself and at constant war with her other self. In addition to that was the overwhelming violence of the uncle and nephew, especially as it related to women. This did not endear me to the author at all. When you add these items to the story taking place in ancient Roman times, this did not make it a great read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"DREADFUL, DREADFUL, DREADFUL. I have never seen such a badly-written load of pap in my entire life. This reads like the worst of amateur fiction. The author has no regard or talent for the art of writing whatsoever. If I had not been on holiday in a non-English-speaking country, and unable to find a single other book at all, I would not even have bothered to finish. I do not recommend this \\"story\\" to anyone with any regard at all for quality literature. Anne Rice's gushing comments on the cover can be, I think, disregarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable","review":"Although I must admit the book started out a little slow, the premise itself was quite intriguing, and that kept me reading. Thank goodness--because the book turned about a lot more interesting and elaborate than I had expected. I love Alice Borchardt's descriptions and the low-key but hilarious humor. I liked how the book kept you guessing (I thought Maeniel was a total wimp at first, but he turned out to be quite the catch,'eh? ;-) and wondering what would happen next. The characters were well-portrayed and had such a real vibrance about them; stereotypes were not played upon. I look forward to reading Ms. Borchardt's next book. One last thing--what's with that Kirkus Review about the book? It says \\"Lucilla, who has eyes for the virgin, also has some secrets of her own: She, too, is a werewolf--and the mother of Maeniel.\\" I had three words for that--\\"WHAT THE HECK?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious writing","review":"This could have been a great book. Alas, it was not. The overuse of flowery prose killed the story and the superfluous adjectives caused me to laugh out loud when I am sure I wasn't supposed to. Ms. Borchardt tried so hard to be poetic and lyrical in the telling, and it is glaringly obvious that she is copying her sister's style. The result is pitiful. The gratuitous, graphic rape and molestation of a young boy early on in the novel should have been grounds for a toss in the trash, but I kept reading, glutton for punishment that I am. I also found the seduction of Regeane by her female mentor to be gratuitous. Overall, this book is insulting and an affront to werewolves everywhere, who should band together and prevent Ms. Borchardt from ever picking up a pen again. Somehow she has been published again and again, though. This is one of the worst books I've ever read, undeserving of all the 5 star reviews and copious praise it has received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Perfect, But Getting Better, A Worthy Read","review":"I had a difficult time getting \\"into\\" this story by Borchardt. I must admit, I bought it because it was recommended by Anne Rice, not knowing Rice was Borchardt's sister. Silly me. But, as I muddled through the first chapters, overlooked some problems in writing style and story line, I actually started to care about the characters and grew intrigued about the storyline. Borchardt tells a beautifully descriptive tale and it did get better as pages turned. I recommend this first segment in the series if only as an introduction to the second book, which is really much better. Probably 3 1/2 stars would be more accurate but this book is definitely better than 3 stars so I gave it 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book that I have ever read","review":"In my search for interesting werewolf books, I came across The Silver Wolf. I tried very hard to continue reading this book, but it became arduous and seemed more like a task than something that I was doing for enjoyment. The lead character of Regeane was so boring and weak in human form that it became impossible to believe that she was a werewolf. I'm sure it was written that way on purpose. This is the first werewolf book I read that NEVER described the form change. It was written as if it just happened, like changing clothes. I had to throw it away about half way through to move onto something else that didn't put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"So she's Ann Rice's sisters, but that doesn't mean she's a good writter as well. I have been looking for a good werewolf book, and I am still looking. The book doesn't even get interesting until the end, where she finally runs into other werewolves. This is where the book actually gets started and the events described on the back cover begin. The whole begging and middle of the book is just of bunch of jibberish. Many details described in the book don't make sense, have nothing to do with the story, and just rambel on forever. And as for romance? Ha! There was none. The aurther needed to write more about the werewolves, and less about leepers, Lucia, and cruel relatives. And as for the story taking place in Rome, that was another unimportant detail. This story could of took place anywhere. DO NOT waste your time reading this horrible and predictable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Pressed to Find Better!","review":"I would like to strongly recommend 'The Silver Wolf.' I read this book about 4-5 months ago; I have not been able to stop thinking about it since then. Only when I bought the book for myself was my longing appeased. Besides the dealing with the supernatural, the scheming and plotting around the fall of the Roman Empire, the encounters with the dead, and the fight against evil, this novel is also a great romance. I am eagerly awaiting the third book of the series! More, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, often clumsy writing","review":"\\"Captain Exposition!!!\\" works overtime in this historical romance/fantasy from Anne Rice's older sister, with characters endlessly rattling on about the back story and history of the characters. Honestly, I've never seen back story so ineptly handled. That Borchardt's editor let it slip past only shows how helpful it is to have a powerful relative in the publishing world.But once the establishing chapters end, the books winds up as a pretty fair piece of historical fantasy. The premise drew my attention to it in the first place: a female werewolf in eighth century Rome caught in the political struggle between the Pope, Charlemagne, and the Lombards. Borchardt writes the werewolf action and expeditions into the spirit world with flair, but often dwells on historical digressions for too long, losing the plot momentum. The story moves in fitful spurts of action and historical scene setting, and would have been a far better work at half the length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking for a good werewolf novel","review":"I didn't buy this book because of the author or who she was related to, but because I resently bought another werewolf book, Moon Dance, and it was a bummer. I was hopeing this would be good, since I am really into werewolves, but at last I found it wasn't. I don't which was worse, Moon Dance or The Silver Wolf. I just hope someone writes a great werewolf book someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book Gets Me Going","review":"This book was the best book I have ever read. I really enjoyed it to the fullest degree. I never put the book down once. The suspence kept me going so I kept at it.

I hope others found this book as intriguing as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good werewolf novel.","review":"I liked this one!

I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS!!","review":"It's a shame that you can't pick zero stars from the menu -- one was the lowest I could give. This book was terrible -- the plot was weak, the history shoddily researched, and the characters were cardboard and completely unappealing. Even the author's attempt at homo-erotica in the book fell flat -- apparently she was trying to cash in on her sister's writing style. Not a very good book -- and it's a little sleazy to have Anne Rice give a wonderful review of the book (she's the author's sister!) -- apparently Anne never actually read Silver Wolf. Just terrible!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I was watching a bad movie","review":"really uneven. basically a bodice-ripper romance novel trying to pass itself off as fine literature (I guess being pretentious runs in the family) -- sorry to be so harsh, the author must havwe put a lot of work into it, because the book weighs like 5 pounds.There were a couple of things I liked about Silver Wolf, but they were pretty well outweighed by the author going on ad nauseum about the heroine's pert breasts and magical silver hair.It is just not my cup of tea, personally. Give me Marion Zimmer Bradley or even Stephen King over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.","review":"This book is tied with another for the all-time worst book I have read. The character development is trite: characters are either very good or very bad. The character's actions are not consistent with their personality and there is a serious lack of continuity. I found myself very hard-pressed to be at all interested in what was going to happen to these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"First in the Legend of the Wolf Series","review":"Alice Borchardt shared a childhood of storytelling with her sister, the best selling novelist Anne Rice, in New Orleans. A professional nurse, she has also nurtured a profound interest in little-known periods of history. She published her debut novel, 'Devoted', in 1995.Regeane is an unwilling pawn in the plotting that is going on in Rome, at the time of Charlemagne. She is betrothed by an uncle she loathes and despises to an unknown barbarian lord. There is little or nothing Regeane can do about it. She is unable to refuse as she knows that her uncle will betray her as a shape-shifting wolf woman. She is strangely drawn to a dark wolf prowling outside the city gates.This is the first in the legend of the Wolf series. There are two more book in the series: Night of the Wolf and the Wolf King. I found this book thoroughly enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"A poetically detailed book with well developed characters","review":"One of the first things that will strike a reader of this book is the beautiful and sensually detailed descriptions Alice gives of the main character's world. The feeling is heightened when described through her eyes, nose, and ears when transformed into a wolf.However, there are times when the pacing almost grinds to a halt. The plot is decent enough and all the characters aside from Regeane and Maeniel tend to be formulaic and lack complexity. Surprisingly Maeniel doesn't get the explosition he deserves in this book. He is mentioned in the beginning and is later reintroduced after more than halfway through the book. It's good that the sequel talks about him more.All in all, a good read, but not nearly as exciting as it could have been. However, the book has some truly memorable moments (visit to the land of the dead, ending battle, Regeane's encounter with the pack) that give good testament to the imagination of Alice Borchardt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"At the time I read this novel, I was completely unaware that she was Anne Rice's sister. Thankfully so. Where Anne Rice's novel seem to slowly devolved in strength, imagery and plot, The Silver Wolf did not. Admittedly, there was the sensation of plunging halfway into a Harlequin Romance. However, the strength of the heroine was worth while. Even though the vision of history the book presents is skewed and at times less than accurate, the presentation causes that vision to be of an alternate world. I reccomend the book highly, over Anne Rice's later works."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not so good","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I was excited to start reading it because it looked really interesting. I was very disappointed. The story felt very one dimensional. None of the characters to me seemed to have any depth. I never felt I knew any reason why the characters acted one way or another. The plot was absolutely predictable, there were gaps, and the narrative seemed to jump around all the time. In all honestly I got to frustrated a little over half way in and skipped ahead to the end. The end was exactly what I expected. I very rarely skip ahead in a book, I will struggle through bad book in hopes it will get better, but this one was just not good enough for that. Anyways if someone is looking for a good read this is not the book to find it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not run in the family.","review":"I picked up the book because I read Anne Rice's books. Hit of miss, I pick her titles up in hard cover, as more often than not, they are enjoyable reads. When I found out her sister wrote a series of books, I thought I would give them a try. I did not expect them to be the same, I was just hoping for a good told tale.I was able to get 104 pages into the paperback version of this title before I gave up. I could not care about \\"our heroine.\\" I kept hoping I would get some sense of a plot. I never did. I never got the direction the book was going in. It read to me as if the writer had an idea, but was allowed to go with a first draft.I don't usually give up on a book, but there were too many switchbacks in those 100 pages and I simply stopped caring about Regeane. It lacked \\"something\\" a story needs to hold a reader - that piece of a story, or mystery in a plot that makes you keep reading.

All My Friends Are Superheroes is about a guy named Tom, who marries a superhero, but at their wedding, his wife is hypnotized to believe he's invisible and nothing he can do can make her see him. After six months, she believes that Tom's abandoned her, so she flies to Vancouver to start a new life. He has until the plane touches down in Vancouver to get her to see that he's not invisible or he'll lose her forever. Tom's friends are all superheroes, like The Projectionist, Wild Mood Swinger, The Sloth, or my favourite, Fifth Business, so you can see how much fun this book will be. Plus, Tom hangs out at a lot of the places I've hung out at in Toronto and he lives near my neighbourhood, so it was kind of like reading about someone I know. You can also read it in about an hour and it will be the most fun you'll have reading a book in an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Variety","review":"Shot in one long continuous take (hence the title), 'Real Time' creates surprising levels of tension as the viewer is dragged through 15 locations, tagging along with a gang of foul-mouthed creeps as they pull off a heist and, one by one, knock each other off. The choreography of the camera takes center stage, its forward-thinking ingenuity contrasting greatly with the crass stupidity of the greedy, rats-in-a-maze characters.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great posthumous release of Badfinger member'demos","review":"A great album. This allows fans of Badfinger to hear a variety of demo recordings made to improve his songcraft and submit for the band's albums. There are number of classics here and producer Dan Matovina has done a great job of \\"touching up\\" these demos. Among the highlights is the potential hit single \\"Hand in Hand\\", the original acoustic demo for \\"No Matter what\\" and a superior demo version of the song \\"Matted spam\\". Most of these songs were either never recorded by Badfinger, or unreleased demos recording shortly before Pete Ham's death. This album, along with his Badfinger recordings, highlights the unique talent that Pete had. For those with a bit more cash, the Japanese version had 5 bonus tracks that are well worth the additional expense if you are a Badfinger fan. If you're not sure, sample the Amazon recordings and make your decision prior to ordering. This great album deserves 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Badfinger was never a group that could coast on their talent. While Ham and Molland could pen some great songs, they were few and far between, and some of the recording techniques were what made some marginal songs great. This CD is evidence that not all songs that Ham wrote were gems. The result here is very uneven and the sound quality is poor. Yes, we know it was recorded on a a reel-to-reel as demos, but with the technology available today, much more could have been done to make update the quality. Sorry, it wasn't up to standards, and I'm sure Pete would have been embarrassed by its release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work with compact fluorescent lights!","review":"Anything that uses an electronic ballast (light the compact fluorescent lights - CFLs) will not work with this device. That's because the device looks at the peak current to figure out the watts. For example, a CFL that actually uses 13 or 14 watts will erroneously show up as using 65 watts. That's because the crappy meter sees a maximum of 0.5 amps of current, but most of the time the CFL is drawing much less current. This device only refreshes about twice a second and cannot see a current that is pulsed faster than that. It will work fine for anything that uses a constant level of current, like a fan, toaster, etc. Also keep in mind that the packaging itself says it is only accurate from 125 - 1875 watts. That means anything using less that 125 watts might not show up very accurate. There are much better devices out there, like the Kill-a-Watt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent product, simple to use and it does what it's supposed to.

The digital readout is clear and quite accurate as specifified by manufacturer's specification sheet. This load tester is well worth the price as compared to other Load testers on the market that can cost up to $150.00. Also for all you that are trying to conserve energy, this device can show how much all your appliances and electronic equiptment draws power while on standby mode. Be informed and stop wasting money and watts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised.","review":"This works as advertised. I bought this to test the amps and watts of items that I planned on hooking to a generator. There are better watt/amp load testers available, but none are as easy to use as this. If you are not very experienced with electricity, but still need to find the amperage (or wattage), then this is for you. You simply plug this in the wall and the appliance into the plug on the back of the unit (you cant see it in the picture but its there). Then just take the reading,its that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to use","review":"For the most part I am very satisfied with the meter. I wish I had something I could test it with to verify its accuracy. A supposedly 1500 watt microwave tested at just under 1700. My new George Foreman grill(760 watts) tested at 730. I replaced almost all my lighting in my house with the new energy efficient bulbs. A bulb equivalent to a 100 watt incandescent bulb that supposedly uses about 30 watts tested at 85(a real bummer for me as I spent quite a bit to replace so many incandescents). A 60 watt incandescent tested at 59. I'm of the opinion it is an accurate meter, that's why 4 stars. A way to verify it would really boost my opinion of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"I have two problems with this tool:1. When I have the selector on \\"Amps\\" the last digit is supposed to be a decimal. So where is the dot then?! E.g. the display shows 37 instead of 3.7 (you wouldn't want to have 37A running through your circuits at home, trust me). Perhaps I just have a bad one, but I doubt it because LCD segments don't normally burn like LED segments.2. The display is updated too often jumping from one value to the other all the time. It's really annoying. The refresh rate should be longer, e.g. every 2-4 seconds. This is a design flaw done by people who probably did not understand well what AC is.I was going to buy a Reliance transfer switch for my generator but in view of the poor quality of their tools I'll buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for checking some \\"energy vampire\\" low wattage items","review":"This appears to be a very durable ammeter, that's why I purchased it instead of the \\"Kill-a-watt\\", but forget checking those small transformers (wall-warts) or other very low current appliances. This seems to be unreliable somewhere around 20 watts or less, which was a disappointment in checking out so many of these types of devices around the home. Obviously, it also does not have the capability of checking usage over time like the Kill-a-watt, but you should know that going in on this deal. Overall, this tester appears to do what it advertises, very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"RV power monitoring made easy!","review":"I have a 34 ft Travel Trailer and a new Yamaha Generator. This device hooked up between my trailer and Generator gave me valuable information. We used more power than I had anticipated and kept overloading generator.

This album/CD is loaded with entrancing blends of beats, chants / raps (English and non-English), grooves that will make you want to move your body -- whether you choose to or not. The track \\"Get Up\\" makes you do just that. It is a great example of the many energetic compositions. This volume definitely has heavy Indian influences - the traditional instruments blend perfectly with modern electric dance beats.

It is the same item and quality that you would buy in any sporting store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important tool","review":"How a powder trickler works is pretty simple and seemingly standard among the different manufacturers so I am not so sure that this is significantly better than any other trickler but it is solid and allows you to add just the smallest bit of additional powder which is what it is designed to do. It is built pretty solidly and I think that it would be difficult to wear it out in a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"most strongly recommended for clarinet concerto","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who comments on the wonderful tone of the clarinet soloist. The others are good but this one stands out. The orchestra is fine and acceptably imaged in the recording. This is an excellent disc that is easy to recommend. Edit: I have found since writing this a collection of these works I prefer on Deutche Grammophone on one of their \\"Trio\\" collections by Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Particularly the bassoon and oboe soloists on that recording are better in my opinion and the orchestral textures are lighter -- more appropriate to Mozart in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depression","review":"This book contains a clinical look at depression. This book defines depression, symptoms, medications, etc. During the author's research, clinical trials were performed and the subject's responses are included in the reading. This book was a slow read and it was hard to identify with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meisner is not for everyone","review":"I read this book in anticipation, hoping that he would inspire his actors. I found Meisner to be condescending and quite negative. Like another reader's review, I just couldn't finish the book. The impression I got from the book, is that Meisner is an emotionally, psychologically unstable person. He seemed to be a person who had serious problems and taking it out on his students. His technique may work for some. Personally, I have found \\"other techniques\\" more useful and helpful. I suggest \\"The Chubbuck Technique\\" by Ivana Chubbuck or \\"How to Stop Acting\\" by Harold Guskin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Thank God that I bought this book at a very low price through one of the retailers. Because it was horrible. I only read about half-way through the book because it was very painful. I felt a lot of the infomation he taught was very repetitive. It all depends on what you want, I just didn't like his whole process and learning techniques, they were driving me nuts. But I never took a meisner-technique class. But I wonder, the only way this technique works if you have a partner. What if you're doing a one-man show, or practicing a monologue. I just know that I never got an emotional connection with this book. It was very painful as I said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Guide to the technique of acting","review":"Sanford Meisner's \\"On Acting\\" is an excellent book for the actor. This book can benefit someone new to acting as well as a individuals with acting experience. The book goes through each lesson from the beginning of his course and gives instructions for exercises to guide the actor toward a progression of more and more complex acting problems. Ultimately the goal here is to have his students understand how a sound technique can help them to experience a deeper level of expression. His method also guides the student work toward a more truthful and meaningful development of character ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I couldn't even finish this book. Meisner makes acting (acting school in this case) sound like an absolute nightmare!The book's setting is an acting school, where he is (supposedly) training students to be actors. Instead, he keeps letting students go despite their dedication to their craft, and deciding for them they just \\"aren't cut out to be actors\\".While I thought some of his insight on acting was helpful (living truthfully under given imaginary circumstances); I found the book negative, condescending, and discouraging. Awful, actually. There are much better books about acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sadist teaching people how to not live","review":"i couldn't finish this book. meisner's negative energy just got to me. now, i'll grant you, he's probably a great acting teacher, perhaps the best, but what is he really teaching people how to do? he says it's how to become deeply vulnerable, to really get to their core emotional stuff...but for what purpose? i just got a really bad feeling about this guy's energy, the feeling that he's a disturbed person acting out his own childhood traumas on his pupils, over whom he wields a huge amount of power through his authority.i thought to myself while reading this that if meisner is the best (and i wouldn't doubt that he is), i never want to become an actor.i'd rather just live my life...and when i do get to my emotional core issues, it's not to exploit them for better acting, but for my own personal growth...as a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard Slog","review":"I had anticipated being as excited about this book as I was about Harold Guskin's \\"How to Stop Acting,\\" but Dennis Longwell's \\"you are there\\" approach to capturing Meisner and his technique is almost impenetrable and, worse, reveals an unbearable egotist - preening, dismissive, often cruel to his students. This was baffling considering the gushing comments on the back cover.I read 2/3 of the book and couldn't finish it. It was too painful. I hope the students Meisner dismissed from class (and humiliated in the process) had enough sense of their own ability to continue acting.I strongly recommend Guskin's book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it!","review":"This book was just what I needed and got it when I needed it.

If you haven't read that book, by all means, go ahead and read this one. After this one is completed, give the other a read as it helps refine what some passages were in this book. The Meisner technique is incredibly fascinating and should be studied by anyone who considers themselves an actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"This is an excellent book if you are serious about acting. This book will become a good reference tool. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very welcome book.","review":"This book offers much insight to meisner's technique and his own teaching style, as it is given directly by him. Because it's written as a third-person master class, it isn't very direct at times, but the benefits of this book greatly outweigh that. I particularly liked that Meisner includes brief personal moments and thoughts from his life outside the classroom in every chapter and you can truly see how he feels about each student's progress. I also feel this book is a very good companion to the DVD \\"Sanford Meisner Master Class.\\" I wouldn't recommend this to someone completely new to the Meisner technique, but it is very helpful to those who want to look farther into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No puedo","review":"La movie me llego broken por lo tanto no pude mirarla entonces no puedo opinar hacerca de la movie. tuve que regresar la movie.

So then, I decided to use it on my face as a moisturizer and I hardly ever breakout anymore.. It also keeps my nails from breaking and they are actually growing healthier than when I was going to the nail salon every two weeks. I thought my nails were a hopeless case.

Without Lee's leadership and calming actions after his surrender the country would have experienced a continueing cival war for decades. Nothing was mentioned of his refusal of financial gain or his constant calming effects on his former officers and troops. I would expect a more balanced portrayal from PBS.....but I guess they have lost their perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillussioned PBS Viewer","review":"From the opening words of this biography, as the reader in solemn tones recited Lee's Oath of Allegiance upon accepting his military commission, it was transparent that the film sought to besmirch the man. I by no means am an expert on the Civil War, but I have read a few serious books on the subject. Those accounts bear no resemblance to the tripe presented in this biased, politicized \\"documentary.\\" Ironically, PBS has inspired me to read definitive biographies on Lee written by true historians interested in truth rather than their own political views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this product but not surprised. They obviously gave a negative spin to the life of Robert E. Lee and, in my opinion, misrepresented his real positions on the great issues of his day. Also in my opinion, this was a perpetuation of the Northern myths of the history of the War for Southern Independence rather than a fair presentation of both sides. Fortunately there are still plenty of resources for people seriously interested in the truth of Lee and the South. Three good resources, for starters, are \\"R.E. Lee\\" by Douglas Southall Freeman (or Richard Harwell's abridgement), \\"The South Was Right\\" by Walter D. and James R. Kennedy and \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War\\" by H.W.

Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme negative bias","review":"There was a lot of revisionist \\"history\\" here.

They use the internal APIs of Tomcat and then successively implement the various components. As the book progresses the components become more and more complete.This is a good way of learning about a piece of software. I'd love more books to follow this format.

The desk only had two coats of paint, the original beige (no primer) and a quick spray of black by somebody else who own the desk at some point.I poured the stripper over a section of the metal desk and let it stand 15 minutes and nothing happened. After 30 minutes about 10 percent of the paint covered by the stripper rubbed off with a plastic scrapper, but it wasn't down to bare metal. It barely removed the light coating of black spray paint. There was no curling up or bubbling of paint disolving.For my purpose the stripper didn't perform what it was advertised to do. It was very disappointing.I got better results wet ssanding the desk with 180 grit sand paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless.

This was not up to the job. i made two attemps. followed the instructions. it says it will work in 15 minutes. put a thick layer on and after 35 minutes nothing budged. And i've already sanded layers off. On the second attempt i put a massively thick layer on and left it for two hours. Not even a single spec of paint came off when scraping. it didn't bubble, or curl one drop. my saliva would have done more damage.

There are other fine approaches to it: Kertesz, Kubelik, Neumann, etc., but none with the sheer inner glow of this one.Symphony 9 is also gorgeously played and powerfully laid out. There are scores of good recordings of this piece, including a wonderful bargain from Kertesz and the Vienna Phil, as well Karajan's own Viennese recording. This is a worthy and lyrical one. At the price it is well worth it and the sound is rich and lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Karajan, this is for you. If not...","review":"Karajan has a tendency to conduct every symphony as if it were Beethoven's 9th -- the music must start almost inaudibly like a faint hum and (very) gradually take shape and emerge. While this approach is effective for, say, Bruckner symphonies, it does not work very well for the New World Symphony. This particular recording of the piece takes an extremely long time to get off the ground -- when the low strings make their entrance, going back and forth between the brasses, the orchestra sounds like it's swimming in molasses.The Eighth Symphony is done better, though almost by necessity; the music just happens to be bouncier than the Ninth, so there's less room for excessive rubato."},{"rating":"2","title":"FCLG the best of PAULA LIMA & Co.","review":"I received this CD straigh from Paula Lima herself.

Bernard Cornwell, Marion Bradley, and Stephen Lawhead do come close. Llywelyn's characters are fully and properly heroic without unpleasantly swollen machismo. Not only is this a highly literate novel, it's also a grand romping adventure. This author has a special knack for capturing the humanity without slighting the history and this dramatic, yet quiet sensitivity is always compelling and soul-satisfying. If you enjoy the works of those authors mentioned above, you'll like this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read the reviews about this book and was excited to receive my book and start the read. I enjoy the history and myths of Ireland and Scotland and thought this would be right up my alley. I found the book to be very average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"Depending on your taste this is can be an excellent book, it is seemingly one sided and if your on the side of the Celts you will enjoy it emmensly. Llywelyn is great at writing historical novels and she even includes a short bibliography at the end.This book is about the adventures of a young druid named Anviar, we see him bloom from childhood into man hood and eventually into a wise coulcilor. She ties this in with the hisrotical story of Vercingtrix and the struggle between Ancient Gual and Rome. She doesnt give much explanation of Ceasor and the Romans, they are the bad guys and that is all the reader is given. Llywelyn knows much about Ancient Celtic lore and proves it in this novel, she doesnt depict the Druids as the usualy mythological creatures that only work great magic and travel the lands looking to raise the next hero, she shows their humanistic side; Ainviars jealousy of Rix, Anviars inablility to bring all the people he wants back from the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling read","review":"I was drawn into the world of the mysterious druids from page one. This story is told through the eyes of Ainvar, a druid initiate of the Carnutes of Gaul. I felt that the characters were well developed, and what most people do not realize is that ancient societies were very sophisticated. They were still ruled by superstition, but they weren't \\"cave-men\\" so to speak. Too many stories are told through the eyes of the victor and not the conquered. Bravo to Ms. Llywelyn for telling their story!Ms. Llywelyn used historical facts in the writing of this novel. Though much is not known about the druids, I feel she really brought their shadowed world to life.Druids is filled with magic, history and compassion for a conquered people. Her poetic writing style called out to me. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in ancient history or the way of the druids. You know who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great.","review":"I read this book years ago and was impressed with the mastery at which Llywelyn writes around a culture that has no written history, yet maintains numerous oral rumors and myths. I especially enjoyed looking at the fictional side of the northern people's view of the invasion by Caesar. Remember the conquest of Gaul and all the things written about their \\"pagan\\" ways came from their enemy. Hmmm.....makes the truth of the history questionable doesn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly magical and memorable","review":"Easily the best work of Morgan Llywelyn's so far.

It's certainly one of my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a book that treat the Druids correctly","review":"Morgan Llywelyn has put the ancient religion of Druidism into the present, A story well told, with much accuracy.

This book is the best presented of any on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best book I've read this year!","review":"'Druids' is by far the best historical novel on the celtic druids I have ever read.

I applaud Morgan and look forward to future books by her!Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great historical novel.","review":"DRUIDS takes place in Gaul when Rome (Caesar) is trying to conquer it.

I was wrong. It is an intelligently-contrived heresy. It is counterfeit truth. If I were to write a fabricated treatise on the nature of reality and mankind's place in the universe, I would borrow heavily from the Bible, but twist the text, while building upon well-established New Age lies and so-called esoteric knowledge. This book does that in spades. It's amazing to me that so many people can embrace this trash with such conviction. The Bible says that in the days before Christ's return, mankind will be sent a great delusion, and that people will replace the truth with the doctrines of demons. It seems to me that this process is well underway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining as Fiction, repulsive as nonfiction.","review":"If one takes this work as fictional approach to secret societies and intrigue therein, then the book is entertaining. BUT this individual wants us to take his work as a piece of non-fiction.

His original organization was in southern Illinois, called the Stelle Group. Apparently he is no longer associated with the Stelle Group.He claims association with the Ascended Masters and White Brotherhood both Satanic in origin.I heard him personnaly speak in 1975 when he made false prophecies about coming world catastrophic events in 1977 - obviously they didn't happen.His group and others like it are New Age deceivers taking advantage of the gullibility of those seeking spiritual enlightenment and not knowing where to look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there.

Read with caution.","review":"I read the book in 1969 and became involved with the Stelle Group for the next five years--until the author/leader was exposed as a regular human of questionable integrity; was expelled; and went off to start his Adelphi project in Texas. The Great White Brotherhood stories presented in the book were allegedly learned by the author during his involvement with the same organization in Southern California that Elizabeth Clair Prophet sprang from. None of this material is new to anyone who has studied the esoteric traditions. Standard Masonic, Illuminati Grand Plan drama reading. Helpful, insightful, but of questionable relevance to the author and his projects. The author does a good job of casting himself as a significant player."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold emesis","review":"I read the first edition in 1968.My friends moved to the failed Stelle community.The book helped me to start investigating.The Ultimate Frontier has about as much credibilty as the T.Lobsang Rampa books.If you want to persue an investigative path, read what Zecharia Sitchin has published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love Indie movies and this is one of them.

Loved the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes reincarnation believable to my Midwest mind.","review":"This book makes a compelling argument in favor of reincarnation. William Walker Atkinson, an insightful and comprehensive writer, makes a convincing case for the 'unknowable' through rational and intelligent reasoning. Atkinson does this by presenting history, natural laws and by disputing arguments against reincarnation and karma. Reincarnation And The Law Of Karma reads as if it were written today but surprisingly it was originally published more than 100 years ago. Although I had already somewhat come to grips with the possible/plausible doctrine of reincarnation and karma before reading this book, I have now included reincarnation as one of my profound beliefs since reading this book. If we are open minded and have our truth radar switched on we find teachers come from unlikely sources and speak to discerning souls like a Buddha. These teachers sometimes wait for us in free kindle books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"The book does not give you the biography of the author. I Googled it, and found out that he was from the past century. The book enlightens me a lot on Hinduism, but he shouldn't try to explain the Orient philosophy regardless of how short the article was, if it was not true.Like many spiritual books, they all talk about different layers of heaven.

Other reviewers have made valid critical comments about the vocalists' styles, accents and so forth, all things to bear in mind I suppose. For pure listening pleasure, however, this CD set has been the winner for me. There are moments where the singing does seem slightly \\"modern\\" and probably not historically accurate for a century old piece, but somehow I feel as if Debussy himself would be fine with this. His music, particularly much of this vocal music, is so forward looking that it practically beckons the new. Sonically the recording is sweet - a good amount of natural room reverberation and well balanced piano sound that never intrudes.

No offense, but the original was a crapfest with the only redeeming quality being able to see what Bruce Willis looks like when he acts while asleep.

Her words are stark and striking, and her storytelling is mesmerizing. After meeting Aneita Jean, I wanted to go back through the years and get acquainted with my own grandmothers, hear their stories and live vicariously. I felt an intimate attachment to the memoir, as I grew up in Newell, WV, and currently reside in Chester, and my parents live on Phoenix Avenue across from Aneita Jean's childhood home. I frequented Thornberry's store, growing up in the 70's, and I still think about it every time I drive through the town and see the building that once housed the store. I was a bit taken aback by some of the harsh assessments Glock levied on WV and Hancock County, but I understand that is her truths, and Aneita Jean's, but not necessarily mine (I escaped for 15 years but found myself yearning to return, so I did).

What is this strange relationship with the angel of her eye and ultimate perfection, Laura? Why can't a character that wants to go to Harvard actually speak the English language? And for that matter, why can't the author use the English language and communicate with the poor, beleaguered readers?

First of all, the book lacks a plot and does not seem to have any purpose except for the narrator's incoherent descriptions and actions. The random characters don't seem to add anything to the plot either.Another pitfall of this book is that the syntax is mutilated to the point of incomprehensibility. Many times I had to re-read a sentence because of the strange order of words and long sentences split by the incorrect use of commas. To make matters worse, the author does not use quotation marks, which leads to more confusion.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK OR READ IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plodding mess","review":"Having read and enjoyed 'Ellen Foster\\", I never really got around to this sequel until recently when I found it in a dollar store [that itself should have been a hint]. This is a plodding read and is set a couple of years after the last book. Ellen has grown up but her life is less interesting than in the previous book.

It rambles and the voice isn't as clear and as perfect as it was in the original.

Why I read that far I don't know. I guess I hoped it would start to come together into some kind of coherent story. Rambling is a pefect description. Some of the sentences were so disjointed and nonsensical it almost seems like Ms Gibbons is trying (I say trying) to write poetry rather than a novel.

WHILE THEY SEEM LIKE LIFE SAVERS, THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE. THEY DON'T WARM A LARGE AREA, IE THE WHOLE FOOT, ONLY SMALL PORTION OF THE TOP OF THE FOOT. ALSO YOU ALMOST HALF THE TIME GET NON WORKING WARMERS, I HAVE BOUGHT MANY GERBER WARMERS AS WELL AS OTHER BRANDS, AND I FIND THAT THEY WORK ALMOST ONLY 50% OF THE TIME. I DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE BECAUSE THE BATCH IS OLD OR THEY SHIFT TO MUCH IN SHIPPING. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY ON THESE PRODUCTS. I HAVE FOUND WHILE IN EXTREME COLD WEATHER THICK WOOL SOCKS OR EVEN PRICEY BATTERY POWERED HEATED SOCKS WORK BEST. JUST REMEMBER TO CHANGE SOCKS CONSTANTLY TO AVOID TRENCH FOOT, AND FROST-BITE.

Poulenc was one of the very greatest songwriters of any era. If you have no Poulenc songs in your collection, start here. The recommendation of Kruysen is a fine one, but only after you have heard this as a basis of comparison. Of Ameling, Senechal, Souzay, Gedda, and Parker, the only disappointment is Parker, who - I'll just say it - sings with his usual bleat. Souzay is a shade past it in vocal quality, but he still understands these songs as well as anybody, with great declamation (and that, after all, is what most of French singing is about). The dryness of the voice is nowhere close to disastrous, as it might have been in Italian opera. Indeed, it lends an air of life lived, without excuses. Gedda is okay. The standouts are Souzay, Ameling, and Senechal. Baldwin accompanies superbly."},{"rating":"1","title":"the best songs ever ruined by uneven performing","review":"This is a warning for all Poulenc fans NOT to take the bargain route and purchase this immense collection -- you might think you're getting a great deal but: the singing and pianism is substandard and doesn't do the music justice (remotely). Songs like Bonne Journe'e or Ho^tel are all but ruined... Here's what to buy: Bernard Kruysen's CD of selected Poulenc masterpieces (favoring the Elouard settings)... nobody will ever come close to Kruysen in interpreting Poulenc. Avoid THIS CD. They still get 2 stars for (1) being encyclical and (2) delivering clear and even sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Impossible Mission for the Commandos","review":"The excitement in this story rocks. The Black Eagles, a CIA backed commando unit in Vietnam is sent on a POW rescue mission. That's the easy part. They're also given the job of bringing back the prison commander and the Korean brainwashing expert working on the POWs. Throw in a battalion of Vietnamese soldiers and various VietCong guerillas hunting them and you have a mission from hell. The Black Eagles blast their way through the jungles to accomplish their mission. This series in one of the best in the action/adventure genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should see this film.","review":"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Emotionally charged and terrifyingly true, BALLOT MEASURE 9's greatest achievement is that Heather McDonald deftly connects other marginalized groups to the anti-gay initiative in Oregon, showing how all people are oppressed when one group is singled out for discrimination, no matter what the rationale. I would recommend this film especially to straight people who don't understand what gay men and lesbians are going through all over the country -- quite literally, a fight for our lives. My (straight) parents' attitudes were forever changed by this film and so will you be. BALLOT MEASURE 9 will make you scream with anger in a world full of fear and ignorance, but it will also shout for joy at the hope and love and possibilities revealed in this incredible fight for a real democracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love this movie!","review":"My 2 daughters and 6 year old son watched this movie 3 times on their snow day yesterday.

McKenna deals with difficulties in academics although she is an excellent gymnast. She then has an injury and learns to cope with regaining lost skills. Most importantly, McKenna gains a new friend who is a school mate in a wheelchair. This child is portrayed as the competent young woman she is. McKenna's wisdom increases through the experience, and the viewer is left with the recognition that the girl who uses a wheelchair for mobility is NOT a victim and does not need pity. Excellent message and well-presented. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate Involving Gymnastics","review":"This movie is very factually incorrect involving ALL the aspects of gymnastics. Regional team? No such thing. Her skills did not add up in the least, one moment doing level 9 skills, then everyone is cheering for a level 6 leap. Her parents would NEVER have run out onto the floor so immediately after taking a fall that at least \\"appeared\\" benign. It is a fine movie, but they should have at least attempted to be factual in some cases, such as the gymnastics. Also, If a gymnast actually took their eyes AWAY from the beam to look at her coach during their routine, well, no WONDER she broke her ankle! No dur! And changing her routine? That would NEVER happen in a million years. She never warmed up those skills, so, once again, she kind of ASKED to break her ankle, by practicing unsafe gymnastics.Overall, completely inaccurate, but if you don't care about the gymnastics, its relatively stupid anyway. The acting is actually very good, though. Props there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor Purchase Options","review":"My daughter loves this movie, and the American Girl message is a good one on the whole. However, when I purchased this, I thought I was purchasing the digital rights to this movie. Instead, all I can do is play it on our TiVo. That means when the TiVo is gone, so is the movie.

Dealing with the tough issues of war, prostitution, incest and grand society you get an insiders view of what boils beneath the surface of this family's business. The Grand strips away the romanticized view of the Roaring Twenties and leaves you at times wanting to turn away because it can be just too much realism, yet captivated because it is so human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"I watched the entire collection of this former TV series and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We also tested some and found that they did not damage the wall at all when we tried to remove them. We haven't tried them on the ceiling yet, but I think they will work fine. The only reason I'm giving this four stars is just because I'm sort of indifferent to this kind of thing and, since this is my first experience with glow stars, perhaps there are better stars out there and I just don't know about them.

You just have to be careful to use only the smallest amount necessary. The stars are still glowing brightly every night.I wish there had been more of the larger stars and a few less of the really small ones. Realistically, if you covered your ceiling with stars, it would look cool to have tons of super small ones, but it is a pain to get them all up!We're probably going to order another pack of these for our daughter's room since she loves looking at them on her older brother's ceiling. This kit comes at a great price and the stars are high-quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly researched and interesting","review":"Timely and thoroughly researched, with enough historical data and information to keep the reader interested in the focus of the work. Very well-written and provides the reader with a full examination of the women's movement and cultural/socio-economic and political obstacles and challenges facing women of every walk of life. Even if you're not a big feminist, you'll enjoy the approachability of this book and how it frames issues facing modern women as they try to balance the realities of aging in a looks based society. Many readers, particularly women, will enjoy the writer's approach to the subject matter as it relates to a growing population of older and, thus, disenfranchised women seeking a sense of community in a society that places value on youth culture, even as it denies the inevitable fate we all face-aging and death. This book handles those intractable facts of life with a dignified intellectual honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":".

If I could give it a \\"0\\" I would because this abomination is a horrible remake of the Duran Duran classic. The concept was bad enough, but to have Naimee Coleman provide the vocals was the biggest mistake. Her vocals are flat and weak - I've never heard a worse vocal dance tune. I hope she has a day job because I'll never support anything she does. The only two mixes included were the radio edit and the Above & Beyond Mix, and even this talented duo could not save \\"Ordinary World\\" from disaster.This easily walks away with my vote for worst tune of 2000. Hopefully for future releases Aurora decides to release original material (without the vocals of Ms. Coleman) for the sakes of people who will still listen to them (I won't, they've totally lost my respect).

Sherman gives tips on how to best equip yourself, aside of course from that GPS. These are mostly traditional common sense guidelines for anyone hiking.One thing you can get from the book is that aside from the geocaching, nowadays pure hiking has changed. Many hikers bring along GPS for safety and convenience. Some traditionalists look with askance on this, however.Readers might recall how GPS was originally developed by the US military, and when GPS devices were heavy and expensive. Here is yet another instance of a military spinoff that followed Moore's Law and added on popular civilian usages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti- Italian racist crap","review":"This book is anti-Italian racist garbage.

But I feel that the book is far from in the truth as any sci-fi book I have read in the past. The book outlays personal Spirits and ways in which we can find our indigenous soul. I worry that in Martin Prechtels search he lost sight of what he was looking for.If you are looking for a book that will through you into a vivid world of imagination and full of exciting metaphors and mental illustrations this is the book for you.However if the book details the beliefs of the Tzutujil people correctly I seriously doubt the fact of him publicizing about them.

Since the phone is not plugged in to a power outlet (the LCD is run from batteries), I thought replacing the batteries would solve the problem. Not so.Eventually, the LCD display became unreadable (not something you want for CallerID).

Based on the evidence here he spent the next thirty years forgetting everything he learned. This Mikado has the same problems that can be found in most of his EMI recordings, and even the later D'Oyly Carte Princess Ida - it is simply too slow and too meticulous to give any sense of fun. The singers all give the impression that they are slumming and would rather be doing Fidelio. The acoustic is annoyingly ambient.Give this one a miss and instead check out either Mackerras on Telarc or the excellent and underrated D'Oyly Carte set on Sony. Sargent is about as much fun as sitting in a mud puddle on a cold afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Singing, senza Dialog","review":"I have become quite a fan of Gilbert & Sullivan operettas. Currently I own 4 of the Malcolm Sargent recordings on EMI (Pirates, HMS, Mikado & Gondoliers) and love them all. Why? The singing is breathtakingly beautiful. I especially enjoy tenor Richard Lewis' contribution in each set. Some reviewers have found the \\"tempi slow\\" in this Mikado, but this is not evident to me. I find this Mikado quite entertaining. The only thing I wish it had (and the others in this series) is the dialog. Afterall, the dialog helps relay the story and contains Gilbert's wit, which is just as enjoyable as Sullivan's wonderul music. For dialog you need to turn to the London/Decca recordings with the D'Oyly Carte Company conducted by Isidore Godfrey, which are very fine as well. To be honest, I would not want to be without either the EMI or London recordings, since each has it's own merits. If possible, get both as I have done.

A fun read for anyone whether you're liberal or conservative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring it on, Katherine Black!","review":"It's about time someone countermanded Ann Coulter, and to do it with the opposite approach of the right-wingers, namely humor, is a fantastic way to show the \\"Idiocy!\\" of a simpleminded segment of the population.I especially liked the author's simulated interview with President Bush in Chapter 15. I wish it had been the first chapter! Just the fact that every answer he gave to her journalistic inquiries was an actual quote, is all anyone needs to know about the conservative mindset that would \\"elect\\" him and support our current leadership.I'm a liberal and the next time someone teases me about it I will direct them to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good add to my collection","review":"I recieved the item and was not disappointed.

When I found out there was a DVD for the shorts, I bought this volume 1 addition. It wasn't all the ones I remembered, though. It sort of disappointed me there were more volumes you had to but to find the ones you remember NOT on the disc. So if you're a fan of the \\"Elves and the Shoemaker\\" or \\"Snow White and Rose Red\\" this isn't one you should consider. But if you like say \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" or \\"The Magic Fish\\" this isn't a bad buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Funny as I remember","review":"When I was young I thought this show was really funny but now it just seems silly.

I have played this game a few hours and its very entertaining, and challenging. The AI is smart enough for most people, maybe not for a few \\"geniuses\\" in the reviews who beat every tournament in a few hours. If they were that smart, I would be playing live tournaments getting rich, just a little thought.I have won about 3 tournaments in this game, but believe me, they're hard. I highly recommend it.P.D. There's plenty of tournaments and if you play all of them, you advance to next year's.One minor flaw, the \\"ambience\\" sound sucks.

GREAT to see BRAD BIRD (INCREDIBLES) talk about the guys who built Disney. The film looks prestine and sounds GREAT too. My only complaint is the cover. This BAD Air brush art has to stop! Why doesn't DISNEY use the original poster art that the DISNEY STUDIO took much care in creating...instead of using this CHEAP looking, badly airbrushed art that looks like a high school art student created?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgot how great this movie is","review":"Huge Disney fan, but often cite the movies from the 90s as my favorite and forget how good some of these true classics are.

The story is timeless, the music is charming and we're absolutely wild about Jaq and Gus!The bonus features on this DVD are okay. The background/history was interesting. Otherwise, I was unimprssed with the bonus music, etc. But then, bonus features for older movies are rarely terrific because the original cast / staff is typically unavailable for interview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella still rocks!","review":"I gave this to my son's fiance -- she is 24 years old, and still adores this movie!

The reason I gave this movie 4 stars was because it's certainly not one of the most entertaing movies Disney has made. A very stiff movie, but a very lovely fairytale classic.

I want to watch this movie in either wide screen or full and not in a box. It looks like the movie is being seen through a computer monitor.

Both discs fail to play in the new player. The video is garbled throughout substantial portions of each of the discs (though in different locations). I give up.

While it is not my favorite version (Rogers and Hammerstein's 1965 made for TV with Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon gets the top spot), the Disney version can be enjoyed by people of all ages and now that you can watch these classic films on DVD, I definitely recommend that you do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get the blu ray disc to play in my blu ray player","review":"I have had other blu ray discs.

I am a wasp sucked dry.\\" The large majority of the collected poems conveyed to me this same sense of remorse, guilt and anguish, perhaps \\"comforting\\" to some who share similar trials.

And not in a good way! I tend not to like latter-day Holmesian stories of this stripe, but I truly read this one with an open heart and again and again I cringed and shook my head at one mistake after another. How anyone can claim to be an authority on the Holmes canon---and what's worse, be called an authority---and commit all the blatant errors in fact and principle this author does is stunning. For every mildly interesting bit presented in this hackish abomination, there were untold aggravations and blasphemies. Plus, balls, it's not even that good of a book. Don't waste your time here. Read or re-read one of the originals!After a baby \\"spilt\\" juice all over it, hopelessly ruining it, I had my friend shoot The Seven-Per-Cent Solution with my grandpa's WWII-era M1. An execution it richly deserved. May it rest in pieces!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plot, a travesty to the canon","review":"This book betrays the Sherlock Holmes people know and respect. In this tale, Holmes is reduced to a semi-deranged cocaine addict in desperate need of mental help.The amount of plot in this book is about the same as one of Doyle's short stories. A tacked-on chase sequence at the end seems out of place, but since the author is a screenwriter, it is perhaps not surprising.But the worst of all is this, revealed right at the start of the book: Professor Moriarty, Holmes' most dangerous enemy in the real stories, is reduced here to a meek, ordinary schoolteacher. What a ridiculous and depressing idea! I kept waiting for the real Moriarty to show up, but no. Meyer's Holmes has no brilliant enemy to challenge him, just a boring cocaine addiction. I am surprised the owners of the Sherlock Holmes trademark approved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary","review":"This was my first \\"Sherlock\\" book.

This forces me to refrain from saying anything but the following:1. Meyer's writing is superb and way better than some other \\"writers\\" who defile Doyle by writing Sherlockian adventures in ghastly language & style;2. The story is taut and very exciting;3. Somehow, the end evokes the image of the wisest and the best man walking into the sunset all alone.Please read this work, if you like to see Sherlock Holmes as a human being who rose to become the immortal archetype of everything logical. Also read it if you want to immerse yourself in a story that explains a lot and yet, leaves a lot to imagine about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pastiche'","review":"Really enjoyed this book..saw the movie before and did not like it one bit...was almost a comedy and personally thought Nicol Williamson was awful as Holmes. But the book is really interesting take - particularly Freud and Holmes taking turns at helpign each other was pleasantly done and interesting. Gave it one star less because of the train fight towards the end -very long drawn and unncessary, made it like a swashbuckler historical. The ending has a very unexpected twist to it. Overall the character of Holmes and Watson have been maintained and it is fast paced and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent logistics guide","review":"I found this book to be indespensible in identifying where to go and how to get there. A section on each of the major islands, and then regions on a per island basis makes it easy to use. Pratt identifies which birds you can expect to see in each of the birding spots identified. Although color plates of many of the species are included, this is not a species classification guide per-se. You'll need a separate guide for that. But you can't see them if you don't know where to go or how to get there, and that's where this book shines. I shutter to think of the time we would have wasted without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DVD!","review":"I purchased this item for my daddy for Valentines day.

But if you don't want to use up the mag so quickly, don't but this gun, or buy this gun and use semi so it takes longer to use the bb's. I would recommend buying extra mags for this gun, just don't buy the mags that say they are from DE, they don't fit (don't ask me how I know that.)

This is a very poorly written book, subjecting the reader to superfluous information about irrelevant people. I love a good biography about those people who have had a significant impact on our culture, and Joe Namath certainly fills that slot. He was the manifestation of the '60s for many of us, taking chances to express himself without apology and, often, without an audience. However, this book is about all of the other people who crossed through his life, many peripherals who simply do not matter, and who fill space without adding to the story. Why should we be subjected to the life histories of people on the fringes, and why can we not simply focus on the true impact of this man? Do not buy this book - there are better bios to read that will not bore you to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"This book was tererible. I am a big Joe Namath fan.

I actually tasted it to see how bitter it is -- alas, it's relatively mild.

Judy Geeson and Jenny Agutter provide a little beauty amongst the \\"beasts\\", i.e., the Germans. The \\"American style\\" salutes seem out of place, by those playing Germans, e.g., Caine, as opposed to the \\"heil\\" salutes. [My tape was marred a little by some \\"garbled\\" sound at the end, I'll have to see if there is a DVD version.] I would say that it wasn't bad.

The plot also seemed thoughtless, although, having not read the book, I cannot attest to its faithfulness. It seemed as though the producers spent the movie's entire budget on payroll, as the props, writing, etc. were all very shabby. Overall, it is hard to even watch the movie all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eagle Has Landed","review":"This is a great movie. Michael Cain is at his best as a great leader on the wrong side. Donald Sutherland is Jack Higgins' Liam Devlin. Robert Duval does agreat job. Jenny A. shows us how good she can be. The story of killing or Kidnapping PrimeMinister Churchill is fantastic. You will enjoy the action and excitement. John Struges the director has one of his best later career films.

I'm sending it back and would like to know if anyone knows of a copy which contains these two scenes. The movie is good anyway; but I really thought the missing scenes added much to the film.

The cast is excellent and, at times, seemingly too realistic; however, the screenplay is a poor adaption from the book. The story is not developed well--which is disappointing because the movie's unexpected and thrilling plot is left out to dry.

It insults our intelligence when businesses have there employees wear fake smiles and kiss the bottoms of overly rude and obnoxious customers. A rude customer at times deserves it in kind and there are not always two correct sides to every customer altercation.I'm sure the tactics put forward here work fine for companies but small business owners (2-4 employees) who treat their employees poorly and always take the side of the customer are sorely misguided. Small business owners would be better served to use the positive feedback of their dedicated employees over the cruel complaints of a disgruntled customer.Any small business owner using these strategies only cares about themselves and obviously is not concerned with keeping their employees happy.

It's lame. I feel bad the guys lent their voices to this crummy game. It's not that fun - yah you can fight guys and there's some kind of special moves but it was all so boring that I couldn't tell you how to even execute some of these moves - it's a little complicated and not worth your time learning cause you get no special reward for executing them. Money is a complete waste in the game. Don't bother collecting it for yourself as it serves no purpose whatsoever for the game itself. It's weak. I rented it and won it in maybe 4-5 hours gametime.

I played the game sparingly over the course of about 2-3 days, and would say that it only took me 5-6 hours of gameplay before beating it and getting made. Further, I only died twice, and used my gun no more than 2 or 3 times (most of the time you can just punch and grapple strategically, and win). I think that had they taken more time and actually COMPLETED this game, it would have been one of my all-time favorites, but as it is, I am shocked that the best show ever made feels it appropriate to put their name on such an underachiever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 40 bucks down the drain...","review":"When I bought this game, like most other people, I expected a free-roam, mission-based, \\"Godfather\\" or \\"GTA\\" style game.

I bought the Godfather for my PSP in the meantime. Generally, I expect PSP games to have less depth and shorter playing time than a PS2 game. But in comparing these two games, the Godfather for PSP blows it away. The story had more depth. The lead character had more depth. And the gameplay was much, much better. I found the Sopranos game interesting for the first hour or two of play as I loved the ability to interact with the characters in the Sopranos. Even as simple as the game was, I was enjoying it. But then it ended... and nothing had happened. I fought a bunch of guys by hitting the same buttons each time. I thought I was maybe a quarter of the way through the story... and it was over.

The gameplay was unimaginative, the graphics sluggish, and the environments - while accurately rendered - were completely sterile. You're basically told what to do through the whole game. On your way to complete pointless missions, you just beat a lot of people up. I finished this game feeling cheated. If I had actually paid $40 for it, I would have been furious because there's absolutely no replay value here. The design of this game was completely rushed, and the makers were counting on the participation of the real actors to convince people that this thing was worth buying. If you're interested in this game, just rent it. But be warned - you can never have that four hours of your life back.

THQ really phoned this one in, and are out to make a quick and dirty buck off the show's loyal fans.I'm not much of a gamer, and I finished this piece of crap in under 4 hours. No strategy is required at all.. You beat thugs up, then you beat more of them up, then you beat up a bunch of them and you get made. The end.

It is a mildly interesting read, yet Stannard ends up doing a dis-service to both particle/ Astro-physics, and Christian Apologetics. There is a sound thinking behind epistmilogically seperating physics and meta-physics: one is academic, one is artistic.

I asked my wife's opinion as well and she said, \\"Are these leather?\\" The only saving grace for these was that they are made in the USA. If you are looking for a well made quality boot with a sewn on sole you should seriously conider looking at Alico. Danner has goretex and Alico doesn't but there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to keeping water out.

Since I wanted to only purchase front seats, it was too difficult to confirm which one to purchase, so I found it elsewhere online. Too bad, Amazon missed out on my business this time.

The actual experience, however, is a mixed bag. Generally, the performances are very good and Rattle demonstrates a fine understanding of these works, but any worthwhile interpreter of Sibelius symphonies must get the Second Symphony (his most popular) right. Sadly, the Second Symphony in this set is terrible--poorly played and interpreted all around. So if this set is your choice, I strongly recommend picking up another recording of the Second (like the Cleveland Orchestra with Yoel Levi conducting) and leave Rattle's Second on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps it hot!","review":"We are loving our new coffee mugs..keeps our beverages hotter for much longer which is what we need when enjoying our coffee and mornings outdoors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of iTunes \\"Gianni Schicchi\\"","review":"For anyone thinking about downloading the Tito Gobbi \\"Gianni Schicchi,\\" beware of the version being sold by iTunes.

Beaumont series","review":"This is the first book of the series that I read and it hooked me and spurred me on to read the rest of them. Although the author, J.A. Jance is a woman, she writes very convincingly about a male character, J. P. Beaumont. We see the struggle between his personal and his professional life as he is summoned to a Shakespeare Festival where his daughter is pregnant and soon to be married. After his arrival, two actors are murdered and Beaumont uses his professional skills as a policeman to solve the murder while trying to be civil to his prospective son-in-law and his daughter's artsy friends. Beaumont has a wry way of looking at his own foibles which endears him to readers. If you enjoy this book, there are several more in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Reading","review":"I do a lot of reading and I love James Patterson's books but when I found J.A. Jance's books I thought I would give them a try and I have to admit she is the female version of James Patterson. Her books keep you in suspense and have you reading until you get to the end. So far I have gotten the whole J.P. Beaumont series and they are all have you wondering \\"what's going to happen next.\\" I would recommend her books to anyone that loves to read. Believe me you won't be disappointed, they are one of the best fiction novels I've read in a long time.Linda"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product","review":"I know that a printer cable will not come with any printer...

I am sure Paul Zindel means well, but his outlook on human life is simplistic at best and cynical at worst. The man clearly believes humanity is a small step above animals, and that our children should be raised to accept their fate in this Ricki Lake world in which we live.This is the sort of book that turns children into sex and relationship obsessed creatures, consumed with nothing but the desire to eat and procreate.

Bruce does the obligatory opening chapters on quantum mechanics in general and the weirdness that arises when mere humans [like me] try to fathom the subject. The book then launches into a thorough accounting of what the author refers to as the Oxford interpretation, giving us the agreements and disagreements, warts and all. Bruce is a great writer and keeps the tough material engaging. I should confess that I'm a very willing participant and have been fascinated with the many worlds interpretation ever since I read the Larry Niven short stories All The Myriad Ways and For A Foggy Night. I highly recommend Schrödinger's Rabbits to anyone interested in quantum mechanics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no...","review":"Lily Munster was GORGEOUS. This doll is not.

That's not all good news if you have to carry your rack around, because you'll be cursing the extra weight.

To me, the failure of Raxxess to provide necessary hardware to make the ears work out of the box is horrible customer service and support for the product.

This book didn't disappoint as far as facts. The author takes great pains to mention as much as she can about the women she's writing about. My only quibble with the book would be sometimes when the author introduces some facts, she would just leave the facts hanging there. There would be interesting tibits mentioned about a particular woman, then that tibit would be left and the author would go one to discuss something else.Still, overall this book is very enlightening about how women lived back in colonial times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Wives","review":"I received this product via My Kindle and have nothing to say about Amazon's service itself.

It's a nice service that doesn't make me scroll to the same page I was on in my Kindle, it started from the last page automatically.The four stars are not a reflection on the prompt delivery but on the book itself. I was forced to read the book because of school, and although interesting, learning about how women lived between 1650-1750 gets old really fast.

It was a good book, and did give a good view into the lives of colonial women, but I'm wondering what anyone learned from it. There was nothing surprising at all, completely mundane. I do not feel there's a need to argue the importance of women in history, no one's writing any books about how great chairs are for sitting, it's understood. Of course no society could develop and function without women and all of the very important things they do, to me thats a given.

He loves it. He can put it back together himself and is very proud of himself when he does it. The only difficulties we have had is one of the screws came apart and had to be reglued and one of the screws is bent due to a knot in the wood and is difficult to screw in. We have only had the train a few weeks but it is holding up otherwise pretty well to a 2 1/2 and 16 month old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful addtion","review":"This toy is a wonderful addition to the Little People series of toys. Easy to play with, make up stories and durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good rousing rendition","review":"When I found that my favorite version of The Planets was not available on CD, I turned to this version. Boult supposedly conducted the world premier of The Planets and he seems to know what he's doing. A good all-around tradional interpretation, which is what you want with a work like this. Driving and powerful when it needs to be, subtle and delicate elsewhere (such as the Venus movement.) The Enigma Variations are a nice extra that I didn't have before. A worthwhile package."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor oppressed women in the US","review":"this is NOT a novel about poor oppressed women in Saudi Arabia, but the very antithesis.Funny how we get these ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again...","review":"The author shows little understanding of Saudi women and culture, relying on Orientalist stereotypes for his story. This book is based solely on the author's imagination - after all, as a man it would have been impossible for him to gain access to women's social circles. We don't need yet another fantasy about the plight of 'poor, oppressed, invisible' Saudi women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hammerklavier Like No Other","review":"If your looking for a \\"Hammerklavier\\" to add to your library, you can't go wrong with this one. This release won Gramophone Magazine's award for remastering of historical material and justly so. I've listened to this one again and again over the past few years and I never grow tired of it. An excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Final Testament for Two...","review":"For those looking for the \\"Last Word\\" in solo piano repertoire: LvB's final half-dozen sonatas on his favorite instrument, recorded by British pianist Solomon (nee Cutner) between 1951-1956, just before his own career-ending stroke. To those who think Sviatoslav Richter's \\"TEMPEST\\" and Rudolf Serkin's \\"MOONLIGHT\\" and \\"PATHETIQUE\\" are definitive: so too are these. With only minor sound issues (a small edit blip towards the end of Sonata No.31 and Mono sound in general) these performances transfix more than all the others (Brendel, Kempff, Pollini, Hess) I have experienced. Listen to No.32 and... The End."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome!","review":"I love the book. I couldn't wait until I had Book 1 read so that I could go to Book 2 which I just started."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I thought it was a great start to a new series. I thought Quinn was sexy and Cassidy was no shrinking violet! I liked the fact that she was a fox (literally)instead of wolf. Enjoyed the interaction between them. I will definitely buy the next boox in the series. Warren is on my auto-buy list. She never disappoints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended read!!","review":"I didn't really expect to like this book as much as my other paranormal books. It's a quick read, but it pulls you in the entire time. Christine Warren puts a new twist on the paranormal genre. The characters are likeable and plot is even better. If you are a newcomer to the paranormal romance genre I highly recommend this book as well as Patricia Briggs, Laurell K. Hamilton, and J.R. Ward, to name a few. I can't wait to read the next book \\"She's no fairie princess\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"Despite the addition of Foxwomen, Wolf at the Door really didn't add anything new to the paranormal romance genre. In fact, I read a similar idea recently involving a coyote, rather than a fox. I simply couldn't finish this book. I couldn't even get half way. As a fan of paranormal romance I was hoping to enjoy it, but the problem is: the story and the characters were just not interesting. If you're new to this genre then you may want to give this book a try. If you're not, then don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I got bored right away. I guess I was expecting something different. I bought this series as a recommendation of a friend but I just cant get into it. I actually didnt even finish the book which for me is unheard of even if it sucks. I may go back and try again just because they are there but that is doubtful. The whole lot will probably end up at the book exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf at the Door","review":"Fun concept but not much substance. There were possiblities to develop some of the more interesting characters and their relationships. Unfortunately, the author went for the easy road and chose to dwell on one aspect of the main couple's behavior almost to the exclusion of the plot itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the eBooks first","review":"While this novel can be read as a stand-alone book, much of the background and characters are not well fleshed out as they have their own stories in the authors \\"Fixed\\" series of eBooks published by Ellora's Cave.If you prefer not to start in the middle of a series, I highly recommend you download the other stories first. Book 5 of the Fixed series - Fur For All - is Rafeael De Santos and Tess' story."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book that I have purchased and not finished","review":"I am so disappointed! I have never not finished a book if I have paid money for it, but I just could not make myself finsih this book. I did not care what happened to the characters. I did not care if they solved the mystery. After starting and stopping several times, I finally decided to leave it alone. If you like a plot driven mostly by sex, then you might like this book more than I did. I am assuming that the series must get better since there are so many of them, but I am not willing to take the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Kept me interested all the way through. Really enjoyed the read. Loved the entire collection of Others. Can't wait for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entertainment","review":"I really enjoyed this book - more than I thought I would given many of the reviews I read. The romance was good with a few steamy scenes to spice up the intrigue. The plot involved some mystery adding to the book's entertainment value. Christine Warren casts wit to her story which makes the tale even more enjoyable. I recommend this romantic read without hesitation.Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this","review":"Eons ago, I read (and LOVED) Fantasy Fix by Christine Warren. That book was brilliant. It was fun and fresh. Granted, it wasn't deep. It wasn't a thrilling, edge-of-your seat page turner. It was just a light, well-written escape, which is what I look for in a book. I guess I made an assumption when I bought this book. I expected something similar to Fantasy Fix. What I read was nothing like Fantasy Fix. Didn't finish it, and I haven't picked up any of Christine's later books, expecting they'll be more like this one. Maybe I'm wrong...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible... Well, maybe I'm a little heavy on it...","review":"... But I didn't like it.Maybe it wasn't the time for me to read this book, but... bufff... I dind't like it.I don't like explaying about things that I don't like because I know how much effort the writter put in this book, as any other writter, so I only say that I dind0t like the way it was written, the characters looked as typical, and in some way I think the plot did, too, but I can say so for certain as I wasn't paying enough attention and was flipping pages so I could end it.Anyway, I have the other 2 books that follow this one, and I think those too look better to me.We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Warren writes well in the light-hearted scenes but when it comes to anything plot driven it's tedius. She does make use of great myths that most paranormal writers over-look and so I'd be interested in books where those entities are the lead characters. Without that edge, this isn't anything special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Ehh...","review":"As another reviewer said, there is definately nothing new here. What's worse is that Warren may actually turn some people off to the genre with the disappearing/reappearing accents, the errors (at one point in the beginning of the book the heroine's parents are describe as both being shifters, later she goes on and on about her human father), the lackluster characters and the skimpy world building. I've read a couple of Warren's e-books and they weren't much better but at least they were cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I know it got mixed reviews, but I thought it was a good book. If she is planning to write more along these lines I would definitly buy another.."},{"rating":"1","title":"O-Kaaaaaay","review":"I wasn't pleased with this book. I've read all of Ms. Warren's E-Books and I have to say they have a lot more fire. She lost a lot in this book. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I started thinking \\"Did I actually buy a book this bad.\\"Because I enjoyed her e books so much I didn't stop to think before purchasing it. I was so happy to have her book, I immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book. Boy, Did I get it from her the next day.Because we don't believe in throwing money away, We're still stuggling to finish the book. Hopefully, there is light at the end of the tunnel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring to many Cliches","review":"This book was way to predictable to me.the characters could have been used a lot better and the fact that the villans follow everyday cartoons makes it worse.

Still, one shouldn't know the solution to a 371 page mystery by page 195. The author might consider eliminating the innumerable redundancies--how he does go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder Re-united!","review":"This is another triumph from Mr. Elton. He is rapidly becoming one of the best and most original crime writers around. As ever the pace of this whodunnit is unrelenting. It is almost impossible to put down from page one onwards.He has a great talent for using contemporary fads as the setting for his stories. In Dead Famous we had a murder in a Big Brother house. Here we have a series of murders linked to Friends Reunited. He manages to weave a good tale and also to satirise the craze.There is some graphic violence that might put some people off although it is not gratuitous and in many ways essential to the story.He also introduces us to a new character in DCI Newson with the tantalizing hint that there may be more. Let's hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Elton's worst book","review":"I have read all of Ben Elton's previous books, have enjoyed his stand-up comedy, his play Pop Corn and his musical We will Rock You. All that stuff was great and tremendously funny! When I read this, his latest work I was really disappointed. It was truly his worst, and would recommend to anyone who has not read any of his works: Do not start with this one!Although it was witty, it was generally too far-fetched and simply very predictable. I knew how the murder mystery would evolve one third into the book.. Please Ben, stick to funny, stick to temporal fiction and your hilarious vocabulary, but stay away from murder mystery, as the genre clearly does not become you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it but I didn't love it. A little disappointing.","review":"The book starts off well with highly descriptive (though a little gruesome) scenes of murder, it has some great comedy moments and a lead character that pretty much everyone can relate to... there is a 'BUT' though - I just don't think the mix works well, the genre is confused and a little inconsistent, there are a couple of golden scenes which are fantastic to read though there aren't enough of them to make it a great book. I liked it but I didn't love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A CHEWED BAR?","review":"I was excited when i first opened the package.

But as a whole, it was not good. The profaneness was \\"forced\\" and it was obvious. At times, it added humor, but most of the time it made it stupid. The whole Saddam and Satan thing was just stupid and more geared towards a 14 year old than the usual, ironic adult humor this show is good for. Save this 81 minutes of your life.

That said, as an adult, I found it to be hilarious. The parents of the South Park kids, incensed at the detrimental influence of Terence and Philip's new movie on their children, spearhead a movement to execute the Canadian flatulence artists, thereby provoking a military confrontation with our neighbor to the north and possibly apocalypse itself.Although it runs out of steam toward the end, this film is frequently a brilliant satire.
