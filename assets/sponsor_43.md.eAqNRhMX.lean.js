When I went on vacation, I would even take a mini-cassette recorder and just record the instructor's voice and still be able to do the exercises while on vacation. That's how simple it is. I stopped using it several years ago, but it still lingered in my mind as one of my favorites. The warm-up I would use prior to going to the gym. Well, my daughters ran across the tape one day and got together in their video room to do the exercises. The next session, they asked me to join them. Once again, I am hooked on it.

It was incredible to see him do this stuff live with Don Grusin in 1981 backed by Crossfire. Hey, I understand a guy's gotta eat and art for art's sake can't always feed you, but the Smooth Jazz stuff with Grusin/Fourplay/Larry Carlton/GRP is boring elevator music where all that naughty spontaneity/creativity/risk taking has been sanitised out to protect the chicken :-) Just the ticket when you're mowing the lawn maybe and want some 'background music'.

Even though not all songs are splendid, the first two are a sizzling start of this album. This is also mainly due to the AMAZING DRUMMING of Steve Gadd. He has played on so many recordings of so many artists, but this is his finest hour. So if you are a drumming enthousiast, check this album out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LEE JAMS!","review":"I've been a long time Lee Rit fan and those familiar with his work know that he likes to mix it up and the results are usually good but sometimes he misses the mark. This album features the kind of guitar work from Rit that made me a fan way back. The tracks Feel The Night, French Roast and Market Place alone are worth the price of admission for me. Lee's guitar absolutely sings! And when you pair the legendary Steve Gadd on drums with Abe Laboriel on bass, man, can you say 'smokin'?!?Gadd absolutely sparkles on this date and shows why he was a first call drummer back in the day. Sure, there may be flashier drummers around but Gadd is master of the groove, and you can't buy that skill. I've heard and seen some of the best drummers around but Gadd remains unique to my ears.

As usual, both his tone and technique are out of this world. When I saw him many years ago in middle school as a young trombone player, I was completely awestruck by his incredible musicianship. Lindberg is an amazing trombonist in every respect, and comes through 100% on this album. Be sure to check out the Saint-Saens \\"Cavatine for Trombone and Piano in D flat major, Opus 144\\". I'd have to say my favorite on the album, however, is the von Weber piece, \\"Romance for Trombone and Piano in C minor\\", with a simply gorgeous, flowing melodic line. Only buy this album if you enjoy trombone music, though.

Apparently, according to Compaq Tech Support, this unit is basically useless as a stand-alone unit. You must synch it to your comptuer, because if you run out of batteries, you lose everything. I'm glad they told me that now. The main problem is that the unit was full charged when I turned it of on Friday, I did not take it out of my briefcase over the weekend, and the battery was dead when I got back to work after the weekend.

For some reason it keeps turning itself on every few minutes to burn more battery I guess.

Though Paine's editing was controversial, his decision as to which was the better story was certainly correct. The dark satire and human insight present in the better known version are completely missing here and replaced by warmed over \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" style adventures.

This novel is a weak attempt to capture an interesting time. The title leads you to believe that the main character is Vlad III, but he is only a minor villan in a tepid romance. She skips crucial events that might make Vlad more sypathetic, while still inserting angsty bits about the death of his family members, just to confuse the reader. The dialogue is stilted and very false, considering the era, and the writer pays too much attention to the historical accuracy of the character's clothing, as if to make up for this. Badly researched overall, it's nearly as painful as the impalements she describes. I would suggest Augustyn's Vlad Dracula: Dragon Prince over this drivel any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing some parts.","review":"One of the boxes was missing the bolts for the smog control.

He tells you what information to collect from prospective markets, but he doesn't tell you what to do with it.Another glaring omission is verifiable results of claims. There is no way to find out if he has been successful or not. No addresses of properties. No hard numbers. Not even photos. This makes me rather suspicious of his \\"successes.\\"Even his economics don't work. California is an expensive place to live and do business (lots of taxes, regulations, etc.) yet commercial and residential real estate is booming. This is true in many MSAs around the country.

I have no idea if the computer stuff is accurate, and if it is, it's certainly scary that people can track you with every step you make, but it makes for good reading anyway.The murder of a secretive uber-hacker named Bobby causes a lot of problems for Kidd and co, and it becomes a matter of life and death for them to retrieve Bobby's laptop, which contains enough dirt to bring down many major politicians, as well as Kidd, LuEllen and many more in the network.Fast paced, vividly detailed and extremely plausible, at least to non-techies, it makes for a quick and thoroughly entertaining read.Amanda Richards, August 8, 2005"},{"rating":"2","title":"another page-turner","review":"When a hacker is killed and his laptop stolen all hell breaks loose.

We know about the bad guy in chatper one and then we are never left alone with him to to see how his mind is turning. Kidd and LuEllen don't do anything exciting for the first 3/4 of the book.

Of course, you need to have a few legos already, as this one only has the specialized pieces inside. Oh - and a few rubberbands, as well. Ours broke rather quickly.Sra.

It came on time, packaged well, is a handy size, easy to carry on the belt while mowing the yard and poking around wood piles along the creek and can trim a Hercules war club shrub out of your way when you need it. It seems to have good steel that reminds me of my uncle's WWII bayonet souvenir that he used to carve turkey's with on holidays. The sale price really helped make the decision easier. It was my first Puma knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't take an edge","review":"Feels like a nice, solid blade & good materials. Sheath is very nice. However, this knife was not particularly sharp out of the box, and while I don't usually have much trouble getting knives shaving sharp, I cannot for the life of me get this blade to take a decent edge - not even enough to \\"break\\" the hairs of my arm. I'm rather disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good materials/Lousy workmanship","review":"Just got this knife today from Sportsman's Guide. Nice leather sheath. The materials used in the knife appeared to be of very good quality, but the workmanship was horrible. The rivets used to attach the stag handle to the knife were uneven and poorly finished. The middle rivet on the knife I received was sticking out close to 1/8th of and inch and was sharp around the edge. I actually got a small cut on my hand from it while inspecting the knife. If this is \\"German craftmanship\\" you can have it. Maybe the Germans should just make the components and have them assembled in China. Whoops, looks like Puma beat me to the punch and are now doing just that with at least some of their knives! Probably will wind up with a better knife than the ones assembled Germany at present.

The lows arent all that good but you shouldnt expect loud bass from a 5.25 speaker thats what subs are for. This speaker is a excellent upgrade if your car has stock 4x7.

And hot is just what it is. David's voice is a blend of Frank Sinatra and Tom Waits. Besides some original compositions from Mike Melvoin, Milo Adamo and Hurwitz, there's also some smoking standards interpretations of Duke Ellington's \\"I'm Just a Lucky So and So\\", Tom Waits \\"Invitation to the Blues\\" and Billy Joel's \\"New York State of Mind\\" to mention a few. When David sings \\"I'm in a New York State of Mind\\" he does it so convincing that you wouldn't doubt that he really is in that mood.The magnificent Mike Melvoin Trio backs up David Basse.

This article:http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2520points out how OS X is horribly crippled to handle such server tasks when compared to Linux running on a G5 or an AMD chip. The article is very fair and every effort was made to figure out what went wrong and the conclusion was that OS X has very poor threading functionality - something critical server applications like mysql and apache under heavy load.The Linux running on the G5 is upwards of 1000% faster than OS 10.4. Given the cost of Linux I'm not sure what would prompt me to purchase this server OS for 10 times worse performance on the same Apple hardware.

I just went though a box of 12 in 2-3 months. Some only wrote for a few days. The same size box of Sharpies would last 2-3 times as long. Another thing that annoyed me was that I had to scribble on scrap paper to get them to write at full strength if I'd stopped writing for a few minutes.

I first heard it in the 70's, and I still listen to it frequently. The vocals, the guitar, the horns, they are perfect. Probably not for anyone who isn't attracted to blues stylings, and raw vocal. My favorite cut; \\"Big Lil\\". The guitar break goes clear through the whole song,and the vocals are a perfect explanation of how Rock was born of The Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"If you loved the first album, don't buy this, because it doesn't sound a thing like it. It's not heavy, the blues are weak (I hadn't thought it would be possible to blow Midnight Rider but they did), and there are none of psychedelic vocals that Owen did so well on the first album. Terrible. Not one song to recommend. Too bad.

Now that I've burned it to CD and have listened to it again, I can see why. It is by no stretch awful, but this album sounds like a bunch of cover tunes with a few originals thrown in, and just adequately played. At times, I get a distinct Allman Brothers feel, or a country blues feel, but nothing earthshaking. Even while listening to Mr. Skin, I kept hearing the Spirit version over this one.I had heard these guys were a pretty good band and maybe their first album is, but this later album from them pales in comparison. So, this one is going to languish on the shelf just like the vinyl album did.

The tissue paper is very thin and it makes it extremely difficult to craft the flower without tearing it. Actually, I wasn't able to craft a flower without tearing off several pieces. My niece got frustrated and began using the pipe cleaners to craft animals. It is a great idea but the tissue is not strong enough for the craft.

The kids had fun, and the flowers were fairly easy to make, especially for the girls who had already learned the accordion fold in an art class. Several of the moms enjoyed it too.That was the good news. The bad news came the day after the party, when we realized that someone had dropped some tissue shreds on the floor, which had apparently gotten wet (there was a milk spill at one point), and now there are permanent red stains on our hardwood floor. Even Lestoil couldn't beat it.If you are looking for a fun party craft, you might want to go for it---just be prepared for that permanent souvenir. Otherwise, try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"Okay, so, tissue paper is thin to begin with ... but the paper included with this item is extra thin and constantly rips.

Perhaps this entry could be helpful if you are a beginning researcher and need to be pointed in the right direction, but in my case I have already found most of the reference books listed. Overall, this purchase was a waste of a couple bucks.As a side note, I am not impressed with Amazon's digital library options. The eDoc was supposed to be saved in my Media Library, but does not show up there.

Now, I've seen this reality (s**t) show on TV and I'm actually embarassed of watching it! I can't watch this without being ashamed of myself for being watching it...But this really made me open my eyes and realize that Britney Spears is nothing but a product.

Being self-mesmerized (Britney by her narcissism and K-Fed by his greed and venality), both Mr. and Mrs. Federline are perfect retards, and they truly deserve each other.

With all these simple made characters I fell soo much in tune to because I can relate in those funny situations. If you like a good humorous anime that deals with everyday life in a family.

So I took a chance on this Studio Ghibli film in which Miyakzaki was not involved. This is the only Studio Ghibli video we were disappointed in. The video is a series of shorts that are occasionally funny, but the animation was of a much lower quality. I missed the wonderful storytelling, too, of other Studio Ghibli films. Neither my husband nor I watched the entire video through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miyazaki Fan","review":"One of the funniest movies I've seen ever. Very touching, in a bittersweet kind of way.

In contrast to Grave Of The Fireflies Takahata offers us an often funny look into family life and does it fantastically. WARNING: the art is comic strip style and may not interest you. If you give this film a chance you will soon realize that the story and characters are so compelling that you forget that you are watching a cartoon altogether. Great animation, very funny and fun for the whole family. Another classic by Studio Ghibli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film, In Need of Enhancement","review":"This is a sweet film made up of several vignettes that reflect on average family life. Though it takes place in Japan, it is relevant everywhere. You could picture your own family in their shoes performing the same daily tasks and expressing the same emotions. My Neighbors the Yamadas is a nice family-oriented film.The visuals support the vignettes' dialogue. I enjoyed watching the wedding morph into the bobsled race and the ship in the first vignette. However, these visuals need stronger color-the picture tends to be very pale and a little difficult watch for a long period of time with out a dark room."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"this movie was 1 of the funniest movies ive seen in a verry long time. from the start, all the way through i was laughing. i lovet the grandma, she made the movie so much funnier becouse she reminded me of my grandma. i think EVERYONE! should see this movie it will be worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun get -ready -to- read book","review":"My four year old son and I so enjoyed this bright, happy book.

It's a fun story with lots of football, midwestern culture, and a strong 1950's feel.Any Professor-parent will enjoy sharing this with his/her children. The book is character rather than plot driven, so don't look for lots of action. A little preachy at times, the story conveys values of diligence, sacrifice, creativity, and obedience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family grandstand","review":"My niece has been looking for this book for over a year.

For me, not enough description of what he loved about what he saw. And I am not convinced he did see anything he very much enjoyed.

There were bits and pieces that were humourous, but overall, I didn't find it all that funny. That was disappointing, because I think the author can be quite humorous.I think, as others have mentioned, Darlington was trying too hard to show how erudite he was by including as many references to songs, books, quotes, poetry, etc. as he could. I'm well read and well traveled, but I didn't know what he was talking about half of the time.And even though this was about a boat trip, if I had to read one more ad nuasuem description of the locks they passed through, I would have screamed.

So far, the gold has held up through many readings and shufflings. I've also handled the cards a lot while studying, and so far so good.Since the Visconti deck does not have unillustrated minors, it can be challenging to read with.

There's a flatness here, a distancing, as if the author were not quite ready to give of himself. Too many episodes, scenes, characters, are merely fleshed out, cut and dried, with no substance, vigor, or life. Even the title character seems to have no real emotions. Second part of a trilogy. I think this is supposed to be somewhat autobiographical. Set in southern Illinois and Chicago from 1890-1911. The first part is done in a kind of Tom Sawyerish speech, extremely irritating to read. But when he grows out of it, it's still heavy, turgid, flat. Characters come in and go out with dizzying rapidity.

Therefore, he looses credibility from the beginning of the book leaving one questioning throughout: what is fact vs. what is fabrication?Furthermore, he makes huge assumptions and conclusions citing secondary sources of which he displays little if any understanding. Lastly, he misconstrues even a basic understanding of western musical vocabulary: e.g., fugue, polyphony, form, etc.I would not recommend this book other than as an example of bad scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Boy...!","review":"I bought this on the advice of a JFK researcher and he said that this was one of those to get.

This book essentially \\"is the bible\\" since it clearly displays the work of multiple authors and editors that wrote, edited and complied the texts, neatly laid out in sequence.The use of multiple fonts and colors clearly show \\"who wrote what\\" and probably \\"when\\" with impeccable clarity that Moses did not write it. Personally, I suggest that anyone interested in this work read Dr. Friedman's prior work \\"Who Wrote The Bible\\" first, since that monumental and precise effort is the precursor to the delineation of this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is useless -- color coding doesn't work!","review":"The heart of this excellent book is a new translation of the Torah/Pentateuch that is color-coded to match the various sources Friedman identifies. Unfortunately, on the Kindle, there is no color! (I am using Kindle for iPhone but I imagine the Kindle device has a similar problem). This makes the bulk of this book absolutely useless on the Kindle. What is worse, the free sample that can be downloaded to your Kindle doesn't reveal this problem -- you only realize after you have paid for the book. Amazon should withdraw the Kindle edition of this book immediately, and I'm going to ask for my money back.I am sorry that this 1-star review will probably drag down the overall rating of this book, which is generally excellent. But the problems with the Kindle have to be highlighted somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference to double-check certain passages","review":"The Bible with sources revealed (Friedman) serves to check the possible source (J,E,P,D,etc) used by a certain passage. It's nice to follow the pieces of the same source and see how they connect to a whole story. However, be careful and critic when refering to the text itself. Mr. Friedman writes his own translation, which in many cases differ from what you find in several other well-known Bibles. As I do not have any proficiency in hebrew, I can only look with skepticisim his interpretation. Nevertheless, it's worth to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative resource that provides detailed basis for support of the Documentary Hypothesis","review":"In the first part of this book the author briefly dicusses the basis of the Documentary Hypothesis, and follows up with a very detailed listing of all the literary evidence from within the first 5 books of the Old Testement that supports the hypothesis. The remainder of the book is the author's translation of those O.T. books with verses from each source highlighted in different colors. It's a striking and effective visual aid that will be very useful for those who study biblical studies in-depth and for those who are simply trying to understand how the Bible evolved. If there is a short-coming, it will be for those readers who want more information than the book offers: It could use more foot-notes for clarification of translations, and for cross-literary references."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible With Sources Revealed","review":"This is an excellent book for the serious student of the Pentateuch.

Alanna returns to Fionnaway to preserve the village and her home. There is a supernatural play at work that threatens all the people in Fionnaway. Alanna and Ian must work together against the people that are out to destroy everything.ThoughtsThis book was hard to get into at first. Once the pace started moving faster I was into the story. I didn't know this has supernatural/paranormal elements. That interested me all the more. Mystical elements at work witches and sea creatures.

But be warned: this is rather a stinker, even with the lovely potential for magic (never well-enough developed).OK - it's \\"old Dodd\\" (1998), but still... she surely knew better. There are few scenes less believable than those in which Ian suddenly \\"realizes\\" or \\"understands\\" something... Oy. I'm glad I came out of this one alive.

While reading it, I found myself skimming through paragraphs just to ease the boredom.The book's summary made the heroine, Alanna, seem like such an independant spitfire when, in fact, she spent the majority of the book obeying Ian and cowering from his father.If Ms. Dodd wants to create a heroine who is truly full of fire I suggest she read some of Brenda Joyce's books, like the ones featuring the Bragg-Shelton family.

Although clearly similar to Bridget Jones and other books of that vain, I found that Me Times Three has a more serious element (similar to Jennifer Weiner's Good in Bed). Set in NYC during the 1980s, the book does focus on romantic relationships and the working world but also addresses more serious issues such as AIDS. The title really doesn't fully encompass the story--yes, the main character discovers that her fiance is engaged to two other women, but this quickly becomes a minor plotline as the story progresses to other issues.

This book doesn't seem to know what it wanted to be, and sadly it tries to be all and fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manhattan in the 80's","review":"Sandra Berlin is one of the junior up and coming stars of the New York magazine world, working as assistant and general dogsbody to the senior staff at Jolie fashion magazine. The love of her life is her fiance, Bucky, who preceded her to New York and who welcomed her arrival as a new graduate with enthusiasm until she discovered that he is also engaged to two other women. Sandra is a smart, educated woman but where Bucky is concerned, she turns into a pathetic, self deluding wimp who won't let herself believe that Bucky is a cheating, lying creep who preys on women for his own advantage. Chapters of this book cover the devastating effects that the new disease of AIDS is having on the gay community, and detail the horrifying death of one of Sandra's closest friends. It's not exactly a cheerful read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"With all the good chick-lit books out there, you can certainly do better than this. There really isn't anything all that great about this book. The amazon.com review says that the novel provides a \\"delightfully insiderish view of Manhattan,\\" but I think it pales in comparison to the much more entertaining \\"Sex and the City.\\" I also thought that being set in the 80s would make it a little different from the other chick-lit books out there, but being set in the 80s really didn't add anything to it at all.I'm so glad I'm not the only reviewer here who was surprised that this book was published! I can't imagine recommending this book to anyone I know. Please pick up a copy of \\"See Jane Date\\" or \\"Jemima J.\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have we read this book before?","review":"While the writing, itself, is witty, I can't say the same for the story. This story of a single New York woman with a gay male best friend and a disappointing love life has been written (and filmed) before with less predictability. I kept waiting to be surprised and never was. You can finish the book in your head 200 pages before Witchel finishes it on paper.Because Witchel has a witty, and often wicked, turn-of-phrase, I'd like to read something else she writes--something with a more original plotline and and more original characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"may I have a refund?","review":"There are so many great books out there, so why did I waste my time? This one dishes up one cliche after another, and the writing STINKS. The writer should stick to reporting - I'm sure this book only got published and promoted because she works for the NY Times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book . . . but . . .","review":"The writing is good. The story has potential but it didn't keep me interested. I finally had to stop after 160 pages. I don't think it's fair to call it unoriginal--if I had read it before, say Bridget Jones and others like it--than it would have been the first of its kind at least through my eyes. I think the author tries to be funny and a lot of it falls flat, and I simply can't believe this main character is actually a smart person. The plot indicates otherwise. Again, I wanted to like this book. It's a worthy effort, but I think the talented author can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiney, boring and done to death","review":"After eagerly awaiting this book that was so well reviewed by the New York Times (where Witchel writes occasionally and more importantly her husband Frank Rich is a top columnist), I was appalled that such pedestrian writing could pass for wit in the logrolling world of publishing. The one-trick-pony of the fiance who's triple timing her is a dead horse early on, but the author continues to kick it throughout. The heroine is whiney, selfish, shallow and of dubious ethics (love how she rationalizes not bothering to go to her best friend's funeral). Pulling on the tired drama of the gay friend dying of AIDS doesn't add any nobility to this man-hungry social climber. Having read Ms. Witchells dissections of more successful editors in the Homes sections of the Times, it's not too difficult to see how such 'fiction' style comes easily to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff Times Three","review":"Witchel sounds like she's writing a novelization of a sitcom episode, with all the depth of a really bad one.She can't even get her facts straight - Bucky, the cheating fiance, is a junior ad exec and he's making a Wall Street level salary. On what planet? Doesn't reflect reality.Characters have no nuance, no depth, and the central premise of the book is never explained to any degree of satisfaction - how did he manage to have 3 fiancees? Why?You could scan the book in about 20 minutes and pick up the entire plot.Hopefully the movie will be better.And I agree with the numerous previous reviewers who pointed out that Witchel is married to Frank \\"Butcher of Broadway\\" Rich, an influential NY Times columnist and former theater critic. It's all about who you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Too Many","review":"Like many of the reviewers, I was eager for this book. What a disappointment. I LOVE Alex Witchel, but the novel was badly written. Worse, it was boring. There are a few laughs, but too many cliches and no surprises. Which is too bad, because so much of her writing is lethally funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"At first, the plot seemed interesting enough--three women engaged to one man. Just what were the women going to do, destroy his life? Blackmail him?The answer is nothing at all. The plot was barely there throughout most of the book, keeping at an extremely slow pace and not going into detail. Sandra Berlin, the main character, fails to rouse interest, and I rarely found myself rooting for her, if at all. Even the short stories that Sandra writes are cliche and shallow. This is not one of the best so-called \\"chick-lit\\" books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a funny book","review":"This book which is sold as humor quickly turns into a disease book (AIDS). I was very depressed at the end and wished I had never picked it up. She needs a good copy editor to help her fix countless sentences that didn't quite make sense. She almost had something to say. I regretted buying it, but more so, reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"\\"Me Times Three\\" was a big disappointment. I believed the hype I heard and read about it, and I enthusiastically bought the hardcover copy. It's a story full of cliches, so boring and so predictable. My only motivation to finish was the fact that I could sell it used and get most of my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring- cliche","review":"I dont understand what all the hype is about- obviously it helps to have connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it !","review":"I agree with most everyone else's review here. It's just not worth the time. There's two many good books. This one goes no where and leaves the reader wondering on their own about everything. Want to laugh find a book called Watermelon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I wanted to like this book, but it simply bored me. Perhaps one had to be of that time and that place (New York in the 1980's) to get thrills out of the supposed true-to-life aspects of this book. But I don't see the appeal to the more average reader. I read a lot, and I have read a lot of similar books, but I just didn't get why this one was hyped, or even published. And did anyone else think the \\"good guy\\" with whom the protagonist ends up was an anal, selfish creep? I got to the end of this book and saw that the publishing house carefully informed us who the author's husband was, and thought: A-HA. That's why it's getting decent reviews. Fear of Frank Rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me Times Three Equals Zilch","review":"Don't believe the blurbs on the back of this book. The glowing praise from other writers kept me reading this novel, thinking at some point the book would develop at least one of the following: interesting characters, an intriguing plot, a sharp social commentary or graceful writing. Sadly, the book delivered none of the above. If you want to save your time for a novel worth reading, skip this. The writing is full of cliches, the characters are about as deep and realistic as a stack of paper dolls and the plot is drearily ho-hum. Would this gotten such good reviews -- or have even been published -- if the writer weren't a well known New York Times journalist? I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS ON ICE","review":"This book is the weakest incarnation yet of the currently popular \\"hip girl, lives in NYC, works in publishing, seeks husband\\" genre. The heroine's self-loathing is only topped by the hatred she feels toward all other women, or at least those she considers competition. And the worst is, it's not even CLEVER... I was rooting for the cheating ex-boyfriend by page 50, I'd drop this loser for the nearest cocktail waitress too...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is a terrible, terrible pile of words masquerading as a novel. It's almost like a satire of the entire genre: 'sassy' protagonist, self-loathing at her core and angry at all other (attractive) women and (uninterested) men. Ms. Witchel should stick to her nasty newspaper profiles and essays and stay away from fiction. She brings nothing but sad ... and clunky writing to the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom Times Three","review":"This book was so boring I stopped in the middle and flipped to the last chapter and still couldn't read the final paragraphs. Although the first chapters start out with promise, the storyline quickly unfolds to boredom. The characters lack depth and emotion. Withchel uses too much narrative rather than letting the characters speak for themselves. But when they do speak, it's uneventful. Pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money","review":"This book lacks the wit and sympathetic characters ... and is simply breathtaking in its superficiality. None of the characters are at all compelling, and the treatment of AIDS and homosexuality are downright offensive. Pity Alex Witchel that she has such good connections in the publishing business that no one bothered to edit her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"I rarely put a book down halfway through, but this book was awful - how did it get published???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the first chapter!!!","review":"I too, like the Bridget Jones / Sex and the City genre of books, but I couldn't even get through the first chapter. The character development was very slow, as was the whole story per se. It never got into why he ended up having 3 fiance's! Overall, it was a very half-... attempt to copy a style which is cleary not Alex Witchel's forte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, painful, painful","review":"I picked this book up at my local library and checked it out based solely on the Sarah Jessica Parker quote on the back. Let's just say the 5 hours it took me to read this book are 5 hours of my life I will never get back. Boring, poorly written, predictable. Who edited this book??"},{"rating":"1","title":"3X Terrible","review":"This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review, but this book was horrible. The lead character was so pathetic a toss salad could have pulled the wool over her eyes. The only funny thing (although not intentionally funny) was that the lead character thought she was smart,bright and sassy even though she came off as living a boring and pedestrian life while waiting around on her cheating boyfriend despite the fact that she worked at a happening New York magazine. Furthermore, who could not predict the outcome of her gay male friend and his self-denial and final illness. Please!! Been there, done that in many other books and stories. Although I hate to throw any book away, I am not mean enough to force this on the people at Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland, boring, generic","review":"Reads like a cross between Helen Fielding and Cynthia Heimel except with none of the humor. Skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"This book was not at all what I expected from reading the synopsis on the back and looking at the fun and playful cover. I was hoping for a fun, interesting read and what I got was a completely boring, depressing waste of time.Do not waste your money on this book. For a good time read anything by Jane Green (Jemima J, Mr. Maybe and Bookends)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible","review":"I was curious about this book because Alex Witchel has occassionally written smart, illuminating profiles and essays in The New York Times and thought perhaps some of the wit and wisdom she displays in those pieces would be in her fiction as well. Sadly, there is very little, if any. Perhaps she was over-edited, or encouraged in the wrong direction. But it seems shocking that this bloated, cliched mess would be allowed into print. You would think someone in her life would have sat her down and tell her the truth to protect her from the embarrassment (and her fans from the disappointment). Too bad no one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"god-awful","review":"This novel reads as if it were dictated during TV commercials.

But in the end the poorly written prose and bad structure won over and my pity went away. The book is hugely overpriced and so overwritten that I found nothing to like.

Like in the book Marina tries hard to impress Lex and then one night as they got older they noticed a more intense feeling for one another. After noticing this a little while later Lex commits suicide. Mirina upset at the lost eventually finds out that Lex was adopted.

This book had a ton of potential to be great, but it was extremely underdeveloped. I did not know the characters at all. I did not feel sympathy for them. I did not fall in love with them. Also at times the point-of-view was confusing. I had to keep rereading to understand whose thoughts I was being thrown into.I honestly think Block had a deadline and just typed this up super fast on the computer.

But the plot grabbed at me and I had to get it. Though it was a bit hard to understand at first, things cleared up like they should by the end.Wasteland's characters are raw and angsty, and people enjoy reading about trauma and try to feel better about themselves. Its a normal thing.The book nearly forces you to try and understand how deeply tragic the death of Lex was, how Marina has to deal with knowing that he had died without reason.

Showing you how life really is so unfair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice durable dive flag","review":"I was surprised at how thick and tough the material is on the float, unlike the typical beach and pool inflatables, it will definitely last. This float was inflated and left to see if it lost any air for two weeks (my wife cut this test short, the flag was in the corner of my dining room) and it did not! That's impressive. I only have two improvements I'd like to see: first, the flag itself is heavy, same material as the float, and would probably keep itself extended and be more visible if it was lighter nylon. And second, the pole for the flag is a little short, so your flag is not visible over a few waves or swells.

It would have been better to have a lift-off lid than to have a lid that requires these hinges that can't be fit together.

But for health reasons, I need to sit on occasion. This storage seat allows me to store all my gardening in one place and I've placed it in a place that can allow me to sit to rest when I need it. This is a perfect idea to keep active in your garden without worrying about any health conditions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This appeared to be really small when it arrived, but once completed it is a nice little storage bin and while not a comfortable seat, it is useful for things like removing your shoes before going inside, etc. You build it with no tools, simply snapping each piece into place. This is very nice and results in an extremely sturdy item. The bin is water-resistant enough to store charcoal with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Headache Midsize Purple Visor","review":"The mid-size is actually quite large. Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient. I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes! I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well. That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents. I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors. The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering. I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade. The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HEADBAND PADDING !","review":"I just purchased the 'no headache visor' to wear to Sony Ericcson Tennis in Miami and had not worn until I wore it for the two days we attended the tennis matches. It is absolutely the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE visor I had ever worn and after only two days of use!!!! There is nothing but the thin layer of material over a piece of metal right at the center of headband which left my upper forehead with indentation and very sore. It is unbelievable that there is no padding whatsoever. Would never purchase this item again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visors are great","review":"These visors are great!

I have had many of this brand but not of this particular style. The color that I wanted was only available in this style so I ordered it and when it came was very pleased with the look of the visor. I wore it and got such a thumping headache but thought maybe it was just a regular headache. The very next time that I tried to wear it, the same thing happened. This time I changed to a different visor at the turn and was surprised to see that my headache left. Needless to say I will not be able to wear the visor again! I don't know what is so different about it but it definitely caused headaches for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"quality","review":"the visor is not very well made. it is already lumpy on the brim.it doesn't fit very well. it is kind of skimpy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted male fantasy?","review":"I can sum this book up in one word: Ewwww. It read like some sort of demented, (...) fantasy. I don't know about the rest of you but this sort of twisted tale doesn't appeal to me now and wouldn't have appealed to me as a teen and I read and enjoyed some weird things. I read most of the early VC Andrews novels and enjoyed them through and through even when they started to become repetive but, sadly, I couldn't bring myself to finish this one. The story is thoroughly unappealing on all levels. Where shall I begin? The child-like writing? The unlikable and unrealistic teens? The forced diaper wearing? The information dumps that defy all logic? Need I continue? I think not . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing and sick...","review":"The first novel in this series was really good, but however this novel was disappointing and if I can get my money back I will! This book had some pretty sick stuff in it i.e. the girls in diapers, the coffins, etc. VCA books has always had some sick incestous type stuff, but this is beyond that! Also, this book just seems to drag on and on! I mean nothing really happens other than the Doctor and the three \\"buddies\\" torturing the girls until the end. I felt sorry for \\"Posy\\" , and also the book was never clear on what happens to Mindy in the end. Another problem I had with the ending of this book and the other miniseries with the exception of the Wildflowers series, is that most of the girls seem to have their pipe dreams come true at the end. I mean come on Robin suddenly becomes a singer, and Phobe suddenly gets to become a model and actress?? Get real!

I read the first two chapters about Robin and Teal in the first book, and skipped Phoebe because the storyline was so repetitive for each girl. Well, this book wasn't repetitive, but I thought it was sick and boring. I don't like reading books about people getting \\"tortured\\" and the coffin part was really disturbing. So was the fact that they had to use diapers. I like V.C. Andrews, but I think she had, and this ghost writer has, a very sick mind. It's always incest, torture, girls locked up in attics, molestation, and other crap. I admire their talent, but I really thought that Midnight Flight was incredibly sick and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was disappointed by this current novel. I think the plots are catered to a very young crowd...I prefer the more \\"mature\\" versions of the previous books which were in a series with one main character.My other favorite author, Sherry A Mauro writes in the grand traditon of the \\"Andrews Gothic\\".

As far as the Borken Wings series, I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh. My. Goodness.","review":"I couldn't even get past 4 chapters of this book. It was absolutely disgusting what the people in that \\"school\\" did to those girls.It seemed like the ghostwriter had a (...) fantasy that he wanted to put on paper, so he did it to Teal, Phoebe and Robin.I'd skip this one if you liked the ghostwriter's other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Story!!!","review":"I have read every single one of V.C. Andrews books. And I have to say I was impressed with this series. Usually there is a typical pattern to the stories, and if you have read some of the series you can pretty much figure out what was going to happen. But this series had me continue guessing! I read this entire book in one night! I just could not put the book down. this book is told by \\"Phoebe\\". I have to say when I read the last page of the book I just did not want it to end. This is truelly a good read!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY SADISTIC!!!!!!!","review":"This is the absolute worst book I have ever read!!! Who ever this ghost writer that is writing for V.C. Andrews is a total freak!! These books just keep getting worse and worse!! I will not waste my money on another book written under V.C. Andrews' name.I admit I did finish reading this book, only because I thought it would get better. I mean, how could it get worse!! The things that Dr. Foreman did to these girls were so freaky and off the wall. This story sort of resembled \\"Holes\\", but the girls were treated far worse than the boys in that book.I also admit, I cheered at the end!!!! Everyone got what they deserved, except for Posy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This book was VERY good! I could not put this book down, and when I had to, I'd be right back to reading it ASAP. Dr. Foreman gives you chills down your spine whenever you see her name mentioned in the story.

It would make for a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flight Cancelled!","review":"That's it. I stopped on pg 168 after I read some of these reviews.

A powerful line-up of artists, great songs and excellent production. This CD really shows how a thoughful compilation can really soar.

Her contribution to this soundtrack, \\"Loose Your Way\\", is a hauntingly simple and beautiful piece of music, and by far the best track here. Also enjoyable are the song by BT, yet another version of Beth Orton's \\"Central Reservation\\", and Dido's \\"Here With Me\\" from her exceptional \\"No Angel\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carly Simon's \\"Our Affair\\" by itself justifies buying it","review":"Although there are quite a few good songs in the CD, most noticeably Leigh Nash's \\"Next to be Next to you\\" and Tara McLean's \\"Divided\\", the outstanding song here is \\"Our Affair\\", an excellent remix by Richard Perry, sung by a legend like Carly. It's strange however that this song is not heard at all in the film.

They were tight, as they should be, but were still very comfortable. My legs felt great on the 24 hour journey, and the improved circulation gave me more energy.

I have tried lesser compression (10-15) by Preggers but they were not strong enough for me, my legs still hurt. With these compression stockings, I feel great. And they are also sturdy as the other reviewers indicated so I am not afraid of any runs. Overall, they do the job very well.

Am I missing something? As I read the book I would of course ask questions: What is the nature of this disaster? Why is the sun swollen? Why the two moons? Why does the city burn without being consumed? Why would someone go there? Why would anyone stay? Is there an advantage to living in such a place? Where did the holograms come from and what is their significance? Why is the rest of the world ignoring such an unusual phenomenon? By page three hundred none of these questions had even been touched upon.

I had just read Babel 17, and thought it was one of the finest, most unique pieces of Science Fiction I'd ever read. I loved the dysfunctional language, the Eyes, Ears and Nose (ghosts as the engineering crew of a starship - superb!). In fact there wasn't a thing about that novel that I disliked, then I bought Dharlgren.... What happened? Did Delaney's talent mysteriously disappear? A more self-obsessed, mindless waste of paper I don't think I've ever come across. I thought Stephen Donaldson had a tendency to verbose ramblings, but this book could be used to give a masterclass on page-wasting drivel. Maybe there are those out there who will love this, but I prefer to remember the vibrant Delaney of Babel 17."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noelle's review","review":"This is a wonderful book by Samuel R.

I have been bitter towards Delany and all his works ever since. A book such as Dhalgren, with its fantastic imagery and inexplicable happenings is nothing but a cheat if there is no enlightment forthcoming somewhere in the story. To DRAG IT ON for 100's and 100's of pages is more than an author's whim; it's a deliberate thumbing of his nose at the reader.I don't know what type of \\"life changing event\\" the author had made his own. I only know that since spending a month of my 16 year old life devouring this book whenever I had a chance, and feeling so cheated (and laughed at by the Author) at the unsatisfying end, I will never read, purchase or even line a bird cage with another Delany book.Leave this one on the shelf.

It's not just a waste of time; it actively ruins the time it takes to read. It's 800 pages long and there's not a single idea of any sort in it.

With this tome under his belt it appears he's made up for lost time since then.In addition to covering the wealth of blues greats who were either born in Houston or called the area home for any length of time, Wood also documents the underbelly of the lower class club scene, those low rent juke joints and converted shotgun houses that kept the I-IV-V alive all those decades, and still continues to do so.

One weak link you see right away in most of these boxes (this one too) is where the folding handle locks to the box to keep it upright.

The search for friendship, love and happiness often falls on \\"the rocks\\" no matter how hard we strive to hold onto them. Hedwig's case in point. All we can do is \\"keep pulling out the wig, wearing it for a while and then putting it back on the shelf\\".The song, \\"Origin of Love\\" is one of the most beautiful, thought provoking songs ever written.

I've had it for a couple of weeks now and have probably seen it another dozen times. The actor John Cameron Mitchell who plays Hedwig is AMAZING!!! He wrote the songs, sings the songs, directed the film and came up with the original idea of Hedwig. WOW!!! There is something special about this movie-it's like a drug. The songs are catchy and Mitchell has a beautiful voice. I would describe it as an adult, alternative musical/movie. For me, it's sitting right up there with my Sound of Music dvd...I love it THAT much!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"The photography, the music, the story... Loved it and recommend it to everyone, straight/ gay/ it doesnt matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry to say that I didn't get it...","review":"Before anyone blasts me, let me first say that I love Rocky Horror, I enjoy indie films, and I adore Broadway musicals...and I was prepared to love Hedwig. While John Cameron Mitchell's performance was impressive, I didn't enjoy ANYTHING about this film. I couldn't tell if the music was supposed to be funny or straightforward, because it was just terrible and cheesy. I cringed during \\"The Origin of Love,\\" not knowing if I should laugh or hum along. I forced myself to watch it through to the end, assuming that it would improve. I realize that this movie garnered rave reviews from everyone from Newsweek to People, so I guess it's just me, but I can't stress enough how disappointed I was with this film. Sorry, Hedwig!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and poorly directed.","review":"John Cameron Mitchell's stage show was infinitely better than this poorly directed version. It's self-aggrandizement to the nth degree. What do all the meaningful looks actually mean when one character sings to another? What is Andrea Martin as the Agent doing in the movie? Her character's actions make no sense. Why should we care about Hedwig? At least with the stage show you have the raw excitiment of live theatre, and you develop a rapport with Hedwig; however, here, it feels as though Mitchell just wanted to toot his own egohorn. It's just plain bad storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivery?","review":"I'm sure the product is great but it was never delivered. The delivery address is correct and the delivery status says that is was delivered on December 2nd. It's January 5th and I have yet to see it. Because it was already recorded as delivered I do not know what can be done. Is it possible to see the delivery signature to see if it is anyone's I would recognize?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music good, movie bad","review":"Had I been able to cut out the acted scenes and listen, sans picture, to just the music, I'd have rather enjoyed this strange little picture. Alas, since I am not locked in eternal angst over my sexuality, nor am I fond of indulgent, homoerotic navel-gazing, I couldn't get into \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\". Obviously, there is a niche audience for this sort of material, and no doubt that niche adored Hedwig. For the rest of us who politely sat through this flick on behalf of wives/girlfriends... Well, what can I say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film of the year!","review":"Did I see the same film as the rest of the reviewers? This is overblown tripe without even the saving grace of decent music. You don't care about any of the characters, and the only positive feeling I experienced in the whole movie was a warm sense of satisfaction when it finally finished.Mitchell beats you over the head with trite metaphors until your ears bleed - just count how many times Hedwig says he was born in a divided city!If this is the rebirth of the musical, God help us. Give me Busby Berkeley and \\"Singing in the Rain\\" any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER!","review":"This movie was the biggest waste of money! I actually threw my copy away. Seriously, don't waste your time and money! It's not worth it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never wanted to beat a director and writer this much!","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. Aside from lacking completely in worthwhile dialogue and storyline, this movie is blunt and disturbing for the sheer sake of it! I don't understand why this movie ever go past step pre-production. Unless you feel the need to be horribly repulsed and to enjoy pissing away your money, do not even consider this horrible excuse for a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just too weird","review":"Despite the brilliant performance by John Cameron Mitchell, this film is just not all that great. It is visually bizarre, the animation is very simplistic looking but makes very strange conotations as they do apply to the story.I watched this purely to see Mitchell's performance. I had heard it was utterly amazingly brilliant, and I totally agree. This film is just too out there for me. I've appreciated movies about drag queens and gay men in the past so that has nothing to do with my decisions here. Some of it just made no sense to me. This movie is just not for everyone.I did like the music a lot, it was very original and fresh. It helped to tell the story somewhat, but I didn't think the story had much of a finish..."},{"rating":"1","title":"online?","review":"Horrible on line version. Buy it from some where else.

I don't buy many DVD's, but this was a must-have.

We saw this by accident on cable, and quickly became \\"Hed Heads\\" -- playing the soundtrack non-stop in the car, quoting lines, hanging the movie poster in our office. We've been movie geeks before, but more of the traditional Star Wars or Scarface variety. This movie was something else.The music is kick-a** and the filmmaking is amazing (especially since the director was a first-timer). Your heart will break, your spirit will soar, you'll rock out. It's all good, and there's a poignant lesson about self-acceptance and identity in there too. Our only regret is that we never saw the show live.Check out the extras for some interesting info on how the stage show developed, and to catch some tender moments with John Cameron Mitchell and his supportive family."},{"rating":"2","title":"best since the Rocky Horror Picture Show!","review":"Hey Guys, See this ! I was able to see its premiere at berlin film festival in February, and great it was ! The little boy who had to grow up in eastern berlin (his mother having th coolest american accent a german mother can have), had to play in the stove and was finally transformed into an almost-woman turns out to become the wildest popstar ever...this movie, based on the musical being on stage for years now (and being written by the director and main actor of this film) does not at all have to hide beside cult items like the \\"rocky horror picture show\\" or \\"priscilla, queen of the desert\\" without - this film is cult even before it started ! Great (and surprisingly good and rocky!) music, ultimate show pieces (or however you might call it) and a totally cool story do its part, but the actors make it really big - so, go, watch ist and have a 90 minute laugh! (Hey, sorry for my english being so bad - but be sure my taste is all right !)"},{"rating":"2","title":"hedwig & the angry inch","review":"The main reviewer appears to be stuck in the 1950's, as this movie is actually very cleverly done. Granted there are some lapses in flow, the story really sucks you in and Mitchell is indeed a very dynamic performer. I saw this not expecting a whole lot, and was totally blown away. Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a regular guy","review":"I saw this movie not thinking I would like it because of its homoerotic content. But I have to say that even being a perfectly regular straight guy who is not into cross dressing movies, this is still a great movie. It is a funny movie. It is also a movie that deals with issues of what it means to be masculine and what it means to be different. Hedwig, seems to be at first glance to be a gay character, but it as the story reveals, it is not about being gay or straight it, it is about love and accepting who one is. Hedwig asks himself who is is perfect partner and what they would look like. The movie examines the issue of finding one's own person, not necessarily being gay or being straight. Hedwig at the end defines himself as a person and comes to grips with that realization. That is what the movie is about. Plus it benefits from really good music. A definite must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transsexuals Love to Rock!!!","review":"I thought this was a pretty good movie! Hedwig had an awesome singing voice and looked extremely sexy dressed as a girl. Throughout the film, Hedwig tells us his/her life story starting from East Berlin, to getting a sex change so he/she can get married and go to America, loving a teenager named Tommy Speck / Tommy Gnosis, who steals Hedwig's songs. Hedwig follows Tommy around to give him a lawsuit. If you love rock musicals, and transsexuals, you'll love HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much story, but great soundtrack","review":"I'm giving this four stars for John Cameron Mitchell, the graphic and animation, the excellent soundtrack, and the overall idea.I'm leaving out one star because there wasn't really that much to the story.If the lack of plot doesn't bother you too much, you will probably enjoy the story of the East German wanna-be transsexual Hedwig, the band, the dreary tour of Bilgewater restaurants in the U.S., and the love/hate affair with Tommy Gnosis, who was Hedwig's lover until he stole the latter's songs for his own album and took all the credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO SEE IT!","review":"This has been my favorite movie of the year thus far! I thought the premise of the film was ridiculous but once the film gets its hooks on you, you can't let go of it. I saw the last showing for the night and I was bitterly disappointed that the record stores were closed because it's one of those movies that you just have to get the soundtrack! Filled with drama, poignant comedy and witty dialogue, I came out of this movie with pure joy. This is the reason why I am a movie lover. After sitting through a lot of mediocre films this year, it is movies like Hedwig that give me affirmation. Unfortunately, I don't think this will receive the accolades that it deserves come awards season but it deserves to be up there with the best of them. Don't watch this movie unless you're willing to be infected with great joy, catchy songs, and great dialogues that you'll be quoting for a long time. I can't wait until the dvd comes out on Dec. 11!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware !","review":"This is an import and does not play in most all American DVD players, so buyer beware, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now your interested huh?","review":"I hate musicals but I LOVE this movie!Excellent original film and music, brilliant previously unknown cast.1 of my top 5 favorite movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Majesty","review":"Red glitter lips never looked so defiantly good as when Hedwig bursts in and starts roaring her anthem. Like a caped crusader wrapped up in the American Flag, she is her own hero. She wears her wigs and makeup like a 1980's rock star who knows what it means to have to fight to make her voice heard. Hedwig capitulates the very essence of rock and roll into the less frequented venues for such finery with as much tranny flair as humanly possible.Hedwig's one goal is to be a star and on her journey she creates one through Tommy Gnosis. The sweet seeming Christian boy who steals her heart and her songs leaves her performing in random restaurants where the majority of customers look bored or even disgusted by her presence. For them, Hedwig is someone they endure. They can't relate to the pain six inches forward and five inches back creates in a person. Nevertheless, Hedwig insists they witness, listen and look at someone society often shuns."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD does Hedwig justice","review":"I got the DVD yesterday...have been waiting to do it since I saw the movie in the summer. I saw the stage production 4 times with 4 different actors here in NYC. I find the songs resonating in my mind frequently...I think it is genious. Anyway, I am really impressed with the DVD...the commentary is interesting and the deleted scenes with Andrea Martin are truly hilarious. The sound is vivid and the movie looks terrific. A great Christmas present, if you are looking for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gender-Bent Punk Rock Saves American Musical!","review":"Forget Moulin Rouge: Mitchell grabs the American movie musical by its lapels and yanks it phoenix-like from the ash heap in his brilliant cinematic debut!

I used it for a little while, once I figured out what to do, and it worked well. Then one day the metal cover came off the top and bottom.

I'm still giving it a 5 because it's the most helpful sprout book I've seen.Friends of mine recommended it to me - they have an attractive set-up of baskets of sprouts growing in little seed-germinator covered plastic trays. They are thrilled with the book, and we are excited about starting to sprout. We did sprouts years ago in jars, but this system is better.Though the book could be more condensed, it's still an easy read in a few hours. And where else is this vital information available in such thorough detail? If you are considering sprouting, you will find the information valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Only covers sprouting in baskets and bags.

In addition, Funtek does not omit the Promenade between Samuel Goldenberg und Schmuyle and Limoges. In general, the sounds are more \\"slavic\\" in character than Ravel's orchestration. Perhaps not \\"genial\\", as Ravel's, but I think closer to the spirit of the Mussorgsky work. Both composers tackled the orchestration independently and at the same time (1922)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things should not be done...","review":"...such as remaking Gone With The Wind, writing another book on the battle of Gettysburg, and another orchestration of Pictures At An Exhibition. Ravel got it right the first time. The Finnish Radio Symphony's playing on this recording is uninspiring, perhaps because they knew that if this were the only orchestration of the Moussourgsky's piano piece, Pictures would never have become an all-time concert favorite. Save big bucks and avoid this version. Instead, buy the venerable Reiner/Chicago Symphony recording to get the Ravel orchestration and Adolph Herseth, the greatest orchestral trumpeter of all time, playing in his prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret purchasing this download.","review":"I found this particular orchestration rather alienating and difficult to listen to. It seems like certain changes were made simply for the sake of change, diminishing the atmosphere and emotion of the music. For example, at the climax of \\"Bydlo\\", the flourishing symbols are exaggerated to the point of making me want to throw off my headphones. Very disappointing.This also leads me to the downside of downloading MP3s instead of buying cd's: You can't return a download.

It has 6 tracks for a 45 minutes biography that sometimes becomes kinda boring especially since all the things said on the CD are out of date already (like her upcoming release of her spanish album and things like that). This CD is like a written biography but rather than having to read it, someone does it for you. It has some parts of Christina's interviews although they don't have a good sound quality. The CD comes with a 100 page book that is incredibly short in its contents (the letters are just too big for the size of the book). This book has some nice pictures too although I didn't like most of them. Just to give you a better idea, if you are a great fan of Christina then you may wanna buy this CD.

I don't want to eat peanut butter with sugar and lard in it, so I buy the natural but the peanut oil does separate in peanut butter that's just peanuts. It can be quite oily and splash when I've stirred it with a spoon. This mixer fits on the top of the jar, mixes the peanut butter to a perfect consistency that stays mixed until the jar is empty. When you pull the mixer wand out of the peanut butter, it automatically cleans itself so you don't lose any peanut butter. You replace the original jar top, and put the mixer away.

Regardless, I have sufficient hand strength to hold it securely during use but, I still need to finish mixing the PB with a knife, spoon, spatula, whatever, like before because the peanut butter is merely 'stirred,' not really mixed.What use is a tool that requires you to finish the job with the tool you bought the first tool to replace?

The peanut oil leaked out of the opening in the lid. After I persisted in turning it a good number of times and it turned easily for some time, I took it out of the jar and found that the peanut butter was hardly mixed except in the middle.

You really have to crank for awhile to get all the oil mixed in, but once it is it is really easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea, wrong size","review":"The item rates 5 stars... it does a great job of mixing and I am very happy with it. However, the supplied lid size was too big to fit 16 oz Trader Joe's peanut butter jars and required a relatively easy modification before we could use it. I drilled a hole in the center of a TJ lid (plastic) and then threaded the rod portion of the mixer through the hole. Works fine now, with the supplied metal lid resting on top of the plastic lid for stability. MIXERS TO FIT DIFFERENT LID SIZES ARE AVAILABLE from the manufacturer, so you might want to check that out first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This product honestly does what it promises and makes stirring natural peanut butter inside the jar so much easier and cleaner.

I am thrilled with this product and wish I had found it sooner. -JR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better order directly from Witmer","review":"The Witmer company website offers 2 models and various combinations of lid width and jar height.

I can't believe I didn't know about it earlier in life!I took off 1 star because the lid does not fit my 16oz Kroger Natural peanut butter jars. I just hold the lid on and stir while pushing down on the top. The lid fits great on the 16oz Marnatha almond butter jars I buy. I know the company makes other sizes, but since this is the one I ordered (touted as the \\"most common\\"), I will make do."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best gadget ever","review":"This peanut butter mixer is the best kitchen gaget I've ever owned.

Highly recommend it for natural peanut butter ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mixer!!","review":"works perfect with the Smuckers 16 oz bottle. As usual, my wife sniffed at it, but even she commented later that it worked superbly. I almost fell over that she agreed with me. Honestly, this is an immense improvement over using a spoon to stir up the natural peanut butter. Easy to clean because the stirrer is a bent prong that fits neatly in the bottle, and not some type of beater attachment.

It was slow and plodding with no action or character development. I usually like Lori's books, but her last one was a rewrite of a secular novel she changed slightly for the Christian market.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"Well, I must say - I'm with the majority on this last book of the Men of the Saddle series. I found it very boring and porly written. Sorry Lori. I liked all the others though. I'm just glad this wasn't the first of the series because I wouldn't have continued.

Tahiti 80 do what they do best on this album, which combines refined French melodies (reminiscent of 60s French-nouveau pop), with the contemporary stylings of the electronic-inspired pop movement. The single, \\"1,000 times\\" is a dance-along groove that incorporates mod-like string arrangements, with a strong disco backbeat.

That deceives the purpose of using a dovetail joint for it strength. Thoose gaps create a weak joint. I got another jig for dovetails and decided to use the incra for box joints. I made 2 boxes and both were so tight that it could not fit together. I measured the router bits and realized that they were under sized. I used a cheapo busy bee tornado bit and magically it worked.

Don't buy it unless you have used it before and you KNOW it works for the application. Dorman doesn't supply dimensions to ensure fitment- your only shot at that is to go to the Dorman website and see if your car is listed.

It had a great premise, and even though the storyline was a bit murky through the first half of the movie, it moved along and straightened out rather nicely toward the end. The problem with the movie was the end. It was much too abrupt and so confusing that one wonders if it isn't quite complete. Personally, I think the production company ran out of money and just slapped some alternative footage in to finish it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed to get this movie for the price.

Decent acting and film quality for a lower budget horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched - in a Bad Way","review":"If Hell's Gate eventually does open, it's my sincere hope that this movie will trot on over and tumble inside. It's simply awful. Despite what other reviewers have said, neither the acting nor the production values are the problem. The real downfall - as with most bad films - is the writing. The story simply falls apart. The production values are actually quite strong, and this is most evident in the opening sequences which are both eerie and suspensful as they reveal the historical background behind the current plot. However, once the current story gets underway, it's utterly predictable, which is a fatal flaw in a horror flick. You are left not-caring one whit for any of the characters, including the main ones. It was embarrassing to watch this movie, and it's occurred to me that's it's even embarrassing to be writing about it. If you're considering renting this one, don't waste your money, and if it's on TV for free, don't even waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wisdom of Forgiveness","review":"I have recently read your book entitled \\"The Wisdom of Forgiveness\\". I want to say that I enjoyed it very much. I have long had great admiration for His Holiness and this book is very enlightening because of the author's special association with him and his style of writing. I particularly like the way in which he uses his very words, such that one almost sounds like him if you read the text out loud.

When you are done reading you will think of the Dalai Lama as a good friend, and as a self-willed international leader and celebrity who also is humble. You end wishing that the Dalai Lama were your own cherished brother. If you want a closer look at Buddhism and how to DO it check out The Path to Nirodha which discusses the first turning of the wheel of Dharma, purification, along with the sixteen steps of anapanasati.

Very little was said about forgiveness and it was mostly fawning over a religious leader. Having been quite religious at one point in my life I can understand adoring a religious leader. However, the title suggests the content would provide a deep discussion about why forgiveness is good and how one benefits from forgiveness. I found nothing of the sort. What I got instead was detailed minutiae about the author's encounters with the Dali Lama.

Wherever you are Michael Townsend, Rock fans across North America all thank you. That said, Mr. Townsend's real talent may be in his solo, acoustic performances. Track 9, \\"Try\\", is Townsend without his band and at his best. A very powerful love song about a man's weaknesses, Townsend palys only his guitar and a very accomplished and emotive harmonica.

Well opened it up and the plastic cover was great but the 3 wooden blocks that hold the bits are all broken, lopsided. After several colorful words I went back to my return chat. This time I am getting a replacement. I don't believe the problem is in the shipping, although I can't be sure as it appears it might be Freud.

If there is a chance for me to buy through amazon, I would do it over and over again.I am so impressed with this product. The set is relatively complete for basic routing needs.

Once you use 1/2\\" shank bits , you'll never want to buy a bit with a 1/4 inch shank again. They really do cut smoother. The carbide is a little harder than the average bit. It will stay sharp a little longer than many other carbide bits . I find them very good with most hardwoods. They chip a little faster than some if you hit a misplaced brad nail or other hard object. Some will just keep on going. Not a Freud. This shouldn't be a problem most of the time. Freud was ranked in the top 5 in a fine woodworking bit test.

On some of the new songs he is ably (if a little reverentially) assisted by guitar heroes Johnny Marr and Bernard Butler, whose contributions complement Bert's wonderfully distinctive guitar style beautifully. If you haven't heard Bert play electric before, prepare to be impressed. The choice of material is excellent; thought-provoking and mature songs from a master of his craft.

SHE SHOULDN'T BE A DIRECTOR!!!I THREW THIS MOVIE AWAY!!!I KNOW MANSON WOULD BE AN EXCELLANT ACTOR!!!!HE NEEDS DECENT PEOPLE TO GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE TO PROVE HE CAN BE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are their parents in their right mind","review":"I happened upon a theatrical trailer for this movie and must say that the Sprouse brothers parents are not very discerning. Good parents would never allow their children to act in such a movie. This is unfortunate for Dylan and Cole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, vicious, challenging, and VERY underrated","review":"It is not surprising to me that the critics couldn't handle this movie. This movie wears no gloves. This movies is only for the hard core, for those who don't shy away from the dirty truth. I must admit, this film isn't an easy watch. It isn't a movie you put on in the back ground during a fondue party. You don't put it on low in your kid's room after you put them to bed for the night. This isn't that type of movie. This movie challenges you, like a good book would, it leaves a scar, a lasting impression. So if you want to watch a great film and you're not a pansy, you should see this one, as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHILD DEVIANT!","review":"This is an unforgettable low budget classic cult drama that is written by J.T. Leroy and directed (also starring) Asia Argento. The story is about a little boy who suffers some unspeakable abuse...the film shows you the world through his eyes. Many great actors are in the film such as Winona Rhyder, Jeremy Sisto, Michael Pitt, Peter Fonda, and an surprisingly good performance by Marilyn Manson. I strongly suggest this film. One of the most impressive indy films ever made in the history of history. Warning: Please be prepared to be shocked and offended by the substance matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"As weird, and strange as this movie is, I love it! The shipping was super fast! Good quality! No scratches or anything! The movie didn't skip, and it was more than worth my money! Thanks !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asia at her best!","review":"I will admit that I walked in a bit cautiously when i went to view this film because of all the negative criticisms it received. I loved Scarlet Diva but felt it techinically lacked the goods to be a really good underground movie. So I was cautious with Asia Argento's follow-up.All I can say after viewing it is that the critics got it wrong because it is a good film. Asia Argento shows a lot of promise with this one as a director and i look forward to her next project.This film is raw and gritty and without those elements it would've gone nowhere. This film will take you somewhere trust me...even if it's a bad place it'll still be a necessary trip!Oh and yes, I now know for sure that Asia Argento would be the only chick I'd go str8 for. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie you're gonna love and hate.","review":"I really loved this movie but it is very, very disturbing. This is a movie that will make you cry or at least make you feel sick inside. I gave this movie 5 stars for the acting and the believability. I'm not surprised by the adult acting but each child actor, Jimmy Bennett, Cole & Dylan Sprouse did an amazing job. The end really bothered me. SPOILER ALERT. STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDED. I guess we are supposed to assume what happens next. By the way she just takes the boy out of the hospital and drives off doesn't make me think they live happily ever after. I'm thinking this drug-addict poor excuse for a mother ends up prostituting or killing the boy. In real life I would hope she OD's and kills herself before she destroys his life forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Actors, Horrible Film","review":"Well, if there is one positive thing to mention about this movie, it's that there are some great actors here and they do a good job with what they are provided. The problem is that the story is boring and it goes nowhere. I understand that some great movies can be about ugly topics, but to become great in this genre, they need to excel. This movie was just one scene after the next of bad things happening, with no real emotion about it all and no point or thought provoked by it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title is deceitful but fitting.","review":"Asia Argento is a very capable fimmaker and this will become evident if you haethe patience and gthe stomach to sit her movies out. This is an extremely harrowing experience but an ultimately moving one. If you are a fan of the so called drug subgenre of film, you should look into this. But don't expect a breezy ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Demeter and Persephone","review":"A fantastic reconstruction of the rituals of Demeter and Persephone of Eleusis, Greece. Wheel of the Year rituals are quite different from Wicca, but still grain cycle based, and still with many universal themes. Reif has done a lot of research and offers in-depth information on Demeter and Persephone, the clerics of the temple, the liturgy for the rites, planting grain, sacred foods, etc. A lovely book (some great color plates), beautifully made and a great read. I recommend this one highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Take on Modern Paganism","review":"I'll be honest, I bought this book from a more Persephone-centric thought process, but I ended up reading the whole thing. It's a very nice, symbolism-rich take on paganism, and I gleaned quite a bit from its pages. It has lots of prayers and a beautiful take on the Demeter/Persephone myth. An added bonus is the wealth of pages on making Greek costumes, garlands, crowns, masks, etc. I would save it just for those alone! Definately worth picking up if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Hurts...","review":"but in a good way. Inside is a 10-song set of pure poignancy and you'd be a fool to write this one off as just another lightweight folk album. Rice's voice is simple and gentle and reaches areas of cutting, raw emotion. The melodies are fantastic and Hannigan's guest vocals only make this a more rich listen. This is the CD I use as a capper to my day. It's the perfect album to ease me to sleep, like a lullabye. This is definitely the best I've heard this year and easily earns its 5-stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O","review":"If someone told me that I was going to listen to a cd where EVERY song can truly touch every inside of me, and would make me feel exactly what the song is about, I would never believe it. Now I do. After listening to \\"O\\", I'm completly overwhelmed. Damien creates heart-touching song, with simple but powerful sounds that make your world around. I can not recomend it enough. It deserves more than 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suprise","review":"This CD is better than I had thought. It is very sensitive, varied with a personal style. You do listen the song number 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely awesome ...","review":"One of the best albums ever! My favorite song keeps changing from time to time and mood. \\"Older Chests\\", \\"Eskimo\\", \\"Blower's Daughter\\", ... all of them are fantastic compositions with great lyrics, music and vocals ... a truly stunning album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get past \\"Blower's Daughter\\"","review":"Like I'm sure countless thousands of others, I scrambled to find out who sang the beautiful, haunting song that opens Mike Nichols' adaptation of 'Closer.' I know a bunch of people must have followed the same path, because when I went to Virgin to pick up a copy, there was a large sign that said \\"If you want the music from the film CLOSER\\" (last word in about 128 point font on the signage) \\"then you want Damien Rice's 'O'.\\"My problem is that that song (\\"Blower's Daughter\\") is so good that the rest of the CD (to my ear, at least) pales in comparison. I've yet to find anything else that resonates with me. Regardless, 'O' deserves at least four stars simply based on the perfection Rice achieves on that one track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the hype","review":"Allright, I thougt that this album was overall very good, but it didn't rise to the five star level that most other reviewers gave it. Most of the songs on this CD are very good and there are some that just aren't as good as the others. I heard most of the songs on the movie \\"Alfie\\" and decided that I had to have it after hearing \\"The Blowers Daughter\\" during the opening scene, but after buying it, I found that the rest of the CD falls a little short from this song. As a Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, and DMB fan, I would definately recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It'll make you feel like the world has just ended...","review":"Okay, let's get one thing straight here people, music is about havin' fun! That's why when someone at a music store put this on through the speakers I immediately wanted to rip off my ears in disgust at how downright miserable this CD is, it made me feel like my life had just fallen apart.This Rice fella has no right to make us feel like the world is just a cesspool of sadness, what is goin' on in this man's head!?? I do like a bit of acoustic guitar music, but only when it was done tastefully, just try 'Unplugged' by Alice In Chains instead, stack up 'Brother' & 'Killer Is Me' compared to this turgid junk and you'll notice who's the REAL talent here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ireland never sounded so good","review":"This is the only group whose music consistently sends chills up my spine when I hear them play live. Damien's way with words and a guitar are truly lovely and touching. The range of Lisa's voice is unimaginable, that is until you hear it. This is what I imagine an angel would sound like if they were ever given vocal chords. I will miss the small venues as this band gets better known, and they will. It is only a matter of time. I look forward to their next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damien Rice \\"O\\"","review":"Wow. That's the word i would use to describe \\"O,\\" the debut album from Irish crooner Damien Rice. Aside from one or maybe two songs, this record is near perfect. Rice wears his heart on his sleeve and his guitar on his lap as he accompanies himself through 10 heart wrenched ballads. Another nice touch is the lovely voice of singer Lisa Hannigan, who joins Rice on about half of the songs. This one is a must have for any fan of folk, acoustic, or slightly Celtic music.Rating: Four and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Beautiful Album of the Year","review":"With this debut, Damien Rice has created the most beautiful album we've heard this year. In fact, we have been so enchanted with the sound of this cd each time we have listened to it, we have plum forgotten to pay attention to the words. We have noticed, however, the complex, stately melodies, the shortest clocking in at over four and a half minutes; the lush strings, glistening acoustic guitar, and striking arrangements; the haunting and shadowy back-up (and occasional lead) vocals of Lisa Hannigan; and, most of all, the arrestingly agile, evocative and, off-times, riveting vocal performances of Damien Rice. Good lyrics would probably be overkill. (Nevertheless, we're determined to remember to listen next time). The album climaxes with a majesterial operatic performance by Doreen Curran inserted into the extraordinarily moving 'Eskimo'. It is a daring and stunningly successful gambit by producer Rice and indicative of an innovative and exciting new artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing...simply amazing","review":"i don't think words can even explain just how amazing this album is. damien sings the 10 songs of this album beautifuly and tells an amazing story that anyone can relate to about falling for someone, and finally realizing that they don't love you back...although every track is simply astounding, my highlights have to be 4. Cannonball, 6. Amie, 7. Cheers darlin', and 9. I Remember. He just got signed with Warner Brothers/Reprise, so look for O to be released in the states soon. also, go see him at a show if you can get to it, it is definately worth whatever you have to pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Most Prized Possession","review":"Hands down this CD is my most cherished cd out the 100 or so that i have. Nothing else compares! I love all the songs on it,(except volcano)which is very rare, Most of cds i normally like three or four. But this, this is unreal, you have to have it. As soon as he released it in the states I bought it. And i heard his music long before they decided to sell it here. My all time favorite is Blower's Daughter,Cold Water,I Remember,Older Chests, Ohh i can't make up my mind. There all good, and Damien,Damien is Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addict","review":"One listen to Blower's Daughter and you'll be hooked. I simply can not get enough of his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damien Rice","review":"I personally think that this is one of the best CDs I've ever listened to. Damien Rice is an incredibly talented musicians and his music really touched me. I'd recommend this CD to everyone out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately not disappointed","review":"This CD is enjoyable for all those love-sick, tortured souls out there. Rice is heart felt and the majority of the songs on the cd are good; obviously, not EVERY SINGLE song is, but what cd has that? I reccommend this to anyone who loves some good love songs. I am personally very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at all the stars","review":"I don't know why it took so long for everyone in North America to find out about Damien Rice but now that he is here all of us folkish fans can enjoy. Practically every song sticks out especially Volcano, cannonball, and woman like a man. I am not so easy to please musically but this album did it for me with fantastic lyrics, some great guitar playing, and a nice touch of passion in the playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soul-touching masterpiece","review":"Brilliant lyrics and a melodies that find a place in your soul. One feels that they have been let in on a precious secret when they discover this album by Damien Rice. Perfect for those melancholoy moments when you're in need of empathy. A must have for anyone looking for a good \\"singer/songwriter\\" album that is both earthy and inventive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful, Introspective Work","review":"Amazing. This is one of the most original modern folk works to come out in recent years. It's about love and loss, and dealing with painful memories of family and youth. The lyrics are amazing. The music is acoustic folk, strongly rooted in the Celtic tradition, but at the same time it manages to be fresh. It grabs you and can send tingles up your spine or put a tear in your eye. The mix contains some orchestrations and female accompanying vocals. The mix can be a bit uneven and overdone at times but that is the exception, not the rule. Over all a very well done album. My favorite songs are the heart-wrenching \\"Older Chests\\" and the cold calculating \\"Cheers Darlin' \\" If you like Van Morrison, David Gray, or other modern Celtic-based folk singers, You'll probably be very pleased with \\"O\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow and Beautiful","review":"Mellow music - beautiful, deep lyrics. Damien's voice in Blower's Daughter is sexy... The best time for me to listen to his CD is when I'm feeling soulful and relaxed with a glass of wine. Delicate, Volcano, Blower's Daughter and Amie are my favorites - but all are good. Rent the movie \\"Closer\\" and it will bring a whole new meaning to \\"Blower's Daughter\\". LOVE HIM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful folk music","review":"I actually first head Damien in a short commercial during Saturday Night Live with my friends. We liked what we heard, so we immediatly started downloading the music to get a better feel of it. Being in highschool, they had to go home only 10 mintues later for midnight, and so didn't get to hear what we had downloaded. I stayed up 'till 3 and listened to and fell in love with every track. Damien's voice goes perfectly with every song, and the cello is a beautiful and necessary touch. A short while later, I bought the CD because I felt a little bad for downloading them all (it's one thing to download from Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, but with little artists like Damien I always buy the CD) and didn't regret it, because if I hadn't I wouldn't have gotten the gorgeous case, complete with page after page of distinct artwork. O is a must buy for any folk lover who adores heartfelt well written songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse yet consistently beautiful.","review":"It was not too many years ago when this album did not leave my CD player for at least ten months. Even now, years later, I am strongly considering doing much the same thing for another ten months. Each and every song on this album is wonderful in its own right, and yet possess that same pleasantly haunting underscore which makes me want to close my eyes at one point or another. Damien Rice has created a sound that is just enough unlike anything I have ever heard to make it timeless in my book. O, in its entirety, is one of the best examples of true music that has been created within the last ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath taking","review":"I, like many, have seen the commericials for Closer, and everytime it came on I would totally swoon over the music, however I never thought much of looking it up.Big mistake.A few nights ago I was watching the television show Huff, when at the very end of episode there was this very emotional segment and they were playing 'Delicate'. I right away fell in love with the song and quickly looked it up. To my surprise that sexy voice of Damien Rice was also the singer of 'The Blower's Daughter'. My immediate reaction \\"SCORE!\\" And went out as fast as I could to get the cd.The moral of the story:Own this cd, because it will own you.Need I say more about the sexy voice, the gripping lyrics, the soft music? Well, I think you get the general idea..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hips and Makers goes Male on 'O'","review":"One of the things I love most about this album is the use of strings - a cello, mostly, if I'm not mistaken. It calls to mind Kristen Hersh's \\"Hips and Makers\\" and \\"Grotto\\" - albums any fan of Damian Rice's album might want to check out.Not only is the music in a similar vein, but Damien Rice's lyrics are on par with Kristen Hersh's as well. I'm very glad I found this album, as I have not found many albums in this style.Because the style is so much like Kristen Hersh's, I can't give it a 5 yet - but that's also probably because I haven't had the album that long. I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll do on his next few albums - let's see if he's got some real staying power, the kind that deserves a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm just not a folk fan...","review":"I bought this CD because I heard the second track, volcano, and I was inspired, hoping against hope that if the rest of the tracks even resembled this smash, I had found a treasure. Also, I checked the reviews at this site and they were very complimentary. HOWEVER, this CD is one of the most disappointing albums I have purchased in years. The songs are extremely repetitive, and the words...cliche would be a kind description. The singer/songwriter is no doubt a virtuoso guitarist, but he opts perpetually for the road more travelled. It would appear that he is mistaken in his assumption that just because he feigns a strong emotion, he will be able to impart some depth of soul. Instead, he drones on with melodrama, snivelling heart break with the articulation of justin timberlake. I was looking for the rebirth of jeff buckley with the intuition of Aimee mann, and instead I found livingston taylor on zoloft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific voice, AWFUL songwriting","review":"When I see all the glowing reviews for Damien Rice's \\"O\\", I find myself scratching my head. Is it becuase of his voice? That's probably a lot of it - he does have a superb voice. Is it because people like cookie-cutter, trite songs that they've heard done 120 different ways? I'd like not to think so, but maybe.His songwriting skills on this album are weak at best. These sort of lyrics are so overdone, so common to the genre, and so shallow, it's nauseating. Sure, I suppose his songs are \\"pretty,\\" or whatever the usual reaction is, but what do they really say? Absolutely nothing. There is no depth to these lyrics at all, and they're extremely repetitive.If he ever manages to write some decent songs, he'll be fantastic. That voice is undeniably strong. Until then, there are much better options available to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know...","review":"Maybe I'm still punch-drunk of Rufus Wainwright's magnificently rich, multi-layered, overwrought, overproduced \\"Want One\\", but after giving \\"O\\" more than its fare share of listens, it hasn't really struck a chord with me. I tend to think he is a tad overrated. If it comes down to organic, stripped down, home-made records, I'd take Ron Sexmith, David Gray, or Jack Johnson anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy music","review":"This guy is a satire of himself. Dead serious and full of pretention, but lacking both self distance and musical talent, he just comes off as mildly amusing. This pseudo-intellectual work which some praise (and to my surprise very few dislike) rings a feeling of coffee shop music - and that's being very generous to the record. I imagine that his fanbase consists of people who are just slightly interested of the \\"alt-rock\\" scene but are nowhere near of having a genuine interest in music. Because if you had, you'd probably be aware of the fact that Damiens music is an insult to all the musicians he blatantly attempts to copy. Ignore this record and buy anything by Elliott Smith, Ryan Adams or Jeff Buckley."},{"rating":"1","title":"can he sing??","review":"I almost didn't buy this CD after listening to the previews on Amazon. I couldn't believe how 'off' this guy was singing, but the rave reviews convinced me otherwise. When I got the CD, I was amazed at the inconsistency in his voice. He hits so many off-notes that it is painful to listen. There are so many great voices out there that this guy doesn't deserve the accolades he is given. Not even close to a good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many People Have Bad Taste","review":"I can't believe so many people like this album. Seriously, it doesn't explore anything interesting, it wonders through some poor man's day-dreams. I have a tendency to question the sobriety of those claiming how great it is. Otherwise, have fun with it if you're an angst-filled teenager, locked in your room, crying in self pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN FREE IS TOO PRICY (really!!!! I mean it!~)","review":"I would give this zero stars if possible, it would be tremendously funny since then it would match the album title. somebody burned me a copy of this. I am either going to use it for a coffee cup coaster, return it to the person, or give it to someone I only can hope will appreciate this whiny little man. I think this would be a better instrumental cd. I am not just bashing the religious nature of the music. I just think this guy was not meant to sing. Perhaps he should write and let someone else sing. Also, the words themselves don't go good with the rhythm of the guitar. The end. May I never listen to this dude again. He stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this cd","review":"This cd is one of my favorite cds I own. I also saw him in concert, he was fantastic. He is the next Dave Matthews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very dull.","review":"I feel I should warn the public, this album is a waste of money. Both Vh1 and MTV gave this man rave reviews and I can't understand why. The whole album is nothing but a slow, repetitive drone. If you appreciate good music at all, pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"grows on you","review":"this cd came very highly recommended by the raving reviews from a respected friend/critic. i was extremely disappointed at first. the cd seemed slow and uninventive in terms of melody. i gave it about four more half-a** listens. nothing happened. I finally sat down with nothing else to do and cranked up the volume. with focused attention, i finally caught the nuances of his songs and THEN (ONLY then) did the cd start to grow on me. now it doesn't leave my cd player. for me, this is not the traditionally catchy love-at-first listen deal. Definitely worth giving it a try though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish i could give more than 5 stars","review":"Damien Rice's voice, combined with the cello has the power to make you want to cry. I heard \\" Blower's Daughter\\" when i bought the \\" Closer\\" DVD. I didn't even know who he was but i sat in front of the t.v pausing and rewinding the credits to figure out who was singing the song. i immediately bought the cd and it has been a romance ever since. And for anyone who wants to buy the cd you should listen to the bonus track that comes after \\"Eskimo\\", just wait a few minutes after the song ends and another song will start. that song i believe, closes the chapter on the entire cd. This cd is worth buying, all the songs are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ABSOLUTE Must Have!!!!","review":"Every song on this CD is wonderfully crafted and if you like the samples, you will LOVE the CD! The full CD is so much better than the samples. I was a bit skeptical of buying the CD by just the samples but let me tell you - WELL worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging!","review":"I loved the Damien Rice songs that were being played on the radio, so I decided to check out the entire album. At first (and I mean in the first minute only) I wanted to skip to the songs I knew. But I didn't and I am so glad. The songs caught me. They're melodic and most are subdued in nature, however they're still dynamic. Beyond that, I find several of them enchanting. Rice takes many chances (especially for a debut album) and I was surprised and impressed with them instead of being put off. They aren't your ordinary run-of-the-mill songs. Rice explores the music and treats it as an entire experience. You'd think he'd been doing this for years! It's very easy to listen to and I haven't stopped yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OOOOOOO yeah...","review":"Let me just say that it takes a lot for a cd to come along and really just make me sit up and listen, and listen, and keep listening. Damien Rice's \\"O\\" is one of those rarities that keeps me having faith in the music industry today. Soft and yet powerful strings, mixed with the melodic blend of Damien and other musician's voices, topped with astonishing lyrics create a combination that will leave the listener speechless, which is what a good album should do. This isn't just a cd, its an artistic masterpiece that should be in everyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much respect for Dam - O!!!","review":"Damien Rice has always been an old favourite of mine, when he first started out in Ireland I remember seeing him live and it blew me away that a young guy could reach such amazingly high key notes..... \\"The blowers daughter\\" was always my favourite song ever by him...until I heard \\"I remember\\" its the kind of song that as soon as you have heard it you want to go out and just tell everybody you know how much you love them!!! This album is just a sample of his amazing capabilities and it just goes to show that even after all this time, Ireland is secretly flooded with hidden talent that is slowly making its way into todays world of music!! If you enjoyed this album then I am also sure that you would love Paddy Casey, again another one of Irelands young and extremely talented solo singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damien Rice - Love that Voice","review":"The song \\"The Blowers' Daughter\\" was featured in a Jude Law movie (bad at remembering titles) - \\"I can't take my eyes off of you\\". I really liked this song but never had it until now. Love the entire album =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"After debating whether I should purchase the CD or just download the MP3 album, I finally decided to get the CD and I'm glad I did. I have nothing to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"Rice confronts his demons and the result is beautifully expressive music worth paying a few bucks for the listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATES!!!!!","review":"THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM, NOTHING TODAY COMES CLOSE TO IT! I THOUGHT THE BEST THING IN MUSIC TODAY WAS COLDPLAY, UNTIL I HEARD DAMIEN RICE, I LOVE HIS ALBUM!!!! IS GREAT!!I LISEN TO MY CD EVERY DAY, AND STILL I DON'T GET SICK OF IT, AND FOR WHAT IT SEEN I NEVER WILL. I CANNOT BELIVED ANYONE WILL RATE \\"O\\" A 1, SOMETHING MOST BE VERY WRONG WITH YOU OR, IT IS NOT YOUR STYLE, THERE ARE NOT DISAPONMENTS IN THIS CD. I LOVED IT !!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Poo!","review":"Damien Rice says his music is sort of like \\"post poo\\". And believe it or not he is correct. Listen to O and you will understand what he is talking about.I had the pleasure of seeing him in Chicago recently. I can't wait until Sept. 23 when he returns. Pick up this album today. Atleast go to his website and download some songs, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be wrong","review":"While I'm generally all for heart-on-the-sleeve balladry - there's a distinct difference between emoting and mewling. To my ear - and I know I'm a minority opinion here - the album is overwrought, pretentious, all but unlistenable - and onits way to the local second-hand goods store this afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"regretfully","review":"i am a ballad-lover as well, and so i really *wanted* to love this cd. and it does have its moments. \\"cannonball\\" and \\"blower's daughter\\" are both lovely. my general complaints are that the songs are overdone. i think rice's strengths are in his honest, real sound. the orchestration on some of the songs are overblown to the point that his voice is totally obscured. and some of the songs are just too long, as in the one song where he says \\"i can't take my eyes off of you\\" like 6 times each verse. i wouldn't be writing this if i didn't feel conflicted and disappointed. i think rice has some amazing songwriting talents - i just hope his next album is a little more taut and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waters also run shallow.","review":"The hysterical reviews of this album I've seen here make me think that many people deeply believe in the old saying \\"still waters run deep\\". This lugubrious album is indeed rather still, but that stillness in no way masks a depth of content.There is nothing challenging in any way about this album, so it will undoubtedly be a big hit, especially among septuagenarians and those who enjoy vanilla ice cream, tidy desks, and uninteresting, routine lovemaking in the missionary position.If you enjoy recreational valium usage, this album is for you! Mellow out, put on your fuzzy slippers, and be comforted by the aural complacence herein."},{"rating":"1","title":"O you can't write a song worth a lick!","review":"This album has to be one of the most overrated and unmelodic albums of 2003 -- The lyrics are halfway decent, but his voice...it sounds like he's singing while he's laying down just waking up in the morning.There's so many other folk singers out there that deserve Rice's recognition -- I just find this album to be very boring and undeserving of anything more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was cheated!","review":"If you're looking to buy O because you like the Cannonball version they play on the radio, save your money. What you get with the album is a two-track version of the song--just vocals and acoustic guitar. Where are those subtle drums and the great orchestration? Thankfully Rice's skills as a songwriter are so strong, because his voice simply isn't good enough to be the focal point of an arrangement.Cannonball sounds empty, as does most of the album, which is ridiculously underproduced and poorly mixed. When I found out this was a home recording, I wasn't surprised one bit; and all I can think of was that the label released it before it was done. This is a mediocre album that could have been GREAT; and to someone like myself who writes and produces music, that's criminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholy","review":"If you're depressed and you want to cut your veins this is the best album to join you in that moment. Damian has a heartbreaking voice and music. Delicate, The Blower's Daughter, Cannonball, Amie, Cheers darlin' just beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizing mumbling and whining...","review":"After reading so many great reviews for this CD, I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. I had, unfortunately, dismissed the few negative reviews that said things like \\"I wanted to kill myself after listening to this CD\\"... whoever said that wasn't far off. I really do like the song cannonball (which is constantly played on the radio around here)... and there is one other that I like, although I can't quite remember the name (and I think it might be too soon for me to try to listen to the CD again to figure it out)... but most of the CD is filled with the unbearable sounds of this guy mumbling and whining... and the ENTIRE CD has a melancholy tone... it's just entirely unpleasant for me. I actually really enjoy whiny chick music though... maybe Rice is just missing some of that angst. I don't know what went wrong here... I might try it again in a few weeks... but for now I am definitely and overwhelmingly disappointed. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Geat voice, lame material","review":"Im sorry to say I cant recommend this album, since I do like Mr Rice's voice and phrasing very much..Throughout the entire album, I found myself wishing he had even one decent song to sing here...At the end, the entire experience was simply..forgettable...Maybe he should have just covered some Leonard Cohen songs, or something...My advice to anyone except a hard-core Rice fan, or who is easily impressed, is to skip this, and get a Rufus Wainright album instead..sorry..."},{"rating":"2","title":"comparisons...","review":"So I have read several reviewers compare Damien Rice to artists such as Jeff Buckley, Ryan Adams, someone even mentioned Howie Day. I would like to suggest this album to fans of David Gray as well. What I love so much about David Gray is the same thing I find in Damien Rice's music -- the instant connection, the expressive nature, the passion in his voice. Yeah, his voice isn't perfect, but it is so simple and moving... you feel what he is feeling, and no amount of voice lessons or production work can bring that experience. Check out Damien Rice, and check out David Gray while you're at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny,","review":"I like the reviewer ripping on Rice's lyrical talents with the quote, \\"the words themselves don't go good with the rhythm of the guitar.\\" No offense, and maybe it's just me, but that seems humorous.To the point, I have heard only a few songs from this CD but I thought they were quite good. I didn't think the lyrics were as deep on those tracks as others seem to, but I enjoyed the songs nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most else","review":"Any more we hear the standard singer-songwriter on the radio and love them for a day. Sooner or later we forget their one good song, but Damien Rice is the complete opposite. He sings and plays with a true passion that is not easy to compare to anything else. I can feel the emotion set into the songs and this feeling never dies down. Listening to the CD made me feel like i was sitting next to him on the couch and he played solely for me.Anyone looking for great music that isn't tainted by todays sell-outs and yesterdays popular artists will do well to get this CD and not just listen to it, but experience it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"I have been listening to this record for a few months now, and it's still wonderful.

As soon as people catch on, the world will be a better place...I'll do my part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumping on the bandwagon","review":"I stumbled across Damien Rice accidentally....I had to fulfill a membership obligation with a popular mail order CD club, and decided that the ablum looked, well, interesting. Really that's the best I was hoping for.Well....I must have done something great in a past life...being gifted with Damien Rice's talent, genius and insight is as good an argument for the presence of something Divine that I've heard in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of best ever","review":"one of my only five star reviews. blew me away first time i heard it and still does. timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented musicians","review":"I really like the sound of this band ever since I saw them perform on a late show one night. I really do think they sound better live, since the album is a little too mellow and restrained for my taste, but good and relaxing nonetheless. Ignore the people who are on here saying he is a no talent - since they must have no appreciation for real talent, and must be too used to all the crap they play in between commericals on American radio stations these days. The Damien Rice band is very talented, and it seems to me it is only a matter of time before they go mainstream, and are doing international tours."},{"rating":"1","title":"snnnnnnore....","review":"There's been quite a bumper-crop of guitar-strumming/finger-picking, breathy-voiced, heart-on-their-sleeves, male singer-songwriters of late, all harkening back in one way or another to the original, Nick Drake. Damien Rice is, in my estimation, the bost boring of the bunch. Few things distinguish a song from any other one on the album. Most have the same tempos, arrangements, and melodic movement intended to be evocative of longing and melancholy. Even given the high quality of the sound, playing and whatnot, I think this is an awful album. I sincerely wish that folks would stop comparing Rice to Jeff Buckley. Jeff Buckley was an absolute genius, a man who could have been his generation's pop-Beethoven, but Damien Rice will be more or less forgotten within three to five years, with only a small core of fans to watch him when he plays small coffeeshops throughout the country, before he moves back to the UK to become a bank manager or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overbearing","review":"The introspective singer songwriter has become nearly as common as the studio born popstar. So, it takes more than a few thoughtful lyrics, the ability to carry a tune and a sparsely strummed guitar to impress my ears.Rice's voice seems pleasant if not sweet at the onset, but midway through the album his often keening vocals grate on the nerves. The songwriting suffers from an overbearing sincerity and dirge like quality at times. The female vocalist and strings add to the overblown affair, creating a \\"give me a break\\" reaction, rather than the impassioned heart pull it strives to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"O DEAR!","review":"Okay, I admit it Volcano is an incredible song. Damien Rice is an incredible singer and songwriter as well. So what's lacking in this album? It seems as if debut rock artists don't trust their true sound and add sappy amounts of strings to pull your heartstrings as you listen to lovely songs about human love and tragedy. O Damien, if only you had your guitar and did away with the orchestra this would be a masterpiece. I recommend you see him in concert or wait for the next release when he has more confidence in himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catfish of Irish Music...","review":"has lucked out with $$$$$ behind him in the USA... sad but true what cash can do!!!!There are quite a few bands MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better than Damien in Dublin alone... who have not seen any recognition due to lacking USA $$$ behind them.All you people open you ears to Dublin - one of the greatest music cities in the world... and check out bands like BellX1 and The Frames(incredible!!!!!!!!!), Mundy, ASH, Gemma Hayes even... to many to list...Don;t loisten to the cash... discover Dublin music at it best... and that doesn;t mean \\"O\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand this guy.","review":"This guy makes me want to hurl. I have never heard such sappy, trite, sacharin (sp?) garbage in my life.I strongly urge you to listen to anything by Jeff Buckley instead. His music is similar, but he does it right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received item from Amazon, LLC","review":"The one star isn't for Damien Rice, because I am familiar with his music and I enjoy it very much. This item was supposed to be a gift but it never arrived at its destination. I have given the shipment an ample amount of time to get there but after almost a month it is still in limbo. What makes it worse is that Amazon.com doesn't give you any real recourse for such a situation. I tried navigating all the areas in \\"my account\\", and there is no section that deals with lost goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful - just beautiful.","review":"Last night, I was driving my friend's car, while he was in the passengers seat flipping through CDs - he pulled out Damien Rice, saying \\"you have to hear this, he's the best.\\" Words can't describe how I felt, when the music started...it is hauntingly beautiful, one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. Ever. I'm so glad we had a long drive ahead of us, because I was able to hear the entire album - afterwards I knew I needed to have it (I would have bought it from Amazon but I needed it as soon as possible) so I ran out to a local music store this morning, 5 minutes after they opened, and I bought this CD. Damien Rice is a musical genius. I hope he tours in the US sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Damien Rice","review":"I listened to an interview on yahoo.launch, about how Damien Rice came to be as popular as he is today. He first got a record deal, but he felt like it wasn't the right time because he didn't have the creative rights over his cd. So he took time off went to Tuscany, got restless, then came back to Europe and played on the streets like a bum. Later on down the road he produced a record on his own, called \\"O\\". Damien has a unique way about him, where he says it how it is. It sounds to me like his perspective on like is exactly how where it should be at this point in his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ireland 2002","review":"I purchased this cd in July of 2002 in Ireland. The first few tracks are amazing, it ends well with Eskimo as well. There are about 2 tracks that are weak, but overall the cd is outstanding. Definitely not worth $42 if you import, but worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"still good","review":"I am still discovering songs on here, years after purchase. It is moody and not always right at the right time. But when I can really tune in and appreciate it, the music is on point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damien Rice is an Innovative Troubadour","review":"I just love this album. Damien Rice brings storytelling back to the alternative music scene. His warm and sultry voice is reminiscent of Indian singer Tanita Tikarum, only with a slightly more positive bent to the lyrics. The songs have a degree of continuity which makes whole album listening a pleasure. It is filled with unexpected and delightful interjections from female vocalists. The ample use of strings makes O both easy listening and the triumph of a contempory balladeir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring me more Rice!","review":"Ah, there's a good reason why Damien Rice's songs are so frequently used in tv and film soundtracks. They are haunting, unique and fascinating to listen to. This record does not disappoint. He may not have a gorgeous voice but he has a lot of emotion in his vocals, and a great ear for melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is one of the best and most original cds I have ever heard, one of those rare albums that can bring tears to your eyes and chills to your spine. I can't compare this music to anyone else's. The use of classical and opera, the melodies, and the incredible voices of Damien, and of Lisa Hannigan who joins him on several tracks. It's not often music can be described as beautiful. This is. Do yourself a favor and buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Music!!","review":"This is simply the most intriquing CD to me in at least 5 years. I heard some of the tracks recently 1) a TV movie called Amnesia, 2) the UK Big Brother finale and 3) last night at the end of that great show LOST. This music always leaves me wanting more and I cannot wait until he does another one. I am addicted to every song and love the fact that each track is so different from the one before. This is a beautiful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's depressing.","review":"Some people don't like depressing music. If you are one of these people, don't buy this album. My sister can't stand to listen to Tori Amos' From the Choirgirl Hotel album because it's \\"so depressing\\", and that's not half as mourful as this. I like sad songs. I like the folk genre. I like Rice's musical style and subject matter. I quite like this album. You may not, but that shouldn't be too hard to figure out -before- you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What they said...","review":"Such an amazing CD. This is one of those rare CDs that you not only like every song on it, but I love every song on this CD. It's wonderful in so many aspects: lyrics, fidelity, variety, I could go on and on. It's a very well done CD by someone, like someone said in a review I read, is soon to be a household name. I can't imagine any record company dropping the ball and not doing all they can to ensure this guy's success. His voice is truly amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"very small","review":"When I opened this I thought it was a miniature toy, if i had known this was so small I would have never ordered it.

It's perfect for my needs, and an eye-catching addition to my kitchen decor.For someone whose needs are greater, this may not be the way to go.

The wood(?) on the wagon is cheap and all chiped, big slivers were missing before I took it out of the box.

Looks stunning.I can assume only that \\"HIC Porcelain\\" is the name of the company that sells it, otherwise the title is deceptive. It is made of lovely wood.The only thing I did not expect was that the pestle (grinding stick) is not polished wood like the mortar (bowl) is, and is very rough to the touch so watch out for splinters when you use it.(Tip to the manufacturers: I wouldn't mind if the crushing part of the pestle was rough wood, and only the handle polished as that way it would be most functional, but still nice to touch).Definitely worth the price. I can see something like this go for several times the price, in any craft store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look like a kid's toy","review":"This looks like a kid's toy. 1/2 inch smaller than what it say it is.

Everything is perfectly alright for us around the house, but i'm sure the hammer head is gonna fly right off after a day or two on the work site. It completely worth it for the bag, as others have stated. And when something does break, replace ti with more cheap Chinese material at the \\"Depot\\" to keep on moving.

However, some of the bits are duplicates, so I was wondering if it was this way in case some of them get lost, or if it was because that increases the number of pieces in the tool kit to make it seem bigger.

Some of the tools (hammer, wrenches, allen wrenches,) are pretty nice. However, the first time I tried to use the screwdriver/socket wrench it shattered in my hand.

The allen wrenches are small and flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"I moved into my house and decided I might need a toolset instead of 'borrowing' my dad's tools all the time. It has been a very good investment. I like that it comes with drill bits so now all i need is a drill. The bag is very spacious.

First, the quality of the bag is not great. I have already ripped a few of the inside pockets. Secondly and most importantly, when all the tools are placed in the bag there is no organization scheme. To get to tools normally have to empty most of the bag.

After researching several sites for similar tool sets I decided for a back up, entry level tool set the price could not be beat.The items were well packaged and delivered with no damage. A quick close inspection reflects that these tools will perform as described. As for the other reviews I can only say that these are definitely not Snap-on or Craftsman quality; however; look at the price point and be realistic in your expectations.For a basic entry level tool set that would allow most PT home handy men to have the required tool for almost any job this set is PERFECT!!!If you are after industrial strength tools or a general contractor, roofer, sheet rock hanger or general carpenter look elsewhere; these tools were \\"NOT\\" made for you.If you need tools to complete your \\"honey-to-do\\" list then buy these tools. No big investment needed for us part-time handy men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap tools","review":"I got them today and already had trouble with few of the tools due to poor quality and workmanship. When you buy a tool and the bolt on one of pliers looks like it's been hammered in incorrectly (looks half broken). The Exacto knife had to be opened and reset (mechanical parts poorly made inside!. The set lacks a regular size pliers. The adaptable screwdriver is made for small hands and the philips is even smaller. Most of the 115 pieces are bit parts for a missing drill. This set is basically a toy. The best piece seems to be the hammer.Not really worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Demi Spoons","review":"I was quite happy to find these demitasse spoons to match my Ginkgo flatware set.

I'm in the process of looking for something that'll work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not keep food hot - not useful for kids' lunches","review":"I bought two of these with which to send hot food in my kids' lunches. I specifically bought Thermos because i remembered my Dad's thermos when i was little kept his coffee extrememely hot for hours. This food jar does NOT keep my kids' food hot. I had lunch at school with my son and was shocked to find that the pasta we had put into it was room temperature at 10:30 in the morning. He told me it was always like this. I subsequently tested both of the jars, just in case that was an aberrancy: i put boiling water in them, sealed tightly, and checked them 4 hours later. Both were room temperature. I bought them at Target and didn't save the receipt or packaging because it didn't occur to me that Thermos would produce a product that didn't work correctly, so i'm stuck with them. A complete waste of $40! ($20 each)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't leak, but food is cold and mushy","review":"I bought this for my kid's lunch. I faithfully followed the directions of filling it in the morning with boiling water for 10-15 minutes prior to filling with hot food. Nevertheless, the lunch was room temperature, not just one day but EVERY single time we used it! Lunches were kept in backpacks on hooks in the classroom--in other words, at room temperature all morning.The upside is that we never had issues with it leaking. So if you just want something lukewarm to stay in a leakproof container, this will fill the bill. If you want hot, it's a gamble. The thermal insulation NEVER worked for my family.So disappointed that I wasted money on this piece of junk. I am hopeful there is something else out there so that I don't have to give up on my child getting a hot lunch from home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thermos","review":"This thermos was bought because I had another one that worked so good I had to search for a second one for my son.

Under-developed. The verdict? Don't waste your money buying it. It's a one-time renter at the most.

If you liked any made for tv movie ever made, then you'll love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"factually inaccurate and grating","review":"Many folks have praised the historical accuracy of this film. I question the whole factual basis of the film, did 1. Americans kill civilians in Germany, and 2. Was there sufficient time and reason for German orphans to have been brought to America before the War's end?America didn't enter the War 'til 1917, and, from my reading, the Allies did not even penetrate Germany before Armistice in November 1918For me, this film grates on many levels. One of those is the repetitive Wagnerian musical score and fictional German opera. Could such a choice of an opera comport with a teacher's, never mind community, sensibilities of the time?Was the farmer's supposedly outmoded harvester so advanced in that day as to be beyond the skills of the American farmer nor his grown sons?And while facing an American flag, to which flag was the young German pledging allegiance?This film can be compared to the far more polished 'Snow Falling on Cedars'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Basket, in theaters","review":"We saw The Basket in the movie theater last year. If you like a quiet, thoughtful film that is appropriate for the whole family, then this is it. If you want special effects, car chases and swearing, this is not the movie for you. As best I can tell, from reading other comments here, except for one or two detailed critiques, those not liking the movie found The Basket to be boring. Presumably not enough car chases and explosions. Those liking the movie enjoyed the sentimental story and the emotional power, and an ending where everyone won something more important than a basketball game. We thoroughly enjoyed this movie, set in a rural community in the early 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was a class act!","review":"This movie had everything - beautiful cinematography, a great storyline, great acting by Peter Coyote and Karen Allen, fantastic music. You won't be disappointed with THE BASKET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good, but something is missing","review":"Very good, and bargain to boot! It is easy to recommend this as a fine film, worth seeing more than once, excellent fare for a family. It is less easy to put one's finger on the something that keeps it from being a great film. Is it that it doesn't quite know what it is about? That it lacks a unifying perspective? By all means see it, and tell us what you find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money!!!","review":"My goodness this is one waste of a 4.7 GB DVD. Might as well use it as a coaster if you already bought it. Deleted scenes? How about they make the whole movie one deleted scene. If you want your intelligence insulted, watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some fine tuning","review":"I came across The Basket in a video store and decided to rent it. This was my first mistake. My second mistake was watching it. I did find amusement in ripping on the characters with a few friends. Seems like the movie could have went through a little more fine tuning before they threw it to the home viewers. Some very nice scenery at times though. It's a one-renter."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're Over 65, This Film Is First Class Entertainment","review":"Never expect Hollywood to change and make a mature movie with a mature story line for the whole family, like \\"The Basket.\\" I've been to one movie theater in the last 20 years.

I truly enjoyed this little gem & in my opinion if this film was really made back n tha day it would not only had fit in perfectly it would've stood out as one of the better cult classics of that era with out a doubt!

She is released from a mental hospital and instead of heading home she hooks up with some hippies in the desert. This film was made to look like a 70's film, it does a poor job though. The entire movie was confusing and foolish. The clothing was not correct, the slang was incorrect, there was very little gore, and lots of talk. It's one of those films that makes you think you're on something crazy while watching it. I didn't like it much at all. I kept hoping it would get over with, and fast. 1.5 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"All art house, trippy, visionary, inspired, and 'AHEAD OF ITS TIME'","review":"Too bad it's from 3 years ago.I'm giving it two stars only because it was one star better than the one stars I've watched recently.

Though the Second (1937) and Sixth (1954) symphonies of Eduard Tubin are separated by seventeen years, including a world war and the composer's exile from his native Estonia to Sweden near its conclusion, both contain heroic passages, great energy, and plenty of bombast and blather -- symphonic expression writ large!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This is a great product for the price.

Excellent commentaries include Norman Siegel and Frances Fox Piven. Its really well done and also captures the perverse charisma of its star - even while expertly debunking the mythology surrounding his \\"success\\" as NYC mayor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not balanced, but an intriguing look","review":"Of course, Giuliani peetered out in his run for the White House, which came after this 06 release. So, if the filmmakers were trying to send a warning that he was the next Hitler, then it was all for naught. People do forget that the mayor was quite unpopular right before 9/11, which this film makes clear. He may have made some mistakes, but it's hard to condemn the crime downturn associated with his tenure, even if the same thing was happening elsewhere at the same time. Well worth watching even though Giuliani seems to be toast."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for little bear fans","review":"Little Bear finds and egg while picking blueberries with his friends.

It was full of anecdotes that most of us as Blacks folks have experienced. The stories were funny but they were also disturbing because so many of the situations were blatantly racist.

You are left shaking your head but with a smile on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking!","review":"While members of ITCOMS did not agree with all of Mr. Wiley's ideas, we could not stop taking about the book.

Maybe that is what the book is all about: raising awareness, thinking along different lines, and talking and exchanging ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Writer Spreads Hateful Conspiracy Theories","review":"Understandably defensive about his unfocused and rambling writing style, the late Ralph Wiley used his limited talents to lower the standard of discourse on race relations in America. Wiley's various conspiracy theories, which comprise the bulk of \\"Why Black People Tend To Shout,\\" don't withstand scrutiny, and they offer no solutions. His book has value only as a sociological example of one African American male's mindset in the late 20th century. The most accurate review comes from a paraphrasing of Wiley's own words: \\"A very unoriginal human being, this [Ralph Wiley]. Poisoned by the deciders in his youth, he learned his hate, and also learned how to pass off his own inadequacies on other people. If he didn't get something, it was somebody else's fault, not his.

It comes straight out of China which makes the shipping take longer than usual. It took approximately 2 weeks for mine to arrive which was actually fairly quickly. I do question the durability of this product simply because when you grip it to insert it into the cigarette lighter it feels like it might break in you hand. I probably wouldn't buy this again simply because it took so long to get here but I've had no problems with its as of yet...and who knows, it may last forever.

So I thought I would like this. I hated it! The so called jokes just didn't work. I don't think it's even the jokes themselves, but her timing, delivery, and especially her attitude of look at me, I'm so funny and bad! She's not original, just a complete gimmick with PR as slick as her black hair. How much did audience members get paid to laugh? Or maybe it's just a laugh track because the camera hardly shows the audience. It was a waste of my money and minutes of my life that I will never get back. Comedy isn't supposed to put you in a bad mood. How could I not have noticed that 87 people are trying to get rid of copies? I won't bother trying to resell it. I'm just going to throw it in the trash and watch Borat for some comic relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus is Magic, Sarah is Contrived","review":"I like the concept of the DVD and the execution, but Sarah herself as a comedian is contrived and trite. She seems to be specifically seeking \\"controversial\\" topics and poking fun at them. It gets a bit tedious after a time. She thinks she is being fun and on the fringe, but she is pretty lame in the end. I ended up fast forwarding a lot of this DVD. Not worth buying for sure and hardly worth a rental. She seems 10 years too late. I hope her next movie/DVD is a bit more original and not so trying to push the envelope - it shows she is trying too hard (and that is sad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, watch me. I'm over here. Look, look.","review":"Well, I guess we need humor to soften or make sense of life's hard parts. But shock-value comics can easily slip into vulgarity, and who wants to catch themselves laughing at vulgarity? My common reactions to this DVD were \\"did she really say that?!?\\", not \\"gee, that was funny\\". I do like her amusement at life's incongruities and wish she could do more of that and less orifice humor.Silverman seems to have little sense of comic timing; she just seems to stumble across punch lines or almost forgets to recite them. Her continual playing with her hair was an annoyance and borderline unprofessional. The pretaped segments and music videos were lame and obvious padding/filler.Root-canal comics often back themselves into a one-dimensional outhouse of their own building. Use of the f-word automatically tends to crowd out the subtle gradations between reality and what-should-be from which most humor springs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah Silverman is not hot enough to carry this garbage for 72 minutes...","review":"If you have never seen extremely vulgar comedy, this DVD might be very amusing to you. However, if your a fan of George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Chris Rock, etc.....this is not worth your time.Most of the jokes are not witty or insightful in the slightest little bit and rely soley on their obscene nature for humour. Again, virgin ears might find it amusing--those looking for good comedy will sit in silence with the occasional chuckle and eventually just get bored and turn it off.I'm half-way convinced Sarah Silverman actually wrote this in one day (as the opeing sequence alludes to) and that the whole thing was one big joke on everyone who paid money to watch it. Thankfully I did not and you should not either."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"There are some funny parts, but I find this boring and practically cliche with overplayed racial jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really funny at all","review":"I'm a big fan of Mr. Show and thus i decided to rent this film this past week when i saw it at the video store and i have to say i was very disappointed in it. Her humor is, for one, not that funny and rarely witty. Second of all, it seems like she falls back on 'controversial' humor such as ethic jokes like a crutch, as if for no other reason than to show that she is 'edgy'. This more often seems to come out a bit forced, and given how many times she references it just gets old more than anything else. Like, it would be one thing if they were actually funny ethic jokes, but they are for the most part pretty lame, and thus they seem pointless. There is little to no plot, it consists of mainly short musical vignettes in addition to her stand up which takes up the majority of the film.seriously, don't rent this or buy this...if you do and find out that it sucks as much as i'm saying, dont say i didn't warn you"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies ever","review":"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

I think she is amazingly hilarious and incredibly original.NOW. having gotten that out of the way I must say that I was so incredibly disappointed with Jesus Is Magic i don't even have words to describe how i feel. The show was peppered with funny parts, i will admit.. funny lines as well. The problem is those funny parts and funny lines are so very few and far between that it makes it a complete and entire waste of time. The parts that were the funniest were the songs that Ms. Silverman sings. Those same songs, by the way, I had seen on YouTube the day prior to buying the DVD. In seeing the clips, i assumed the rest of the show would have been as funny as the clips.. I was so wrong.MY ADVISE: Search for Sarah Silverman on YouTube, enjoy the clips and take your $19.99 and buy yourself something you might actually enjoy. and if u MUST own it, I happen to have one I would love to sell you. CHEAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"WOW........this was bad.I think I laughed maybe twice tops.This was not entertaining at all mainly because her humour is strange, pointless and disturbing. (Nana's funeral, enough said)I enjoy comedians like Dane Cook, Chris Rock, Margaret Cho, Russel Peters, George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, Seinfeld and more. So, as you can see I have a pretty wide variety of comedic tastes and I don't mind racial humour when it is done fairly (meaning no race is exempt) like Russel Peters. I think the most important thing about a comedian is thier ability to make you see/feel/understand what they are saying. But Sarah Silverman can't do that at all. Be warned, you have to already be like her going in or else you won't like this at all.

I enjoyed her religious and ethnic humor as well as much as the sexual humor, however there are a few things I don't like, and that is crude humor that isn't funny other than the fact it is being crude such as her porno song, or pretending to sing out of her butt.

SNOOKERED!I was on the list for a long time to buy this, waited anxiously for some new edge comedy, over the top craziness, something different and out there, the anticipation was almost to much to bear, and I got this YAWNER.I really wish I would have rented it first.

Here's this Jewess with an obvious nose job (something apparently endemic in the culture) and frizzy hair saying anything for shock value. She's crass, bigoted, unfunny and uninspired. OK, she's willing to cross any line. Big deal. So was I...in sixth grade. As an adult, however, I much more value insightful comedy with an intelligent wit. She's the antithesis of that. Yet one has to believe that someone this over the top and self-involved should be on the stage or screen somewhere. Maybe doing dog food commercials...."},{"rating":"1","title":"not true widescreen; cropped picture","review":"The aspect ratio is messed up on the dvd (or how it displays on my dvd player).

I mention these people because they are \\"shocking\\", but also actually funny.Every one of Sarah's jokes hinges on the fact that she is a, very mildly, attractive girl saying somethign \\"awful\\". Sorry, but I didn't laugh once.Whoever said she is original is way off. What is original about saying dirty joke? There is not an ounce of humanity or even anything thought provoking in her humor. She leaves me scratching my head wondering if this is the new acceptable form of comedy. I certainly hope not. She is a few rungs below burlesque if you ask me.Please think before you say you like this movie. Ask yourself a few questions:1. Why did I laugh?2. Why didn't I laugh?3. Is being a racist really funny, even if its under the weak guise of irony?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I went to the theatre with my sister and we had the best time laughing till we cried.

It's mostly her on a stage doing stand up comedy. I really thought it was going to be more of a movie. In between the stand up comedy there are musical numbers, all of which I have already seen on Youtube a billion times. I don't think Sarah is a very good stand up comedian, she just stands there being rigid trying to get the audience to laugh at her overplayed jokes. I even bought her book \\"The Bedwetter\\", and that book was sloppily put together and boring. And what was that random part in the beginning of the movie where Sarah wipes off a tear and that gay ginger catches it and jerks off with it? It wasn't even funny..........just awkward and randomly placed."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt laugh","review":"not once. didnt even smile. sure, her monologue was offensive in an unimaginative borrish way. not sure if that qualifies as controversial. the sketches were worse than her routine.there are a lot of really really bad female comics out there - SS stands out as one of the lamest."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful","review":"The movie is basically a comedy routine generously (and thankfully) interspersed with some sketch comedy. Her pacing is so slow, it's as if she was told that she needed an hour's worth of comedy, but she only had 20 minutes of material. Then, instead of coming up with 40 more minutes, she just slowed down her joke delivery by one-third.And the jokes aren't even very funny. Most of the laughter from the audience seems to be of the nervous kind. Brash and offensive jokes work when you don't do them ALL THE TIME. That way, the audience is caught off-guard when you go \\"zag\\" and the audience is expecting you to \\"zig\\". But she relies so heavily on the \\"I-can't-believe-she-said-that\\" style, that the audience comes to expect it.Unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough for the stage","review":"As a young girl, Sarah would hang out with the boys and quickly picked up on their potty humor. Shockingly, she would always one-up them, and soon they were all crazy about her. She got a reputation as a funny girl. But what's funny at 13 isn't funny at 20 or 30. She's never grown up.The best humor -- the humor that endures -- is intelligent humor. This is the antithesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah is Adorably Offensive","review":"Sarah Silverman's comedy is primarily rooted in hy-larious topics like rape, AIDS, and the holocaust. She constantly mashes up the adorable and the horrifying in her routine.Unlike a lot of shock comedy, Sarah never comes across as angry. Her persona is always sunny and self-absorbed and ready to follow up a horribly racist comment with something even more awful... or with a song.Yes, a song. The movie includes several musical numbers. The songs are good for the most part, but best of all is the signature visual direction and musical arrangement of Liam Lynch.If you're not easily offended, you'll have a great time with this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Silverman","review":"If you have seen anything by Sarah and you have liked it you will like this.

Also discussed at great length is the role of Victoria, Gladstone and Disraeli in the establishment of the British Empire that emerged at the beginning of the 20th Century. For the casual reader or student of history, Churchill is relatively approachable and easy to read.

The Street Fighter was way ahead of it's time as far as special effects go and it's mainly non-stop action laced with an intricate story line. This series is by far one of best martial arts movies that one can find. It's a little dated, as it was filmed in the 60's, but nevertheless a must for anyone who enjoys the martial arts genre. I rate Sonny Chiba's preformance right up there with Bruce Lee in this set. Sonny Chiba later had an accident that injured his spine and he couldn't move the way he does in the Street Fighter, so your seeing a true martial artist in his prime, dominating the screen in one of the best movie series in martial arts.

Sellers had died before it's making, and so you are stuck with a sloppy thrown together movie. The first movie (the Pink Panther) and Revenge of the Pink Panther are fair, and Trail of the Pink Panther is brutal.I would recommend buying Pink Panther Strikes again (Without question the best of the series), A Shot in the Dark, and Return of the Pink Panther.

Oh yes, sure you can see outtakes from the other films and it could have been considered as bonus material but certainly doesn't warrent inclusion as part of the actual series.I say we should all boycott this boxed set and send a message to corporate greed.

Common televisions scan/refresh rate is too slow. Each eye gets only 15 frames/second which is too low for fast motion. Even direct view CRT televisions show ghosting of images to wrong eye. The phosphors just don't have time to cool between frames.THE ANIMATED CONTENT ON THE INCLUDED DVDS IS TERRIBLE. Same roller coaster/mine train theme repeated over and over and over.One of the movies does have music video of live persons.

Both are fumbling, innocent little things, orphaned and adopted by human families. Winnie couldn't keep his sticky little paws out of the honey jar, and Paddingtons fondness for marmalade could be called obsessive... However for all these simmilarites the one difference is that while child-like pooh looked to Mr Robin for guidance, it was the wee bear in galoshas and a rain hat, found at the Paddington railway station, whose simplistic outlook on life saved his adoptive family from complete destruction of sanity in the day-to-day madness of the world. Paddington was a saviour in childhood, and is bound to be an absolute delight for any child who learns of his misadventures, his love of marmalade and his earnest love of his newly adopted family and newly adopted life in city."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of a marvelous picturebook series","review":"A delightful adaptation of Michael Bond's classic bear story, about Paddington the Peruvian bear, and the English family that adopts him. This large-format picturebook recaps the first of Bond's famous chapter book, from 1958, wherein Paddington is first found at a railway station and is brought back to the Brown family home. The bright, colorful artwork is perfect: it captures the warmth and whimsy of the original series, presenting us with a little, wobbly, innocent bear who is every bit as fuzzy and lovable now as he was 'way back when.(Note: there are several other picturebooks in this series with artwork by R.

Without the editing process, we hear 'one take' Glenn, free and spontaneous. The Beethoven 2nd concerto has more fun and sparkle than either the live Leningrad recording or the studio disc with Bernstein. The music making is pure joy throughout, sunny, happy and played to perfection.The Mozart C minor (one of Gould's most inspired interpretations) is a lighter and less intense than the brooding studio recording. The Haydn and Beethoven have their moments, but Gould went on to rediscover Haydn towards the end of his career with more obvious relish.Of course these are live, unedited performances.

A box with holographic brains? Photos of robots? Mad scientists? Cheezy science fiction film stills? And yet, without mocking it, the brain begs for us to revel in our love of this new frontier pondered so much over the last 50 years.The music ranges from the insanely familiar (The Jetson's Theme song) to the curious buzzing of artists like John Zorn and the appreciation for the silly through, oh, I don't know...

In documenting a remote region of her country, its people, and their way of life, she reaches breathtaking heights, both emotional and intellectual, artistic and political. Araya is, in short, a work of the very highest order that does some of the greatest things cinema can do, and Milestone should be applauded for bringing something so valuable to us, with so much care and attention lavished upon its audiovisual integrity.

I really wish Imus would exercise more srutiny with the books he chooses to endorse. Most of the time he is right on with his recommendations as was the case with Tim Russerts recent book. He should know that anyone writing for that overrated rag New York Times is going to put a left leaning slant on everything they write.

Dowd and her usually unnamed Washington sources generally confirmed my suspicions about the Bush administration, while occasionally answering some pertinent questions. For instance, whose idea was it to invade Iraq, and for what real reasons (not the ones Powell trotted out to the UN General Assembly)? Dowd always came through with eminently plausible answers, but there was never a smoking gun.With the Bush administration falling over itself since its re-election, trying to cover up its misrepresentations and recover from its mistakes, this book connects all the dots. For all-time Bush-haters, rereading these columns affirms our most realistic suspicions. For those who haven't read Dowd's columns before, it shows that the evidence was there all along."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth picking up","review":"I read a very favorable review of this book at a site called www.spunkybean.com and it compelled me to go right out at lunch and pick it up.

She has a level of insight into the D.C. power plays that are invaluable to those of us who want a better understanding of what's really going on. I find her keen political insights entertaining and consistantly on target, whether she's picking on the right or the left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bushworl: Enter at Your Own Risk","review":"Dowd is a brilliant writer who exposes the dirt on Bush Sr. and George W. Bush. In her unstated assumptions and metaphors Dowd implies how President Bush is an awful president and how he lacks the knowledge of potentially being a strong president. While exposing the dirt on Mr. Bush, Dowd makes fun of Bush's actions and statements and implies how Bush does not know how to run his own presidency because of his lack of leadership. In her cleverness Dowd summarizes President Bush and his administration as the Bushworld, \\"It's their reality. We just live and die in it\\".

But I stuck with it hoping there would be more. The more was just a waste of time. Even by the middle of story I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. This story had such potential, too bad that potential wasn't developed. I am convinced that this book was made in a hurry for sales reasons only. Please don't insult a seasoned romance readers' intelligence by publishing such nonsense. A real turn off to a faithful Bradford reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I had expected a much better read from this author, since I had read the Woman of Substance saga.

It starts with some sparse old footage of George and a brief explanation of him. At one point we see the driveway to his property!!! but no George? Were then told by various people in the surf industry what an influence George has been on their surfing, which is fine I understand what they mean, and then treated to some footage of a few pros surfing, which is OK, but still no George? There was a glimmer of hope towards the end as we then see George start to inflate a mat, at this point I honestly believed Id get to see George surf but alas no. Its cuts. No interview, dialogue or anything from the man himself. When I looked at the viewing time before watching I thought 35 minutes of this would fly by, it didnt. I get that the film was meant as a homage to GG, but I really think that it didnt do him justice at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but not square","review":"I double-, triple- and quadruple-checked against other squares and against itself (using the \\"draw a line and flip it\\" technique). Mine was off by over a 1/16 of an inch over its length. It was packed well and the shipping box was in excellent shape, so I'm sure that shipping damage didn't cause the inaccuracy. Also, it had a serious burr on the end of the blade where it had obviously been stamped out. I'll give it an extra star for the pretty handle, but it's definitely not the quality I expected. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Square in Try Square?","review":"First thing I did when I recieved this was to test it for square using the mark - flip - mark method.

This is the best scenery that she has had in a DVD and if you have knee problems (like I do), go at a slower pace. Lots of squats and arm work but you will really target your entire body.

The live footage is great. The audio quality is excellent. Be forewarned, however, that there are f and s-words on this disk, as profanity is used during the show and during the documentary.

We've been lucky enough to see them live twice. We couldn't wait to get this DVD home. It was disappointing. The first time we saw them live the vocals were weak. This DVD reflects the same. We just recently saw them on their \\"Us and Them\\" tour. The performance far surpassed what we saw live and on the DVD. My recommendation is to wait until the next live DVD comes out.

The concerto is one of my favorite pieces of music ever, and this recording does justice to it with the usual Lindberg flair. Highly recommended. Buy it! Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"In aww and confused at the same time...","review":"This cd is , yes, another great accomplishment and performance by Christian Lindberg, one of if the not the best trombonist of our time. I really enjoyed the David Concertino and Morceau Symphonique because I have played them before, and it is great to listen to someone a million times better than you play a piece that you are familiar with, so that you can get a grasp of how it should be played and how it sounds. BUT, I was really suprised at how Lindberg plays the Grondahl Concerto. His tune is way off and his tone and pitch never seem to be what they are supposed to be. Either that or my ears are out of whack. I was disappointed, but he does redeem himself in every other piece. The cd is worth buying for every song except the Grondahl. Only in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine example of Lindberg's Virtuosity","review":"It's quite interesting to note how Lindberg's sound changes over the years. If you listen to this recording and then listen to one of his more recent releases, you can hear how his sound has become more refined, crisp and \\"tight\\".His extreme high register (high F, etc.) also becomes stronger over the years. Just goes to show that even the world's best can still get better. This CD contains great examples of the \\"Classic\\" Trombone Concertos (that David Cadenza is unbelievable!), and the World Premiere recording of the de Frumerie Concerto is just as good; if not the most exciting piece on the whole album. However, I too noticed some spots where Lindberg's tuning is less than perfect (particularly Grondahl). Nevertheless, Lindberg does incredible justice to each piece he records. Definitely worth your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"20% Christmas, 80% NOT!","review":"What does Ed Sullivan, a cowboy skit, the 3 Stooges and Red giving out movie awards have to do with Christmas? NOTHING, so why are they included in a DVD called Red Skelton's Christmas Classics?!! The ONLY Christmas in this DVD is the first scene called Freddy and the Yuletide doll from the 1960's. About 20 minutes long. This scene was the heart touching Christmas story that I saw when I was 9. It is about Red as Freddy the Freeloader finding a raggedy ann doll that came to life temporarily after he wished upon a star. It brought back many memories because I hadn't seen it in 40 years. It has a few short Christmas songs in it along with Red's brand of humor and facial expressions; (No dialogue). It really took me back to my childhood when Christmas was about snow, warm holiday music and family. If you want this one particular yuletide skit, buy it because I don't know where else you can get it. Otherwise, 80% of this DVD is NOT Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool looking Bar","review":"I put this one to my kawasaki z750 and it looks good and feels like a hundred times better.

Her mother longs for her to conform.An escaped convict enters into this unhappy existence and releases long surpressed passions in Deneuve, which has major consequences for her and her son.For once, Lili is true to herself but this comes at a price.

I was not able to complete this test in eight hours. When I took the actual PE exam a short time later, it was much simpler, and I finished both sessions with time to spare.I will say this - if you can take the exam in this book in 8 hours, and get over half of the questions right, then you should have no problem on the real thing.For a set of practice questions that more closely resembles the actual exam, I recommend the NCEES published book. Those questions have a comparable level of difficulty and take about the right amount of time to solve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you are taking the Civil / Structural exam this book has nothing to do with the real exam, you will waste your time on this book. If you are taking the 16 hr structural test again this book will have nothing to do with the test and you will waste your time.There is no point in writing a book which is so far above and beyond the level of the exam. Lindeburg has this ridiculous philosophy of trying to prepare people to a practical exam with excess, in most cases unnecessary and time wasting, theory. 90% of the structural afternoon questions are theory intensive and do not reflect the type of problems in the real exam. Real exam tests your ability to think practically and implement your engineering knowledge into the solution, you are not expected to blow 30 minutes on a question by solving equations.This is the last time I am spending any money on Lindeburg's garbage books.

The author, Uchda san, successfully combined the story with a very strong history background. He allowed the readers be able to \\"learn\\" the real life of Japanese-American particularly before and during the WWII. At the same time, he unveiled the \\"conflicts\\" between the second generations and with their immigrated parents in the United States. However, there is one thing I would like to point out.

It's still fantastic to have access to this video content (a full 4 hours and 10 minutes). The documentary is a very interesting spin on the inner turmoil that led to the breakup...

It was a rainy summer day when I was about 15. I went over to my friends house and he put on \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\". To say the least it was like nothing I had heard before. Within days I was at the record store to buy this record. I was hooked.ELP was a musician's band. Through out the early 70's they won numerous magazine fan polls for best band and also for each of their individual instruments.The performances in this collection are a bit chopped off in places for sure. I would still like to see a complete performance of Karn Evil 9 for example. But this is still the best collection on the market as far as I can tell.The interviews with the various members, managers and producers are also very good, candid and honest.If you like this band, then get this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy!","review":"Unfortunately I am NOT happy with this seller and neither this product because it looks so good and nice on the internet but after I used it first time started being rusty and I try to contact the seller to ask him about it and I did not get anything back neither a way of replacement or to receive another one but is not recommended to use a product which started being rust, I am sorry that I have to write this down on my review but I wait already more than 2 weeks to get an answer back and nothing happened.

These lives are connected as the American woman becomes good friends with Hannah and they find out about Leah through artifacts she and her contemporaries have left behind.This story is so well-written, it flows. Its mystery, intrigue, and engaging characters kept me turning the pages till the wee hours.Near the end the author shows the relationship between feasts in the Hebrew scriptures and their fulfillments in Jesus' life. Even though I have not read the first 2 books in the trilogy, I thoroughly enjoyed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three stories artfully woven together like a mosaic","review":"This novel has an amazing depth of history and spiritual insight that cannot be fully comprehended with one reading. Whether it is the story of Abby an American Schoolteacher, Hannah an Israeli archaeologist, or Leah a new testament servant girl and Yeshua believer, the theme is very clear- God sent his son to forgive everyone of their sins. However, we too must forgive in order to receive this wonderful gift.The book is filled with memorable quotes. My favorite being, \\"We are those individual stones in God's design. . . The master artist cuts us and shapes us so that we each fit into place.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The only PHP reference and start-up book you need","review":"This book is simply marvelous. It is straight forward and deals with all essential topics on PHP. This book begins with installation, configuration and testing of Apache and MySQL for the purpose of PHP. The rest of the book deals with basic PHP programming to advanced topics such as PHP & MySQL together. Every chapter of the book comes with tutorial and working code examples. Other topics includes 'Sending Email with PHP', 'File Handling with PHP' and 'User Authentication'. Mike McGrath did a good job by making this book concise, practical and handy. As an experience programmer, I find it the only book I need to get started with PHP. It gets you to understand how PHP works conceptually through the examples given. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn by example with this short book (great for reference too)","review":"It's a very short book, and it teaches you by example. If you have previous programming experience with something that uses a similar syntax (C++, for example), you can learn the basics of PHP/MySQL in a casual week with this book, after which you can use it for a very useful reference. It doesn't delve into classes much, nor into security, but it serves as a great quick-start into PHP/MySQL regardless and will have you writing your first useful PHP-enhanced websites within a week or two.There is a newer version of this book now, updated for PHP 5, so you will likely want to buy that instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Yes I'll pray for Daddy\\"","review":"This little movie caught me off guard and had me rolling in the floor with laughter. Howard Hesseman(Head Of The Class, WKRP) is a riot as a father who is just a little past Attila The Hun and he rules over his daughter with a ruthless hand. He is about to die and as his daughter arrives with boyfriend in tow(Neil Patrick Harris), he swears in no small measure that he will never let Neil have his little girl. Enter the quack of the title who plans to hypnotize the old boy so that his last moments are pain free. Problems is he dies while he is still in the trance and things become very strange after that.The comedy of horrors is very well made and the cast is great, but make no mistake Harris and Hesseman are the show here as they square off over the girl. Hessemans final threat to Harris and Harris' \\"prayer\\" for Hesseman are side spliting fun and will have you backing up to hear them more than once.Very much worth your time and sure to make you smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MESMERIST DVD REVIEW","review":"This movie kind off caught me off guard.

I read somewhere that I should put this straight on the warts so I did. Remember it was HUGE. After a few weeks of using this everyday and scratching at the warts it died and fell off. I was excited. I told my son we were washing it. He never thought twice. The Doc. wanted me to put acid on it. I don't think so. Not on my baby.So I'm a big advocate of this stuff.

The author inserts Charlotte's writings too frequently. The book doesn't flow, it is too choppy. It is hard to understand because one minute you're reading about Charlotte and then the next minute you are reading something that she wrote and there isn't a smooth transition between the two. The author interprets all of Charlotte's writings as though everything she wrote was based on her life experience and Charlotte wasn't creative enough to come up with her own plots and characters apart from her own experiences. It's too subjective.

It's a good thing this wasn't the first book I'd read by her or else I'd never touch another of her books. For starters, minus the fact that Chelsea has black hair, her life parallels that of the author and the book read like an autobiography. Chelsea is from California, she's a romance writer (Catherine even has Chelsea writing stories from her Star and Song series), she likes to workout, and David is a physician (like Catherine's husband), the list goes on and on...

What did Eliot see in her besides a pretty face and a knack at investing??! An example of out dated writing is when the author wrote about a six mth pg where the mother decided to take up smoking and go on a drinking binge and the Dr. thinking that since it was only a wk of debauchery the baby would be okay.

The introduction explains that the object ball will be black and other balls will be grey. Unfortunately the reproduction of the grey balls is basically black.Under bright lighting and close examination you can see a slight difference, but it's much harder than it should be.

Not as bad as \\"Scarface\\" (1983) or \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" but almost as bad with its unrelenting graphic violence and The Phantom's stitching himself back together.

Andrew Lloyd Webber's version and the original novel contain so much beauty, so much romanticism, so many haunting images... This terrible Robert Englund film is just a cheap horror film. It's not even scary... it's gross. So it doesn't even work as an effective horror film. It's more a slasher flick. Englund (of Freddy Krueger fame) totally misses the opportunity to play an effective Phantom. He just snarls and grunts and isn't menacing at all. 'The Phantom of the Opera' is one of the most romantic tales of all time. There's no love here. I mean, there are these fights scenes where the Phantom murders people. It's quite pathetic. And then, there are these parallels to modern times??? It's ridicolus. What a miserable film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor example of Phantom","review":"OK...all I have to say is: Freddy as The Phantom????? NO!!!!!!This movie showed promise, but it became more of a slasher/Jack the Ripper-ish movie with a phantom that must sew a new face on periodically (and he hunts down victims to get new skin for his messed up face....creepy).Only purchase this to put in your Phantom movie collection...watch it once, then forget about it.

Since early childhood I've been weaned on it), but they're pretty obscure. The portrayal of Christine was rather good, but I do NOT like what they did to Erik. First of all, I have a hard time imagining him with a prostitute(!) and in the book, his Don Juan Triumphant meant so much more than a vehicle to make him famous. I believe this movie to *not* be for Phantom lovers, but it's GREAT for horror movie fans. In that respect, I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A retelling of the classic story","review":"An aspiring opera singer is transported to Victorian-era London and into the arms of a disfigured and evil maestro determined to make her a star. Christine experiences the joys of success until she realizes that her lover has been murdering people to make her success possible. He's not gonna stop until he has completed a masterpiece of blood.This is a very different tale than what we have come to know. The violence is the focus here. The original version of this tale is more of a well rounded story. It mixes the love and killing quite well. In this version the murderous nature of the Phantom is focused on more heavily. That being said, this is still a pretty entertaining movie. It's a great watch for any fan of the slasher horror genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy's got a new gig","review":"I really liked this movie. It is a nice change to the orginal Phantom of the Opera and a gory one at that. The acting was very good and the story line solid. Don't get me wrong, I do like the orginal and the remake of the orginal that was a big Hollywood hit. But this one puts a different edge on the story and it makes it a little different and interesting also. I do recommend it to any horror fan that likes the story of The Phantom of the Opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words can't even describe the horror.","review":"Well to start the movie is nothing like the book it's like the writers never read a page or even opened up the book characters are missing and new one's are created the phantom looks more like Freddy than they way he is decribed in the book. Everything that made the book and the 1925 silent film great is not in here the love story lacks the horror isn't even scary the story makes no since the entire film is daul and horrible. If I could give it less stars I would \\"0\\" is the true number of stars this film deserves. The one thing that is good about it is the costume that the phantom is wearing at the masquerade looks like it should other than that this movie was worthless in my eyes. I'll stick to the book, the silent film, and the musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"if the filmmakers had only read the book","review":"the Phantom is a subject of much curiousity, both in film, and in related books. Unfortunatly, the film-makers seem not to have read the book. There is much bloody violence that is simply NOT a part of the story, nor is it needed in their interpretation. I have just finished watching the DVD of this film. It dishonored the author.However, I did give it one star....I was curious to see how the film-makers completed the story. I was not satisfied. There is what I would call \\"gratuitous\\" blood-letting.....it was unneccessary.Since I borrowed this DVD from a library, I cannot say that I was cheated on the price, but, I would not recommend it.I would recommend reading the book. It is far better than this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"upsetting","review":"After reading Gaston Leroux's original novel AND watching the 2004 Phantom of the Opera, this movie completely threw me off. Many \\"Phans\\" know that Erik had murdered people, but this movie depicted a serial killer Erik, that would kill anyone (and that means ANYONE). Meanwhile the music in this was very \\"weak\\". The main song that was really sung was a VERY revised verison of \\"Don Juan Triumphiant\\", which was completely the opposite of what I expected it to be. Rent the movie before buying. However dedicated \\"Phans\\" may not enjoy it compared to the 2004 and stage version of PoTo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horror movie, so-so Phamtom version","review":"As your run-of the mill horror/slasher movie this film kicks some serious behind. As a version of Phantom...look out for the pitchfork weilding purists. Erik Desler is one of those deformed-latter-on-in-life-Phantoms. Howver it is not by acid for a change. Instead he makes a deal with Satan to have his music live forever. Apparently somwhere a wire got crossed and he got immortality for himself, no recognition for his music and all the flesh peeled from his face. To cover his deformities he is forced to kill and skin people every few days. In one of the more graphic scenes you actually get to witness his removing his face, though I thought this scene was very nicely done from an artistic standpoint. Unfortunetlythe story does not take place in Paris, but in England. One of the more violent of the Phantom genre, this movie is still a much-watch for any phan with a strong stomach, especially those who hate Carlotta..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie!","review":"This movie was pretty good for a horror movie.

What makes 'Just Wright' better than most of these \\"Rom/Coms\\"? is a likable cast and a more realistic approach. What I liked about this film is they didn't make the villain one dimensional, Morgan who is a gold digger and very self centered isn't all bad just like \\"real\\" people are. Most people aren't all bad or good for that matter and even though we hate her in this film, she doesn't try to hurt her childhood friend purposely, it just happens. Queen Latifah can make a good film better and a bad film tolerable. She is very natural and it is really hard not to like her. Of course this film will make you go all mushy in the end, but what do you expect? it's a romantic comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great romantic movie","review":"Queen Latifah shines in this movie as does Common.

I rented it twice before I purchased my own copy! Queen and Common's characters have so much chemistry in the movie! They BOTH feel that \\"red and blue\\" run thru their veins! I enjoyed their talks, walks, playful and serious times! Their characters got to know each other better than Scott and Morgan plus it wasn't just a physical attraction! They had developed a genuine friendship which was appealing in itself. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! The music is truly entertaining! The various songs fit the scenarios.

That aspect of the film didn't ring true to me. I know plenty of women who're not a size 2 who meet, fall in love, and marry the men of their dreams. Do you think these women let society dictate how they're supposed to feel about their size? No! There are plenty of men who like women with curves. Otherwise, I absolutely loved Just Wright.

As for the rest of the cast: Superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"SOCIALLY CHANGING\\", DELIVERS HOPE","review":"Just a simple story, with some romantic silliness, not much to take seriously--hun?!--.THAT'S NOT \\"JUST WRIGHT\\". This movie crossed some American social-lines that we thought were unbreakable. The black man wins his black woman; the black woman believes and accepts his romance; the seriously (romantic) star is not skinny; the star is not helpless but she is loving and vunerable: just a girl who falls hard for a guy but she keeps her pride until he wakes up to smell the cream in his coffee. Then 'happiness' that we can believe in is on its gosomer wings and this movie leaves you flying high.I said it after each four viewings of this movie: \\"This movie has it...that magic!\\" And I was right: 'Just Wright' is still right for me; I'm going to buy the video for my library.

It also leads to a high profile career in the NBA as a Trainer.... uh, yeah sure.The plot is as far fetched as the writing is cerebral. Everything about this film is horrible. From the corny game Latifah kicks, to the fact we're watching a film about the Nets, yet the film has absolutely no historical connection to the team.After 15 mins of watching the film, you'll be able to predict the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acting, No Chemistry","review":"This movie was terrible!! No wonder it never made it to the theaters. I got this as a bootleg and just want to give it back! I was really surprised at the bad acting and predictable script because Common and Queen Latifah have done well in a lot of roles in other big budget movies. First of all, Queen's character didn't feel like she was really looking for a man, but everyone around her was looking for her. Then when she met Common's character, it took FOREVER for them to realize they liked each other. Common and Queen Latifah had absolutely NO sexual chemistry at all. Not one time in all the \\"quality time\\" they shared did they even act attracted to one another! Watching them together was like watching someone eat Wonder bread soaked in tap water, trying to convince you it tastes good. The best part of this movie was Phylicia Rashad's part as the mother, but even that role was a waste of her time. Do better black people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, bad acting by Common, deserves no stars","review":"A typical boring movie. Plot, incredibly uninspired... I love Queen Latifah so I really wanted to see this movie, but as I predicted, Common's acting was terrible.

No need to fear the sturdiness of this crate. It is far more sturdy than almost all the crates I have looked at at the pet stores. It is definitely more sturdy than my previous crates and they held a rottie and a lab. My only complaint is with UPS. The box was mangled when I found it sitting in the rain on my front porch.

Instead you can stand next to the crate and just pull the top of the door slightly and the door will open. Don't worry, it's impossible for the dogs to do this. I suppose if we also used the latch in the middle we would have to bend over but these crates stay secure while the dogs are sleeping without using the second latch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wire \\"GoGo\\" Crate","review":"I think this is the best Dog Crate on the market.

We have over 80 songs that stretch from the very beginnings of LOS LOBOS until the present day.

While that song is included here, it is overshadowed by the great songs that this band has consistenly made. We have all the hits from the group: ONE TIME ONE NIGHT, WILL THE WOLF SURVIVE?, SET ME FREE (ROSA LEE), THIS TIME. We are also treated to songs from the various side projects and solo albums that the group members have worked on.

When I discovered that there was a film adaptation of this Oates' story and that it had been casted with the seductive and cagey Laura Dern, I expected, at the very least, that the basic storyline would have been preserved. That Chopra changed the ending of this classic short story is truly disappointing--Ms. Oates, how could you allow it? The sappy love-hate relationship between Connie and her mother is phony, the actress who played Connie's weird sister could use more than a few more drama lessons, and the character of Arnold Friend has been reduced to a dorky and only slightly creepy Rick Springfield look-a-like. This film project should have been handed to David Lynch."},{"rating":"1","title":"More rocky than smooth","review":"A coming-of-age movie about a teenage girl (Laura Dern) whose chief interest in life is getting it on with some guy. She goes parading all over town looking for likely prospects until she meets Treat Williams, who is much older.

Dern did better work elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre attempt at giving background information","review":"The main problem of this DVD was the overreliance on the movie for everything. The historical data was good and interesting but frequent use of movie cutscenes ruined any atmosphere. This DVD attempted to be both a behind-the-scenes featurette and a documentary and pretty much failed as both to be interesting and watchable.The format of the DVD was a \\"Question and Answer\\" and short simplified answers were given (though some were good) that was in total 53 minutes long. The special features consisted of old news reel stories and propaganda (which had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor) with a short explanatory info blurb tacked on. $ for this seems totally unrealistic.I personally recommend Tora!

Though Nichol's is an interesting personality, this book is poorly written. Most annoying is the fact that the author, David Breshnahan, constantly repeats himself from one chapter to the next. I remember doing this in Jr. High School when I needed to write an essay X number of pages long. Another disappoinment is the Appendix where evidence is presented to support Nichol's story. This should have been the beefiest part, but instead we only get an appetizer. Bottom line: If you have read books by Pritchard, Aldrich, et al., and you crave more, \\"Damage Control\\" still might be worth $15 -- one thing it will do is stir your anger, Liberal or Conservative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Product Switch","review":"I bought a 256MB USBDrive from this vendor and although this page clearly names and shows shows a high quality USBDrive the vendor is actually shipping an Aigo unit.

His friend, a former priest now an attorney, and his friend's partner and ex-wife take on his defense, against the wishes of the archdiocese. The archdiocese has its own agenda, being hit by so many lawsuits about clergy misbehavior, so it looks like their main goal is to keep the case as low profile as possible rather than prove that the priest is innocent.

The numerous differences between British and Americans terms for, and use of, punctuation probably occurred after the American Revolution but before the modern period; a bit more curiosity on the part of the author would have been helpful here. 3.

After all, even the little hyphen makes a world of difference.

Where were the copy editors? Of course, it is written for the British and the British have differences in those rules.(North Americans say \\"third\\" rather than \\"thirdly\\" and Americans may not place a semicolin in the salutation of a business letter, for example.)That notwithstanding, this book should have been proofed to perfection since its theme is \\"zero tolorance\\" for such things.

This book suffers in comparison to others such as Patricia O'Conner's \\"Woe is I\\", which present English abuses in a clever and better written style and which provide examples of incorrect usage and their corrected versions.

She's a lady after my own heart. I gleaned a lot of useful history behind the rules and laughed heartily while doing it. Who knew there was so much to the apostrophe?I'm also thankful that Truss is mindful of different styles (AP being the one I adhere to) and the ways of we wacky Americans. She knows that grammar itself continues to change over the centuries.Truss is a beacon of hope for those who despair that any semblance of structure is fast evaporating from all written discourse.

Those who follow Ms. Truss's teaching will, perhaps unknowingly, violate American rules of grammar, punctuation, and style. In addition, the book is not systematically arranged or complete, so it cannot reliably be used as a reference. Many of the set-in examples are purposely wrong, so that, by contrast with CMS, a reader cannot look to the examples for guidance. In my opinion, the author's attempted humor falls short, too. Karen Elizabeth Gordon's _The New Well-Tempered Sentence: A Punctuation Handbook for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed_ is funnier, better organized, and more complete.

I much prefer nice people who kind-heartedly, accidentally use bad grammar to this pedantic, stuck-up author pushing her sub-par grammar on scores of innocent readers, shop keepers, and advertisers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic","review":"Yes, I know this is not a \\"grammar\\" book, but at least the chapters or paragraphs should have logical flow. Instead, not only were the sections set in a non-linear way (the line of thoughts were jumping around), moreover, I found the book to be colloquial and pedantic.To me, it's supposed to talk about punctuation, hence the chapters should have clearer headings as such. Within a chapter, the author would suddenly jump off at a tangent to discuss about spellings. And sometimes, the tone would lapse into a chit-chat manner.If this was supposed to \\"help\\" people improve their punctuation, spelling, grammar, whatever (sic), then I believe the style of the whole book should be consistent. I would give this 2.5 stars, but since there are no half-star in Amazon ratings, I gave it ***."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful approach to punctuation","review":"Who'd ever think that a book on punctuation, particularly by a Brit, would be a best seller? Only those who have heard about it or read it. It is a very delightful and entertaining treatment of the basic and even more than fundimental rules of the full stop. the comma, the semicolon and \\"brackets.\\"For a pleasent hour or so of reading, turn anywhere and relive the humor (humour, that is) of the author keeping one chuckling amused and yes, educated about the previously dull subject of punctuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous, er, I mean, Adorable","review":"A very cute read for those who appreciate proper writing. At first (even with my Library Science degree) I was a little confused by some of the puncutation until I realized the author-ess was British. Lynne is charmingly witty, and I will revisit her book time and time again.The appalling state of grammar and spelling in this country struck me about 20 years ago, when I drove up the long driveway to a riding stable which advertised, \\"Horse's for livery, Horse's for lessons, Horse's boarded.\\" Then there was this badly painted picture of a smiling horse. I couldn't stop laughing.I wish I'd thought of writing this book! Well done, Lynne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is nothing worse than intellectual arrogance","review":"I read this book with no expectations. I'm always willing to learn a few things I should have absorbed in school but wasn't paying attention that day. I laughed out loud several times and got all the way to the end without being bored, not even a single time.It is amazing to me how anyone could be so stuffy and erudite to pan this book. It's a punctuation book delivered with a light-hearted approach, for Pete's Sake.I'm actually something of a stickler myself. I can spot a misspelled word on a page instantly. It's a gift and a curse. But grammar/punctuation elitists who think this book has no value are simply the biggest boors. To these I say, exhale already. In this rapidly declining culture where written and spoken communication is being abandoned for coded shorthand, to think that someone [Lynne Truss] has made an effort to say it in layman's terms to keep language alive, should be a reason to break out in applause."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author of E,S & L shoots herself in the foot","review":"A classic example of book overhype. Ms. Truss may be a fine person and experienced writer but she desperately needs a much stronger editor, as this so-called British bestseller is wildly overwritten, hopelessly redundant, decidedly unhumorous after the first few pages, and generally not very illuminating to those of us who also abhor poor punctuation and grammar. Absolutely not worth the $17.50 it commands. Sorry, Lynne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny (aka Sticklers of the World Unite!)","review":"You may be shocked to read these words describing a book on punctuation. I would be. I can assure you, I am not exaggerating. Lynne Truss has an incisive sense of humor that drives home her point on this subject better than any other book I have read. That said, there is an important underlying theme to this book - we are losing our language. Amongst the barrage of non-punctuated e-mails, text messages, blogs, etc. we are quickly becoming a people approaching functional illiteracy. Thank you Lynne for trying to stem this tide in your uniquely humorous fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commits the cardinal sin of books on usage","review":"In \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves,\\" Lynne Truss does what a writer of a book on \\"correct\\" usage should never do--she commits the very errors she rails against. A book like this should always be copyedited and proofread to the highest degree, and here the publishers have failed. As the \\"New Yorker\\" says, \\"About half the semicolons in the...book are either unnecessary or ungrammatical, and the comma is deployed as the mood strikes.\\" Beyond this, incorrect statements of fact are made. To top it off, a new edition wasn't prepared for the American market, which seems completely bizarre to me given the many differences between American and British styles of punctuation.People who are genuinely interested in English usage can do so much better than this book. It is a shame that it has done so well when greater works have remained relatively unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book on the advice of a co-worker thinking it would be a reference book for writers; I was surprised to find it to be more a personal story with writing references buried within.The author Lynne Truss, a British woman, writes well but injects an ever so slight hint of aristocracy and snobbishness toward the masses. In one particular story, she relates receiving a pen pal letter from an 8th grade girl from Detroit. The girl's writing was juvenile and poor and Ms. Truss replied in a condescending manner to put the girl in her proper place (grammatically). Ms. Truss states she feels bad about doing so, but reading between the lines, one senses a triumphant pleasure in telling that American girl how she borders on illiteracy.If you think this book will be a ready desk reference and aid you while writing, think again and look elsewhere. If however, you want an easy read with personal anecdotes of one woman's obsession with punctuation, this book may be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Why don't you just tell me...\\"","review":"This book was recommended to me for my bad grammar, but it didn't do much to help. My problem with this book is that after you read it, you feel like a third-grader. I'd prefer less opinion and more instruction ,but that's not the case in this book. The author wants you to know her opinion but offers little instruction. If you want to read a rant on grammar then this is the book for you, but if you want a black-and-white approach with examples ( instead of someone repeatedly telling you how easy it all is)don't even think about using this book as a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Understanding for Any Age","review":"This is an excellent guide for an easy to understand compensation of punctuation marks. The author uses humorous anecdotes to reiterate the lessons and provides examples of how the meaning of sentences changes by a simple misplaced comma or quotation mark. This book is a must-read for everyone, of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Punctuation Refresher","review":"Eats, Shoots & Leaves does a great job of illustrating how bad punctuation can change the meaning of what we write and read. Ms. Truss goes into great detail laying out the basic rules of punctuation and give examples of how punctuation is used incorrectly in everyday life. As part of my job as an Army Officer, I spend countless hours correcting memos and papers. I highlighted several sections of this book that I will share with my subordinates and peers, in an attempt to improve their writing skills. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the author came off as pretentious. Once I got past past the tone, I found this an enjoyable book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their punctuation skills and refreshing what they learned (or didn't learn) in grammar school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just so great","review":"I love this book.

Kudos to this book for demonstrating that fact. But what a shame that the book has so little bearing on the way we use English in America - and has grammatical errors as well. Read this only for entertainment, but use authoritative sources if you intend to write or speak as Americans do."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Better Approach","review":"Zero tolerance? Indeed! Haggling and argufying minor point after minor point displays zero tolerance? This approach is no better than the pre burger-chain disputes over table manners.The Athenian Greeks used no punctuation.

They aren't hard to find. To list them would take several tedious pages. I think America likes this book because it wants to believe that \\"educated\\" Americans are horrified by the sloppy emails,etc. that everybody sends now. \\"These young people and their rap music and what not, they are destroying our culture.\\" American culture is always destroying itself; that's just what it does.

Hell, it could have been the teacher. I don't know. All I know is that like the first spotlight reviewer I found Ms. Truss's attempts at humor (humour) shrill, contrived, and bloody irritating. At the same time I learned a couple of things about commas I didn't know before, had a few other things verified, and enjoyed a few of her examples meant to show how important punctuation is to communication. So there. I look forward to her next \\"hilarious\\" book on those little circles teenage girls use to dot their i's. (Wouldn't you know...I haven't a clue how to use my comma in i's.

I had to tie my hand behind my back to keep from transposing them with a pencil. Why didn't the publisher also produce a book for American readers? I understand the book has sold well, so it couldn't have been for monetary reasons.Maybe it's sort of a snobby thing like Alex Trebek's penchant for misplaced quote marks in the Jeopardy answers. People used to write to him about it; he made it very clear to his audience that he wasn't changing them. Apparently, people have given up because he doesn't mention it anymore.For a superb critique of this book, read the one that appeared in the New Yorker.

She insults every facet of the very audience that is asking her for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to light a candle than curse the darkness","review":"As the old saying goes, it's better to light a candle than curse the darkness. A little cursing is actually OK, but all Lynne Truss does is sit on the ground and cuss, and she never does light any candles. This book is just endless complaining; there is hardly any actual guidance on punctuation. Moreover, even the American edition takes no notice of American usage, except to mention its existence in passing. Truss's book deals exclusively with the British rules, which are rather different from ours, so the book is worthless for Americans. Finally, she had the extremely poor taste to state that the worst thing (for her, apparently) about September 11 was the misuse of the word \\"enormity\\" in the media. (Apart from the moral horror of such a statement, the media did in fact use the word correctly in that context, for once.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynne Truss is my hero!","review":"It makes me so happy that someone else gets as irritated about incorrect punctuation as I do.

What a joke!All this is nothing more than a collection of the author's rants and ravings about poor punctuation.She loads the book and the calendar with examples of right and wrong punctuation or sometimes just the wrong punctuation but fails to tell the reader what makes it wrong or how to fix it. It is totally worthless (except maybe as kindling).Also, the author goes on, and on, and on ranting about poor grammar. I got the point at about page ten. The rest of the book was a little (note the extreme sarcasm) redundant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the buyer beware.","review":"Truss's book is a disappointment for Americans who love the subtleties of grammar, punctuation, and good editing. Her inconsistent picking and choosing of the rules makes no sense. A warning for students: do not buy this book as a guide, and don't follow its examples when writing your papers unless you wish to see a sea of red markings along the margins. You'd be better off with Strunk & White or the unfailing Chicago Manual of Style. In all fairness to the author, this book reflects British, not U.S., grammar."},{"rating":"1","title":"One is born every minute. . .","review":"I just returned from a bookstore where I happened to see this piece of drivel prominently displayed. The punctuation errors on the front cover, alone, should raise significant warning flags to those who are interested in the topic.

And I read a couple of books a month (and have written a variety of materials over the past three decades and develop an eye twitch at the sight of misplaced commas and such). Ms. Truss' main problem is not that she writes in a more convoluted style than Shakespeare, nor is it that she is a stereotypically wordy Limey. It's that it takes her so long to get to a point (and her points are frequently in conflict with the American language so as to render them dangerous) that -- well -- let's put it this way: The entire book is 204 pages long. The introduction ends on page 34! The fact is, I have yet to discover a point to this book. Lovers of punctuation are better off reading the Chicago Manual of Style."},{"rating":"2","title":"What...I am learning??!!!","review":"I have never enjoyed reading a book about punctuation before. Lynne's approach will make understanding and learning about correct usages much easier. This should be required reading for High School students and then again in College. It has made me a far better writer. She even clears up some of the issues between punctuation in the US and in Europe. Who knew there was a difference?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorothy Parker She Ain't, Er, ISN'T","review":"A ninth-grade English schoolmarm might slap her plaid-clad knee and cackle with glee at this book's contents but the rest of us will probably have had enough of Ms. Truss' one-joke inside humor by the bottom of page seven. If you suffer through her lessons in punctuation, you can, if you're so inclined, learn a few things. (I guess.) Goodness knows modern America is none too literate and Lynne Truss' effort at raising the national consciousness about the proper use of the comma helps.Would possibly have been better without the attempts at mirth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every school should have this","review":"It's rather amazing that a book on punctuation can be written so extensively and at the same time, provide much comic relief. Through this book, you'll realize that despite having been well-schooled, there are so many punctuation mistakes that we commit without even realizing the gravity of the errors. More often than not, the incorrect placement or omission of these nitty gritty symbols can lead to miscommunication and the result is often diasastrous and comical.Lynne Truss presents the different punctuation marks in different chapters which include illustrations of wrong usage, explanations of the history and evolution of the punctuations and of course, the correct usage. The coverage is rather comprehensive, if not all encompassing.I encourage anyone to give it a read. All schools should stock a few of these and teachers can use the book as an instructional guide without being being a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle reader is unfriendly with this book","review":"The book could be entertaining and educational in a regular paper printed format.

In fact, I was even tempted to pay full retail based on the subject and reviews. I didn't like it, nor did I pay full retail. I found it confusing and tiresome. I love to read \\"Elements of Style\\" (Wm. Strunk)and \\"Chicago Manual of Style\\" and similar books just for fun. \\"Elements of Style\\" may have been what I was hoping for, hence the disappointment.

Truss invokes an abundance of wry English humor throughout the book, which is, by the way, written in a quasi-novel form.One annoying tidbit that Truss incessantly referenced was the movie title that grated on her nerves to no end: Two Weeks Notice. Evidently, the improper punctuation of the movie's title was just as dreadfully painful as the movie itself.Overall, the book proves to be a quick, fun, and educational read -- although perhaps not as all-encompassing as I might have hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reference tool","review":"Writer/author makes it plain and easy to follow along with the examples offered in the book. Definitely a good reference tool for writers/literates."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Subject Poorly Covered","review":"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves by Lynne Truss is often longer than necessary, occasionally insightful, and usually snarky. Although I hoped for a useful and entertaining grammar guide, I found instead two hundred pages of complaints about modern usage peppered with references to grammarians with whom the author would like to sleep. I was able to trudge through the book in its entirety only due to its brevity and simplistic style.

It would be flattery to say that it is merely tedious. It is repetitive (one or two weak examples come up again and again) and is poorly edited (many paragraphs contain several unrelated ideas).This book is no substitute for learning how to write well. Indeed, although the author may know her punctuation (or at least she knows what she likes) the book is unreadable. The following sentence is an exemplar of what passes for prose in this book: \\"To me a subordinate clause will for ever (sic) be (since I heard the actor Martin Jarvis describe it thus) one of Santa's little helpers.\\" Eh?This is the sort of book that someone pretentious is likely to give you as a gift.

I bought this book based on a recommendation of a relative. But not even halfway through the book, I find her argument for correct usage of punctuation quite tedious and repetitive; her passion and intensity for the subject, approaching freakishness. Maybe that's her humor. I don't know. All I know is that it was funny for about 10 pages... then she totally lost me. I have better use of my time reading something else a bit more compelling, and actually funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - but I think Grammar Gremlins is better","review":"Today, as I'm writing this review, this book is ranked number 743 on Amazon. This is very disappointing to me. Not because this book is bad, but because another is so much better.Don't get me wrong. I really like Eats, Shoots & Leaves and think most of the extremely critical reviews are just goofy. However, I absolutely LOVE another book called Grammar Gremlins written by Don Ferguson. It's both fun and memorable, but, alas, it is ranked number 770,669 today. Does this mean I'm wrong and that Grammar Gremlins is a \\"bad\\" book? Here's a thought: Buy it and then contact me if you disagree. I've recommended Grammar Gremlins to people in my training classes for years and the feedback, with rare exceptions, has been wonderful.I guess I would buy both of the books, but I would uses Grammar Gremlins more as a reference instead of a \\"once read\\".These are my thoughts and I hope they help you make a decision.Tom Carpenter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Permission to Love","review":"Truss warns readers that it is reviews just like these that lead to the proliferatioin of mispunctuation.This book is an enjoyable read for anyone who has ever been confused over just where to place a comma, or the proper use of the semicolon. Truss offers up interesting tales of punctuation history with a sense of glee that is almost catching.Grammar snobs may turn their noses up at this Bestseller, but for the generally confused masses, it at least sparks the debate, which is what I suspect Ms Truss wants more than anything - to see puncuatioin live on indefinitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eats, Shoots(((,))) & Leaves","review":"Everyone who hopes to write text in the English language needs to read this book.

After reading this, http://www.janmag.com/nonfiction/eatsshoots.html, I'm not sure I want to spend my money on it. I'm one of those people who can't not see spelling, punctuation and grammar mistakes, but I don't think referring to a 14-year-old girl as a \\"vapid mousey moron\\" (and shouldn't there be a comma in there?) is the way to get people to see the light.

The people who really need help aren't going to go to someone who gets off on insulting children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynn Truss should be on the Queen's Honours list!!!!","review":"Lynn Truss should be awarded on the Queen's Honours List for her services to language. After all, the common perception that punctuation is not that crucial to the art of the language is terrifying. After all, a misplaced comma, semi-colon, exclamation point, and period can wreck havoc in the perceptions of those who think that there is nothing wrong. Truss has it right that the definition of a panda is that he eats shoots and leaves and how the comma is purposely misplaced to make a point. A panda doesn't eat, shoot, and leave in actions. He eats shoots (maybe bamboo shoots) and tree leaves possibly. For those of us who teach language arts, I admire Truss' ability to reach out and educate the readers with a sense of humor. Punctuation is never really taught to the extent that it should be in our schools. Two Weeks Notice is missing an apostrophe over the \\"s\\" in weeks and we see the author in the back cover of the book trying to put it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I was the only one","review":"I thought I was the only one who routinely called companies when their outdoor signs used the wrong punctuation, or were misspelled, or, the horror, used an apostrophe to denote posession, when they really only needed a word pluralized. Lynne's book is fantastic and a great read for those who are usually pretty good with grammar, but sometimes need a refresher. It's also fantastic for those of us who need an ego check that we're on the right path for proper grammar skills.Her follow-on, \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves: Why, Commas Really DO Make a Difference\\" for kids is a great primer for school-age kids with great illustrations. I highly recommend both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"meaning of enormity","review":"I apologize that I have not read the book, although it does sound interesting.

Never have the rules of usage and their corresponding examples seemed so obvious. Credit for that triumph goes to Ms. Truss, who has given considerable thought to the pithy categorizations and relevant examples that comprise the backbone of her work.Two wonderful features of the book are:> Examples of bad punctuation pulled from popular culture, the best example being (ahem) an amazon reader review.> Passages repeated verbatim that imply a 180-degree different meaning the second time around simply by dint of using different punctuation. Magical stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny book","review":"Very funny book. Never thought that grammar would be enjoyable but in this case it is.

Impossible!","review":"Well, no, it ain't all that enlightening when it comes to teaching the rules of punctuation--you knows 'em by now or you doesn't--but it is pretty funny--hilarous, in spots--in Truss's rants about this and that example of iggerance or stoopidity in our pop culture. And she is to be commended for refraining from shooting fish in a barrel: there's not a single reference to the lapidary prose issuing daily from the mouths of POTUS.It seems impertinent to play Gotcha! with this paean to precision, but there persists, even in the 15th printing of Gotham's American edition, a pretty obvious error on page 124. Evelyn Waugh certainly knew that attach��s work not in legislations, but in legations.

It's a small book and it took me forever to read. This subject matter is not for everyone. I learned some things about using punctuation but this book could have been a magazine article instead.

There are technical writers and then there are those of us who rely on our editors.

Plus, it has stickers in it that my two year old really liked.It's a great book, and helped me remember some basics without rolling my eyes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and helpful, but...","review":"I found this book hilarious. Maybe it was just because I was so happy to finally have a nerdy friend I could joke around with about grammar and punctuation.

Or, maybe, this book really is hilarious.I think it's possible.\\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is a fun read. It goes on for a chapter or two too long, I disagree with its stance on the Oxford (or serial) comma and on the semi-colon, and some of her anecdotes I'd read elsewhere first, but overall this book is about as entertaining as a book on this subject can get.It's the perefect sort of book for people who really need help with punctuation but who would probably never read a grammar book.I would recommend it to almost anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save money.

After I read House On Mango Street, I thought that surely there wasn't a book written worse than that. I stand corrected. Lynn Truss (the author) is obsessive and needs a cat or something. She's very repetetive in writing the book. She constantly repeats what she has previously said because THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH TO WRITE ABOUT A COMMA!!!! God help me. Unless you are required to read this book, as I was for AP English, I highly recommend you do not read this book. It is quite possible you will literally be bored to tears. Save your money. Save your time. Read Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste. Many books on the market that are much better.","review":"My headline says it all. Another author riding their 15 minutes.

It is a wild ride downhill from there.\\" The rest of Menand's article proceeds to tear Lynee Truss a new one, pointing out dozens of unforgivable grammar mistakes. To top it all off, Gotham Books chose not to make any changes to the American edition of this British book. We all know that British English is a horse of a different colour and follows slightly different \\"rules\\". It sure takes guts for a book like this to advocate the intolerance of grammar gaffes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, I'm sorry to say","review":"This book had some entertainment value, but it just wasn't that good. I had heard so many good things about the book that I was looking forward to reading it. However, this appears to be a case of everyone being afraid to admit they didn't like it - because it's supposed to be a bit intellectual. Well, call me ignorant (you wouldn't be the first), but it gets old quick. If you want something entertaining in this genre, try a Bill Bryson book.And a note to the author - it's Two Weeks Notice (not Two Week's Notice) because Two Weeks is describing Notice, not a possessive. It's Sandra's Two Weeks Notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Be Clogging the Used Book Stalls in a Matter of Weeks.","review":"Yes, the title is incorrectly punctuated. I wouldn't make a big deal of it except for the fact that this is precisely the sort of thing this book makes a big deal of, page after page.This might have made a nice little article in something like _Harper's_ or the British equivalent, but a book-length treatment of this subject is a bit tiresome.Astonishingly, Truss seems to have no idea where the possessive \\" 's \\" comes from, citing only the fallacious \\"his\\" theory and then dropping the subject altogether. The \\" 's \\" comes from the vanished genitive case, Toots.Those who defend the book on the grounds that the humor is so quintessentially British that it defies American grasp are talking nonsense. It's not even the sort of pedantic, nerdy humor that would be funny only to librarians who can't get laid, since I AM such a librarian.I laughed much more at Alex Ainley's review below (q.v. sub) than anything in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read Whether You Care About Punctuation or Not","review":"This is a wonderful book. If you are a stickler for punctuation, and want a hilarious refresher course, this is the book for you. Among other topics, Truss covers commas, dashes, and little used punctuation marks. Her examples are funny and prove that punctuation does matter. If you are a stickler for punctuation, this is a must-read. If you are not a punctuation fanatic, you will still get a few laughs and learn something along the way- not a bad deal for a book on punctuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapeutic","review":"I found this calming and therapeutic. I've suffered semi-colon and \\"and\\" anxiety for years; perhaps to some extent due to translocations within the English-speaking world. My library contains Fowler's \\"English Usage\\", Strunk and White, the American Psychological Association Style Manual, the Chicago Manual of Style, and probably more besides if I ever get around to organizing it.The insidious trouble from reading the others is that they love to impose what that guy who was married to Margaret Mead called the \\"double-bind.\\" (Bates, I think.) They tell you that they're not prescriptive, and that it's alright to do your own thing, but leave you feeling guilty about it if you do. I completely became unable to write \\"however\\" after reading Fowler, and it's a terribly useful word. Truss is firm and opinionated but somehow liberating. This is the first time in my life I've written a page containing four sets of quotation marks without worrying and I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I have no friends","review":"Let me start by saying that I do not blame Ms. Truss or her book for my lack of friends. However, I must warn anyone interested in this book: take a long hard look at what you've become. Is it really worth sacrificing meaningful relationships with real people just be right? If your answer is, \\"yes\\", than this book is right up your irreparably pedantic alley. While the differences between American ad British usage is never really addressed nor explained, it is still a deligtful account of one stickler's struggle through a world that prefers speedy convenience to grammatical beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eats, Shoots & Leaves","review":"This book is in fabulous condition, and the service was very prompt, especially since this was ordered during the rush of the Christmas season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is not for everyone, but if you're a stickler for using the right words with the right punctuation, then this is for you!

No small, large print book will do the trick. However, if you want to brush up on a few things and smooth some rough edges, this book helps. The author is quite energetic and over-zealous about punctation (commas, colons, etc.) and its proper use; don't let that scare you off. It is filled with several quick lessons and facts that bring the whole puntuation picture together, piece by piece. It is a quick read and a fun one too. It is not the Bible of english grammar or punctuation, but what is? (i.e. everyone is in disagreement, everywhere)If you want to quickly brush-up and move on, read it.

It's not a definitive guide to punctuation by any means, but it it aims to be a readble, fairly thorough romp through the little squiggles that make language intelligible.It's just such a shame that it had to be written by Lynn Truss, whose voice throughout is spiked with a false sense of bon homie and a very real smarminess. I heard her on the radio recently and she ain't funny in person at all, so why try in print?And another thing, she's pictured posing on the back flap about to add an apostrophe to an advertisement for the film 'Two Weeks Notice'. Why didn't she?

Easy to use as a reference. Thumbs (and fingers) up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shaper Book","review":"A shaper is generally considered a commercial tool so it is nice to find informative instruction that a small shop owner can use. The book covers rudimentary functions of the shaper and can give one confidence to dust it off and put it to work. I especially appreciated the instructions and illustration for the shop-made fence and dust collection box used when cutting raised panels on the shaper. If you have a shaper sitting in the corner, put it to work and you will be pleased with the benefits over a router table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but disappointing overall","review":"I absolutely adored the description of the author's near-death experience.

Sure, maybe one can have an out-of-body experience in a dream, but that is a far different experience than the one she had when she \\"died,\\" when she went to a supreme heavenly place and felt total joy and bliss.

Most studies have shown that 50-100mg of standardized pygeum extract daily is the effective dose, however since this is just straight bark, it's difficult to know how much of the active components you are getting.Basically, I'm going to stop taking this preparation, and find something that is a standardized extract and see if I get the same side effects.

The only song I heard from Rose Royce was 'Car Wash\\" back in the mid-'70s. This album offers some upbeat R&B, plus some slow jams that sound really great. The sound quality of this album is OK, but it's from the late '80s, so it has a bit of a hard edge to it compared to the CD recordings of today. This is due to the fact that the record companies were using analog masters on CDs that were released back then. The bass isn't as smooth sounding as an LP has, and the high end tends to be a bit on the bright side. Even with this, it's still a great album, and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasten your seat belts!","review":"This is a great tale of intrigue, surprisingly accurate in reporting the intrigue surrounding the clash of law, business and government. It may take you a little while to get into the flow, but keep at it, as the endgame is the best part.From the back cover: In July 1979 the new Thatcher government announced its plan to sell off British Airways as part of its extensive programme of privatisation. The airline's transformation from grossly inefficient nationalised industry to successful private sector competitor was unprecedented. But behind the scenes a clandestine trans-Atlantic legal battle - triggered by the Laker collapse - kept the proposed sale close to the brink of disaster.Written by a former Financial Times journalist who monitored the story from the first, this is the inside acocunt of how the politicians and businessmen, lawyers and bankers turned BA's story into the stuff of a thriller novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comprehensive Information for Women","review":"This is a great book that gives an overview of the health benefits of being a vegetarian.

The work table isn't as convenient as I hoped it would be since it is so small and not very sturdy. In fact installing the stand that the wooden board rests on makes using and moving your Weber more cumbersome and the lid doesn't fit as nicely as before. I will say that the cutting board is nice, and to be able to use it inside in the kitchen and transport it to the grilling station is nice however any old cutting board would work.

There needs to be more attention to what mountain bikers really like . . . carving single track trail with varied surface over interesting terrain (i.e. some rough, some rocky, some steep, some smooth and some easy), views, cool destinations and more loop rides.

So this is why I am so sick of relatives of talented singers coming out with there own albums, they simply arent even close to being worthy of their sibling or father or whatever *cough Ashlee Simpson cough* so case in point.

Her album is trash, pure garbage... the only reason this asinine pile of feces was released was because she is the idiot offspring of the once great Ozzy Osbourne. Keep thinking this lame-a** pop record is punk rock kids, I'm sure many of you will run home to the suburbs from the local strip mall so that you can add this vile creation to your CD collection that includes music from other media-w**** a**clowns like; Green Day, Maroon 5, Britney Spears, Simple Plan, Good Harlot, My Chemical Romance, Yellowcard, Coldplay, Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, and Bowling for Poop.

I guess it helps when you have a famous father, but this not Nancy Sinatra. It's obvious that Kelly Osbourne worked hard on this record, but as they say, hard work doesnt mean much without talent behind it. I found this record to be tragically awful. The only clever thing about this album is the title. If only Kelly had decided to \\"Shut Up\\" before the album was made. I think I would rather fall on a grenade than have to hear another album by Kelly Osbourne. Buy her Dad's records instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a zero if I could","review":"First thing's first: Kelly Osbourne can't sing. She was merely given this opportunity becuase she is on TV, that's it. If she did write all of the songs on this album, she makes Avril Lavigne look like Lennon/McCartney (forgive me for mentioning the Beatles in the same paragraph as Avril Lavigne and Kelly Osbourne). This record is just someone cashing in the The Osbournes sudden fame, which is a shame since Ozzy has been making incredible music for 30 years. Terrible record, don't buy it.

This girl can not sing, I wish she would spend some of her family's money on singing lessons.

I hope they realize theyre floating on dead wood & do something better with their time. If you don't know this already, im gonna tell it to you now. The only reason Kelly Osbourne got a record out is b/c who her father is. Now lets say youre a big time record exec & someone gives you a demo of a really bad CD but the lead singer is the daughter of a musical mastermind. Would you sit on it or take it up & hope that all these fans of the MTV show come running out to the store to buy a CD like this just so they can go tell their friends they got this CD.

Kelly Osbourne sounds bad on many of the songs and her voice is just hidden among the heavy layers of rock guitars that dominate this album. Shut Up is the only good track here. The rest of the album is a sloppy mess. And Ric Wake, known for producing my favorite Mariah Carey song(from '90), Someday, Taylor Dayne's hits and Jennifer Lopez, produced this album? This is his worst stuff here! They tried to model this album mostly after her more famous father Ozzy's rock and it backfired. Osbourne was smart to get Linda Perry to produce her second one, and the results are fabulous. Until then, just skip this first one from Kelly. This flopped badly in sales, and I'm not surprised that Epic dropped her from their label."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHUT UP already!","review":"Kelly Osbourne cannot sing. I gave her a 2nd star because, unlike Avril Lavigne, she truly does not care what others think about her. However, her voice, I find screeching, and I also find it annoying that she thinks she is not pop however she is. I do think that Kelly would have more potential if she took a second to hear what she was doing instead of just shoving out this piece of garbage. Maybe a few lessons, or maybe she just needs tuning up. Whatever she needs, it's clear that she doesn't have it in her debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth listening...","review":"I'm amazed about the reviews this album has so far received. A quick review of a dozen or so reviews, puts Ms Osbourne in context with The Donnas, Hole, Veruca Salt, Garbage, and Letters to Cleo. I wonder if people are so deafened by Kelly's noise that by the time they come to the only slow song on the CD, they don't realize that Ms Osbourne cannot sing at all. Don't get me wrong, I love The Osbournes, it's cult. And if Kelly wants to become a musician, that's fine, but it'll take her at least two or three more albums and a ton of singing lessons until she can produce anything worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut Up, Give Up, Grow Up. .

Her voice is rather weak, her songs are boring and generic, her lyrics are childish and silly sounding, and her image is utterly tragic.

This is a testament to the awful and pathetic state the music industry is in today. You want to know who's to blame for making music so horrible these days? MTV and American radio.

I wonder if Kelly's relation to Ozzy and The Osbournes TV show did more to hurt her music career than help it... seems like a lot of people just like to bash Kelly because of that stuff. The Shut Up album is pop-punk with total Kelly attitude. The sound reminds me of the band Hole. Kelly's voice is strong within her range, and she really shines on the song \\"More Than Life Itself,\\" which is my favorite track. If you like good 'ol rockin fun pop punk rock, this is a great CD in that genre.

The title song, \\"Shut Up!\\" is a catchy tune and I find myself singing the song in my head hours later.The album in a whole is good and should not be taken too seriously.

There is no narrative drive to the story....things happen with no urgency or sense of importance.Cornwell persists with her new narrative style. It is so irritating. Again she tells you everything that goes on, how the characters are thinking and feeling, but with no room for the reader to make up their own minds about the characters. It is patronising and rather lazy, hence this IS a very easy read. You don't have to think about any of it. A disappointment.

Trace would have had a good chance as the storyline was pretty good however, it just seemed like there was way to much going on... Benton in Aspen, Kay in Richmond and Lucy in Florida. It also confused me at one point as to how Lucy working in LA had anything to do with her house in Florida? LA was brought up a few times and yet it had nothing to do with anything.

The synopses convinced me to give her one more chance to bring back her vibrant, interesting characters from her earlier books. Well, they are not present in \\"Trace\\". There is no need to make prospective readers go through a wordy review. This book is boring and no better than her last several attempts to entertain her loyal readers.

This time, a mere trace of evidence, a trace so small, most would never find it, is the key to solving the mystery killer of a young girl. Politics, red tape, and uncooperative assistants make finding this trace nearly impossible. The characters are well-developed and intriguing. Sadly, the mystery involved in solving the crime is not very challenging to the reader, and leaves some readers feeling dissatisfied. Because of this, I don't plan to give the other Scarpetta mysteries a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in the present tense","review":"Why, oh why did Patricia Cornwell write this book in the present tense?

The third-person, present-tense narrative is annoying and tedious, and the characters have become banal and boring. There isn't a single character in the story that elicits even the tiniest amount of interest, sympathy or appreciation. The writing and dialogue (and constant repetition of certain ideas and phrases) breeds yawns instead of page-turning. I wish it weren't so, but this will be the last time I attempt to read a Cornwell: there are far too many fresh, invigorating authors and characters out there as competition. Scarpetta and company have missed the mark with no indication of a future regeneration. Their time is past. RIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money and time","review":"Full of loose ends, flat characters, bad plotting, absolutely unsatisfying. I've rarely read anything that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cornwell Quality","review":"I've been a devoted reader of the Scarpetta novels, but this is not Cornwell quality. The plot is jumpy and poorly developed. It reads like a poorly scripted soap opera. The characters are flat and the real questions are unanswered. What is up with Joel Marcus and Fielding? Please Patricia tap your true talent and bring back your the thrilling Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kay Scarpetta needs to retire!","review":"Ive been a loyal fan since Postmortem, but Kay Scapetta needs to hang up her surgical gown, brush the chip on her shoulder and call it a day. It is incredibly disappointing to see this award winning series bottom out so pathetically. The inconsistancies are becoming more and more apparent. (It seems Scarpetta only ages 1 year for every 5 of Lucy's!) We the loyal readers need to be given a little more credit. But alas, Im sure if another Scarpetta is published I'll be there buying it. One can always hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many changes","review":"I have eagerly always awaited Scarpetta's new adventures. However I am severly disappointed in this latest book. First of all it feels like someone else is writing this book. The style is different and now the third person in just weird.Also the plot was soo weak. It took 95% of the book to take us nowhere and then a very hurried explanation at the end. The story was weak and the characthers so one dimensional (mainly Lucy)I hope she finds her way of writing again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too bad....","review":"It seems that Ms Cornwell needs to do one of two things: 1) see a shrink herself to delve into what drives her to heap such wrath upon the head of her lead character, or 2) just give up what was once an exceptionally well-written series and find something else to do.Bad doesn't describe this book. Sad? Mad? Definately depressing and unreadable. What a pity that Ms. Cornwell has such a wonderful opportunity to portray strong, mentally and physically healthy women characters and instead chooses to portray them as weak willed, maudlin individuals totally incapable of finding strength in their own intellect and sense of self. I won't even go into the story line, which is the worst of cheap camp, immature and silly for a writer who once showed such promise. Overall, a disappointing, and ultimately final, immersement on my part into the world of Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Boring, Without Substance","review":"Having vowed to never buy another Scarpetta novel after the pitiful offering that was Trace, I capitulated after reading rather good reviews - note to self: NEVER believe the reviews! At the end of this novel I was left wondering what on earth the whole thing had even been about! Plots meandered off into nothing (why on earth were we told about Marcus'anxieties if it wasn't being persued later??), and once again we were \\"treated\\" to Marino's obnoxious utterings, for no purpose other than to show us that he's still a pig. Benton made some token appearances, usually to tell Scarpetta he couldn't talk to her, and Rudi, Lucy's \\"offsider\\", prowled around the novel without any useful purpose at all. My advice? Buy the Kathy Reichs novel instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you think the story's going somewhere...","review":"...the book ends. That's my main objection to Trace. Cornwell sets up multiple plot threads to wind together at the end of the book, but despite all the obvious foreshadowing, it's not clear that many of them actually DO come together, except in a very contrived way.However, the forensics stuff and some character development can be interesting. Marino, particularly, exposes more of himself (emotionally and otherwise). I kept hoping that all the interweaving plot threads would end up making sense plot-wise and character-wise at the end. Instead, the end just happens, quite abruptly, as if Cornwell's publisher were enforcing a page limit. The worst thing is that some plot points are introduced fairly late in the book only to be dropped entirely, and I'm not sure whether they were intended as red herrings or if readers were supposed to reach some kind of conclusion on their own. I'd have rated it 3 stars if the ending had been even remotely satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"another letdown","review":"why do we need to know that Dr. Marcus has a garbage man phobia? pointless to this pathetic mystery. At first, I felt we were back on the right track - Kay Scarpetta seemed ready to rock. However, it quickly veers off - spending way too much time remodeling Marino, reminding us that Lucy is still nutty, rich, and unhappy - and finally, that the old, impressive, Benton isn't coming back. why keep reading Cornwell? I guess I am still pining for the wonderful old Scarpetta novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Poorly Done","review":"One can only assume that Patricia Cornwell is tired of these characters, so she should not write about them again. Thankfully, after the fiasco of BlowFly, I did not buy this book, but borrowed from the library, as I did expect it to be horrible. Wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"A very disappointing book.Having read all the previous Scarpetta novels with the exception of Blow Fly, I was expecting a lot more. This felt very much like a quickly written, advance-money driven novel. If you have not read ALL of the Scarpetta novels, read them first, they are far more satisfying than this shallow effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"More aptly titled \\"Not a Trace\\"","review":"Unlike many reviews, I really enjoyed Blow Fly, as well as all of the other Kay Scarpetta books; however, this one was a drudgery to read. She got bogged down in the minutia of forensic details, which became very boring and cumbersome. The plot was very poorly developed as were the characters. How exciting in her last book to find out that Benton is still alive. I couldn't wait to get this book and have their relationship continue. They didn't even interact until the very last chapter!! Since this is the first of her Scarpetta series that I truly did not enjoy, I will give them another chance. I'd love to see her bring back \\"Le Loup Garou\\"--the werewolf. I thought he was a great and interesting villain. I just hope we can expect better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trace","review":"This is the last Scarpetta book I'll be reading. I loved the early books in the series, but the story lines are old and just boring. The arch-criminal going after the hero made a good story 15 years ago, but every other crime novel rolls out this tired theme along with all the TV crime shows, from all the CSI type dramas to and including The Mentalist and Criminal minds. Lets get real the last thing REAL criminals want is to be caught and getting involved with a law enforcement person is the furthest thing on their agenda. This book would be great on CDs abridged down to 2 or 3 disks.It is time for novelists and crime show write to come up with a new theme or just get back to the good old Jack Webb story line of there's a crime, investigate, catch the criminal. For these writers it seems that there are \\"no new ideas under the sun.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Desert With Only Hot Tap Water To Drink!","review":"One word aptly describes \\"Trace\\". FORGETTABLE.!Trace lost its way painfully early, it was saturated with the personal issues and drama of Kay Scarpetta, her niece Lucy and detective Marino. What happened to the case the book was supposed to be based on? Well, it seemed to be highlighted as an afterthought intermittently throughout the book. A waste of precious trees especially with this book being over 500 pages. What happened Patricia Cornwell?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Written","review":"I've read the earlier Kay Scarpetta books, and found them to be reasonably entertaining. \\"Trace\\", on the other hand, is just awful. As I slogged through the story I couldn't help but think of all the unpublished writers out there who can't get a foot in the door, yet this garbage is published and treated as if it's got merit. Did Cornwell suffer a brain trauma somewhere along the way? Did she bother to read what she had written and see just how ridiculous it sounds? In earlier books, the characters were somewhat believable, but in \\"Trace\\" they all seem two-dimensional. I'm scratching Cornwell off my list of worthwhile authors. Save your time and money. This one isn't worth either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I typically listen to the Kay Scarpetta series in audio form during my daily commute. I found myself yelling a the CD to 'move it along'. Ms Cornwell goes on and on and on in this book about pointless conversations and meaningless details. I have no idea why she has made all the characters mad at each other. I find it distracting from the story. I probably won't be back for the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a total waste of time","review":"1. I'm not an \\"expert\\" on this author (I've read one prior book by her). But from the recommendations of my friends, I decided to give this author one more try--> what a total mistake. Via the reviews on her prior books, I'm sure that she has written some good stuff. However, this book appears that it was written as an afterthought; something written to appease her publishers... which is a really sad thing to see.2. Bottomline, if you value your time--> skip this book and do something else more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Style","review":"Being an avid Kay Scarpetta fan I was looking forward to reading this most recent addition to the series, unfortunately I could only make it through the first 50 pages before I gave up reading it. The book is annoyingly written in the present tense in short choppy sentence making it very hard to follow. I hope the next one is better. Maybe it's time to end this series...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very excited to hear that Scarpetta would be back in Richmond in this novel. I was hoping this meant that the writing would be like the older books, but it wasn't. Blow Fly was the last book that I read, and I couldn't even finish it, it was so awful. Trace was good in the beginning, but the plot just fizzled out at the end. It was completely anticlimatic and left me wondering why I wasted my time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as previous books","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell books, but was disappointed by this one. It seemed as though there was alot of information left out and the ending was rushed. I didn't feel that the conclusion was reached as a logical progression of the story. It was interesting that very specific details of the new ME were revealed, then he was pretty much not mentioned for the rest of the book. Is there another book which explores his quirks?? Also, it was odd that the subject of Lucy being homosexual is never actually stated in the book, only \\"hinted\\" at. This book does not have the feel of previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y-a-w-n-n-n-n-n-n-n","review":"Much of this book is tedious. I used to rank Patricia Cornwell among my favorite authors, but the last few books have been slow and repetitive. This one is no exception, so tedious that the plot is nearly lost. It does get better in the second half, though. Cornwell uses an odd combination of present tense and third person omniscient. She frequently uses \\"and\\" to tie together otherwise separate sentences. I think the idea is to mimic stream of consciousness, but instead it just seems like poor grammar. The style is disconcerting and detracts from the plot. The plot itself is fairly preposterous - too many unlikely scenarios and connections. The two books before Trace were also both blah and painful to read (I didn't bother to finish either one). I wish she would pick up the action of her earlier style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trace is very boring","review":"First, this is the most disappointing of all the Patrica Cornwell books. In fact, it is the most disappointing book I have ever finished. I kept reading hoping that the ending was going to be somewhat exciting but the book ends with little thought provided by Cornwell. Certainly not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing rehash of previous themes","review":"There's political machinations to keep Dr Scarpetta down, there's a misbehaving Marino sleeping with enemy (another sociopathic woman with a dead child), there's an innocent dead child with all the usual tearing at heartstrings, this is just a rehash of previous novels. What happened to Patty? I understand if she wants to take all the money she's made and go do fun stuff, but please, don't try to fob off C- work on the public... if you want to write, Cornwell, do it right. Otherwise, let us find new voices whose hearts are totally into their work. I'm done, I've paid $27 once too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good read !","review":"I bought this book at the airport before going on holiday....and guess what... my flight was delayed. Thank heavens for a good book to get you thru the endless hours of waiting!I loved this book, as it is very gripping, and i could not wait to read on to see what would happen next. I was well written although i could imagine that more pages could have been written to make all the inter-relationships between charaters more clear. You must know some of the history to fully get the bond between all people.Needless to say i finished the book by the time i finally got to my destination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"My first and last Cornwell novel. No plot, no suspense, a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trace","review":"This is the 13th book in the Kay Scarpetta Mystery series and there have been 300 reviews posted on amazon.com that range from raves to rants. I've read almost all the books in this series, and found this one to be both well-written and interesting. In fact, after reading this one I read Blow Fly which also got a lot of negative reviews, and I thought that was good, too, except for a weak ending. The scenes set in the old morgue building Scarpetta once worked in are both griping and fascinating. This book moved along and kept my interest from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where they from and where they go?","review":"As the other reviewer wrote, we had a lot of start-LESS, end-LESS, reason-LESS and motive-LESS characters in this new novel. How did Benton and Kay make a good relationship again? Sure they could/would, but how Kay easily took her hurt off without a word. Benton? You are still a secured person hidding on Aspen? Lucy? Where to? What will be next? Maybe she can be Charlie and still be Charlie's Only Angel. Or she can be a actress has a role of next Charile's Angels Heroin. How about some supporting character like Dr. Marcus, is he still a Chief of VA? I think he ran away.Anyway, I'm still a Big Fan of MS. Cornwell. Plz! Back to VA and Write a good novel.ps. The picture of MS. Cornwell's on the back makes me think she worries about the book. For my opinion, every book with a sturbbon face has been bad include this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Worst Books I have ever read!","review":"Have never written a review before, but was so disappointed in this book, had to say something! Started and put down this book several times, but finally forced myself to finish it because i had enjoyed other Scarpetta books. This one had undeveloped characters, plot lines that were never explored, and all kinds of stuff happening in the background that was never explained. What was the deal with the new medical examiner's phobia of trash trucks? Why did Pogue keep talking to his mother? I was left with a very unfinished taste in my mouth.... Would not recommend this book to anyone. On the plus side, did not buy book, but got it from library. On the minus side, took me so long to read it that I ended up with overdue fees. If I could reach author, i'd tell her she should pay the fees!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Let Down","review":"I have practically been praying for a Scarpetta novel even half as good as the first several, but alas, this is not the one.

It was better than \\"Blow Fly\\", which I thought was one of the worst books I've read, but I am ever a hopeful Scarpetta fan. \\"Trace\\" was a good read, but as with the past few Scarpetta books, it finished up in such a rush, I kept thinking I must have missed something. I became a fan of Patricia Cornwell's when I first picked up \\"Post Mortem\\" from the library about 9 years ago, and have read all the Scarpetta novels. After reading \\"Trace\\", I am now re-reading \\"Post Mortem\\", and there is no comparison. \\"Post Mortem\\" is descriptive and in depth and makes me wish the new books by Patricia Cornwell would have the same great writing and story telling as her first few Scarpetta novels.

In \\"Trace\\", she left characters hanging, subplots unfulfilled and the ending was a \\"hurry up, finish, and let's get this book to market\\".

It is time Cornwell stops resting on her laurels and writes a book that resembles her earliest attempts and successes. There were no thrills or suspense in \\"Trace\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Going On?","review":"The last two Scarpetta novels have been truly disappointing. Trace left too many unanswered questions. What happened to Gilly's dad? What's up with Gilly's mom? What's up with Dr. Marcus? What's wrong with her former assistand M.E.? Why is Lucy self-destructing? I am hoping her next book will address all of these issues.

Kay Scarpetta is such a strong character and this title left me feeling like she lost some respect - from herself as well as me. Her niece, Lucy, has gone off the deep end. I don't care about Lucy. Scarpetta is why we read these books. Lucy has been instrumental in other novels, but this time, both she and Kay have become these emotional, confused women. What happened, Ms. Cornwell?!

The characters were strong, the plots exciting, and the writing was great. It was truly painful to try and get through this mess. I finally had to close the book when I got to the part where Scarpetta gave Marino a genital exam in his hotel room. I can't imagine what Ms. Cornwell was thinking as she abused these much-loved characters -- not to mention her fans. It's finally over for me. Kay Scarpetta is D.O.A. Onward now to Kinsey Millone, Harry Bosch, and Alex Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened P.C.?","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell mysteries and I have to say this one must have been written by a 'ghost writer'. As usual the plot began with it's usual suspense,but after the situations were set there was not much follow-through (at times none)!Many characters were created only to fade into the pages, like the new Chief and his fear of garbage trucks, what was its relevance to the case? What about Tina, did she play a part in anything? Even Marino's parts were scattered.What happened P.C. your heart really wasn't in this one.

I was very confused after I finished reading it. I thought I'd give Ms. Cornwall another chance after Blow Fly, but that's it. Get this book out of the library instead of spending your money. Just sloppy and poorly written. Also, why is she all of a sudden referring to Kay in third person? I liked it much better when she referred to Kay as in the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRACE should have a warning label.","review":"Patricia Cornwall is laughing at every single one of us that bought this book. She must be, and so must her publisher. Readers continue to make her mediocre books bestsellers based on the Cornwell name and what it once meant.She hasn't written a really good book since Body Farm. If we continue to buy this quality of book, why should she try to write a better one? I think Ms Cornwall's personal issues have destroyed that spark of talent that made her first few novels great. She obviously has come to hate her characters and so have I. There is not another really good book left in this author.From now on, for my forensic fix, I'll read Kathy Reichs and Beverly Connors."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOES NOWHERE!","review":"This is the last Patricia Cornwell book I will buy.

What was the sense if Benton and everyone involved knew she was lying? What the hell was Lucy hiding from Scarpetta after everything her and Lucy had been through in the past? I hate it when I read a book, and I am pissed off at the end that I wasted my time. Sorry Ms. Cornwell, but this is the last book that you will suck me into buying.

Marino gets involved with the mother of a victim (hmm.... deja vu?) Yet another jealous M.E. tries to set up Scarpetta. Is this sounding too familiar?Overall rating, an ok of 2 stars.

It seems as if Ms. Cornwell is not happy writing the series anymore. I feel as if that comes through in her writing. This book was not fun, fresh or scary like her other ones were. The last three books we not good in anyway. Blow Fly was such a disappointment and I thought this one would be better and it wasn't. Lucy, Benton, Marino and Kay used to make reading enjoyable. Now a person just reads the books to get finished with them, with nothing to take away from the books but unhappiness that a person wasted time reading it. I sincerely hope that Patricia Cornwell goes back to the formula that made her earlier books so well liked. The way she is doing it now, is the way to lose fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just bad for Cornwell - just bad","review":"I don't mean to sound like a broken record agreeing with everyone else, but this book is terrible. I felt no sense of suspense. I had no empathy for the characters. I kept reading it just out of curiosity to see if it was going anywhere - it wasn't. When you are 50 pages from the end of a mystery book and you can put it down and go to sleep, you know something is amiss. There are too many fragments of backstory that just don't matter and aren't well explored anyway, too little insight into the killer, it was just dumb. I know Cornwell can write, her earlier novels were excellent. This one stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's Worst Yet!","review":"I avoided reading reviews of Trace on Amazon until I finished. This dreary, disjointed, and near unreadable mystery seemed horrible, but I wanted to give the book a chance and avoid following the crowd to pile on. Unfortunately, Patricia Cornwell's slump (to put it mildly) has continued and it was an ordeal to even finish Trace. How could such a talented author with any pride put out such garbage? Trace is more of a compilation of idea notes than a real book. The interesting threads in Trace quickly die while we are subjected to more psychodrama and absurdity of what has become an extremely unappealing extended mystery family. Perhaps Cornwell's greatest sin is that she has become boring. The evildoer in this book has to be the wimpiest and most boring psychopath ever created in print. Could Cornwell be attempting to portray the \\"banality of evil?\\" Of course not! Trace is just something I would not recommend to even the most hard-core fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Trace is awful! We used to be such big fans but this is definitely our last time to read one of the Scarpetta series. The characters are mad all the time, loads of extraneous information and story lines that go nowhere. I'm surprised I could finish it, I just kept thinking it couldn't be that bad and waited and waited for it to get better. It doesn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful... simply awful","review":"Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful. I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment. But I give up. No more Kaye Scarpetta for me. This book cured me - for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Blow Fly, but then what isn't?","review":"From starting out as an author you couldn't wait to read, Patricia Cornwell is continuing her downward spiral. Yes, it was better than Blow Fly, but that book was so revolting - both in concept and in writing - that anything would be an improvement. This book started out interesting, but quickly disintegrated. What was the clincher was that Scarpetta all of a sudden remembered the suspect's name and everything about him...and professed to hardly remembering him at all. Hmmmm.....that kind of says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Rhode Island","review":"I was a true Scarpetta fan but this one was a dissapointment. The story line was like riding a roller coaster. It brought you up and let you down time and again. No more Kay for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Fan","review":"I was a HUGE Cornwell fan for years and recommended her books to EVERYONE. But I am so sad to see what is becoming of this series, and I'm tired of paying these prices only to be disappointed. First, what happened with Benton was downright cruel. In Cornwell's latest installment, Scarpetta and Marino seemed tired and washed out; the two made ME tired. And Lucy...what is with Lucy? I don't even like her character! The plots starts off on an interesting note, but it just went downhill from there. Marino wasn't so bad, I've always loved him, and the scene where the dead girl's crazy mother bites him and Scarpetta examines him was touching. and then FINALLY she and Benton get together, well, maybe, but not quite sure. Cornwell is far too talented for this, and I long for the days when I could not put the book down. I have not enjoyed her books since \\"The Last Precinct,\\" and, should I ever buy another book, I will not spend the kind of money I spent on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up on Patricia Cornwell","review":"I have read all of the Scarpetta series but Trace will be my last one. I was alternately bored and infuriated. I agree with other reviewers that too many questions were left up in the air. I never figured out why the killer killed Gilly - did I miss something? And what was the deal with the dog. Lots of questions unanswered. What really annoys me though is the total disfunction of each character. In Cornwell's world no one is ever happy. These characters now make you want to smack them and say \\"Quit whining and get a life!\\" Kay has become her own worst enemy as has Lucy and reading about their constant angst is just getting downright boring. They are their own worst enemies and I am beginning to think they deserve what they get.Don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trace","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews BEFORE I bought this book...alto, I probably would of bought it anyways...I have enjoyed \\"most\\" of Cornwell's books (earlier ones much better), this one was the worst!! I concur with all the reviews...what a waste of time and money....left me very disappointed. It seems like Cornwell gets more and more gruesome as the books go on...and so many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I think this will be my last Cornwell book for a long time...if I buy it will be a \\"used\\" paperback!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Retire Dr Scarpetta","review":"I have loved the Scarpetta novels for years. I ran to the bookstore to snatch the newest installment off the shelves and sat up reading way past what logic, employment, and grad school would allow. I'm not sure I will do that any longer.Trace lacks the energy of previous novels. The characters lack energy, the plot lacks energy, the dialogue lacks energy -- I'm beginning to think that Cornwell lacks energy. I agree with the previous reviewers that it seems that Cornwell no longer likes this character and it dragging this relationship past its limits. Perhaps it is in the interest of her fans..I know my personal feeling is that I don't want to see the Scarpetta novels end, but I'd rather she go out in a blaze of glory than the self-absorbed whimper Trace seems to be.If you're a Scarpetta fan, avoid this novel. If you haven't read Cornwell before, try some of her earlier work. I'd hate for one experience to turn you off her completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to your roots","review":"I have always enjoyed the Scarpetta books, but lately Ms. Cornwell seems to have forgotten what got her fame as an author. The last 2 books started all right, got slow and then sloppy and then she tried to tie everything up in a few paragraphs with no other explanations. What happened to Kay and Wesley's love, Lucy's brillance and Marino's \\"do it my way\\" attitude? What happened to the new ME and his panic-attacks and what happened to Jack Fielding? The Wolf-Man is still on the loose and yet there was no mention of that in this book. We have never had any real insight to Lucy's TLP or what Kay and Marino are really doing since leaving Richmond. Marino's losing weight and trying to get healthy, but, did he grieve over his son's death. Part of the fun of continuing stories is tying them together. This book almost completly forgets Blow Fly and begins over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have been a huge Kay Scarpetta/Patricia Cornwell fan from the beginning. However, this latest book fell flat. The reader never gets any answers to the one murder Scarpetta is supposed to solve, other than who did it and we basically knew that in the beginning. She threw strange plot lines in that not only didn't add to the story but were distracting and created questions that went unanswered. The book never even explained why the killer chose his victims - only why he was going after his \\"big target.\\" There was an entire chapter devoted to an encounter with Marino and the grieving mother that started to appear to provide the answer as to why the victim was chosen, but again nothing - it was just dropped. The ending was abrupt and left all the sub-plots unresolved. The ending almost seemed as if she got tired of writing and just stopped. Killer caught - book over. I really hope the future books will be like her originals. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo's mom","review":"Has Patricia Cornwell developed a drinking problem? Most of the story didn't even make sense. She left us hanging with questions about things we really shouldn't even care about in the first place. Like WHY was the director afraid of the garbage trucks? Why was Fielding losing muscle, developing rashes and hiding from Scarpetta after inviting her to dinner? What was Benton doing wasting time with Henri? She could have deleted all of the above and the story would have been no better or worse. All I can say is she ought to read a few of her past books (except Blowfly, another stinker) and try to get back to the incredible writer she once was. She might also consider switching to decaf coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Trace of Interest","review":"Trace, the latest in the Kay Scarpetta series by Patricia Cornmwell has not even a \\"trace\\" of the the previous, well written, intersting and absorbing novels. This book was a waste of time for both the author and reader. The storyline, which has potential, is nerver fully realized to its maximum suspense value and merely serves as a backdrop for the angry rantings of the characters who are models for dysfunctional relationships. Why these characters would ever want to be in each others company is the true mystery. You quickly tire of the angry exchanges of meaningless dialogue and keep hoping the story will get inteseting-but it never does. Ms. Cornwell needs to retire these characters or herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am soooo disapointed....","review":"I was really excited to see another Scarpetta book, until I actually read it. There are a ton of plot lines left unresolved. What was with the whole \\"conspiracy\\" about bringing Kay to Richmond. It's like she just made it up and never finished the thought. What happened to Dr. Marcus. What is wrong with Fielding? The whole thing with Lucy was just WEIRD. Cornwell just kept starting things and never finished any of them. I work at a Library and am constantly refering people to this author. I may have to rethink this after this book. Her writing has gone way down hill the past couple of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trace","review":"First of let me say I love the rest of the series. That said I have to admit this book was bad. I read the whole thing waiting for something to happen. Anything. It went into to many different directions. Normaly at the end of her books they all tie in well. Not in this one. There is no big suprise. No climax. No nothing. I sat thru this book only because I was afraid if I didn't I would be missing something on the next one. Belive me you won't. Don't waste your money on this one. If you really want to read it go to the Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about Cornwell?","review":"I had the feeling throughout this book that Cornwell's move to Fl/NY stirred up something in VA and she is getting even. In the great Scarpetta novels, Va is an exciting place to be and crime solving is an art. In this, there is a broken down system. All she?/Scarpetta created in VA is seemingly destroyed by mismanagement. The story seems subserviant venting for reasons unknown on the state. There is much extraneous material and unresolved questions as other reviewers have noted.I think the work Cornwell is doing on Diana and Jack the Ripper and any other real life cases may well be where her present talent and energy is taking her. Obviously she through Scarpetta has no good feelings about Richmand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill slide for Scarpetta continues.....","review":"I'm so disappointed with this book and the previous two as well. Has Patricia Cornwell forgotten how to write? Has she lost interest with this character? If so, maybe it's time for Scarpetta to retire.The plot in this book was so disjointed and muddled, it was a chore to read.There was a time when I couldn't put down Cornwell's books, but after the last several I don't think I'll be picking up any future offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT good at all","review":"I only gave this book two stars because I am very loyal to this author. Unfortunately, this book is horrible. Blowfly was REALLY bad. This one is also bad, not as much but... I read the other reviews and I believe the book was given okay reviews because the previous book was so awful that this one seems good compared to it! I am so sad that P. Cornwell is continuing to murder the characters that we love so much. I can't stand this anymore and I don't think I will be buying her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Cornwell I enjoy....","review":"I love spending time with my favorite fictional friends; however, I am beginning to think it's time to avoid Kay, Pete, Lucy and Benton for awhile. They've all become such downers. Where is the sense of humor? Where is the twinkle in the eyes?Each one of them could benefit from a personality labotomy. We, as readers, are forced to see their multiple short comings and psychological weaknesses, plus their never-ending analysis of each other and their relationships. Enough! Cornwell needs to return to the heroes who did not have more problems than the bad guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Nowhere near the excellence of the beginning of the series, but better than Blowfly (I know, that's not saying much). We do see at least a pale version of \\"the old Scarpetta\\", although I wish Ms. Cornwell would return to the first person narrative which she used so effectively. It appears she is holding Scarpetta at arm's length. In \\"Trace\\", she tries to juggle too many storylines (the killer, Benton, Lucy, Marino, to name a few) and ends up not doing real justice to any of them. But it is a step up from the last, and maybe she is working on bringing Scarpetta back all the way. I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I fell in love Patricia Cornwell's earlier books but the last two have just left a bitter taste in my mouth. The ending is to abrupt and it just doesn't flow well. Too many subplots and things are left unexplained. If you want a gripping read I recommend \\"Out of Reach\\" by Patricia Lewin. Great book....I read it in less than 4 hours. It grabbed me from chapter one and didn't let go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Patricia, what happened to ye lass ??","review":"I am firmly on the \\"waste of time\\" side of the critique crowd. This is one of the worst novels I have had the bad fortune to read lately. Ms. Cornwell drones on about Kay Scarpetta being \\"dissed\\" by the new examiner and it makes me wonder if her character is her alter ego. I waded through the book but it was painful and I don't believe I will attempt another Cornwell novel any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I wouldn't have wasted the time","review":"Oh my gosh, this is one of the WORST books I have ever read! I cannot believe it even got published. I was a loyal Cornwell fan, but after this I am having serious doubts about ever reading another one. I am actually kind of mad about wasting my time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF is Patricia Cornwell doing? This deserves 0 stars!","review":"After Blow Fly, which was just awful from start to finish, I hoped for better things with Trace. Sadly, I was disappointed. I don't like the third person writing style, and short sentences really only work in the hands of a good writer. I was a HUGE fan of her earlier books: Body of Evidence, Postmortem, All That Remains, and I even liked The Body Farm. However, things slid rapidly downhill from there. Patricia, go back and read the books I just mentioned. Notice how much better your writing was then? Notice how you actually TOLD A STORY that had me unable to put these books down? With action and exposition that MOVED the PLOT ALONG???????OK, now go write a Scarpetta novel, in the first person, like that. That good, or better. Concentrate on Kay! Not Lucy, not Marino, not Benton. Or, make Benton more interesting and kill off Lucy, who has really become tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell going downhill","review":"Just sending in my agreement with other reviewers here who panned Cornwell's latest effort. The pacing and excitement of her previous novels are missing, with numerous extraneous story lines taking up space and then disappearing. Then, it was like she was told to wrap it up at 400 pages. The clunker ending positively oozed to a conclusion with no buildup, just a brief explanation of where the main characters were at the \\"last day\\" nothing more. Please stick to the basics here: Scarpetta, Marino and murder! It makes such a better read than all the tidbits which were crammed into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Just take a look at how many people are selling their copies and see what they are willing to accept for them. That will tell you how much readers liked this book !Patricia Cornwall just doesn't have it anymore. That is a fact. I love Kay Scarpetta and and I have so enjoyed the books about her, her family.. and her job but this book was pathetic. It jumped around and never really got into anything.Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. This book was awful. I finished it, but only because I keep waiting for it to get better. It didn't.Patricia Cornwall should just relax and enjoy her millions. As a writer of good fiction, she has lost it along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a Trace of a storyline","review":"This has to have been the worst of the worst. While I've always enjoyed the Scarpetta mysteries, the only mystery we have in this book is: where's the mystery? The story was disjointed, there was no plot (or even a hint of one), no resolution or explanation of anything pertaining to the basis of the story. Characters introduced, barely explored and discarded.I don't plan to purchase any more of her books until I'm sure it won't be a repeat of this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"I am a big fan of Kay Scarpetta. I've read them all. I use to preorder all of Patricia's books until I preordered and got Hornests Nest and was let down. Then the book on Jack the Ripper. Not a good read eather. This book had no climax and read way to long with no excitement. I am glad I checked it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with Ms Cornwell?","review":"Although I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels and have appreciated her work over the years, every now and again she misses the mark. Unfortunately, this novel represents one of those times. She is a craftsman skilled in the genre of the suspense novel; however, Trace is missing many key elements. No action, no climax and a pathetic ending that leaves the reader wondering if this novel was written solely to fulfill a contract deadline. I think Ms Cornwell does her best work when she is enthused about and dedicated to her subject. The character, Kay Scarpetta, has served her well in the past...not the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody pleas kill off Lucy!","review":"If I could find Lucy, I would do away with her myself!

Sad because I really enjoyed the early Scarpetta books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Yet","review":"I've read every Scarpetta novel and have watched Cornwell's writing change significantly over the last few novels.

If this were a movie, I'd wait for the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly lacking.","review":"I keep a non-fiction and a fiction book on my nightstand and read each for a half hour after \\"hitting the rack\\". This book was so tedious and boring that I kept looking at the clock expecting the 30 minutes had passed but the clock seemed to barely move when reading this book.Normally, if a book doesn't grab me by the first third I don't finish it.

It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I just finished reading Cornwell's book, Trace. I am a huge PT (Scarpetta) fan and was looking forward to this book. As I read this book, I kept waiting for the suspense, interesting plot development and climax. Unfortunately, they were all missing in this one as were the tying up of some loose ends. There were areas in Trace where the author was vague, redundant and flighty. It is hard to believe that it was indeed written by Patricia Cornwell.

What is with this cop, Marino--he seems like a moron, although, the only interesting part of the book is when he gets biten and beaten up by some broad. Have to say, do not waste your money.

But when my father left this book at our house after a visit, I figured a diversion would be nice.Unfortunately, I picked the wrong book. This is just plain horrible writing. It's cliched, it's repetative, it's obnoxious - the characters are so irritating I found it hard to care about them.But, I stuck it out to the end just to see what happened. And the ending was the worst part. It was completely anti-climactic. It ended before it ended. Just when I was ready for a police chase of dramatic showdown, I was force-fed an abrupt shut-down, with all the salient details told in reverse order. It really felt like Cornwall had a page limit, or was working with a deadline, and suddenly had to wrap up the entire plot in one fell swoop.In short, this was one of the worst novels I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so sad ...","review":"To those of you new to Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, read the first nine books. Those books have some of the best writing and story telling that you'll come across in this genre of literature. Stay away from the last three books, including this one. They're not worth the money they cost, or the time spent in muddling through them.To those of you who are long-time fans of this series, I'm leaving your ranks. I don't think Kay is coming back, and I'm saddened to see the changes in Lucy and Marino. They're just not believable characters anymore. And the stories are no longer well plotted.

Ya think??!","review":"I anticipated this was going to be a REAL Scarpetta novel, back to the GOOD stuff, at last!! But no such luck! The odd switch to 3rd person for Scarpetta means she's no longer narrating, and right there you have a huge loss! Scarpetta said this, Scarpetta said that, etc., etc., etc., it's just far less interesting. I think even the lightweight plot could have been saved by PC using her winning formula of having Scarpetta doing her usual narration! I can't fathom why a terrific writer like PC would have so little regard for her fans as to mess with what we have grown to expect from her. If she's trying to drive her readership away, then just keep disappointing us like this! I threw BLOWFLY in the garbage, where it belonged, after reading just 20 pages! I'm going to finish TRACE before I donate it to the Thrift Shop. But I'm just going to have to deal with the fact that the Scarpetta series is really over now.

I told her I was going to check the reviews online to see if others felt the way I did and they absolutely do. If I had her website address I would write her and tell her to stop writing novels. There was no plot to this story and the linking together of so many people and places was unbelievable. Trace was a good title because there's only a trace of a story.

It was taking place in 3 different states, which would have been fine, had there been a real story. Blowfly wasn't that good, but I thought the people would all be pulled together for this one. We still don't know the status of Benton and Kay, and after reading this book, who really cares? Where is the wolf? After reading trace, I really don't care. What happened to the real Lucy? How did Marino quit smoking and drinking? This book lost all of their personalities. I usually read the Scarpetta books in 2 day (I work 9 Hours and have 2 boys to do homework).

The reason I found this latest so tedious is that the characters are too abnormal to be real. Between the psychotic serial killers are a bunch of seriously disturbed folks. Ms. Cornwell: Most people in this world function a whole lot better than those in your latest books. Also, please do not neglect to tie up so many story lines in your next book if indeed you write another book. So what DID happen in the political mess of the ME's office with Dr. Marcus ( surprise! another mental wacko!)Did she ever speak with Fielding? If Lucy is so dang smart, why is she so stupid?

Some claim here that Cornwell returned to her former form. Don't make me laugh! She had lost everything in fiction world five years ago and she reached the zenith of silliness when she published Isle of Dogs. Now she is trying to do the same thing with the Scarpetta series, making herself a pity caricature of a once-respected author.

What was Cornwell thinking when she was writing Trace? I used to be proud of having read her novels but now I'm no longer sure she still has the gift of good writing.

The saying \\"phoned in\\" may be literally appropriate here: the prose reads as if it is a transcription of spoken English, replete with alternating broken, incomplete sentences and sentences of the run-on variety.Everyone should stay away from this, even those, like me, who weakly might decide to give Cornwell another chance after the \\"Blowfly\\" disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"Somehow Cornwell has gotten away from the basic Scarpetta thriller.There is too much of her niece in this one. The ending is weak. I usually love her work. This one was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely a trace of the old Cornwell","review":"This book is not bad, just disappointing. She really has not written a good book since Point of Origin. It seems Ms. Cornwell has gotten tired of Scarpetta and as a reader I am exhausted as well. I won't bore you with a synopsis of the book, but take my word for it, this is not her best work. As an avid reader of her Scarpetta books, I can honestly say I don't care about these characters anymore, especially Lucy; please Patrica kill her off. This character is so obtuse, who can believe she is a genius; and a hot one at that. What's next Lucy as President-Super Model-Bill Gates; GIVE ME A BREAK, and am I the only one that shivers at the thought that Marino could be a composite of policeman Cornwell knew? How revolting. Maybe it's time for Cornwell to give up Scarpetta, she obviously doesn't like her anymore and I'm not sure she likes her readers much either... the feeling is mutual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The early Kay Scarpetta books were GREAT. But something has happened to her lately. I finished the book but it was very hard and it took me longer to read it than usual. I can/could read the Scarpetta books in a couple of days.

Yes, Patricia Cornwell has exceeded all expectations in that area! I got excited when I saw the new release! It was quickly extinguished when I started reading. For whatever reason, this book shifts from first to third person and past to present tense at a nauseating clip. I too felt like there must be a book missing between this and BlowFly.An author once on my favorite list is slipping into the \\"land of .50 cent book-dom\\". I'm not even sure I could re-sell the hardcover copy for that.I'm sticking to Tess Gerritsen and Lisa Scottoline from here on out - Patricia Cornwell has disappointed this faithful reader one time too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless waste of time","review":"Patricia Cornwell needs to quit this series now. Luckily, I checked this book out of the free library! The story line with Benton and Henri is pointless and the viewpoints from every character are annoying.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry angry angry","review":"Kay is angry. Marino is angry. Lucy is furious. The whole books seethes with angry people. One suspects that Cornwell is angry, perhaps at her readers for asking for another Scarpetta novel. Well, she's taught us a lesson.

The entire book constantly refers back to the past and never truly divulges into the present storyline. Whatever new characters that are introduced seem to disappear into the pages, possibly because they are so boring. In my opinion, the storyline is weak and I didn't feel the usual \\"can't put it down without finishing it,\\" feeling I have experienced with every other book involving Kay Scarpetta. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire Scarpetta","review":"What a disappointment. I rarely sell or give away books, but this one is out. Patricia Cornwell needs to get away from spending pages on what \\"rich people\\" have and have not. Continuous and unnecessary descriptions of costly homes, cars and clothing are redundant and boring. Also, the main characters which have been built up in previous books as strong, independent, successful people are plaqued with insecurites and a whole array of psychological weakness and insecurities that make the whole book an uninteresting and boring soap opera. Time to move on or take a vacation. Tired of the whining and sobbing over past loves and insecurites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally disappointing on the heels of _Blowfly_","review":"I was excited to hear that Cornwell was pressing >reset< after Blowfly and trying to get back to her original quality of writing. So imagine my disappointment when I began to bog down in _Trace_ and realized that this woman has simply lost the ability to write gripping stories about interesting characters. Everyone in this book, including Kay, is a cardboard cutout, and the perp is a laughably ridiculous caricature with little motive and even less development. If you can get through some of the exchanges with the wacko mother and not scream 'COARSE BULK OATMEAL FILLER,' you are a more patient reader than I. I'm done with Cornwell at this point. On to greener pastures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woeful","review":"I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that \\"she should have been told....\\". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're getting closer...","review":"While not her best Kay Scarpetta novel, I believe she is heading in the right direction. I almost didn't buy this book, as 'Blow Fly' and the 2 preceeding novels, almost convinced me that Kay had laid down and died, and I wasn't interested in the person who had taken her place. 'Trace' has me believing that we can hope to see the 'old' Kay starting to come back from the ashes. Now if Lucy can just get over herself, confess her secret and become a supporting character again, I will be most satisfied. I believe the 4 stars I gave the book is a bit high but 'Trace' was definitely better than 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has Happened?","review":"I have to agree with the other posters. I have read all of Miss Cornwell's novels and I have to say that the last 2 books have been a dissapointment. The whole business with Lucy made no sense and did not really pertain to the story. I also feel that there has never been any type of closure w/ Benton and no discussion of his years being \\"dead\\". These novels feel rushed.Don't buy the hardcover, borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"I am appalled at the change in Patricia Cornwell's writing! After reading Blow Fly and Trace, I started rereading some of the earlier books and it's as if a different person wrote the last two books.

This book drags on eternally, never makes a point and eventually ends with more questions than answers. I thought even the character that I usually love fell flat this time. I almost think that Patricia Cornwell resented having to write another one of these novels or something. I try to not leave a one star unless I really, really hate a book, but this one is deserving. I can't recommend this book.

This one, sadly, should just never have been written. I could only struggle through the first two chapters before I decided it just wasn't worth the effort, and I gave the book away (to an unsuspecting friend!) Why, oh why has the author decided to write in this stilted, distracting third person POV...\\"Kay Scarpetta did this, Scarpetta says that?\\" It's annoying and awkward, and I really can't enjoy the book having Cornwell tell us what Kay is doing and thinking, rather than \\"hearing\\" it first person as Kay tells us.

Who was this Henri person... it was not explained until like 3/4 of the way through the book. I kept on trying to remember if I am suppose to know her, and what is Benton doing with her. Things weren't explained every well, and never were. What is up with Dr. Marcus who is now the ME of VA. They talked about him and how weird he is and how he wants to discredit Kay, and then he drops of the face of the \\"book\\" earth. Why go into all that detail about him, just another example of all the subplots going on. No one is happy, Kay, Marino, Lucy, Rudy, Benton, no one!!!!

You spend every minute that you can etch out of your day reading. The dishes pile up in the sink, the cat circles your feet and then sits yowling in the corner waiting to be fed, the kids eat 3 minute noodles because that is all the time you will take out to cook dinner and you read and you read and you read. And at that last page the smile spreads on your face and out comes the contented sigh of a booklover that has sampled life's finest and nothing can be sweeter.Then there is trash like this that cost the earth and leaves you feeling as bitter and twisted as the characters it contained.

It seemed to jump around and I had trouble following the storyline.Eileen"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about me me me","review":"Gone are the suspense filled plots that made it easy to forget that the stories main character is a self centered narcissist. Cornwell's characters, even the beloved ones, seem to have only one role, as the less valuable sidekick to Scarpetta who spends an extrordinary amount of her time musing over the many people that she believes are 'out to get her', jealous of her and always, more flawed than she is. Her need to be seen as superior to all others as well as her obvious distaste for men, are not enough plot to keep this reader interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst yet","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books but this was the worst. It was a hard read, boring, easy to put down and hard to pick back up. There was just no substance to the storyline and too much going on that didn't amount to anything. I have been a mystery reader for the last 47 years of my life and it is not often that I have been this disappointed by an author who originally kept me glued to the pages. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this???","review":"It's so disappointing that Cornwell has either forgotten how to write or that she's sold out and got someone else to write for her. This book is so disorganized and boring that I realized at page 200 that nothing much had developed. It was only towards the end that things sort of came together, with a weak ending.It seems as though a lot of the authors that have made it big feel that they're above getting any editorial feedback on their work and churn out crap. I'm sorry to say that Cornwell has joined the ranks of Parker and Clancy in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING","review":"I was so excited to finally read this, it usually only takes me a day to rip through her books. This time was much different. I had to force myself to read. Lucy and Marino are such great characters (or used to be) And now its just sad to see them deteriorate. I was very disapointed, I went back and reread Cruel And Unusual just to make myself feel better.Dont waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it.","review":"Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door \\"wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater\\", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is really writing these??","review":"I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the \\"voice\\" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating.

There is just no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell taking herself too seriously","review":"I enjoyed the early Scarpetta books, but the last few (and those ridiculous books set in North Carolina!) have left me very disappointed. I've come to believe that Cornwell thinks SHE's the Medical Examiner, and that she's the smartest crimesolver alive, and is living vicariously through the Scarpetta character.All this nonsense about flying helicopters (which Cornwell does in real life) while solving crimes (which Cornwell thinks she's qualified to do in real life, i.e. the Diana and Ripper stuff) is just too unrealistic. And she's developed such an unlikeable personality in Kay that I'm no longer rooting for her to get out of harm's way. From her \\"I-take-myself-too-seriously\\" TV interviews, I think that personality is Cornwell's as well. And Lucy... Gawd. Does anybody find that obnoxious character likeable in any way?Sad that what was once an entertaining and stimulating series has turned into such drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it is time to forget about Kay Scarpetta...","review":"Again. Another poor book by Patricia Cornwell. I anticipated better after the disapointment of Blow Fly. This was just another bad book. Way too much Lucy - who continues to be an unlikable character. Lcuy is smart, Lucy is great, who cares about Lucy??? Marino seems at his worse and Benton is just boring. She offers up some new characters that are underdeveloped - a new ME and a employee of Lucy's...you are just left saying \\"huh?\\" about both of them. And where is our Kay?? This character is dull and boring. Cornwell needs to get back to her roots and read some of her first books to get back in to the swing of things. I hesitate to read another Scarpetta mystery in the future..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta needs to be put to Sleep.....","review":"I remember the days when I couldn't wait for another Scarpetta adventure! But what the heck is going on? I was very excited to start reading Trace since the Blow Fly disaster I couldn't even finish. But that same feeling came back not too far into this book.

I have to say I will really think twice before I buy another Scarpetta book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"I hadn't read a Patricia Cornwell book in a while and came across this one at an airport store. This was easily one of the worst books I've read, and I definitely won't be picking up any Cornwell books again.The character development is poor and the dialog reminded me of something from a college writing class. There are scenes in the book that are out of place, and it seemed like Cornwell couldn't figure out how to end the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Cornwell's first novels (not Scarpetta) were really rather boring and I couldn't finish them. The Scarpetta novels really built up into some incredible writing and several were quite good and entertaining, but now I believe Cornwell has run out of good new plot lines. Unfortunately, I found this novel as dull as her originals before she learned to really write. Time for a break. I'm not buying anymore of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Any mystery in this book plays 2nd or 3rd fiddle to the depravity the characters seem to have sunk to. The colleagues from previous Scarpetta books work together - but seem barely on speaking terms. Perversion and torment seem to be the main subject. Don't waste your money or time - reread one of the early ones instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending reads like Cornwell got bored or ran up against her publishers deadline.","review":"My one complaint about this book, besides her increasingly negative tone towards her own characters, is that there is NO ending. It just stops. Within a handful of pages, Cornwell wraps up all the story lines without any real payoff at all. Pitiful! It was clear who did the crimes, so couldn't she have taken a little time to actually write an ending that has at least some substance? I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read for Scarpetta fans","review":"Very disappointing read especially for fans of Kay Scarpetta. Not a great story easy to figure out who is the villian in this one. Written differently than other books by Cronwell, thoughts of main characters differs from past actions and past insight into personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a trace or reason","review":"This is the last Cornwell book I will read. As a reader who devoured the earliest Scarpetta books, I've given the latest books every chance I could. No more. My thoughts on this one are: 1) She let her 12 year-old neice write it as a lark, 2) she remembered the night before the deadline that she had a book due or 3)she's bored to death with it all and trying to get out of her contract.... If it is #3, I wish her the best of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kay Scarpetta RIP","review":"I loved the early Scarpetta books and was a real fan of Patricia Cornwell. I'm afraid to report that Trace continues to represent a downhill slide for this series. Where BlowFly was awful, this book comes close. Scarpetta is depressed, miserable, and unhappy (again). Lucy continues to be spectacularly stupid. Marino has lost weight, shaved his head, and now wears black leather (oh, no!). Benton is distant and uninvolved. The plot is boring. The writing is plodding, clipped, and just plain lousy. I don't know what happened to Ms. Cornwell, but it seems she's gone way off track since that Jack the Ripper embarrassment. It's clearly time to move on to other writers in the detective genre. Bye, bye Kay Scarpetta and R.I.P."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"I kept reading because I incorrectly assumed the story would tie together in the end. Although I have read many other Scarpetta novels, so many questions were left unanswered, I felt lost. The book seems to be incomplete.This book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Bad to Worse","review":"I was turned off by most of Cornwells recent works- too angry, too dysfunctional and otherwise too wierd for words. Trace takes the cake. The third person POV strips Kay of whatever humanity she ever had, Lucy continues on her raging, homicidal slide towards eventual imprisonment, and Benton is simply a non-character. Marino seems to be provided for somewhat bizarre comic relief. The villan, Pogue is simply laughable. And what about the new Richmond ME? Do we really care that he has a garbage truck phobia? And poor Fielding, I guess nobody gives a hoot about this poor slob.

The dialogue seems written by a 4-year old and I didn't finish the book. It's out residing on my lawn now. I can understand getting tired of writing about the characters that have been your bread and butter for ten years, but have the decency to STOP WASTING OUR TIME AND MONEY!

I was very frustrated with the lack of procedural work in this book and the return of Scarpetta to her old stomping grounds fell flat.

Unfortunately, Cornwell has lost her connection with fans. She has watered down Scarpetta and turned her into a cliche. The characters and subplot are disjointed and not likeable. Cornwell repeats the same tired descriptions of her charcters over and over again.

His ideas about and research into the truth behind the origins of Kung Fu and Karate kata is unique and insightful.

He argues (and I think proves) that forms developed from push hand techniques that were developed for Zen transmission. As a result the (sometimes ridiculous) applications for kata techniques that many of us were taught, are reexamined and more likely applications are presented.

I went from listening to my iPod at near full volume to near zero volume by switching to these (from the ear buds that come with the iPod).HOWEVER: Shortly after I bought these, my co-worker apologized for suggesting them, as the wiring failed in his pair. I ALSO had these earbuds for 5 months before the wiring started to fail. First one ear lost sound, then the other...if I wiggle the cord I can get sound every now and then. I am generally very careful and do not believe that they were mistreated, just poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headphones ever","review":"These headphones are terrible. Yes, the sound quality is great but after a few months the wire inside breaks down and the headphones cease to function properly. Now, some may say it could be user error. But i owned a pair of headphones for a year and a half before they died and these were the only ones available at the closest store (University bookstore). I got my first pair of these in January... it is now mid-April and I'm on my third pair. Don't waste your time with these, because they aren't very reliable in the long term. Spend the extra money on a better pair and you'll be way happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty shell charm","review":"I added this pretty shell with pearl charm to my bracelet to represent where I live a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean.

No waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really filling, not much coconut flavor","review":"I love coconut so I thought a product that wasn't too sweet and was mostly coconut would be a great alternative to other snacks. These bars are really filling, slightly greasy and definitely not too sweet. They don't taste like coconut candy at all. I wish the coconut flavor was more pronounced but perhaps it is not because it is all natural and hasn't been enhanced by artificial flavor. It is an ok snack but doesn't really satisfy the desire for coconut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grows moldy way before expiration date","review":"I bought these on subscribe and save, last year. I ate them occasionally and put the new arrivals in a cool dry place for storage thinking they would still be good up to their expiration date. I had to throw away two boxes of these because they went bad and moldy. Another box I sealed in a ziplock storage bag and it was not visibly moldy but smells and tastes off (like cough syrup) compared to fresh ones. So even when they are put in additional sealing and stored properly, they go bad far before their expiration date."},{"rating":"2","title":"tasty and healthy","review":"I love the flavor of these energy bar and i keep one in my bag all the time in case i get hungry.

It has a very strong coconut aroma to it and so crunchy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch those slippery wrappers!","review":"This is a delicious little snack but may slip out of your hands due to leaking wrappers. The oil is so prevalent that the outside of the individual bar is wet with the oil and it also leaks on the outside box/container. Now that I've covered the messiness, let's address the healthiness. The calorie content is far too high to eat them everyday, but if you don't they will spoil due to the leaky wrapper. Some of them are pretty dried out by the time you get to them and others are two moist to even hold up until the individual bar can be eaten. Don't think I'll be reordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inedible within month of receipt","review":"As mentioned in another review, the package arrived oily and became moldy in less than a month.

Makes a great snack, or as a quick energy fuel-bar. The only negative is that the coconut oil in these packages seems to seep thru the wrapper, especially in hot weather. I had mine in my kitchen cabinet, but then had to refrigerate them during a hot spell. They are the right size and the price for a box of 18 was great, even better when purchased thru Amazon.com with the free shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled within 3 days","review":"When they first arrived, they tasted very good.

How nice to find an anthology of stories that are engaging, provocative, and not completely self-absorbed. Ok, a couple of the writers in the book are self-absorbed, but there are stories by all sorts of other authors, some I'd heard of, some I hadn't, that made me laugh, worry, think about the world, and want to pass the book on. In a literary world where either sullen math or indulgent memoir (or a combination of the two) seems to rule, Juncture is a welcome oddity - you'll think about some of the stories for days and days afterwards and not be pissed off as I usually am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Stapleton and Gonzales have done an excellent job crafting an anthology that is both eclectic and coherent; these stories feel like they belong together, and yet each story seems surprising and highly individual. I was eager to read ahead, to see what unexpected turn the collection would take next. The anthology as a whole feels vital and risky--these writers are nothing if not linguistic virtuosos, and like the jazz riffs and subversive dance beats on the CD that was cut to accompany this book, these stories pulse with immediacy, a sense of urgency that is all too often lacking in contemporary short fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what we expected but great anyway","review":"I've been a NMA fan since they started playing the Library in Oxford, MS (btw its right next to Proud Larrys where RL Burnside played too). And like you I expected NMA to stick with the hill country blues sound that got them where they are, but I shouldnt have. These guys have enough talent to branch out and still be true to the blues but break new ground. They tried to do that with Polaris but failed, but they nailed it this time. A song doesnt have to have a standard blues progression to be the blues. Blues is a state of mind and a feeling, and this CD has it! I look for great things from this band for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Educational DVD","review":"I used this DVD as part of the educational program at a hospital's pastoral care department.

Like most people, when it comes to pondering death in relation to family, friends, and myself, I go into ocelot mode.What makes this documentary good is that it presents the subject of death and dying with a lot of sensitivity while addressing a lot of the issues associated with grief as well as the funeral and burial process. There are numerous options available to families, but I doubt that many people give this adequate consideration until someone dies. It impressed upon me how important it is to be well-informed and to also make one's wishes known to the family before death visits.The bottom line is this is an interesting and informative look at the funeral industry that approaches the subject of death with a lot of caring while also addressing practical issues. It also doesn't sensationialize death."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Home with Italian Food","review":"Probbly the best of his books, Nick has finally come down into the kitchen we all have and offers rememberances of his past in both the recipes and stories.

However, the point that must be remembered is that this book is the personal account of a single soldier in the fight against terrorism. I was the Commander for ALL interrogation operations conducted in Afghanistan up until July 2002, and referenced in the book. His accounts are based on true heroes of the HUMINT effort. Everyone must remember that the interrogation effort and HUMINT collection is a joint effort and can not be won through the efforts of a single individual. Also, a point to remember, as stated in the intro, is that the book has been changed in aspects to protect sources and identities.

Georges Duroy values only two things in his life - success and money - and he is willing to do anything to get it. He does not have any restrains and during whole book he abuses most of the people he gets in touch with (especially women).I found very interesting that author leaves Georges unpunished.

I far more enjoyed the diet book.Morgan Tansi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of good paper","review":"It isn't often that one stumbles across an author's first effort that is a total blunder incapable of capturing the readers attention. Mr. Tyrone Walls has fallen flat on his face with To Die Like An Amazon, hopefully he will keep his day job.I found this story to be boring and unimaginative, the author obviously has no clue about this subject or history!

Both have their charms. The farm has fewer nooks and crannies to hold items but the objects themselves are just as clever, and Maisy's friends Talleulah, Cyril, Charlie and Eddie are here on the farm.This is a terrific value -- a charming fold-out setup, creatively designed and with lots of hidden surprises and fun accessories. Your preschooler boy or girl will have hours of low-tech fun playing with Maisy and her friends as they tend to the garden, feed the animals and play on the tractor.A mini-book relates Maisy's busy day on the farm, and three pages of punch-out accessories include character props, animals, food and farm tools.The cardboard props don't really hold the characters up, and the thin material is liable to tear, but pieces are easily taped and this low-tech setup fosters hours of imaginative play.Charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a Novelty","review":"Purchased as a Christmas gift a few years ago and the product never was a hit.

Boom! is definitely Faith's best latin album, featuring songs that would soon become classics of the Bossa Nova era. In fact, the tunes recorded here were recorded before the vocal versions became popular such as Estrada Branca and No Blanco Do Jequiba. Both tunes became classics, so it's nice to hear them before lyrics were added. And as a bonus, on the tune Estrada Blanca, Faith takes it at a tempo so completely different from the version that Antonio Carlos Jobim (who composed the song) and Frank Sinatra take on their version, that you may not initially recognize it! Faith's version of Yesterday is beautifully done with strings, far better than his later version on his album, Percy Faith plays the Beatles.

You don't need to buy ten dollars worth of something to do some self-meditation.This guy, Joel Osteen, he sounds like a nice Christian guy and all, but all that he teaches can be found in a simple hard covered bible.Any problem you have YOU and ONLY YOU can solve, with the help of GOD, as well of course.

This book breaks down the 7 steps into a series of 7 day cycles. Each day has a short chapter, challenges you to work and ends with a prayer.In addition the book is loaded with a series of inspiring quotes by famous people like Helen Keller, Robert Kennedy, John Wooden, Booker T. Washington, Oliver Wendell Holmes and more and many biblical verses as well.The journal will help you put the 7 life-changing principles to work and enable you to start living Your Best Life Now.May the rest of your life be the best of your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Great Record","review":"I recently got this Dollybraid product in my hands.

I am an admirer of her work as well her piece de resistance being Pure; so I received this DVD with great anticipation.What a disappointment; so disappointed that I have viewed this DVD only once. The performances were hollow, contrived and uninspired in stark contrast to the original DVD. The muzzle that was placed upon Hayley Westenra was puzzling.

I did not appreciate their dresses with breasts hanging out, or low cut dresses. The violinist does not wear a slip so at times, if she is in the right light you can see-through her dress.

Well, what can I say, it is the greatest invention since the wheel. easy to use, strong, and well balanced. Dragging the deer out, even over logs and rocks was a snap, and that snap wasn't my ankle. Great product and great price. Wish I would have brought one of these years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"Great Value. Light weight but seems tough enough. More narrow than my other cart so easier to get throught the woods. Still has a low center of gravity so not as easy to tip as others i've used. The wheels are worlds better than bicycle spoke wheels that catch EVERY twig. The pins supplied to assemble unit are junk. Use something else as these will catch on brush and be gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"play it for all your friends","review":"My brother put some of these songs on a mix for me, and I had to have the album.

However, I feel Brooks did not spend that much time on the main antagonist the Morgawr; or his final stand with Grianne and the crew of the Jerle Shannara. Perhaps I just didn't want the novel to be over so soon. I wanted more story....that desire is the reason why I would recommend this book. To me, not wanting the book to end is great story telling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"I have been a fan of Terry Brooks and the Shannara series from its beginning. I bought each book read and reread them then lent them to friends. Not so with this latest add-on. Did someone get paid to write 400+ pages out of a story line of perhaps 100? Snore......its unlike these characters to whine and snivel about adversity..but here they seem to bubble over with it. Seems I would read a page or two and then skip a page or two so I wouldnt have to reread all the life stories. The only other books I have ever had to do this with is Swords of Time and White Gold Wielder (you guys know what i mean..\\"I'm a leaper....\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloat, with a little action","review":"This book is painful. A half a page of action followed by 5 agonizing pages of character self-reflection. When separate threads come together, the characters rehash everything they experienced to their friends, forcing the reader to sit there and reread everything all over again. Has the real feeling of being forced to fill the publisher's required length. ... The original trilogy was the best. If you want real fantasy, give George R.R. Martin a try (A Game of Thrones, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss Something?","review":"I've read all of his work to date and am a huge fan. This is truley the first time I was disappointed with one of his series. Most of his series are stories within a story. This was one however was a continuous long droning story. The first book was disappointing. The second picked up some speed and I thought the story had been salvaged. Then the third ... well, here it is ... usually I read brooks in a couple of days. Non-stop ... can't rip it out of my hands if you tried. With this book, I had to force myself to read it and stay focused. I could be seen throwing it down more then picking it up. I didn't connect with any of the characters and found it completely predictable. Very disappointed! Hopefully it gets better ... I loved his other works. I guess everyone is entitled to a bad one every once in a while. reminds us no one is perfect and we're all human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but Brooks cranks out the same pulp fiction.","review":"Of the three books in the series, this is the most satisfying. It is well written, and shows the maturity of the author. The problem is that the story is too predictable, and you can see the ending coming like a parade down main street. By the time you have finished 400 pages and the end of a three volume series, you ask yourself, \\"Was that it?\\" In other words, this trilogy lacks the freshness and originality of the Sword of Shannara series. I'm a fan and will continue to buy Terry Brooks books, but I am waiting for another book that just makes me say \\"Wow!\\" This ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"I have been a Brooks fan since I was 16 and fell in love with the Sword of Shannara - Unfortunately his latest trilogy fizzles out about half way through Antrax. The overall story line is good albeit somewhat predictable - unfortunately all of the characters are the same - constantly filled with self doubt, constantly going over the same old ground page after page after page... This series should have been edited down into one book - then it would have really been a nice story! As it stands it is a mediocre story mired in a bunch of fluff. Brooks has never been a \\"trilogy\\" writer. By and large all of the Shannara and Landover books can stand on their own. - He and DelRey are definitely milking it for the extra cash...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light read, some what predictable but fun","review":"I found Morgawr to be the lightest in the Tilogy and the quickest read. It was what you expected from Brooks- all the story threads coming together, overlapping and being tied up at the end...oh but wait another hint of books to come...Not as great as his earlier series, but we continue to read them because his style is good and the hopes he revisits some of the excitement of books he had written years ago.I gave it 4 stars because the book was what I expected. I'm never let down by Brooks, he always comes through on the entertaining factor. And when I want to exscape with a book, he is one of the authors I go to.Enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best series","review":"I have read all of the Shannara series, and think Sword of Shannara is an important work. The Jerle Shannara series is in my opinion, his best work. It takes leaps from technology to science, the past to the future, adolescence to adulthood, companionship to love, accident of birth to conviction of purpose, short term goals to long term achievements, and failure as a part of the path to success. The characters emote, not brood, because they think and feel. The action is vivid, focused, and dramatic. I would recommend this series to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting For Survival","review":"To me, the pinnacle of this series was the portion dealing with the computer, Antrax, but I also wondered very much how the situation with the Morgawr was going to be resolved and how Grianne, formerly the Ilse Witch, would confront and accept her evil deeds. Bek displays a true tenderness as he helps her in her time of vulnerability.I was also secretly hoping that at least one elven ranger would make it. But alas, out of principle, they had to be killed off to the very last. And oh yes, I quite understand that Mwellrets have GIMLET eyes. I was reminded of this on numerous occasions. But these were but small points of contention as I observed the corrupt politics of the Federation and wondered how the good guys could possibly survive the Morgawr's fleet. The heroes have failed in their mission in some ways and succeeded in others. Now they have been reduced to raw survival and the reader waits to see how the battered remnants of the crew will ever reach home alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"Once again Terry Brooks has proven he is still one of the top fantasy fiction writers. This trilogy started out slowly but got better with each book. Morgawr finishes it off with a typical Terry Brooks finish. The only negative thing I can say is that he left a few threads hanging. Hopefully he will pick up on those in his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star","review":"Terry Brooks stopped writing engaging fantasy after he finished the first Magic Kingdom novel. The rest has been typical, sub-par, fantasy fare, on par with the average romance novel. Anyone who thinks otherwise should expand their library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story, differnet names","review":"I am dissapointed by the Voyage of Jerle Shannara set. Its the same story (Brin and Jair) of The Wishsong. Sister is caught up by evil, brother has to save her. A Druid dies, another takes over. It seems the plot was just twisted a little bit and the names were changed.The first 10 books were ok, the rest have much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness fills my heart to post this review","review":"I hoped, I prayed and look what I am at now: typing this review...The first was acceptable, the second needed help.But this one takes the cake as probably one of Terry's worst books to date!Probably my expectations were too high, given Terry's obvious talents, but to publish such a work? Scandalous!!Honestly, this book fall flat. It was supposed to be the climax of the series but was actually the dullest of the lot. Well, I really hope the next series will be better.Alas, I must still finish this review....I give it the...rating of :( aka 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pitiful conclusion to a substandard series","review":"I'm rather astonished that this is the same Terry Brooks that wrote the original three Shannara novels. I don't usually say this, but this series really did come across as a cash grab. Each book is roughly 200 pages shorter than earlier novels, and with fewer lines per page.But these are technical details.The story itself started out well enough in the first book. The usual search for treasure in a distant land, leading to conflict and adventure. A small handful of interesting characters are introduced.Now, book three. By the end, all those interesting characters will either be dead or altered beyond recognition. Through great leaps in logic at various crucial moments, those remaining characters we knew would survive, survive.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Terry's earlier books, particularly Elfstones which was one of the best works of fantasy ever written. At best, I found this book to be insulting.I would give it 0/5 if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"As pointless as the other 2","review":"I agree with the reviewer who wrote \\"much prose about nothing\\". Very disappointing. Have read every Terry Brooks book up until now but this will be the last. Wasted money on these 3. Where is the real Brooks? The one who wrote the earlier Shannara? It's almost as if these books were written for young teenagers or children. So many words but very little going on. If you want a good fantasy series get into the George R. R. Martin one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Library Rental Book","review":"Don't run out to buy this if you can borrow it from someone first. It quickly became apparent to me that this was a \\"chase\\" story, where all the characters run all over the place trying to get somewhere, and when they finally do, the book is over. Or, in this case, almost over. The characters have inhuman abilities to run and run and run for days, complete with serious injuries/illnesses. The normal human would have collapsed with some of the situations, but Brook's characters carry on, sometimes shrugging it all off with \\"oh, it's only some broken ribs!\\" It was this kind of fault that made this book a \\"one-time-read\\" for me. Just read it to find out how it all ends, and then return the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring killers","review":"Kinky killers is so boring. The script is poorly written and all the characters protrayed in this film is flat. The main reason for me to buy this DVD is because of Michael Pare. however, I am so disappointed that he is not the male lead in the film (or may be there isn't any lead actor/actress in the film, now you can imagine how bad this film is).Michael's talent is totally wasted.Yes, there are many killing shot and sex scene. But all are badly done.It doesn't not reach the \\"unrated\\" standard. The most is \\"NC17\\".Michael had one full nude shot when he had sex in doggie style, you could hear him moaned but the scene was shot in wide shot and it only lasted for few seconds.It's not worth buying it, if you are Michael's fan, just rent it.

I was not born when it was aired and never saw this in syndication over the past 40 years so I took a chance and bought this season and loved it and consequently purchased all other seasons. The picture and sound quality are perfect. My only regrets are this show didn't go on for a few more seasons and that seasons 5 & 6 have some repeat episodes such as \\"Betty's Graduation, Father The Naturalist, First Dillusionment etc. \\" I highly recommend this show for anyone looking for a quality family program that may have been over-looked due to time ( over 50 yrs old tv )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Buyer","review":"This show was a wonderful classic production that I have been eagerly anticipating for more than a year. I was all prepared to purchase it the day of release when I saw the reviews saying that the company distributing the shows on DVD had chosen not to give us the full, unedited shows as orginally broadcast. Reviewers used the term \\"butchered\\" and that was enough for me to decide that I would NOT purchase this DVD set after all.

A significant source of the pleasure in owning such classic series is that you expect to see them unedited, as they were originally broadcast. The editing of these episodes is obvious to even a casual observer, with dialogue and scenes simply fading out. To add insult to injury, even the closing credits are edited. As the credits are displayed, instead of the show's theme playing through the end, the credits just stop--abruptly. \\"Father Knows Best\\" deserves better treatment, and so do the customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No go","review":"I was all set to buy this but heard from a friend that the episodes were cut down.

The director of this character assasination obviously had a political agenda(Note the poorly educated, and morally corrupt, liberal wing-nut actor chosen for the narration). The production(?)is not even historically astute about the overall era, issues, and politicians.

But this one combines acting and narration very successfully. The kids both enjoyed it and, more importantly, learned a lot from it.Positives: Good mix of acting and narration. Production is also very good.Negatives: Only negative is really only a problem for teachers...like most documentaries, its made for adults so the language/vocabulary is not easy for younger kids (for my 8th graders we had to discuss lots of vocabulary prior to watching)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to wake up","review":"I will admit that I turned this on PBS at 3 a.m., when I couldn't sleep, because I felt a nice documentary would lull me back to sleep. Was I ever wrong. The documentary was so engrossing that it kept me awake and when it was over, I hopped on Amazon to order my own copy because I wanted to see it again.The most fascinating thing about the story of Andrew Jackson is how little we have progressed in all this time. The controversies are (mostly) the same, the scandals are (mostly) the same. Jackson used the media of his day the way politicians of today do.

My favorite character, Marik(not Yami Marik) is the center of the events. Most of his character is known in this set. It seemed almost if Yugi was only a side-note for a while. Even though I dislike dub, this was still good enough for me.The scene when Marik talks to his brother for the last time (or so he thinks at that moment) is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime I've seen. If only the voice actor sounded like Marik's age for once and kept the poignant music.

The constant self-examination by each character was over-the-top. If this is this author's idea of good writing I don't see her with a long career. You need a lot more dialog and less self analysis.

I ordered one of them and I sincerely hope it won't also be a waste of time.Just to double check my impressions of this book I checked the other reviews on this site and found one (other than mine) one-star rating and 3 (3!) five star ratings. How can this be? Am I and the guy that also thought this book was useless completely out of it? To repeat the sentiment expressed by the author of that review, Naaaah! This book is a waste of your money AND a waste of your time. It actually has negative value. By the time you've read it you will have many misconception to overcome that you didn't have before."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably irritating","review":"this book might be useful if it weren't for the authors' seemingly implacable desire to be funny, which they are not. almost every sentence has some superfluous witticism in parentheses (usually with an exclamation point!). really, if you cut out all the ribaldry the book would be about 200 pages shorter, which would be a blessing because the reader might actually learn what she was setting out to learn. i do not recommend this book, except for people as retarded as the authors (in which case, they will probably not learn HTML because they'll actually be enjoying the sad attempts at humor)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not worthy of being in the Dummies' line up","review":"Every other Dummies book I have read was well written, funny and eased me into the more technical facets of their subject matter. This one however did not. The interminable 6th chapter presents HTML is more obtuse terms than some technical manuals I have read, and I have already had some HTML experience. The rest of the book, as far as I got, instead of providing concrete examples, just spouted on style. You are far better off getting the HTML 4 for Dummies Quick Reference. It is much better and more clearly written, offers concrete examples and it costs less."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most useless HTML book I have seen","review":"I love HTML and I've got lots of books about it at home. So far as I am concerned, this is the worst. There's at least half of the content that could be demolished. It kept saying things over and over again and that space would at least take 1/5 of the whole book.It didn't explain HTML properly (which is the most basic thing), it doesn't much helps beginners nor experts. this is really a FOUL book. There's HEAPS of other books with this prize better than this book ten times!Remember: If you're planning to learn or improve your HTML, do NOT buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst I have ever read on HTML","review":"I learned HTML with out any book. All I did was look at the document source of some of the pages I went to and found out how to write the HTML. But I wanted to learn more so I got this book. If I did't know how to write HTML before I got this book I would not know how to write it. I have another book that is really good it is \\"Web Publishing with HTML 4 in a week. You don't need a big expensive book to learn something as basic as HTML. It is the easiest language out there. You could just teach yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A POORLY written dummies book","review":"The book was awful. The book always goes of subject by showing you the design of a webpage instead of the actual HTML. Get another book on HTML if you want to learn HTML.

Highly recommended. However, the seller is HORRIBLE! There is an instructional/tutorial CD that comes with this book. It is affixed to the back cover of this paper back book. The seller wrapped this book in butcher paper & drop kicked it into the mailbox. By the time it reached me, the CD was shattered to pieces. I contacted him & his response was literally, \\"Oh well, sucks for you\\". He has my $$$ and that is all he is concerned with. What a jerk.

When I went to my local bookstore to get \\"Html4 for Dummies with CD ROM,\\" the sales associate did everything in her power to dissuade me from buying it. Now, 2 weeks into the course (and the book) I understand why.There is too much text in this book: long, verbose explanations that make learning a chore. It is no fun to read, and is often confusing. Unless you are in the same situation as I (your professor demands that you use this, and only this, text) don't waste your money. Elizabeth Castro has written a much better book on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"I've bought a few dummies books through the years and the one common theme throughout them all is REDUNDANCY.

Do a google search of Basic HTML and you'll get a lot of sites and will teach you more than this book and it's FREE! Please avoid this junk. Besides who do they think they're calling dummies? You're only a dummy if you buy there products. Just call me a reformed dummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"For dummies, in a way.","review":"I simply expected this book to educate me about how to use HTML code. There is too much unwanted subjective advice on what makes good content for a web page. The technical explanation of HTML code is confused and poorly organized.

I actually started to feel ill trying to grasp all of the tag information contained in this 1000(actually 100)page chapter. The problem was that there were no examples in this relatively huge chapter to help clarify all of the information.Granted, examples for each tag were supplied on the CD which came with the book but there are 100s of sites out there which will gladly teach HTML for free!I wanted a good book because I didnt want to HAVE to be glued to my computer to memorize tags. This book could have been awsome if it didnt rely so heavily on the CD.The CD should compliment the info in the book- not suppliment it.An additional 50-100 pages of backup examples could have saved this book in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better guides out there!","review":"Vague and inconsistent. There is too much reliance on the CD and the toggling back and forth got old pretty fast. The book should do the teaching. The enclosed CD-ROM did not have many of the examples, especially those relating to chapters 4, 5, 9, and 10. A call to customer support promised a replacement that never arrived. I also found the attempts at humor to be distracting. More coordinated examples may help."},{"rating":"2","title":"a REFERENCE for the rest of us.","review":"They really live up to that subtitle in this one. Chapter 6 is a reference. This is however what I needed, because I already had written some html code, but was unhappy with the code the tools were creating. Remember, YOU DO NOT NEED A BOOK TO LEARN HTML! However, a book can help you improve the your html code. If you do need a book to learn html, then your going to have much larger problems because html is the tip of the iceburg, it's what the user sees and uses to communicate with the CGI script running on the server. May all the gods help you if you need more hand holding then any HTML book would provide. You could print the reference from the web, but, that will not look as pretty on the shelf. I'm a programmer for FamilyHomeSearch.com, and use the book as a reference to make the generated html code from Microsoft Front Page 2000, more efficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"and I always thought dummies books were for complete beginners...","review":"Caveat emptor to the absolute beginner. This book is not written for the beginning web page creator. It is not written in a tutorial style. It is good as a reference source as you study a true tutorial type book. It discusses tags and their attributes one at a time without showing you how they fit into your web page code. The beginning chapters throw lots of advanced features at you and tell you they will be discussed in chapter 19 etc.I was completely overwhelmed after 20 min of reading. So what's a beginner to do? I recommend Create Your First Web Page in a Weekend. By the time you get half way through that book then you can use this dummies book as a reference.william"},{"rating":"1","title":"Castro's Book is much better!","review":"A big disappointment.

Get Castro's book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not get to the point","review":"Instead of just explaining the tags and showing examples the book goes into long-winded discussions on how things work -- discussions that amount to nothing more than filler, which the reader must sort through in order to find the information he needs. It is a very basic book. I just purchased it and could not wait to learn HTML. After reading the first chapters I actually became disgusted. It does not get to the point or even teach you the way a book should instruct you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was a really good read.

I read about 50 pages and learned nothing about HTML tags, so I got frustrated and quit reading. I couldn't even tell you anything I learned from that damn book. I could, however, remember about 1 million horrible jokes and idiotic references to unrelated matters.

Unfortunately, something has changed. The mat is dangerously slippery.

That said, I think with time/more cleanings it will be just fine.

I am SURE that that is why this product is always on SALE! They are trying to dump it!!I only discovered this minor detail after I was getting ready to reorder. It would seem to me that a company like Swanson would have enough sense to know what maltodextrin is, and that they would not sell a product like this to those wishing to control their sugar; (0r at least a WARNING in big RED letters). Of course if that did that, they probably would not sell any of this product since 99.5% of the people that purchase this product do so with that fact in mind.WARNING: READ ALL LABELS and RESEARCH EVERY PURCHASE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY!

If you think you are a true hardcore rap fan then The Evidence is ESSENTIAL to your collection. It has all his original hits, such as \\"6 N The Mornin'\\", \\"Colors\\", \\"New Jack Hustler\\", \\"OG Original Gangster\\", the list goes on and on. My only querie in an otherwise stellar album is that Ice should have included some of his other hits, \\"Mind Over Matter\\", \\"Iceberg\\", \\"Lethal Weapon\\", \\"Lifestyles Of The Rich And Infamous\\" are some that immediately spring to mind, but other than that this greatest hits album is essentialy flawless. I recommend you buy this album whether you like hip hop or not, just to see the best of a truly remarkable artist. This is a very impressive album and one of the most important rap albums ever.

Getting it out was a challenge; I had to use at least 2 fingers to fish it out, and it was sooo uncomfortable. And no matter what, the cup was always *covered* with blood, not *filled* with blood. The directions say that it should lay low in the vagina, which makes no sense at all, considering that is where all the nerve endings are. (I could always feel it inside me. The directions also say not to push it up far in the vagina because that will cause leakage. I mean, what?) I was really hoping this cup would work, as it says it can be worn overnight for 12 hours, and a tampon only 8. But ugh, it just didn't work for me at all. I will never betray tampons again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would never switch back to tampons","review":"The Diva Cup is awesome. It no longer is a burden to have my monthly period. I hardly notice to even have the Diva Cup in, and it is superior for so many reasons. It is much more comfortable since you can't feel it, and is less drying than tampons are. It is less messy, more environmentally friendly, you can go pee while you have it in, they contain no bleaching chemicals, it is more cost-effective, it is more comfortable for working out, and it is easier for travel. I don't have to worry about carrying tampons, and I don't have a white stringhanging out when I change in the locker room. I no longer have to carry tampons around in my purse, and I don't even have to buy tampons at the store. I have only tried the Diva Cup, so I don't have a comparison for other brands. After having a menstrual cup, I have no reason to ever go back to using tampons. It took a few months to perfect the technique, but no difficulties beyond that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye-bye to tampons and pads...","review":"I will never go back to tampons or pads. I can usually leave the Diva cup in all day at work and not have to worry about changing anything. I've never had any leakage. I also notice less odor than with tampons/pads.

I've only been using one for about a year--I decided I was sick of the waste of tampons, their tendency to leak, ruin clothes etc. Initially I was also worried it seemed a little gross but it's not and I won't be going back. This is so convenient. As others have said, you can wear it overnight, you can head out to work and just deal with it when you get home again. I've used it a couple times on vacation and again, you get up and go for the day. I've also never had a problem at the gym, the pool, the ocean, on hikes, on planes.

I'm a convert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, comfortable product","review":"I absolutely love my diva cup. Not only is it green, but it saves a lot of money. It is comfortable to wear and there are no problems with leaking. It takes some practice getting it in correctly, so don't give up on it quickly. All of the information says that you can trim the stem part to comfort, but I would suggest not doing that until you've had some practice getting it in correctly, because I cut mine before that time and now I'm wishing it was still longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I bought one the other day and am trying it for the first time.

My hands get covered in blood and mucus! Ewww! There is no way that I would be able to empty it in a public bathroom.During the first 2 days of my periods, I have a heavy flow. I was always able to wear a Super tampon and a pantyliner with no problems, but for some reason, the Diva cups leaks within just one hour! The first hour it leaked, I emptied it and put it back in, and then put a pantyliner in my undies. Again, within the hour I leaked! This cycle kept continuing all day! I'm getting so frustrated! It works fine when my flow is light, but I really hate getting my hands so dirty! It's just not worth it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT work for me!","review":"I purchased a Diva Cup, thinking it would be easier than tampons and pads, alleviating some of the stress of a period.

I went to sleep, while still dizzy and worried, and woke up the next day to find that I could not take it out. I had to go see the doctor that day to have him help me remove the darn thing. Worst experience of my life, and even the doctor had a lot of trouble with it! I can't even return it now, since they kept it in the doctor's office.

It's a little awkward at first but once you get use to it you dont feel it at all. My problem with it is that I have leakage and I hate that feeling. Tampons work much better for me. A couple of reasons for this might be because my muscles are weak and I have't done any Kegel excersises to make them work better but the other problem is that my flow is quite heavy and the consistency is on the watery side. I hope I'm not grossing anybody out but I'm trying to help someone to decide if this product is right for them. I'm perimenopausal and I wish that it would have worked because not only is the DivaCup environmentaly frienldy but it would have also saved me a whole lot of money.

Ugh. I never really noticed how unpleasant that feels until I got the Diva Cup and didn't have to do that anymore. Now my periods are clean and I feel all airy and wonderful down there! My only complaint would be not against the cup, but that I can't really see what I'm doing down there when I put it in, so I can't see or feel if it's folded inside me or not, until I actually have a leak... so until I have a leak, I just kinda have to wonder if it's in there right or not. I think as I gain experience using it though, I'll probably be able to tell. I love it! LOW MAINTENANCE PERIODS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a little practice, but I love not having to feel like I'm on my period.","review":"Ok, so it took me a few tries to figure out how this cup fits in well. I would also recommend that you urinate soon AFTER you put in and take out the cup so you avoid any chances of getting a UTI, especially when learning. Besides these things, it's really nice to feel like I'm not on my period (not having the feeling of something flowing out all the time) and also feel like I'm helping the planet by not throwing away so much waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs well, comfortable","review":"Very convenient and easy to insert. For me, it lasted about 9 hours, not 10-12. Much better than Soft Cup, which were too large to use. The size is very comfortable. The one issue I have is with the end pull that's used to remove the cup: it should be longer. The short length is very difficult to grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept - Not For Everyone","review":"I wanted this to work for me. It hurt. Even with lube. I got it in but the little stick part on the end poked me no matter what way I turned it. Taking it out almost made me scream. I think I have fibroids or some other garbage going on. I may also be too 'inexperienced'. It's a cramped space. The model 1 was too big for me.I trust the person who recommended this and I think it's going to be a great product for a lot of women. If you're primarily celibate, have fibroids, or find sex painful, this isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's HUGE!","review":"This was the first menstrual cup I ever tried, and I was a bit intimidated by the size. I tried it out, and there was only one afternoon where I couldn't feel it. And you have to completely cut off the stem. Overall, the idea is FANTASTIC, but it's HUGE. I ordered a MeLuna online, and was shocked and relieved that it was HALF the size of the diva cup. I can't feel it at all. And I didn't have to remove the stem. Also, it's made of a different material that you don't have to boil for 20 minutes monthly (just 5)... If you've had children or bleed ALOT (i hardly filled it at all) it might work, but do some research on the products and sizes. It's HUGE. And I got the smaller of the two diva cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Come True","review":"One of the best purchases I have ever made. The Diva Cup finally gives a woman freedom from her period, eliminating the need to purchase and carry around (non-environmental-friendly) tampons and pads, as well as reducing the risk of TSS to practically zero. Although it takes a bit of time to get used to the process of insertion and removal, as well as figuring out the heaviness of your flow and how often to change the cup (certainly no more than the tampon being changed every four hours), once you've got the idea, you don't have to worry about leaks. This cup has kept me unaware of my period even when performing strenuous physical activity (acrobatics, dance, etc), and is wonderful for swimming. It can also be worn overnight with no worries.One of the most highly recommended products I can suggest for menustrating women of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I love the concept of this product and tried for more than a year's worth of cycles to make it work, but the Diva Cup often leaves me feeling raw after use.I looked up different tips and hints, making sure that I was using it properly and definitely was. I ordered the correct size, too.The reviews indicate that it works better for the majority of women who've reviewed it, so good on them, but I'll be switching to reusable panty liners."},{"rating":"2","title":"wooow! wish would know about this years ago...","review":"i love my divacup,by the 3rd day using it i got the hang of it and i felt so much more clean..amazing product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for me.","review":"I use this product because I hate the thought of wasting money on feminine hygiene products and the thought of putting all that garbage in the landfill. I love it because it fits perfectly. Amazing product and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice alternative to tampons","review":"Once you get your technique down on how to use it, it makes for a nice alternative to tampons. It works extremely well for light days, but on heavy days it leaks a little bit. I haven't had a child, so this is why I selected the Model 1. The brochure that comes with it says that it's hard to get a good fit and some women may need to try Model 2 for a better fit. The cup is made of a good quality silicone and is easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diva cup fan","review":"THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT especially for a heavy flow. It was so hard the first time I tried it, I almost gave up. Since it was the only thing I had with me in a foreign country in a small village (stupid, I know) I had to make it work.It took me a couple tries to figure out how to get that huge thing in there, but once it was in I couldn't feel it.I would normally try and go all day without changing it, because I want to be home since it is quite a mess. My flow is SOOOPer heavy though so I have to do it at least twice a day.It is awesome not having to tote around all those tamps and I feel good about cutting down on waste. Tampons don't cut it for me...even the biggest ones ( and I'm not even overweight!)Anyway...Great product HIGHLY reccomend.(I'm trying to get my little sister to use one lol)"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a pain","review":"I love the idea. And it definitely keeps the flow in check. Not sure about they suggested time. Probably depends on your flow. But, boy, is it hard to get in and out. Really hard to get it in the right place and then get it to release the suction and get it out again. It's very messy! And a bit painful. I read a lot of different reviews. And apparently, some people love them (if you can trust the reviews) and other people not so much. I don't think it's for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!!!","review":"I've been using my diva cup for six months now. It makes me feel so much greener than wasteful pads and tampons, and I don't have to worry about all the pesticides in the cotton. It's a lot cheaper, too, especially since I have such a heavy flow. It is a little awkward to get in and out at first, but you get used to it quickly, and it's not nearly as messy as it sounds. And it's so much more comfortable than tampons! You can't even feel it. I sleep in it and everything. I also used it when I went swimming with sharks, so that should tell you how leak-proof it is. It did come dislodged once, but that was because I had forgotten the ever-so-important full twist during insertion. It was a bit more disastrous than leaking through a pad or a tampon, but luckily it was in the middle of the night when no one was awake to see. Overall, it is a great product. I absolutely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best period product!","review":"It takes a little getting used to but once you've got it, it's wonderful! It will save you money and stress when it comes to your period. No more wondering if you have any pads/tampons with you or if you have enough. I can keep my Diva Cup with me everywhere I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me :-/","review":"I ordered the pre-childbirth model of the Diva Cup. I can't insert it without pinching (painful!), and even when it is fully inserted I still have to wear a panty liner because it leaks around the edges, can't form a good seal. I guess I am one of the people it just doesn't fit well. Love the idea, but just doesn't fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still not entirely used to it, but a good product so far","review":"I heard about this from a friend and decided to give it a try- it was strange to use at first, but I did figure it out pretty quickly. I've only had it for 3 months, so it's still slightly foreign to me, but the more I use it, the more I like it. I feel good about reducing waste, saving money in the long-term, and I also think that it puts you more in touch with what's coming out of you, strange as that sounds. Somehow, it makes the monthly thing that we all have to go through a little less icky- you're not seeing a gross, dirty napkin go in the trash or toilet, you're just seeing a small puddle in the cup that you pour out and clean out. Give it a chance- it's something that you have to learn to use, it doesn't come automatically, but once you get it, it becomes natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, great service","review":"I know that the Diva Cup isn't perfect for everyone, but I love it and it works great for me. I needed a new one, and it was shipped quickly, and for less cost than a Whole Foods that carries it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a little getting used to","review":"Overall, I think that this will make life a little easier.

Super easy to use, you don't feel it, and your mind is free for the whole day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and awkward","review":"like the title of my review I found this experience to be extremely awkward and messy. Awkward in the fact that manoeuvring it onto my cervix was next to impossible with no matter what fold and just try using it in a public restroom - imagine walking out to rinse it, with blood everywhere...Not to mention the pressure on my poor insides was tremendous.NO WAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wonderfully!","review":"This product does exactly what it's supposed to, and it does it well. I admit it was a bit confusing to get the hang of at first, but once I did, inserting and removing only took a few seconds. The cramps I would get from tampons are gone, and I know this will save me a lot of money in the long run! Plus, I rather enjoy how long I can leave it in (12 hours, apparently) so I don't feel pressured to replace it all the time. I would recommend this to any woman I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"no more tampons","review":"The diva cup rocks. I've used it for six months. I had some cramping the first day I inserted it, and then never again. I haven't had problems with leakage at all. For me, it's so much more comfortable than the tampons. The cup stays put when I have to use the toilet, when I cough, when I run, lift weights, etc. It misses 5 stars because it's a drag with public restrooms. I would rather wash it with soap and water each time I remove it, and that's difficult to maneuver in public toilets."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never go back","review":"This product has changed my life! Well, it's changed 1/13th of my life.I will never go back to pads or tampons. Ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but lacking in execution...","review":"In theory this product is amazing. A reusable cup that can last 12 hours, won't give you TSS, and cuts back on the $$ spent on tampons/pads...count me in! However, I have experienced some problems using this product. First off, insertion is fairly easy enough but I can never get the cup to open up completely. I've just been letting it go and eventually it pops open on its own, but I'm waiting for the day that doesn't happen and I end up leaking blood everywhere. And speaking of that, removing this thing is a joke. I can't imagine trying to remove the cup anywhere other than the privacy of your own home. Took me five minutes of digging around to pull the cup down far enough to break the seal and remove it. By the time it's all over, my bathroom looks like a crime scene and my vagina hurts.Is it worth it? Not for me, but I still love the idea of it. I would recommend that all ladies should try it at least once, as it seems to work great for some. You never know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I do like this product. It is a bit gross, you definitely have to get used to the empty procedure. But it is very comfortable. I don't usually have to empty more than once morning, once evening so that makes it very easy. And I find doing that during my morning shower makes everything even easier.It seems expensive, but I haven't needed a tampon in months so it starts saving money in no time.This may be unrelated, but I also find that my period has shortened by about a day since I started using it. And that is definitely another plus.I occasionally have a tiny leakage problem... but never anything serious and I have a feeling it is because I should use the other size.I give it a thumbs up and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product in all ways.","review":"I can't think of anything bad to say about this product. It's good for the environment, cost-effective, less time-consuming than other products...The only warning I can give is to learn how to take out the devise. When I first tried this, I couldn't break the vacuum properly and it really hurt. Pinch it so that you take it out the same way you put it in.Definitely worth the time, money, and any misgivings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Period days feel like non-period days","review":"At first I was not happy with the Diva Cup, but now that I've become used to it I would never trade it. When I started using it, insertion was tricky and often led to leaks (this can be common at the beginning when you are getting used to it, but now they are increasingly rare), but in this case practice makes perfect. I realized I was not doing the insertion properly - it is critical to pay attention to the \\"insert horizontally towards the tailbone\\" instruction. I have seen some complaints from other reviewers in regards to the stem, but in my case the stem has never bothered me. I do recommend wearing thin pantyliners when using the Diva Cup just in case (one 99 cent box will last 2-3 months and be more than enough to deal with blood that gets through) but my period days feel like normal non-period days for the most part. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so far..","review":"I'd heard about this online, and being (or at least always striving to be) a very earth-friendly, green person, I was anxious to try it. Works fabulously, and I can't be happier about contributing less to the landfills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest invention ever! I LOVE IT!!!!","review":"This product is fantastic - works even better than tampons or pads. I was really worried that it wouldn't work well or that it would be hard to insert and remove, but after the first time, it's pretty easy. I can't feel it at all when it's inserted, and there are no leaks whatsoever. On my heavy flow days, I would go through one Super Plus tampon every hour, but even on those really heavy days, I don't need to empty the Diva Cup for about 6-8 hours. And on lesser flow days, I leave it in for 10 hours, which is very convenient. I heartily recommend this to all women - it is better for the earth and much better for our bodies than bleached tampons, and it just works better to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I could have imagined","review":"I've used commercial tampons, natural tampons, pads, and disposable menstrual cups before and this absolutely is the best, easiest, and most effective. Without a doubt.It is much easier to insert and remove than I thought, because that was a concern of mine at first. You feel it in you even less than tampons. Change it once every twelve hours + it's virtually impossible to fill the cup up enough to warrant changing more often = it's almost difficult to remember that you're even on your period! I am not kidding at all! It's small, discreet, easy to use, easy to clean, comfortable, eco-friendly.. I can't say enough good stuff about this. It even feels much less invasive than tampons.

I used applicator-free tampons for about a decade before making the switch, so I was over the \\"ick\\" factor there may have once been.There are so many pro's to this:- It saves money! and pretty quickly depending on the price- It's better for the environment- You have to change it less frequently (about every 12 hours)- It's comfortable (you don't feel it)- No risk of toxic shock syndrome- It has marks for measuring volume (if you're in to that kind of thing)- It doesn't leakI will caution you to read the directions carefully!

It might be hard to insert it the very first time, but after that it takes several seconds to insert it and you forget that it is there. I empty the cup once a day and found that it is very convinient to do that in the shower. Not only I no longer have to waste all of the money on conventional products, but I also don't waste my time - it takes less than a minute a day to take care of my period with Diva cup.I really try to spread this idea around through my family and close friends.

In contrast to both pads and tampons, it is reusable and thus results in much less waste. Compared to pads alone, it is cleaner, less bulky, and worry free. You can wear it swimming and nobody will know. Compared to tampons alone, it is more comfortable and physically safer. You can carry the product discreetly in your purse in its little travel bag, which comes with your purchase. Just wash with mild soap and water before and between uses.

My period is heavy the first 2 days and thats, of course when it leaks the most. Also its very messy to clean. When u first take it out you run the risk of spilling it on yourself!

I couldnt have been more wrong. Diva Cup is SOOOOOO much more comfortable than tampons and you dont have to worry about 'leakage' like you do with tampons. They are so easy and convenient. I just check it twice a day, rinse it and thats it! I NEVER worry about changing it at work or about having an accident while Im out. I cant believe how much money this saves as well. Give yourself a few days to get used to putting it in and taking it out. Dont get frustrated. It takes a few times to get the technique. But after that it is so easy and worry free.

You are recommended to boil it each month before use (or however regular you are) and I once left it in the pot of boiling water too long (I forgot about it).

The Diva Cup is easy to use. It can get messy removing it, but for me, it's worth dealing with a mess a few times a day. If you have to empty it in a public bathroom, here's what I do: Carry a small package of baby wipes in your purse. Wash your hands before going in the stall. Remove the cup, empty it and insert it again. (No need to wash it every time, just wash your hands well first.) Clean your hands with the baby wipes and throw the wipes away in the sanitary napkin holder.

At first, my response was \\"eeww\\". But then after hearing and reading so many positive responses. I decided to give it a try. SO WORTH IT!!First time inserting it, easy. Pull out easy to. Push a little, grab the little knobby thing, and if sticks a little, squeeze the cup and pull out. I remember the days of struggling with the diaphragm. Nothing like that. super easy. The best part: NO leakage at all. Nothing. Nada. I have had very heavy periods, and OMG it's awesome. I don't feel it at all, and you only have to deal with it twice a day. This is a no brainer. Oh...and then you never have to spend money on tampons or pads again. Really...why is this not mainstream?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like a football up you know where","review":"No mater what i do this thing just feels like a giant football up in my lady land. My other issue is that as soon as its in i constantly feel like i need to urinate. I dont get it, i sqweeze it/fold it make origami out of it and its just not comfortable.

Alas I am not one of the fortunate ones. At age 52 I am depressed that I still need any feminine protection. I gave the Diva Cup a good try... but I must be too short. I watched all the YouTube videos and read everything possible on the tips and tricks of use. I have had the same problem with tampons all my life. I've only found one brand short enough for me to use. Don't let this turn you against trying the product if you have never had a problem with tampons being too long, I think the Diva Cup might work for you. However, I hope I saved others some money if you suspect you might have a short canal too. Another thing, if you have long nails...I want you to imagine having to \\"run your finger around the outer rim of your Diva Cup\\" to make sure you have the proper seal, this is while it is inserted mind you, during your period of course..ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It!","review":"I had discovered the joys of using softcup last year and I really liked it, but I found myself still rinsing them out and reinserting them. After doing this for multiple periods I knew I was ready to try diva cup. I can say that I really enjoy it! I had a hard time initially getting it not to leak (because I was putting it in wrong), but after a day of practice things are great and I can totally tell when it is time to empty it. No complaints, especially from my wallet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"Awesome product. Was skeptical at first but am so glad I bought it. Even recommended it to a friend!

It takes some getting used to, but once you're comfortable with it, this product is really amazing. There is very little to no leakage, you can leave it in longer than tampons, and you can't feel it AT ALL!! I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially women with light but long periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it","review":"I love the Diva Cup and the Diva wash! I use it every cycle and would never go back to tampons or pads. Love this product. I can't even feel it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The diva cup is amazing. I will never go back to tampons. I made the switch to cloth pads and diva cup this month and instead of having a full trash can and feeling yucky during my period I felt clean and my cloth pads were soft and no trash to speak of. I was scrubbed into a 14 hour surgery on my heaviest day and my diva cup didn't even leak. Everyone should atleast try this product, they won't go back :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life!..

I spend next to nothing on feminine products now (I got a bulk pack of panty liners about a YEAR ago and am just now running out!)... Even if you consider the cost of the cup & wash, it's way cheaper than what tampons & pads will run you for a year (way cheaper). Also, it's just nice not to have to worry about dealing with that stuff when you're at work or school all day.

Anything that goes in the oven on a cookie sheet goes in on these. I asked for this for Christmas and was thrilled to get it! I make freezer cookie dough that you can slice and bake, and when I want a cookie, I cut a slice, put it on my toaster silpat and bake. PERFECT! I've done onion rings, cookies, chicken, pretty much anything on this. My only concern is that I don't recall ever seeing any discolorations appear on the large silpats and I noticed that there were a few yellowed areas today after use. I am wondering if I overdid it and accidentally toasted too high a temp. Since I think this is a user error, I'm still giving it five stars. I've NEVER had a problem with any of our other mats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"I really like it.

DeMarle had placed a sticker on the 10E wrapper that identified it as a \\"Toaster Oven Silpat\\". I returned the oversized Silpat to receive one of the correct size, and once again Amazon sent me the DeMarle 10E - a repeat of the error that it was intended to rectify.

I have found that it inevitably elicits giggles. I enjoy reading this book with great emotion, shock, frustration, and a surprising twist at the end. I find that I like to pause before turning that final page. The illustrations are deceptively simple yet convey every emotion. This book reminds me of Mo Willem's Elephant and Piggie and Pigeon books. How these authors convey so much in so few words and simple lines amazes me. I highly recommend this book, it's great for read-a-loud time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story but . . .","review":"The story is really cute, and the illustrations are funny even of mother dog's expressions of concern. It has an ending I didn't expect and it was not predictable; a pleasant surprise. But,why would anyone write an amusing story like this one and deliberately misuse the English language? George and mother misuse the words \\"go\\" and \\"went\\" throughout the book. George \\"went\\" nine times in the book and really didn't go anywhere; he just sat there trying to bark. The usage of the word \\"go\\" by the mother is equally disturbing. For example the mother dog says: \\"Cats go meow\\" and \\"Dogs go arf.\\" What ever happened to the words \\"said\\" or even better \\"replied\\"? The English language takes a beating in everyday usage. At least the written word for children should be correct. I'm sure my grandchildren will find this book funny for it is a happy story. I would not have purchased this book had I known of the English faux pas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the 4 to 8 year old category","review":"I purchased this book for my son. After reading the customer reviews, I thought it was a pretty safe purchase. But after receiving it, we quickly found that the story was to easy to figure out and could not keep my son focused. It is a simple story meant to be read to two year olds. I also found the animation sloppy. Others may find it entertaining, it is all a matter of personal tastes. But I do not feel this book belongs in the catagory of 4 to 8 year olds. It is to short and not challenging enough for this age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"bark at you","review":"I liked the story, that's why I ordered the book, but I could have bought a used library book much cheaper than the shipping and handling charges at a local library book sale.

Dogs go arf. Now bark George. George went: oink\\". The use of \\"go\\" instead of say and \\"went\\" instead of said drives me crazy. I don't want my child to grow up thinking this is correct.

I read it to my son when he was little and it quickly became his favorite. He would even tell people all about George the \\"goofy\\" dog. Eventually he moved on to other books over the years. Then, shortly after his baby sister arrived, I quietly watched unnoticed as he brought out the book and read it to her! He told me later that he had \\"shared\\" the book with his sister.

They love the various animal sounds and figuring out what animal SHOULD be making that noise.

It includes some good footage and interviews with members of the beat generation, but its attempt to dramatize Kerouac's life are unfulfilling. The acting is sixth rate, and the actors themselves don't look much at all like Jack or Neal Cassady. I think it was a great idea to have an actor read passages from Kerouac's work, but even this manages to grate as the sentences are read melodramatically and contaminated by too much emotion. Kerouac didn't sound like that, nor, from what I have read, did he think like that.

Spencer has collected and described hundreds of North American and European superstitions, however, the book is lacking in that there is no background information given. Anyone interested in how the superstition developed will not be satisfied. Furthermore, there is no index, making it hard to cross reference superstitions involving more than one object. As there is also no bibliography, interested reader will find it impossible to trace sources.A far better collection is that offered by Claudia DeLys \\"A treasury of superstitions\\" which has a broader collection, delves into the history of particular superstitions and offers a detailed index and bibliography to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilligan's or Fantasy Island","review":"\\"Paradise\\" is actually the coast of Australia, where this 1989 made-for-TV adventure was filmed.

The scavenger hunt is enjoyable and the girls car is cute. I didn't know that steve carell was the cop who was after the girls. He was really funny. It's an all age film with an obvious happy ending. Their are very good moments, especially the night club scene and the ending scene. Now that was funny. It's amamzing how now Alexa Vega was in \\"Repo, the genetic opera\\" and Sara Paxton was in \\"the last house on the left\\" remake.

A repair shop inspected the TV and found nothing wrong but the bulb. I expected at least 5-10 years with out a problem after spending about 2 grand for a TV. But according to Mitsubishi it normal to spend $250 on a bulb every year.

Its often said that he was a consistantly good poet, without composing any real classic.

Almost everyone has voluntarily given up life in the real world to live in a virtual world. The technology is not plausibly described and it seems even less likely that so many people would actually enter the world.So much for the setting. The rest of the story is a love story. It may be based on Romeo and Juliet. I can't really spoil the ending, since I didn't get that far.

The first so-called 'Beginner' CD is much too difficult for the average beginner. It takes you through poses we never even touched on in the classes I've taken. Kathy Smith has you hold the poses too long and you have to use some props which means you have to stop and get things. The 'Intermediate' CD isn't much better but incorporates some poses that could have been on the beginner CD. At this rate, there's no way I'm ever going to get to the 'Advanced' CD. Wouldn't recommend this series unless you're at least at the 'Intermediate' yoga level."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing compared to the Finder's Stone trilogy","review":"I expected a lot from this book. I enjoyed the Finder's Stone trilogy greatly (*especially* _The Wyvern's Spur_), and was looking forward to seeing the characters again.Instead, I found a hackneyed plot and flattened characters. Alias and friends seemed to move like puppets, and the villain was never adequately fleshed out.Avoid this one and go back to the Finder's Stone trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step-down from the Finder's Stone trilogy","review":"In Azure Bonds, there was real mystery: what were Alias' origins, and who was Dragonbait? In Song of the Saurials, the intrigue continued with the mysterious Grypht, and the action was built to an epic scale, with the companions fighting gods and dragons. But everything is scaled down in Masquerades. Alias (who does not seem nearly as well developed as in past books) and the gang are confined to a singular, typical city (so it's not too epic), facing a typical, predictable villain (so it's not too mysterious). This book could have been converted into a cheesy Dungeons and Dragons adventure pretty easily, and that's not a good thing. If Novak and Grubb want to return to these characters, how about they do it through another well-thought out, interesting, mysterious trilogy? I just don't think they expended the same effort on this \\"little Harpers book\\" as they have in past efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"A book with Dragonbait and Olive has to be good.But this was great!I liked the plot.All the supporting characters were well-made and since Westgate isn't in many books it was nice to read about it.Alias did behave stubbornly but nobody's perfect.I recommend this book to all interested in the Forgotten Realms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper understanding of myself and my sons","review":"My wife left this book on my desk for me to read. It was more informative and helpful than I could have imagined and educated me on how to be a better father, not only in caring for my three sons but also for myself.I was especially drawn to the emotional development of boys that gave me a deeper understanding of what my sons are going through as they develop into young men. Now I feel more confident in my parenting decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative guide","review":"From Boys to Men is well written and very informative. Any criticism that the book denegrates women by \\"reducing\\" them to a caretaker role is preposterous.

I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reducing women to role of caretaker!","review":"I am stunned that this book has even been written. Why is this text not addressed to men? There are many women, I would say most, that take much better care of their husbands and sons than they do of themselves.

It is at that point that they will learn self-care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"In reference to complaints registered by other reviewers, I just want to point out that this collection only features Scorsese's films for Warner Brothers - which is why, for example, seminal Scorsese films like \\"Taxi Driver\\" (Columbia) and \\"Raging Bull\\" (MGM/UA) are not included in this box. On the other hand, \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\\" \\"After Hours,\\" and \\"Who's That Knocking\\" are all terrific, and have never before been released on DVD in any form, making this an absolutely essential purchase for fans of the director (if the special editions of \\"Mean Streets\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\" were not inducement enough!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, and you get what you pay for","review":"i bought this because i didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for a plug,but, i got what i paid for.won't stay in place without a clip.seems to be very brittle plastic, not soft at all, so i feat that if anything bumps into it,in the cold weather, it will just likely shatter.would recommend a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"I've used my cup for one period and wish I had known about cups a long time ago. It's kind of hard to figure out a technique and I think it's probably different for everyone. The instructions say to turn it once but I couldn't turn it at all. I found that tugging and pushing on it a little did the trick. Sitting on the toilet didn't work either, for me it's the standing position. And even these techniques didn't always work as it would leak. Overall I love my new cup and would recommend them to anyone.

I've tried Instead cups before but they are pretty flimsy and you have to keep buying them as they are one time use. I got the Diva Cup size 2 and it fits fine. Keep the directions handy the first few times you insert. For me, aiming for the tailbone was clutch (part of the instructions). The first couple days of my period I usually have to empty (or \\"dump my cup\\" as I tell my husband) 2-3 times during the day. By day three I usually just empty it twice, morning and evening. I've never had it leak day or night, and I was paranoid and wore a panty liner. If I'm at home I'll rinse it out before reinserting (I can reach the sink from the toilet).

By me being overweight and suffering from fibroid tumors, my periods have always been very heavy. I would have to use two super-plus tampons at one time, plus a pad for backup. And working in customer service (sitting all day and not being able to go the ladies' room as often as needed) created a problem. With the Diva Cup, I can make it thru an entire work day without worrying about any leakage. And to those of you who have problems cleaning the cup in a public bathroom, I have a word of advice: take some soapy papertowels in the stall with you beforehand. Dump the contents in the commode and clean and dry the cup with the papertowels, then re-insert. Problem solved! Then when you're at home, you can give the cup a more thorough cleaning. I'm so glad I've found this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might be the best (girl) thing ever...","review":"I'm 38 and never had kids, so wondered about how the #2 would fit. Fits perfect. I've worn it kickboxing, cross-fit, running for miles. I do have to say, when doing minute after minute of jumping jacks or jump rope, I have to squeeze the kegels a little - gravity is a bitch. Otherwise, I never feel it and have gone longer than the 12 recommended hours simply because I forgot. Twice a day! When I get up and when I go to bed! All in the privacy of my own bathroom/shower (super easy in the shower)! No more accidentally peeing on your string (I hate that)! No more \\"I forgot to bring more tampons\\"! No more boxes and boxes of tampons stored away! No more spending money on tampons!

I have tried it over and over again, but it is so uncomfortable. Even after trimming the stem completely off, I can feel the bottom of the cup ready to protrude. If it's pushed in any further, it doesn't create a good seal and leaks or doesn't open at all. After doing more research, I have learned that the Diva Cup is the longest of all the mentrual cups; I wish I had bought one of the shorter versions. At this point, however, I'm hesitant to invest in another brand. Part of the reason I did this was to save money. What a huge waste of money!

The fit is not the same at all. I can not feel the Softcups, and they NEVER come out before I take them out. The Divacup literally falls out. I am inserting it past the pubic bone and turning it to make sure it is open. It stays for about 10 minutes and then is hanging out of my body.

It's my first time using a menstrual cup, and all I can say is I'll never go back to using pads or tampons again. I highly recommend watching the instructional videos out there, like the one on YouTube. It really prepared me for using this and I haven't had a bit of trouble inserting or removing, it's really easy. So far I haven't had any leaks or problems and it's really comfortable, can't even tell it's there. Also, no drying out or irritation like with tampons or pads. I will say you must be comfortable with yourself and your nether region for this to go smoothly, but it is definitely a great alternative to the traditional methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish i knew sooner...","review":"Being a gyno-cancer survivor, id been forced to take a second look at my feminine product ingredients. I didnt know tampons contained chemicals like bleach in them. I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole assortment of eco,chemical free, comfortable alternatives. i dont remember why i chose the diva, but i do remember thinking how lite and soft it was after i took it out the pack. When i first had a chance to try it on...whalla! fit like a charm without any discomfort or irritation. Insert and out does take a lil practice, but i intend to get some years worth out of this product. hope this helps with your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROSS","review":"In a perfect world this product would work great for everyone. I'm squeamish but even if I wasn't this is still gross. No one wants to handle their own blood. I'm sticking to tampons, I don't care if they're not as safe.

It was not very difficult to insert the first time, but for me it got harder each time and messy. I wore it the first day with no leaks or issues which was great. But then when I slept with it, I couldn't help waking up thinking, how is this thing going to defy gravity and not spill out. Lo and behold, the next morning, SMH, you know the rest. Good thing I use back up at all times or it would have been a huge disaster. I'll just stick with what's always worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes some getting used to","review":"Make sure to take some time getting used to it, to make sure it fits properly or it will leak.

I had to find which fold would work for me and after using the punch fold, it is much easier to insert. If it were'nt for the cramps, I wouldn't even know it was \\"that time of the month\\".

It really has to be worn like a cervical cap, even though the instructions say it's not one. If you jog or run, it slides down, and I had to readjust it every 2 hours. And I don't have any \\"pelvic floor\\" issues, either!It took a week to figure out how to use it--my bladder feels pinched when I'm wearing it (I know, I know--how does a bladder feel pinched?) But the feeling never goes away.And then, it still sometimes leaks, because I can't get the seal right, no matter which way I insert it.If you're an eco-friendly gal, go for the lotus pads or the luna pads--both are good,reusable cotton pads. And try the organic tampons--unless your anatomy is perfect, the diva cup is not a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"I tried this product because I was sick of leaking tampons and having to change them every hour or so at my heaviest. I had no problems inserting the Diva cup properly. It was less comfortable to me than a tampon just because I could feel it. It did help some what when I cut the bottom tip all the way off.I was disappointed that I still leaked a little and found the process of removal and washing to be quite disgusting. It would not work at all in a public restroom. I purchased this in hopes that I would be able to go more than 6 hours between washings but that was not possible. So to date, I have not used it again since. I may try it again during swim season because I hate those long strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice alternative","review":"It was strange to get used to at first; putting it in, taking it out.

I have spent the majority of my life worried about leaks and stains on clothes. I have a heavy cycle for twice as long as most people.

I was worried that it would leak, and that it would be really inconvenient in general. I have to say though, that I had absolutely no problems at all! In fact, I had zero leakage (less than conventional tampon methods), and it is so comfortable I didn't really feel it at all once I had it in correctly. I had no limitation on activities (sleeping, working out). I love the fact that I am not using chlorine laden tampons anymore and thus not putting something harmful in my body. Also, the fact that I am no longer contributing to unnecessary waste is an added bonus. Great item! I would totally buy this again and recommend to family/friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work","review":"This item was very uncomfortable: difficult to insert, difficult to remove, and did not do its job, either. I tried it a few months in a row, but since it never worked and was so uncomfortable, I gave up.

Therefore, it wouldn't stay in place and became uncomfortable after an hour of wearing it. i tried multiple times to get it work but i just couldn't so i gave up for that cycle and maybe i will give it a shot next cycle. It is large but if you fold it and wet the rim it's goes in pretty easily. I followed all the directions about turning it 360 degrees and pushed it as far in as i could but i still just could not get this thing to work. Of course then i think there's something wrong w/ me b/c i couldn't get it to work. So if your up for a challenge and really looking to try something new maybe give the cup a shot. I'm still up in the air about it but hopefully i can get it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This product is such a waste of money.

Much cleaner than pads and tampons. I never have to worry about leaking or taking enough tampons with me when I go somewhere. I'm saving so much money, too. It's pretty easy to put in and take out. I cut the stem as it stuck out and made it feel awkward. My son was a big baby and so I think that's why after walking with the cup in it starts to slip down. It won't slip out, but the bottom of it pokes out a bit and it's awkward feeling. But tampons felt awkward at first, too. Even so, I find it much healthier to wear than tampons and more fresh than pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!","review":"Wish I would have known about this 30 years ago!

It is easy to get in. It doesn't leak. You can't feel it once it is in. But when it is time to come out....forget it. Even with a good seal it rides up too high. The stem is not at all helpful to get it out because it is too short and not really something you can grab on to.It took an hour to get it out, and you couldn't pay me to try it again and risk going through the heroics and effort it took to get that thing out.I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1 because it did deliver in every area except for being able to get it out. If everyone's first try is like this and there is just a learning curve to getting it out, then the company needs to put a warning to that effect on the instructions so the user is prepared. This was a huge dissapointment because it seemed like such a good way to reduce the trash/garbage I create. I really wanted this to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"I am so glad I bought the diva cup. I wish I had been using this for years.

I contacted Diva Cup and they said \\"Due to the nature of the product, we do not accept exchange or refund.\\" What? So, you have to depend on their recommendation for the size, and even if you follow the directions COMPLETELY (They sent me the long version of the directions and that was exactly what I was doing), they will not exchange. I contacted Diva Cup again, and they said that I should try doing Kegel's because childbirth probably loosened my muscles! Thankfully, Amazon's AMAZING customer service helped me out.

I have tried to contact \\"customer service\\" at Diva Cup with no response by them. Obviously, they don't care what happens once their product is sold.

They really should think about suggesting some other considerations in determining the appropriate size. I am not sure that childbirth or age are good determining factors anyway. The vagina is a very elastic organ. Unless you have had a bunch of children, I am fairly certain that most stay just about the same size and shape as pre-childbirth.

But David Schwartz has produced a well-researched, carefully documented, clearly written historical account of Las Vegas casino culture from its inception in the early 1930s to the present. His carefully contextualized work shows how changing currents in American cultural life and leisure preferences shaped the style, architecture, and budgetary considerations of those who aimed to profit from casino ownership in an improbable desert environment. One learns from his book of the risk involved in such investments, and how the famous Las Vegas strip has always rested on unsteady financial and political pylons. Finally we have a solid, fascinating historical account of the casino industry and its consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"Not that great.

I was very disappointed. This book gives very few details on what is a very complicated subject and also manages to give too much information on some very obvious points. I was also disappointed with the photographs. A lot of them were the same in pose and lighting and, although I do understand that the author is doing a series of non-nude photographs with capes, those photos do not belong in this book. The lighting diagrams give very little information and the size of those diagrams and the size of the some of the print take up an inordinate amount of the pages. This book is a very quick read with little information. Had this been an article in a photography magazine I would not be complaining so loudly. For the price of this book however, I feel that the author has let us down."},{"rating":"1","title":"selling soap","review":"You wont find any great secrets to photographing the nude in this book.

I know this was something I had to learn the hard way and I still struggle with this subject a great deal! Wendy's insights were logical, relevent and helpful and I think just about anybody would find this an interesting read, AS or not.My favourite thing about this book was its positivity and constructive outlook. It asks the important questions and it gives thorough and sensible answers. Buy it, read it, share it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound Insight on Friendships","review":"Excellently written!! Wendy Lawson indicated us the specifics of friendships in such an organized way that I may be able to take what she is driving at on board. It seems like she shows us various kinds of friendships exist. Since most Auties/Aspies suffer from other people, I feel she is trying to encourage them to enjoy life in order to gain happiness. In this respect, this book may be highly recommended for Auties/Aspies because lots of them including myself have found it so hard to make close friends. If you ask me, our close friends can see through both the pros and cons of us. Even if we have personality clash with each other, that never means our friendships are over, so to speak. Simply put, being a yes man doesn't make sense at all. Besides, that's too superficial to accept!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the light-hearted","review":"I was required to use this text for my graduate courses in Quantum Mechanics. It is by far the worst text on the subject I have ever had the misfortune of using. Hecht's presentation of subject matter is disorganized and often incoherent. His ability to explain with any amount of clarity even the most elementary principles is lacking at best, and his command of the English language is absolutely appalling for someone of his education. The author claims that this book is \\"self-contained and can be used by students without a previous course in quantum mechanics.\\" Don't believe it! This text may be useful for someone who has already taken a few grauate courses in quantum mechanics, but is utterly useless for learning purposes.

Chicken backs seem the form a huge portion of her dogs' diets.Chicken wings and backs alone are WAY too bony.She is doing it to be as cheap as possible and in the process is feeding an incomplete diet.Your dogs' poops should NOT be white and chalky- that is a sign the dog is eating too much bone.It should also be mentioned somewhere in the book that raw pork can cause trichinosis and that freezing it for a month first will prevent this. She just recommends raw pork.

It's a short, easy to read book which emphasizes the health benefits of fresh, raw food without scaring anyone with the minutiae of dog nutrition. She also reminds owners that vets may well be hostile to the idea of raw feeding, tells why this probably is, and how to educate them.With all the dog food recalls, even of \\"good\\" brands, many of my puppy people are interested in the raw diet. I'm going to recommend this book as an explanatory guide. Even if they don't end up feeding raw, it may at least encourage them to give their poor kibble-fed dogs some raw meat/bones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide for Raw Feeders","review":"Relaxed and funny, this book is a great guide for dog owners new to raw feeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Dof Food; It Easy for You and Your Dog","review":"This book is a great starting point for first time Raw feeding.

It is, however, both a solid introduction for beginners and a good companion for the more advanced. Watching someone put on chain mail and plodding through the desert sun helps put things into perspective, as well as seeing all the locations and settings. It nicely demonstrates how the Arab civilization was invaded by the barbarian hordes - ironically this time at Rome's beck and call - and how they needed to find the military organization and leadership to deal with the problem. Certainly worth spending an evening infront of the television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one if you are looking for a good balance.","review":"The Introduction says it all: \\"We make no pretensions of extending the bounds of scholarship\\": they certainly don't; the supporting documentation appears on the weak side. \\"For those who want to read more there is plenty\\": correct! Skip this one if you are looking for a serious, well-supported, well-balanced and unbiased treatment of the subject. The style is definitely too journalistic; some of the opinions expressed by the authors (e.g. on the Church, on the French, on the aristocracy) are patronising and give the appearance of having been poorly researched.

I love, of course, rereading my favorite books and poems, but with a tale like that of Orpheus and Eurydice, I'm simply not looking for the same story. I want a new perspective, not only a retelling, but a reshaping of the myth. Orr puts his own spirit into what many of you may know of as the tragic lives of the two lovers. He writes, however, from a place unlike most before him. With the same joy as seeing a film remade with exceptional talent, I read Orr's work with excitement and pleasure. It's not the same story.

After a little use I could not tighten the screw enough to hold the cutter assembly in place.After cutting one hole the cross bar that holds the cutter developed play where it fits into the center mandrill. This allows the cutters to chatter badly.There is a safety nut on each end of the cross bar the keeps the cutter assemblies from spinning off should they become loose.

The viewpoint is definitely biased towards the female side of what intimacy should be like which I feel is unfair to men and not helpful. Men are men, thank goodness. The author also prescribes to the idea that no one will love you unless you love yourself, that you have to get past your fears of intimacy before you will find the right person and that commitment phobes are people with \\"issues\\" (as opposed to being just your standard every day jerk).

The chapters about \\"ambivalence\\", high expectations, and identifying \\"commitmentphobes\\" were very helpful and informative. I've done a lot of self-discovery while healing from divorce, which I believe helped me process the information in this book.

Unfortunately, too many times I hit yet another mistake in the book that causes me to have to figure out the problem by working around the book, not with it, or worse, I may not be certain I've even understood the concept to due several contradictions between the conceptual material and the examples/exercises.Learning a database language by unlearning mistakes in the training material is not the right way to learn anything.I have the third edition.

This book, although containing the required information, is very badly organized. Examples are given before you can try them out, since you build the tables at a later stage. The \\"hour\\" discussing normalization is simply misleading and shows an example completely unrelated to the normalization rule it is supposed to apply. I used Oracle SQL and found that a lot of the examples didn't work in Oracle SQL environment.

He didn't need to spend 11 pages to explain this. In addition, Viddler tries to point out that no matter what you look like, you can still get that certain \\"someone\\" to become attracted to you and to fall passionately in love with you forever.

There are three emotional trigger points, so once you find someone you are genuinely interested in, you pay attention to (1) their gender identity; (2) their social self and (3) their ideal self. You merely have to identify what they're like and show that you appreciate them completely. In our society, we are all so concerned with our appearances, especially women, that we don't pay enough attention to the other person in this specific way, and we miss out on love.

I did like how the author went from one characters story to the next. It took a long time to find out the main character Eliza's secret and then the book seemed to rush to the finish. Historically I am sure the book is accurate, but it did not seem like the depression years really affected the family. I also think there needed to be more of a romance between Gabe and Eliza.

But, as in every good book, nothing is as it seems. Everyone in the book is hiding something, either intentionally, or not.I thought this book was very well written. The author did a good job of describing the beginning of the Depression and how being a single woman with 3 kids to raise got along.

The main character Eva (AKA Molly) was a refreshing alternative to most young female characters one finds these days - smart, strong, but with all the imperfections of her youth.One thing I liked a lot was the fact that Rick Thunderbolt, who seemed at first like a token jock and a plot device thrown in to simply create an obstacle (he was even taken out by a convenient accident), comes back to become a mentor figure for Molly.Even as an (nearly) 18 year old, I liked this show a lot and am eager to see the second volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Watch!","review":"I absolutely love this watch.

The auger/pump does not have anything securing it to the base, it just sits there so it is very loose.

Well, this mit is definitely more flexible but not better for my hands. The heat has come right through on multiple occassions when I've picked up hot pans from the oven (like the Christmas Day Turkey in the roasting pan). I attribute this to the silicon being too soft and flexible. The weight of the pan handle just squishes it until it's very thing over your fingers and then the heat comes right on in. This always occurs around the edges/seams of the mit. Personally, I'm going back to the Orka mit. Yes it's not as flexible, but the point is being able to hold a hot pan and not feel like you're burning yourself. I've not had any problem with the Orca mit in grabbing any pan handles or edges. You just have to think about holding your hand in the right direction to grab it properly without fighting the glove."},{"rating":"1","title":"left me pretty unsatisfied","review":"I really wanted to like this silicone glove be I just have to say it is no good beyond a few seconds of heat protection.

I have burned myself more times than I can count with an old fashioned oven mitt, after they have gotten damp when a lot of baking is being done. I baked cookies today at 350 degrees, put on my new Lekue Silicone Super Flexible Oven mitt and took out the first batch. Before I could finish taking off the 12 chocolate chip cookies of the sheet my hand was really warm. For supposedly being heat resistance to 575 degrees, 350 should have been a breeze. Needless to say I am disappointed. I will continue to use them, since I do a lot of baking and my regular oven mitts get wet after I rinse off the sheets, but would not recommend them to friends. I also purchased a silicone oven mitt from my local grocery store (HEB, in Texas), it was their store brand, for my daughter. I tried her mitt and although being rated to only 450 degrees worked much better than the more expensive name brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flexible, but not very insulating","review":"Silicone has its advantages. The material itself is heat resistant, durable, and washes easily. And these mitts are certainly more flexible than most in this category of product. However, it must be noted, silicone is just not a good thermal insulator. You can't hold anything hot for than five seconds and you start to feel the heat come through. The cheapest pair of cotton mitts will protect your hands better than these high end silicone things. And given the extraordinary high price of silicone products, you could afford to buy new cotton oven mitts every year and still spend less than you do on these.

Alas, and quite surprisingly, the movie lacks some of the lunacy and fun that you might expect. This south of the border epic introduces a renegade James and a maniacal Frankenstein (who is experimenting on poor locals), and then keeps them apart for much of the film's running time. Starting as a fairly routine western, the movie goes seriously off-course with one of the most annoying love stories that you're likely to encounter. A plucky Mexican heroine (who was scandalously killed in real life) whimpers and cringes throughout and yet remains an irresistible love interest for the rough riders. The final confrontations finally elicit viewer interest, but (for my taste) it is all rather tame and uninspired. The title shouldn't be the most interesting thing about your movie!

I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy.

When our son picks it out for a bedtime story we usually try to convince him to pick something else. It is really long and the story is very strange. The vehicles are in some strange state of semiconsciousness and it is unclear whether the humans in the story are aware of this. There is a lot of completely unnecessary detail, and the vocabulary in the book is too advanced for young children. Having said all that, my son (4) likes it. But if you are going to be reading it to your kids, pick something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Buddhist Yoga","review":"The Tibetan Book Yoga is a beautifully designed book, very easy to read, and Western oriented in its informal and practical style.

I read this book at the same time I was reading Maslow's paper on human needs. The two dove-tail quite nicely.For me, I'll put it this way. Each of us have about a dozen or so moments in our lives where we feel like me just made a huge stride forward; like some of life's biggest questions just got answered, and from that point, the world is never the same. It's a paradigm shift. We've all had them. This book was probably my most significant paradigm shift in my 34 years. It occurred to me that probably 90% of humanity goes through life asleep at the wheel, or dozing off. When you learn, and MASTER (that is key - mastery) the art of persuasion, you will then be able to master your own life, and thus speed up personal growth.

The only \\"evidence\\" that Hogan provided in order to support his arguments (throughout the entire book) were simulated dialogues between an imaginary person and a Master Persuader. The dialogues, however, were poor. They were not realistic or informative.

Finally, there is a breath of fresh air on the American political scene, with a voice we can understand, because it is our own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Third Party politics is vital to our nation","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Robert Roth does an excellent job of entertaining and informing the reader on the need for more choices in our own political system. He shows how, in spite of all the hype that we are the greatest democracy on Earth and export democracy around the world, but in fact the US is really one of the least democratic nations when it comes to our own political and governmental systems. The iron grip of the two party system virtually guarantees that no new ideas or voices can be heard in any political forum or debate and how this is to the determent of the nations as a whole. He gives wonderful examples of what third parties and what the Natural Law Party in particular can do to bring a fresh and vital breath of new, simple and proven ways to look at our nation's challenges. And he does so in a very entertaining way!

Stick with previous versions.","review":"When my IE6 kept crashing and nothing could fix it, I backed up my data and re-formatted my drive.Reinstalled norton and it crashed 1/2 way thru installation.Then, I couldn't totaly remove it.Tools on symantec website don't totally clean up the mess their installation makes.After a 2nd reformat and reinstall of XP, I said,\\"Enough\\".I'll lose out on several monthso of my anti-virus subscription, but if norton won't install, there's no other choice but use someone else's utilities.I used norton for over 10 years.Time to give the new V-COM Fix it 6 or Systemsuite 6 a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE THAN THE HOLOCAUST","review":"This is by far the most buggy, speed draining, useless garbage software ever written. Symantec has slowly morphed into a junk software vendor interested only in selling you useless gimmicky crap that breaks your computer. I am a computer technician and I see over 1,500 computers a year. Of the ones with this software installed, (perhaps 75 or more), NONE of them has functioned properly with this sloppy monstrosity on it. Symantec thinks since they own the trademark Norton, people will buy it's software because of it's once well-earned name recognition. And alas; they are right. The mindless masses eagerly shell over an exorbanent amount of money to adopt a little yellow box with the word NORTON on it, but beware - don't even get the BOX close to your computer. There should be a class action lawsuit against this crooked company. Anyone who gives this product good reviews either is in a persistent vegetative state or works for Symantec. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful manual","review":"This is a book I have been looking for a long time.

Sorry to hear about the previous reviewers bad experience with that.-the DVD was made in 2004 so some of the exact pro-tools functions look different on the screen. But the concepts are rock solid and up to date. I found it to be very helpful, I'm an intermediately experienced home recording engineer/producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in DVD Player","review":"I purchased this for my husband to use to learn more about digital recording and mixing. I did not know until after he tried to play it that it requires a PC and Quicktime. My husband is not computer savvy and even though I installed Quicktime on my computer we had issues with the video freezing, etc. even though I am computer savvy. He is frustrated that he cannot use it without a computer.

I had the vinyl album until I gave up all my vinyl about 18 years ago(what a mistake).This album is filled with classics that were used for many advertisements for the past 40 years. I'm writing now because I was astonished to hear a new advertisement on the radio yesterday that featured one of the songs from this album. Not only are the songs great examples of 60's techno-pop, and not only was this a groundbreaking album for its sound, but the songs are actually fun and delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cup of coffee","review":"This is an inexpensive, simple , easy to use single cup coffee maker. If you only need one cup at a time (my wife doesn't drink coffee), this machine is great. Takes a couple of minutes to make a pretty good cup of coffee, no paper filters and easy cleanup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee for a Great Price","review":"I bought this to save counter space in my dorm room and am so glad I picked this one.It makes a really good cup of coffee in only about 6mins.My only problem with it is it doesn't fit most of my mugs and sometimes I have to brew into a smaller mug then pour into my own.Also, the coffee won't stay hot for long. It brews the coffee hot enough, but because the bottom part doesn't have a warmer, it won't stay hot if you wait to drink it.Perfect if you want a 1-cup coffeemaker.I wish they made a larger model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like coffee that tastes like burned plastic.","review":"This coffeemaker has the same drawback of most one-cup coffeemakers. It is plastic inside and out, and when it heats up, it smells of burning plastic. On top of this, the coffee has a burned-plastic taste to it - which is never a good thing.If the possibility of plastic chemicals leaching into your coffee isn't enough to deter you, consider the slow brewing time. It takes longer to brew one cup of coffee than it takes me to boil water on a stove and make the coffee with a French press. I had hoped having a small automatic maker would make my life a little less hectic getting ready for work in the morning, but the long wait and plastic-tasting coffee end up being a waste of my time (and my money).I'm sticking to the French press."},{"rating":"1","title":"inexpensive but problematic","review":"I bought this unit to replace my Black and Decker brew-n-go, only because it had gotten old and I wanted to try something different.This unit is inexpensive, very compact and looks quite nice, but it has some problems:1. It takes it a long time to make the coffee2. The coffee, to my taste, is not very good3. It does not have an automatic shut off, which seems dangerous to me (the black-n-decker has an automatic shut off)4. The unit REALLY heats up when it makes the coffee, making me really wish it had an automatic shut off5. You cannot use a large size mug ... which is a problem for me, because I don't like small mugs.So, I tried it but I'm not planning on not using it. I wish there were more options for single-cup coffee makers that don't require pods. I'm going back to the Black and Decker or to using single-cup filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"This coffee maker works perfectly. The only thing is that the coffee could be warmer but it's easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this coffee maker","review":"The product details state that many size cups can be used for this machine. The only one that fits is the one that comes with the coffee maker. I also read that it comes with an extra base for larger mugs. It did not come with an extra base. The height of the mug can only be as high as the one included with the coffee maker. I purchased this thinking I would be able to use my \\"favorite\\" mug, but I can not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toastess Coffee Maker","review":"I can't recommend this personal size coffeemaker. By the time the water has filtered through the coffee is cold in the cup. Even starting with a warmed cup doesn't help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little 1 cup coffee maker","review":"This little machine that I bought through Amazon is perfect for me. It is the second one I have had and it makes a perfect cup of coffee. Unfortunately it does not have an automatic turn off which is not good for anyone who is forgetful - who isn't? There have been occasions when I am thankful I didn't burn the house down."},{"rating":"2","title":"single cup coffee maker","review":"I have had this product for months now, it is the best little coffee maker I have ever had, It takes up little room and makes a good cup of coffee anytime you want one. This was well worth the low cost and has lasted the longest of all my one -one coffee makers Definetly dependable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This product makes lukewarm water and produces weak, undrinkable coffee. When I say \\"lukewarm\\", I really mean that the liquid coming out of this machine is not even close to hot. Why bother? Ridiculous.Not expensive, but you get what you pay for. If you like a good cup of coffee, I advise you to ante up for a machine that will work. I am sending this one back and will be purchasing a REAL coffee maker.The lucky thing is that I bought this from Amazon, where they always make good on the things they sell. The return is painless, and they are even paying for the return shipping, so I am not out any money. However, the whole thing has been a waste of time, and now I have to make an extra trip to the post office."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 yaers and still working","review":"It's very good for the price. The only thing that scared me 2-3 times in 2 years is when I tried to turn it off with wet hands I felt electric shock on my hand, so I try to be careful when I turn it on and off.Other that that, I love it! I've been using it 2x a day for 2 years and still works as new. It's quick and handy, as I'm the only coffee lover in my family it's perfect. Not to many dishes to wash, except filter and coffee cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"We needed a new one cup coffee maker. My husband drinks one cup a day. Our Black and Decker one finally gave up the ghost. Most of the reviews were favorable so thought we would try it. Pretty disappointed. It is very slow - takes forever to brew one cup and then it is pretty noisy in the final minutes. Think we will look for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slow slow","review":"It takes 7 full minutes for 1 lukewarm cup of coffee. It accomodates 1 size cup and there was no extra base as stated. I donated to the local thrift stote. At least I got a tax write off for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this to save counter space and make just one cup of coffee at a time. It works well and the coffee is hot enough. To make sure after reading some reviews about the temperature, I rinsed the mug in hot water first to make it warm before using. The only problem which is slight is the small amount of splashing when it's dripping into the mug. It really should have a cover with a small hole in it to prevent this. I take a narrow piece of aluminum foil and just scrunch it around the upper part of the mug and no spills. I recommend this product as a good product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Cup Coffee Maker Still Tickin'","review":"It is a one cup coffee maker and does just that. Nothing fancy. It is rather slow and splashes a little if you use a regular size coffee cup. I do think that it makes quite a good cup of joe though. Probably about the best bang for your buck if this is all you need. I am satisfied with it.Just an update 12/2011. I still have this thing, guess it has been about 3 years now. It still works well, and has faithfully produced an untold number of cups of coffee for me. The screen filter is still in tact. No complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lasted a little over 3 months...","review":"It worked fine for the first few months, then the brew began to leak a little from the bottom while brewing.
