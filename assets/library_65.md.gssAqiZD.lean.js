It's about what adds up to be a bad bank robbery with everyone shooting each other up at the end. I really thought the accents of both McCradie and Denisof trying to do Russians was bad. McCradie is Irish isnt he and Denisof is like British..no, I'm not buying it for one second.

Unfortunately, Alyson is the ONLY bright spot in this movie and there was not even enough of her. It was truly painful to watch at times. Everyone else's acting was atrocious. Jennifer Esposito should have her Guild card revoked for her performance. The story was awful, the script worse. If you're an Alyson Hannigan fan, watch it once for her performance.

Besides that the movie was horrible. I found it hard just to pay attention. The only part of the movie that had an affect on me was when Alyson Hannigan's friend in the movie died and Alyson Hannigan was destroyed, the flashbacks of them were so heartbreaking. I felt Alyson's performance in that scene was the only thing that had me. Alexis Denisof's fake russian accent was atrocious.I rented the movie only for the fact that I saw Alyson Hannigan was in it.

This is a very underrated film, it may have its flaws but I found the performances of the 3 female leads good enough to make it a reasonably good film, and viewers should take in to consideration the fact that this is only Gigi Gaston's second attempt at directing. I was glad to see Alyson Hannigan in a role that required more dramatic range than \\"Buffy\\" or \\"American Pie\\", I would love to see her in more roles like this but she seems to be mired in \\"Comedy\\" right now. The main flaw with this film is the poor editing, in watching this film I get the feeling that alot of good scenes were left on the cutting room floor.

The ending was sooo stupid. did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them... they just keep standing there. Like nothing is happening. I really haven't seen a movie this bad in... well... EVER!! Oh and Alyson Hannigan's acting was way better in My stepmother is an alien. I think she was about 13 in that role.

The gentle interplay between Garcia, Weir and Lesh reaches telepathic levels. 2. A lengthy, nervy Playing In The Band where Weir's rhythm guitar really shines. 3. A fast and furious Truckin' which emerges out of He's Gone -- the gearshift between them is one of my favourite segues. 4. A ghost-like Stella Blue, with Garcia in particularly tender voice. 5. Keith Godchaux. His piano-playing here is nothing short of superb: complex, jazzy, constantly shifting in mood (sounds like Keith Jarrett at times, and you know that's a good thing). Grateful Dead tours were like wine; some were always better, more highly sought after than others. As the last gig of 1973, one of the band's very best years, the first in the excellent Dick's Picks series proves to be vintage indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, rambling and lacking focus","review":"I would not recommend this CD for anyone who is not a dyed-in-the-wool \\"dead head\\". Based on the stellar recommendations below, I purchased it (having owned a number of Dead LPs in the past). I found the long rambling jams to lack focus. It seemed as if the players had fallen asleep and that their instruments played on without them. Then at some point, the band wakes up and decides, \\"Oh yeah, we better change key and while we're at it, let's try to improvise another song to death\\".If you want a Grateful Dead CD that is live but with a different edge, try Reckoning, where the music is played accoustically (Unplugged before that existed) and this tempers their tendency to try iprovising every possible combination of musical theme in each song, as they did on this CD.In summary, Great band, good songs, long unfocused jams that don't seem to go or get anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Being new to the Grateful Dead these days can be rather daunting, they have so many albums and such a long history. I bought this album only after reading numerous reviews. What a huge disappointment!The tracks are weak and the arrangement of tracks is extremely poor -- they all run together and sound similar. I got tired of listening very quickly. This is an album that shows no depth, no intensity and very little diversity. I listened to it twice and that was all I could stand.Being new to the Dead and hearing such great things about them I wanted to like it, I really did. But after listening to Dicks Picks Volume 1 I can only conclude there is a reason the Grateful Dead existed as long as they did, produced as many albums as they did, and had as few hits as they did. Judging from this album, they're an awful band.Many people claim the Dead were a great live band. This album is far from it. If you're not a Dead fan already this album will probably ensure you never will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING! THERE ARE BETTER DICK'S PICK'S AROUND!","review":"I thought I was going to love this CD, and I must admit it was quite enjoyable for awhile. After listening to other DICK'S PICKS, however, I came to regard this as just a so-so show and nothing to get excited about. The long PLAYING IN THE BAND is good but lacks the feeling of other versions and just sounds like a guitar practice session rather than some of the mind blowing versions from other concerts. The highlight (to me) was the NOBODY'S FAULT> JAM > OTHER ONE > JAM > STELLA BLUE which has some nice moments. For some reason though I feel less inspired from this than other \\"great concerts\\" from this band. DICK'S PICKS 23, for instance, runs circles around the professional-sounding but somehow lacking sound on this CD that should be taken out of the series and forgotten at least for awhile until other deserving concerts can be appreciated first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live Dead & tons of fun.","review":"I like this collection - CD #1 is \\"grate\\" and #2 can hold its own.

Big mistake! After like 2 hrs of walking the arch on my foot and ball of my foot started to hurt and ache. Walking became like a tedious chore and i wasn\`t sure what was the problem until i removed them. I found out that the rockports where designed with some support for your foot originally in the shoe design, and raising the heel was a bad idea. Doing so left no support at all for your arch. So be careful when using these or any heel inserts that causes your heel to lift. if you have a higher quality shoe and want more cushion opt for the entire footbed (even the cheaper flat gel footbeds work great). that way it won\`t just raise your heel but the entire foot is cushioned the evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another offensive turn of the screw","review":"Dershowitz argues that Jews ought to \\"preserve themselves\\" but not because they have been persecuted.

There was practically no plot and not enough meaningful interaction between the two main characters. In fact, they barely spoke to each other. I still can't quite figure out if there was actually a plot. It felt like there were large pieces that were missing or edited out.

The \\"lead character\\" comes across as an idiot when she comes across as anything at all, and the others aren't much more than names on the page.

I bought The Island based on those older books. Unfortunately this book simply doesn't stand up. The plot is threadbare. The characters are irritating (yet another book in the stupid-heroine genre).

She finds a skull hidden in the sand on the beach, and is very suspicious about this guy Keith and his buddies that are walking the very same stretch of beach.... and they're coming straight toward her and the spot that the skull was found.That's really all the farther I got in this one. The story just didn't hold my interest. Or rather, it might've if Beth wasn't freaked out about 'something' every-other second. She's too paranoid and too suspicious about what she found and started suspecting Keith and his buddies knowing or having something to do with the skull she found; and everything to do with who Keith was. It was just too dramatic and unrealistic for me.I thought this book would be a nice summer mystery I might dig into, but once I started, I knew it wasn't going to be as intriguing as I had hoped. I would say read another one. Anything by Lisa Gardner is worth the thrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story dragged","review":"I was glad I got this one from the library.

Let's move on!\\"I was also having trouble keeping track of the characters. There were a lot of different characters, none of them particularly memorable, and all with similar bland names. I even struggled to remember who the heroine was. The only thing memorable about her was that she spent most of her scenes trying to figure out if she had seen the skull or not. When she wasn't doing that, she faded into the woodwork.Sorry--just not enough to keep me reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"In The Island Beth Anderson goes on a trip to a remote island near Florida with her brother and her nephew. She finds a skull there and gets all freaked out, recalling a story about a missing couple. This leads her to investigate the situation in what turns out to be a convoluted mystery.The Island is a very flawed novel. For one thing, none of the characters are all that interesting, and it's hard to care about them, in particular the love interest that Beth develops with the mysterious manly man Keith. The plot holes in the story are too numerous to mention. The tension never fully develops, or perhaps it didn't matter because I could not get myself to root for or against any of the characters. In the end, this is a very forgettable novel.

I paid less than $5 for this - and it wasn't worth it. This dvd is so amateurish in both the quality and informtation. After each \\"mystery\\" they offer a conclusion, which often has nothing to do with what was just discussed. They claim outragrous things as fact with no evidence to support their claims. They make comparisons where none exists (for example, they spend a lot of time telling us how the 1920 bombing of Wall Street was \\"just like\\" 9/11). One of the \\"experts\\" spends all his time reading notes off his lap so you only see the top of his head. Rumors are presented as fact. Anyone who actually knows anything about these stories will find this insulting. I made it through the first disc but can't bring myself to start the second.

It delves into mysteries concerning crime, american history, mysterious occurences, and even babe ruth.

There are lots of legitimate ways of improving your own health, or the health of others. This is not one of them.

Being brand new to Reiki and knowing little about it I did learn a little something which is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars. If I had been more experienced or knew more about Reiki to begin with then the book would have been a real waste of time.

For example, the whole third is dedicated to the history of Reiki and the author's own path.But my main complaint is that you can't learn Reiki from it. The author states that to be able to use Reiki, you must first be go through the process called \\"attunement\\" and you need to attend a Reiki course to do that (or find a Reiki Master to get you through it). Supposedly, this process will open you up to Reiki energy and then (and only then) you will be able to use it for healing. How is it then \\"for beginners\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great case, but not for 3C","review":"This is a quality case for PDAs, soft leather, a feeling of durability.

So she doesn't believe in marriage and is living in sin with Gene Raymond: well, what of it? Takes more than that to be interesting, I'm afraid.

You will never see him under the same lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tasteless attempt at mocking the rich that wasnt funny","review":"This book attempts to satarize the elite English but trys too hard, it is unrealistic. Many schools have been forced to read it and I have not met one student who liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Descension of Decadence","review":"The author paints a poignant tale of immorality, Carnality, and Sordidness. The book teaches one of the hollow and shameful lives most of the wealthy live. Caught up in selfishness and materiality; they breath only to sate themselves. The top antagonist, Brenda Lost is one of the most loathsome characters I have ever read about. This story was published in the 1930's. However, it is as elucidating about today's world as it was then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Satire, Some Problems","review":"I read this book this past year in a University literature class, and I must say, Waugh is a first-rate satirist and easily one of the best in the twentieth century. The book is, as good satires are, bitter and darkly comical, and it builds in its ludicrousness. That said, the one troubling parallel Waugh draws (and he is by no means the only one to do so) is the association of money with depravity. Money is a tool -- it does not make people depraved any more than it makes them virtuous. It is up to the individual to choose the function of money; the individuals in \\"Handful\\" chose to corrupt their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Good Book With A Very Bad Ending","review":"The final section of A HANDFUL OF DUST feels as though it came from somewhere else, which apparently it did. This could have been such a fine book. As it stands, it is a disappointment of a novel best read as \\"how not to end a book.\\" EW should have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best by far","review":"I have read \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" and admired it greatly. I thought the characters complex and the insights into English society so lucid and complete that I felt that I could understand their motivations and wants.However \\"A Handful of Dust\\" is much more opaque. The characters are loathsome, without any redeeming qualities usually present in his other books. The book is sardonic and dry to the point of being sere. It is so arch that it becomes wearisome, a farce of malice and well-written cruelty.As usual the ending is anti-climactic, another flawed tying-up of loose ends. Waugh, though entertaining, is not one of the century's great novelists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satire is Supposed to be Funny","review":"Although this book is very well written as are all of Waugh's books, it is more invective than satire. Who cares about these people. Spend your time reading some Dickens---over and over again if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Waugh's best novel, and arguably the greatest English novel of the Twentieth Century. Can't add to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was Literally Balling","review":"I was lucky enough to hear Mr. Klaus read this story on a National Public Radio broadcast. This story follows the life of a man, who has recently lost his wife. The story is told through a series of personal and heartfelt letters to her. In the letters, the main character covers many topics, including his dreams about Kate, the pain he feels when he sees the items she left behind, and the anger he feels when he sees an old lady in the supermarket buying a bottle of booze, while he lost his kind and loving wife. Above all else, this is the story of a man trying to cope with his loss.

I had been looking for a book on the Lightning which would combine pictures and text to tell its story. Bodie's book is well written and shows his passion for the subject. It is well organized and there are many excellent pictures (including a color section) accompanied by wonderfully informative captions. If there is a fault with the book, it is that Bodie spends perhaps too much time on the period before the P-38 was developed. Background is important, but I felt that it was somewhat excessive. Still, this is a required book for any Lockheed P-38 Lightning fan's bookshelf. I struck up a correspondence with Bodie after reading the book and found him to be very friendle and helpful in my research on the P-38."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of great pictures and detailed history of the P-38","review":"Warren Bodie has done his research and brought together a wonderful collection of pictures of the P-38. There is a vast amount of detail, which sometimes becomes repetitive. Included are production and testing history, and some highlights of the P-38 operations in WWII. This book is not for the casual reader unless you just want to look at the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and Fabulous!","review":"Seriously - Brenda's music is sooo good. Some highlights:\\"Tease\\" (sometimes it sounds jealous, sometimes it sounds like a warning - great song)\\"Weave My Way\\" (the best love song I've heard in years)\\"Sweet Lullabye\\" (anthem for self-confidence, without being sappy or cliche)\\"Pretty Face\\" (a perfect song about the hurt of a bad relationship that was a mistake - again, without cliche and completely real and easy to identify)\\"In the Morning\\" (i dont know - this song just makes me feel good)This is such a great album.

I went to see Brenda in concert and heard some tunes from Crazy Happy and had to have it too! This has some incredible songs with dynamite lyrics. Tease is the first song on the album. It is just amazing what she can do with her voice and guitar. I could not stop listening to this cd for weeks.

I dont keep my credit cards inside the case, but for the who want, u can! Being short and simple : Its a must have for your E-115."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"This case offers only a little more protection than the case that comes with the Casio E-125. The same rigid cardboard-like material is sewn into the case to protect the screen. There is no extra padding. The soft leather is nice, as are the properly spaced holes so that you can use the PDA while it is in the case. But the added bulk of the case makes it impossible to fit the PDA into a jacket or shirt pocket. The little case that comes with the E-125 fits snugly around the PDA so that it still fits into these pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abstract and darkly passionate","review":"This record was a major challenge to both the traditionalists and the emerging avant-garde. Jeanne Lee was a pioneer of avant-garde singing, graced with a haunting, hypnotic voice. Ran Blake's piano explores the internal structures of harmonies with delicate colourations. The Newest Sound Around is an intriguing, strange mesh of piano and vocal sounds delivered with a passionate tenderness.The novel approach contrasts strikingly with the material: standards such as \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Lover Man\\", and traditional gospel such as \\"Motherless Child\\". But this is the great idea behind the album: new sounds will penetrate the unprepared ear more profoundly if wrought from familiar material.The album cover boldly proclaimed that this music \\"may well be the beginning\\" of \\"an enduring new wave in jazz styling\\". Well, by definition, no new wave can be enduring, nor should it be. Jeanne Lee remains one of jazz's most original, individual and compelling vocalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fleetwood Mac","review":"This earlier album is classic, essential Fleetwood Mac and one of the two albums that I would highly recommend~ the other being Rumours. I was a child when this music was released and these songs evoke wave after wave of visceral memory and associations.

Stunning clarity and gorgeous music. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new era","review":"This was the one that started it all.

Haunting lyrics and legendary guitar riffs. I even named my daughter, Alexandra Rhiannon, after this song.SAY YOU LOVE ME, and OVER MY HEAD are the other radio played singles from this CD.MONDAY MORNING is an FM radio frequency.LANDSLIDE and WORLD TURNING should have been radio staples.

If like me, you've been Rumoursed to death, this record provides a nice relief from all the overplayed radio hits; and showcases what was about to turn into a magical chemistry of five different musicians. The gorgeous subtle production that made the Buckingham Nicks record sound so buttery is also on \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" thanks to producer Keith Olsen. Christine McVie's voice is golden and Stevie Nicks offers up two of her best examples of songwriting: Landslide and Crystal. Never sounding dated, the collection of songs on this album goes down slow and easy and makes you long for a forgotten warm summer day from your childhood.Other highlights: the McVie/Buckingham classic collaboration World Turning and McVie's lost folk rock beauty Sugar Daddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditto.","review":"I second the sentiments of the August 25th fan below regarding Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The fact of the matter is that this band goes down in history BECAUSE of the addition of these two creative artists. Anyone who refers to them as \\"failed musicians\\" simply posts his ignorance up in neon for all to behold. Let's put it this way: Mick Fleetwood and John McVie had been at a while, going through the likes of Jeremy Spencer, Peter Green, anyone remember Bob Welch?, while Lindsay and Stevie had just started out. This album started it all. Not as many powerhouse songs as \\"Rumours\\", but still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"I got this about 3 years ago and my first impressions were: what a discovery!

Which is all right if you're planning a state dinner, but don't spend your money on this guide if you're planning anything cheaper than black-tie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This book certainly has a lot of different reception locations, but it could be one-quarter of the size if it didn't keep repeating the same locations 2,3,4,5,6 times in the same book (just in different section)! The reviews were also very blunt with no real description of the location. The author also gives only flattering comments to every location, some of which turn out to be no so nice at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intenet Wins and Free!","review":"I was disappointed in the book because of the duplications throughout. Most entries I had already come across on the web. It's also missing a big chunk of the wedding market that resides in the Frederick, Maryland area. It makes me wonder if this isn't just advertisements for those who were willing to pay to have their businesses listed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both of my children's favorite!","review":"Our now 7 year old LOVED this book when he was a toddler. Now, our 2 year loves it. I love reading it to him! The rhyming is fantastic but even better are the rhythms and sound effects in the book. The book crescendos and then gracefully ends. My little one knows most of the last words on each line and the sound effects. Rock-a rock-a rock-a rock-a sh! sh! This is the longest book he has the patience for but it does help him relax for bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bedtime story","review":"Fantastic book! Large pages (hardback book is 9x11 inches) with bright and colorful illustrations. There is SO MUCH to see on each page. It's very entertaining even as an adult to see what each character is doing as the story progresses. The rhyme and flow of the words is soothing and easy to read. A sample page: \\"Cars sway on the wooden track. Wheels go click. Wheels go clack. Glide across a plain so flat. Gently toss this way and that. Clickety-Clack! Clickety-Clack! Clickety-Clack!\\" We bought this because my then-2 year old son loved trains, but our daughter is now that age and she loves the story just as much, even without a train fascination. A favorite bedtime story for both kids (now 4 and 2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this book!","review":"I purchased the Kindle version of this book and it is horribly done. You can't even properly read the story and show your child the pictures. My daughter, 2.5 yrs old, was so disappointed in the delay of my reading and the confusion. There were multiple pages on each Kindle page, then repeat pages in poor quality. The words on the pages can't really be read and they have typed the words out for you to read under each scan of the book pages, but even those are confusing. It is exactly like the read it now \\"preview;\\" which I thought was just an issue with the preview. Otherwise this is an awesome story and I would love to buy it in the hardback version. My daughter loved the idea of a train going night night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bed time book!","review":"Love reading this to my 15 month old son. He loves the noises and pictures. I love the easy read rhyming format and the pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I like the rhythm for teaching our kid to read and not a book that I get tired of reading over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves it","review":"My 2 year old is on a train kick and asks me to read this book to him every night. The pages are heavily illustrated. He is always discovering new animals as we read through and has learned new words by asking what they are. Good bed time book for kids into trains!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version-- BEWARE!!","review":"Bought the Kindle version of this-- mainly with an interest to see what a kid's book looks like on a Kindle. The story is decent enough, but the interface is AWFUL!! It doesn't just read like a book. Two or three pages of the book (some randomly repeating) show up on each Kindle page and you have to touch on and enlarge each page to actually read it. Quickly tiresome to the average toddler. So, be warned. I wish I'd just have ordered the hard copy version. For the price of either, though, it's not that great a story-- ok story with pretty plain/uninteresting illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it had more than five stars","review":"My 20 month old grandson is into trains, so when I saw this book and better yet, read the reviews, I knew I had to get it. It did not disappoint! He runs around with the book saying \\"Night train, night train\\" and could have it read to him all day. We like to save it for bedtime since it's such a nice quiet book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book for bedtime","review":"This is my husband's favorite book to read to our daughter at bedtime. We had checked it out from the library and we all loved it so much that we purchased it from Amazon. The illustrations are really great and there is a lot to look at when our baby is old enough to be really interested in the pictures. The story is cute and it is a nice change from Goodnight Moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MOST amazing book! Must Read!","review":"Bought this book for my 2 year old daughter through a childrens book club. After reading it every night she knows the story. We can sit down with the book and she will read it to me, know when to turn the pages. She loves the story and the little choo-choo sounds that are in each story line. She loves the story so much she has memorized it. A must read for youngsters and it will keep their attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"I bought this book for my son who just turned 3.

Love to follow all the characters and find new things to talk about on each page. Illustrations are beautiful. Our 2yo loves this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating book","review":"I purchased this book for my son because of his fascination with trains. Not only is this book a must for train lovers, but also for any child who needs to get settled down with reading before bed. My son always seems to chose The Goodnight Train for last. I'm sure there is a reason for that. This book is very soothing and has minimal stimulation, which is perfect for getting my son to calm down for bed. The artwork is beautiful, and both child and parent can appreciate it. The whimsical rhyming feels like a lullaby, and helps to set the bedtime tone as well. I would consider this to be one of the most refreshing and comforting books since Goodnight Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review Of Kindle Edition - Beware","review":"I've never written a review of anything on Amazon until now. If you are considering purchasing the Kindle Edition of this book, please do not. It is simply one of the worst Kindle conversions of a book I've ever seen. The illustrations are poorly scanned, they tried to squeeze 3 - 4 book pages onto 1 Kindle page, and the text on the pages does not match up with the illustrations shown. Overall, the book is basically unreadable. I am reading it on an iPad (Kindle App) so there should be plenty of screen resolution and space to see this book.I'm sure it is a wonderful story in book form but I would caution anyone considering the Kindle Edition to avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is certainly a good book - however it should not be sold as a Kindle version as it just does not work at all well in that format. The illustrations are nearly illegible and the text has only part correlation to what is on screen at the time. Its really sub standard. To be honest I would ask for my money back if there was a way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"My daughter (age 2y) loves this book. It has a very sweet, simple rhyme which my daughter helps repeat with me. It also has very beautiful, fun illustrations which make it one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great train book!","review":"My 2-year-old son just got this for his birthday and loves it, along with Chuga Chuga Choo Choo.

His Mom says it has become a favorite and is now part of his bedtime routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible on Kindle Fire!!","review":"It is very hard to read on the Kindle Fire. The type is so small, you cannot read it. They have typed the words larger below, but is on a different page than the illustrations. I wish I could get my money back. What a waste!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this book","review":"I'm always looking for a good night time book for my son (2) and daughter (6 months). My son at two is in love with trains, and loves repeating the different train sounds that are cleverly derived in this book (\\"hush-a hush-a\\" and \\"sleeeep, sleeeep\\" to mention a couple). The story is simple, rhymes nice, illustrations provide a lot to find for a 2 year old. Overall, one of my son's and my favorite night time books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful bedtime story","review":"This sturdy board book is a wonderful bedtime story that I have read over and over with my grandson.

I received my copy within a few days and in time for everyone to watch it. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"dolphin-free fun","review":"This dvd is a recording of the stage production.Because i had seen the play before, i could translate it as if i was there.

These two men can play any character with such utter perfection you almost think there is more than two people in this movie.

You'll never stop laughing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tuna Christmas is a real thigh slapper","review":"Two versatile actors play a variety of colorful residents of Tuna, Texas.

Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Book by Great New Author","review":"What can I say? I loved this book! The characters--gotta love that Tally!--are so well-developed that I probably will find myself looking for them next time I'm in Boston. Great plot that kept me up at night. I kept telling myself, just one more chapter... Dynamic writing, real-life dialogue, a colorful cast of characters, and plot twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end are just a few of the reasons I've put the next Stiefel book on my \\"must buy\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston's Crimefighter","review":"Vicki takes the reader on a wild ride through Boston in her search to prove the innocence of one of her clients in her lastest book, BODY PARTS.

Can't wait to read another of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete letdown","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books I've ever read; a cliched \\"silence of the lambs\\" knock-off where neither the criminal nor the motives are believable. The author creates numerous suspects, never fully developing any of them, and then out of thin air chooses one of them to be the villain. An attempt to make the main character interesting by giving her an unusual occupation and bringing her into a relationship falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely average","review":"I should have seen a red flag when I noticed that one of the positive reviews on the back of the book came from her very own husband!All-in-all, this book was completely average. There was nothing that stood out about it. The writing wasn't that exciting, and the author introduces so many characters that I had trouble keeping them all straight. I didn't feel any of them were developed well either.Bleh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never trust a husband...","review":"Body Parts is a crime itself. Describing gory scenes doesn't make up for lack of plot or credibility. To me, it was easy to guess the murderer, but harder to guess what the obsession with the main character was. She is unbeliveable. Supposedly smart, yet can't fix a light bulb with the danger around her? The references to the drums were ridiculous. Please... I should have been worried when her husband's review was used on the back cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"E Best","review":"I have been using Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E body lotion for over 20 years and I wouldn't use anything else for a skin lotion or a healing agent for scratches, cuts, and blisters.

The songs are just not good... I don't even know really what to say. Listen, if you are buying this because you are hoping to hear more great songs like \\"Play my Funk\\", you WILL be disappointed. The only other good song was \\"Neck Wreck\\", and thats cause the beat is crazy. Whoever was managing Simple E, or behind her team should have payed more money for better production, also spent more time on the songs... I mean this album is just not good.

I was looking for something that looked good, protected my product but didn't add a whole lot to the size. Well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad...It may have been the particular case I had was defective, but my Palm kept sliding out of the case. I had this product for like 2 weeks and my Palm fell out 4 or 5 times. Fortunately, it happened when I was pulling my Palm out of my jacket, thus the unit fell back into coat pocket and the Palm was not damaged. I put the unit back in time and time again, trying to solve this dilemma, but could not do it. After 2 weeks, I reazlied I could not use the Dooney & Bourke Case without the risk of damaging my Palm, so I returned it.Again, it looks great and offers suitable protection for the Palm (especially the screen). My experience may have been an isolated one, but be careful: make sure the case holds the product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Teen Drama","review":"A series that shouldn't be taken seriously.

Things get complicated when Momo's \\"best friend,\\" Sai, makes her life miserable and tries to steal Touji for herself. Momo's only friend is playboy Kairi who begins to fall in love with her.The series is charming and although it is over the top, it's pure entertainment and has a strong message of friendship, forgiveness, and love.

This is SO much like the drama that I witness on a daily basis. Many girls here are extremely competitive - and one will stop at NOTHING to take another boy away from her best friend. They gossip about their best friends constantly.Having only a few boys on this campus, they think they are God's gift to the world (and they are not, unfortunately).To sum it up, the characters of this show are very immature, but that is how most teenagers are.

The illustrations are surprisingly good, the animation is not up to today's standards, though. On a positive note, there certainly is more truth and less embellishment contained in this than more up-to-date versions of Bible teaching \\"movies\\" or DVD's. Your child can certainly learn more Bible truths from this DVD than any other I've seen. It was produced in 1978 by the American Lutheran Church. It also contains a lot of material from both the Old and New Testaments on two DVD's. My daughter likes it - she's 3 years old. It would probably be more understandable to older children, though. Be prepared - it is not as exciting as something like Veggie Tales or Prince of Egypt, but there's more Bible content and the content follows the Bible much more closely. Certainly, a great value and worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.......","review":"These video's are rough. I am sorry but I bought this for my 2 year old and I am pretty sure she will not care to even watch them until she is like 8 or 9. They were put out in the late 70's and they do reflect it. I gave them 2 stars ONLY because they seem to stay close to the bible in content. But really dont even waste your 10 bucks. The animation and the dialogue are horribly stiff. There is nothing here to make a child interested in learning about the Bible, maybe one day when she already wants to learn about it but this video collection is certainly not going to instill any desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential symphonic prog. rock","review":"If you like this type of music, buy this disk... it's a masterpiece.

I shipped the carrier to Sherpa, figuring they would cut me some slack given the item was brand new and I was using it in good faith with a toy dog. I offered to upgrade to a better zipper, if available. Guess what? Not only did they not help me, they emailed me back requesting a Visa card # so they could charge me to ship the damaged item back. \\"Satisfaction guaranteed\\" is not part of their warranty.

It is a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom moves ourpt from under pet","review":"I do like this carrier for the most part but when our cat was hit by a car we put him in the carrier to keep him as still as possible. He actually rolled it once and the lining came out from under him. There is no solid base under the lining pad so it was very difficult to keep the pad under him in his agitated state. I was never a fan of hard carriers before but a firmer base would have spared him some pain in this situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a great read","review":"Overall I liked this book very much. Lush, breath-taking descriptions of the Sand Lizard people and their world, and its contrast to the greed of the white world. I found the characters engaging, and reading this book made me feel a deep sense of loss---the world has lost the wisdom and tradition of Native people. The greedy and destructive ways of one culture have won out and all of humanity is worse off for it.In terms of criticism of the book, I thought it needed a better editor. Silko has a talent for writing descriptions, but at times the descriptions went on and on for pages. It boggs down the storyline several times. Still, this flaw does not detract from an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and On...where's the editor when you need one","review":"First, I'm a fan of LMS. That's why I'm critical of this work. It read like it was often restarted with only little effort to avoid repeating itself, then put away,and so on and so on. And then come the last few pages, reflecting a style that wants to wrap this baby up. Its a story about people I genuinely cared about; but told in a style that seems to regularly turn into a trance inducing chant, often robbing the story of its power.But then again, maybe that was the other story being told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novels that tell and don't talk fail. Silko disappoints.","review":"Indigo asked. Hattie told him. Edward pointed out. Aunt Bronwyn explained. But don't look for much dialogue. Gardens in the Dunes is a 479 page creative writing exemplar of telling not showing. As an ad nauseum travelogue/encyclopedia of botany, Bath,or Gnosticism it bores. Only alive with the Native American characters in the Southwest, the novel fails to accomplish the purported ambitions which reviewers attribute to Silko. The characters wear the trappings of sometimes eloquent verbiage; yet, they seldom are more than appendages to Silko's descriptions. How disappointing. Don't make this novel one that turns you away from her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn\`t put this book down...","review":"I\`m surprised by the negative reviews because I loved this book. Certainly there are \\"agendas\\" here, including characters struggling with feminist and expansionist issues. Exploring these agendas is Silko\`s point. Her characters are voices from their time. Why does the Tuscan reviewer dismiss this novel for not having enough dialogue? Silko presents the story through the eyes of very different characters. By not including much dialogue, we see the problems of communication between these people--they each feel separated. The reader is \\"shown\\" each character\`s reading of the disturbing and interesting events. I\`d recommend this book as strongly as Silko\`s other works. It\`s a page turner of a different sort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Victorian Odyssey of Young Native American Woman","review":"Leslie Marmon Silko moves to the first rank of American novelists with this haunting, exquisitely written tale of a young Native American woman's odyssey through Victorian Age America and Europe. Her keen observations on 19th Century women's rights and exploitation of nature are still quite relevant today. Anyone who has enjoyed reading Charles Frazier's \\"Cold Mountain\\" and Frank McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes\\" will find this magnificient book just as poignant and mesmerizing a read. \\"Gardens in the Dunes\\" truly deserves a wider readership than it's earned so far.On a personal note, I remain indebted to Leslie Marmon Silko for taking the time to read a science fiction novel I had written that was rich in ideas and deficient in character development. Her generous advice I wasn't able to heed, but I hope a current work which a literary agent is now reading will bear some promising fruit."},{"rating":"2","title":"English tea","review":"My husband is English and drinks a LOT of tea.

Over several years and in many locals the Falstaffian Welles shares his thoughts on film, his own movies and life with his devoted student Peter Bogdonovich(himself a talented director best known for \\"The Last Picture Show'). If you want to know what Welles really thinks and believes this book is the Rosetta Stone for your investigation!As Truffaut was able to discuss his life and films with Sir Alfred Hitchcock so does Peter B. do the same thing for Welles.After all the reading and studying of Welles the man emerges as a titanic force of nature whose undisciplined genius is a wonder to behold. Any fan of Welles or Cinema should add this excellent book to your library. Well Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another comment on the Photographs","review":"One review mentioned the poor quality of the photographs in this book. Poor isn't the word. Undecipherable is. I have never seen such horribly scanned photos in my life! Now, that doesn't mean this isn't a great fun read and a nice valuable source of information -- because it is. And don't buy the book for the photos anyway, as there aren't that many in there (Thank God!). It just amazes me that there was so much time and effort, not to mention years of interviews, put into a book like this, and then quality control is nonexistent in the photos. How could a publisher not be embarrassed? But if you are an Orson fan, or want to know more about him, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"After first use","review":"It seemed great until the cigarette plug overheated and melted the fuse inside... Tried replacing the fuse but still won't work the plug gets too hot to touch after about 8 minutes. Guessing that the fan motor is bad or there is a problem in the plug itself. Not something that makes me ever want to buy a koolatron product again. Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garage Sale","review":"I did a little research on the different electric coolers that are on the market. Koolatron seemed to get decent reviews, but not great. I had a Coleman before that lasted about 2 years with occasional use and it did a good job to keep our food cold over a 48 hour period. The cooler arrived in a cardboard box, no packaging to protect it and without any bill of sale. The condition was something that you might expect from a garage sale. The latch was broken and did not close and the sticker was peeling off. Luckily I was able to return it and order the same Coleman that I had before. However, I did so through Walmart.com for two reasons, better price and quicker delivery. As a rule, I try to avoid Walmart when possible, but due to inferior product from Amazon, I was left with no choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koolatron fails to deliver.","review":"After reading through all the shinning reviews of this product I had thought that it would have been well worth the trouble. However, that was not the case. When it arrive it was in it's original shelf box with no packing material at all. The quality of craftmanship was horrible. When opening the lid to examine the interior the seams that were held in by tiny screws began to seperate... I had the unit on for several hours hooked to a 12 volt system to get cold. Once again I was disappointed at the results. After several hours it was only mildly cold. The outside air temperature was in the 60's. I filled the unit up with items from my regrigator anyways to test it out. Along the way on my trip with the unit plugged in, the unit failed yet again. The dairy products were warm and everything else was as well even with being plugged into the colling side. I would not recommend this product at all to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I bought this for our boat. First it blew a fuse. I could not find any where what size fuse to to put in it. Called their support line and got the answer. Then the plug keeps coming out of the adapter. Bought a different plug and wired it up, worked for a few days and now it does not cool or heat? It did at first with the new plug. I would not buy this unit ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect product for me..","review":"The unit arrived in time for a 5 day trip to the Oregon coast. We packed a lot more than usual in the way of food as we had the adaptor for the car. What we didn't buy was the adaptor for AC, but we borrowed one from family there. Later we bought our own. The unit is very light weight, but sturdy and easy grips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size and worked well.","review":"Only owned one day but tested out and worked well. In a room around 72F after a little over two hours it was at 30F empty using the optional power adapter. Placing 3 glass bottles of soda brought it up to 40F after a short time. It took about 3 hours to chill them and bring the temp back down to 32F. Switching to heat mode it took less then 1 hour to bring the empty cooler to well over 75F again. Fridge thermometer was buried so I don't know exactly.Overall I think that it performed as advertised and will work out fine. The P95 is a perfect size for personal use and trips to grocery stores not close to home. It's not huge but it's not small either, good mid-sized choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cooler with great space","review":"We have had a Coleman cooler in the past and I am much happier with this unit. Love the doomed lid on this cooler, it adds a lot more space. Cools well and runs quietly. Have not tried it on the heat setting yet so am not sure how well that works. Am able to keep items from the grocery store cool even on hot days with multiple stops and we live 45 minutes from where we grocery shop. One suggestion is to make sure you plug it in and let it cool before you put items in it - it seems to work more effectively that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfactory","review":"Do not buy this cooler. This cooler only lasted 4 months past it's one year warranty. It's too bad because it seemed like a nice cooler, but it should also last far longer then 16 months. I've tried Coleman brand coolers and Koolatron coolers and none of them are worth the money. The longest lasting cooler I've ever owned in this price range lasted 1 year and 9 months. I don't know what the problem is with these coolers but I think their all junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good cooler","review":"I'm a truck driver and have used the coleman and igloo electric coolers, and recently purchase a koolatron. The cooler freezes up, the motor spins both fans and is too weak to turn fans as fast as they need to go. Within 3 weeks the latch broke. It is cheaply made; will not but another. I'll go back to Coleman and keep some money in my pocket; it was the better value for my money. Customer service was great on sending replacement for latch."},{"rating":"1","title":"12VDC plug stinks","review":"It works when you can get the 12VDC plug fully seated in the recepticle. One of the four receptlcles I own will run the cooler. The cooler plug has a larger diameter area that keeps the plug from fully engaging in standard 12VDC recepticles. I'll probably have to buy a replacement plug and wire it in so that it will work on my boat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"After reading the reviews, I bought one of these. I am an over-the-road trucker and was tired of buying a new Coleman every 6 months. I thought I would give this one a try. After about 3 months of use, I would rate this a DO NOT BUY. It will not keep frozen water bottles frozen more than 1 to 2 days in my cab. It does keep things cool, just not cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cooler I've owned","review":"I'm an over the road truck driver & have gone through many coolers,mostly Igloo.I've owned this Koolatron for over 5 yrs. with NO problems.I would have gone through 3 motors in the Igloos by now.The only thing going bad on mine is the seal that holds the lid on.It's starting to crack from being opened and closed 10-15 times a day getting my Cokes or sandwiches out of it.When I bought it I saved the booklet to buy another motor when this one went out.Don't need it!!!I'll buy the 56 quart next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Kooler","review":"We received the Koolatron in a timely manner in good condition. It has proved to be more than worth it's cost. We are in the middle of an extended trip, using it as our refrigerator in car and hotel/motel/cabins. It is working flawlessly. Quiet, smooth operating over many continuous hours using the AC converter to plug in 110 outlets when not in the car. You can't get a better deal in our experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"More then satisfied . . .","review":"We are professional drivers, on the road a month at a time. Keeping food essentials cool is a must. We tried the other brand who also makes camping gear and it failed within the first two weeks, later on we found this to be fairly normal. The Koolatron was actually our second choice due to the price but you get what you pay for. It has performed perfectly! When power from the truck batteries runs low the unit shuts itself off and still keeps things cool.Very happy! Thanks for making a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I ordered this item the end of May 2010. We used it once to go on a day trip and put it back away. We pulled it out of the box in July and took it on a family vacation. On our way back home, the unit stopped working. Of course this was after the warranty expired. I contacted Koolatron about the issue to see what they recommended. They told me to check a fuse in the cord that runs to the outlet, which was not the problem. I contacted them again to ask what else I could do and they have never contacted me back. I would think this unit, for the price paid, should be more durable than to go out after one week of usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"If you place warm items in here, it takes forever to cool them down, and then only keeps them cool not cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Kooler","review":"The Koolatron cooler was broken when I opened the box. The cheap, plastic lid latch was in pieces. So I returned the product for another one, not a problem. Except it was a problem, as the second time I opened the box, I found that this cooler was also broken. The cheap plastic of the lid latch was broken once again. So the cooler goes back and I'm not getting another one. I never even got to try the actual cooling/heating action of the cooler itself because of the stupid, cheap, crappy lid latch. Just looking for a quality product and this my friends is far from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Door latch broken","review":"We researched electric travel coolers and decided Koolatron was the best and ordered one. When it arrived I noticed the plastic latch for the door was broken off. Not a problem if you are using it as a chest cooler, but if you are using it upright this would be a problem. Ordered a replacement and it arrived in the same condition. So I went to a local store and bought the Coleman version, for less money, and it has been working great. The Coleman version has the same plastic latch as the Koolatron but the door on the Coleman is designed better so that it can not shift as much. I believe the shifting of the door during shipment and handling caused the plastic latch to break. This is probably a good product if you don't have it shipped and just buy it in a store. But I am happy with the Coleman version. It cost less, works good and looks better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koolatron P95 cooler","review":"This is a great cooler except 1. it drained our car battery to zero when we didn't unplug it overnight, 2. we had ice crystals on our sliced ham travelling in cooler temps, no controls for temp.

Both had to be returned.The second time, the unit had so little cooling capacity that I had to throw away hundreds of dollars of food and medications because the temp inside was no different than the ambient room temp, although the motor was definitely running (and seemed cool when I put the items in). Is it possible that the motor burned out with a single use?Amazon was good enough to refund me each time, but I can't help wondering if the units were packed appropriately -- rather than being shipped in only the descriptive cardboard -- would they arrive in better working condition?I have purchased other Koolatron products in the past and have been somewhat satisfied, but I'm thinking these things are just generally poorly manufactured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned Out Quickly-Really Bad Customer Service","review":"We used it less than two weeks and it \\"burned out\\".

Of all the fine Herrmann scores, this must be near the top.

I even went to Hewlet Packard as this is the only modem out there that I know of that supports the Journada. Their tech support did what I did and tried to find a support telephone number on the Pre tec web site with no luck.

Upon assembly the swivel wheel was so tight that it would not swivel! But a little WD-40 solved the problem and now it works fine. The handle is a little high for me (I'm 5'3\\"). The tray in front of the seat pulls completely out, but I would prefer it to swing open instead. Other than that I like the stroller.

It just snaps onto the stroller tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little stroller","review":"Can't beat this one for the price!

Its like all three wheels are trying to their separate ways. I took the wheels off and checked to make sure it wasnt put together wrong, but still no luck. Even if front wheel is locked in place it wobbles. Small visor, so I had to buy an extension. Seat does not reclince all the way, so no napping in it while we are on the go.

There are two little latches on the seat, and one of them broke off, so now the seat is crooked. I was not rough on the stroller at all. The fabric gets caught very easily on the frame when you fold it up and unfold it. That's how it got ripped. As far as the seat, I didn't notice it until I took my son to the zoo for the day, and tried to figure out why he was sitting so crookedly. Also, the wheels squeak horribly. I was totally embarrassed driving the thing around. The positives are that it does look nice, it rides pretty smooth, and the wheels come off easily so that it fits in car trunks without a problem.

There are no sweet nothings and no romance here, just some one-night stands, vulgar banter and an inane string of man-hating wisecracks with all the subtlety of a knock knock jokes. This could have been a great book, but it isn't. Try Sandy Blair's book, AMan in a Kilt, for a much better example of time-travelling historical romance with enough plot, passion, and real humour to keep it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"steaming hot","review":"this book was excellent!! it was not only funny but steaming hot! sandra hill is a very good writer. i read this book awhile back but it's still one of my favorites. harriet and etienne are meant for one another and it takes him awhile to realize that. i highly recommend this book because it has plot to it and it will have you laughing out loud and breathless with desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time, this book is not very good","review":"I was totally disappointed in this book. It took Harriet like 100 pages to figure out that it wasn't the present and that she was in the past.

I have the Franklin zippered ring binder case for when I am running around out of work (also carries checkbook and stamps, membership cards, etc.) - it is my complete organizer. But when I get to the office, I switch to this little case. It is compact - fits in a jacket pocket, easy to open in a meeting, easy to check appointments, plus I have the sync cable (no stand) at my work desk and you can sync with that cable without taking it out of this case.A really nice combination and convenient for easy access."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correct item #, but not as described!","review":"The two phillips head screwdrivers are *not* as described.

There's lots of gore, violence, slapstick humor, and it's like watching a how-to guide of making movies about giant rodents. I thought it was alot better than the first one. Plus it's Canadian, and their horror movies are usually better than the average hollywood low budget programming. If you study the camera angles you can see how trick photography made the rats look enormous. The scene with the giant 5 year old kid was the absolute best though. If you want to see a little more of the film before you get this product just see if you can find the trailer on youtube.

I finished the book with in two days,it is 400 words strong and each one perfectly describes the real feelings of people in London just before the out break of WW2. The relationships that are built up between the 6 main characters and their families and lovers really draw the reader in and make the book come alive. References to real life stories and events just increase the hold that the story has on the reader. As the book twists and turns its was to the climax, it is sorely tempting to read well into the dead of night. The language used really transports you to inner London, the cockney ryhming slang adds to the effect. The tone is exactly right,understanding of the emotions people felt but light and funny when needed and again serious when appropriate. The feelings this book provokes are amazing and you will find yourself hankering for the sequal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"Sing Along\\" DVD does not show lyrics","review":"There is no \\"karaoke-style\\" line at the bottom of the video songs to help viewers to sing along.

The instructions work for XP prior to SP2, but they are completely useless under SP2. As a result, my daughter completes a set of lessons and, instead of moving on to the next lesson, the programs throws her back anywhere from 5 to 15 lessons. This has been sufficiently discouraging that she has given up on the program. The Broderbund site has no facility to send a question or inform them of a problem. I'm hoping someone from Borderbund will see this review and post a fix to their website. Without a fix for this problem, I'm stuck and this program unfortunately becomes a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product, even worse graphics, zero support","review":"I'm a Mac user and it is beyond me how this program is ranked number one.

No such luck. I have seen other Mavis Beacon programs so I knew it was exactly what I wanted. For a while, it was. The program taught me all the basic keys, but, then it quit acknowledging my success. No matter how perfect I do the lessons, it WILL NOT move on and keeps making me review the same lesson. The same problem another reviewer wrote about earlier. I have looked everywhere for a fix, but, cannot find one. I have removed/reinstalled the program, tried everything I could think of. To say I am discouraged and frustrated is an extreme understatement. I am sure I would have given it 5 stars had the program continued as it began.

Mavis Beacon also comes with games that are fun to play to build speed. But some of these games' graphics make me squint to read, so therefore I have to slow down.I think you will be happy with Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 16 and because it is not the newest version buy it at a lower cost and save yourself some money!!!Happy Typing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from it, Broaderbund hasn't discovered Windows","review":"Avoid this product.

Running 16 Network on Windows 2000 P4 and it runs dog slow. What is it doing? Re-sort a progress report with 25 students by clicking on a column tab and the program goes out to lunch. Not to mention that it takes over the computer like it was DOS (maybe it is running DOS). It has some odd launcher program. THe instructions are measly and miserly. No instructions on how to setup on a network until you read the technical notes. Wrong place buddy. That stuff belongs in the primary docs, like a Getting Started section.

The passive matrix screen is difficult to read. The keyboard is small and curved making touch-typing difficult. The unit itself is a bit heavy and ackward to lug around compared to some of the latest (and smallest laptops). With a max resolution of 800x600, images and video look cheap. There are NO output ports on the unit itself - you have to hard-link to a computer even to print! No VGA-out for use with a projector. Not even a PS-2 or USB port! The handwriting recognizer works about 3/4 of the time. That is, in a page of handwritten notes, you'll have to manually correct about 1/4 of the page. It does slightly better on single words or sentences. My recommendation: Take the [amt] that you'd spend on the Clio and add to it the [amt] you'd spend on a Pocket PC and buy a decent laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it the same day","review":"I bought this and found it very hard to set up.

Made in the mid 1920's its based on Victor Hugo's classic novel and for a film that is over 80 years old it holds up remarkably well.You do need to concentrate when watching it as there are quite a few major characters and as there is no dialogue its easy to get confused. Of course there are captions to give you a clue. Chaney's makeup is well done, and apparently took hours every day to put on.The picture quality for a black and white film from so long ago is reasonable.

The blade slips into very small crevices and cuts that last little bit of wood that you normally can't get at. Unfortunately, once the blade is worn the whole saw is expendable because of the replacement blade price. Stanley carries the blade and prices it at three-quarters of the tool price.

All the signature traights of HIM are present here from the mellowing baritone vocals to the soulful electronica style guitar work and piano interludes. There is more acoustic work on this album than on their other efforts, which in some senses compromises the quality slightly, but on the other hand shows the skill with which the band handles this particular type of music. I say it hinders the qualtiy only because after about 4 acoustic-y songs in a row, they kind of start to sound the same. Once again, some of the songs have those signature catchy tunes such as the first few tracks (salt in our wounds, heartache every moment, and lose you tonight). Good musical quality, but the album as a whole could use a bit more variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for HIM fans!","review":"Recently, I ordered every HIM CD I did not have.

I have had it for almost a year now. I needed a watch that could take a beating. The face doesn't scratch, it keeps great time, and it's light but feels sturdy. 100 times better than my $350 Swiss Army watch.The only negative aspect is the scratches on the titanium. It scuffs up very easy but most of the watch is a brushed finish so it's not too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Watch","review":"I didn't want a large, heavy, thick watch and this is just what I expected.

The next day after wearing the watch for some 5 hours I noticed that the band was severely scratched (All I did was go to school and write notes). The crome plating comes off very easily and althought the scratches dont affect the watch's performance, it makes it very awful to look at... especially after it cost me $230.00 dollars.If I could return this watch I would do so in an instant. I would highly recomend you buying something different!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to match the first, but a solid compliment here","review":"While the first season of Ah My Goddess! introduced you to the all the characters and their motivations, Flights of Fancy does a very good job to further flesh out these characters and introduces two new ones. However, while the first season generally saw no direct interference with the main protaganists' relationship, the second season directly goes that route to forcefully develop said relationship. While this works as a plot device, it does conflict with some of the clean charm and innocence that made the first season so refreshing. Still much of the fare remains, while all the characters are further developed.

Nearly 10 years later, thanks to this great introductory volume, I am still meditating and feeling the lasting benefits! Although the title is somewhat basic sounding (there are lots of books called \\"How to Meditate\\" out there) this is THE ONE that is the most focused, practical and profound and one of the few of its kind that I could really recomend. I've also bought a couple of the other \\"How to Meditate\\" books and was disappointed that they were really just surveys or smorgasbords of a bunch of different techniques. In this one, Novak is careful to present one coherent, well-thought out system that you can really feel his enthusiasm for. I really couldn't recomend a better introductory guide to meditation (and its even one of the least expensive!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a cheeseball, but I like it.","review":"I want to review this book because it kind of had a rather big impact on my life, now that I look back on it. I figured I ought to do something and perhaps the author will at some point know that I appreciated his work. I picked up this book on how to meditate sort of randomly one day because I was trying to find items to take home for some item I was exchanging at a bookstore. I didn't expect it to be much but it was. It was a simple step by step guide to help beginners focus and learn to concentrate, learn to control our bodies and minds, and to be aware of and to control the energy that exists in the universe. Now it's more than a decade later and I still remember this book because without it I wouldn't have had the first clue about how to raise energy in my current magickal studies, unless I'd somehow stumbled across it some other way. The book shows how natural and easy and wonderful meditation and its related arts can be, and I'm eternally grateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about god then meditation","review":"Very religious book.

He shares stories of success, setbacks, and innovation. I read the book some years ago, but the reason I most enjoy it now is when considering difficuties I am going through in my own career. Like most professions engineering will bring you frustrations as well as triumphs, and I enjoy seeing how a fellow designer delt with close-minded managers, tight deadlines, small budgets, and took blows as well as wins.

One of the characters, Carlie, deserves a thumbs up. She helps Harvey cheer up about his legs. For example, in the story when Carlie she talked to Harvey about what happened with his legs and made him feel better. Another example, her personality can cheer anyone up. Like when she tells Harvey that she believes in him and he will make it through bad times no matter what. Another example, her sweetness, like when Carlie actually got mad and upset because of what Harvey's father did to him, shows that she really cares a lot. I think that other kids should read this book, The Pinballs, because it teaches them to show respect for other living in foster homes. This book has a great plot, and we enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for Me","review":"I didn't realize that this was a workbook to go alongside The Pinball novel.

Will they ever be a \\"Brady Bunch\\"-type family? Besty Byars has written an intersting story about life in a foster family. The Pinballs is realistic,with believable, fast-paced, witty conversation. The sassy way Carlie talks is humorous at times, but the theme story is a serious one.

The author claims that guitarists don't play real chords(Maybe we play \\"knock-offs\\"!) So shouldn't the title be A Pianist's Guide to Chords & Harmony?This author is also extremely depreciative of other musicians.

He doesn't really try to cartoonize his music like Loony Tunes or something.I bought the CD. The opening title theme is amazing! I love the music he wrote for adventure! My favorite track is probably Loneliness. There you hear the main theme played very expressively just as he did with The Whispering Winds in the Land Before Time.

While the formula works (and will continue to work as long as angst-filled teenagers open their Hurley velcro wallets in support of these bands) it doesn't satisfy anyone looking to find an original sound. The song Chicken is along the same lines as 100K, but isn't nearly as good. Massive and Drastic display the Loved Ones' attempted serious songwriting skills but act mostly as filler, while Candy Cane finishes up the EP with notes and chords you've heard on every marginal punk record.

May be a good read for someone who is a Theologian, but hard to follow for the average lay person. The writer uses language that the common Christian does not use in there daily life, nor hear in Church or Sunday School. This makes it very hard to stay focused on what you are reading. I've read paragraphs sometimes three times to find the main topic. Here is an example of what I mean quoted from the book. \\"John's original variation of the salutation in 1:4b - 5a strongly suggests that his understanding of the divine is deliberately 'trinitarian'.\\" Maybe it's just me, but it seems like this is not an easy statement for the average reader to grasp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray!","review":"This book is an excellent overall look at the book of Revelation.

This book has been one that has perplexed me since I was a young believer. Is this book to be taken literally? Is the book figurative? Is it somewhere in-between? Bauckham falls into a general examination of the book, looking at the genre, the big issues, the themes, and specific issues that scholars debate in all circles. This book is not an exegetical painful process, rather a good look at the big picture of revelation. How should we apply it today? Are we afraid that we will be 'left behind?' Thank goodness Tim Lahaye made a DVD for those people who will be 'left behind.' Anyway, on a more serious note, this book is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and will help almost anyone get around the book without feeling overwhelmed or lost.

The outrage of Gallipoli should have conviced Britain, but Churchill was skillful enough to cover his tracks, lay the blame elsewhere and always survive, to see others die another day. A remarkable, five-star accomplishment in history, biography and investigative reporting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Books such as this make the world a worse place. Instead of spending time productively, authors waste their time and worse, readers' time by attempting to bring down a wonderful legacy that Sir Winston Churchill left our world.

However, the subtitling is, well, awful. Even with a limited grasp of Japanese, it's fairly evident to me that the subtitles don't really follow the spoken Japanese dialogue very well, and if the translation of the dubbed version isn't any better, I'd probably not be happy watching this dubbed either.One would think that Disney would be capable of doing a better job of translation and subtitling - I was sorely disappointed with the job they did.

It's very successful not only as a rangefinder, but as a movie as a whole. It depicts beautiful panoramas (The setting is reminiscent of industrial-era Europe), memorable characters, and a good plot that holds itself together. Miyazaki doesn't bother burdening himself and the audience with an unplausible explination of the events at the end of the film, but rather let's it flow out wonderfully, presenting a good, positive message.The animation is rich and pleasing and it fits the action and themes perfectly.Miyasaki has surpassed this effort with some of his newer films, still using this film as a sort of \\"platform\\".

However, I'm still baffled by the fact that Disney has paid professional actors to voice the characters and gotten the film prepared for release in the US -- even advertised it -- and has since then just sat on it.It's almost criminal to hold such great films as Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Pon Poko in your possession and not share them with the English speaking world.If and when they see the error of their ways and make this film available, do yourself a favor and buy it.

No doubt it is artistically worthy in many ways. But is it praiseworthy as a children's movie? Pazu is a kid waving a gun who participates in a military adventure. This I find poor content to which to expose kids, and morally objectionable. I wish I had known beforehand.Perhaps you will say that this is better than 99% of what else is out there, and perhaps that's true, but I don't think it affects the point. Sorry to rain on everyone else's parade.My rating is for the movie considered as a children's movie, which is how many will regard and evaluate it.Update of 12/25/2012 (please note recent events).

I don't like the way the people were drawn, and the colors in most of the movie were dull and gray. I didn't like how Dola and Pops looked and sounded like chararacters from Spirited Away.

It has action, drama and plenty of suspense. The animation, sountrack and voice acting are all amazing as well. The battle is also very intense. This isn't one of my favoriter Miyazaki movies, but it's still awesome by itself.

I find the concept of a once-powerful, but now long dead, ancient culture particularly intriguing, but I won't say any more along those lines for fear of spoiling the plot. The movie starts off rather, ah, interestingly, with the main charchter seemingly plunging to her doom. This, however, is only the start of a remarkable chain of events that eventually leads to the satisfying conclusion. Along the way we meet some unforgettable characters and, in true Miyazaki style, there is even a giant (and I mean giant) tree.

I was impressed with the animation techniques used, and Miyazaki's enjoyment of flying machines. Sporting a quirkily funny, yet epic storyline, we follow the adventures of Sheeta and Pazu, two lost orphans, as they go on their quest to find Laputa, the Castle in the Sky (as was described in Gulliver's Travels). Considering that the film is nearly over 17 years old, it still never ceases to amaze me how ahead of his time Miyazaki was, especially in his animation and his understanding of human flaws. The tenacity and love of the human spirit are captured perfectly in his films. The magic of Miyazaki is an inspiration to us all, and I hope that his films will be viewed in the years to come, and inspire many more generations of children and parents alike. Bravo to the magic makers in Studio Ghibli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"The title, \\"Laputa,\\" comes from Swift's Gulliver's Travels.

He's creates these magical worlds with the most wonderful characters and storylines of any movie out there. With each frame of film I am in awe of the wonderful things I am seeing. I think Disney is doing a wonderful job by bring voice talents such as Cloris Leachman to the project. She plays the captain and makes the character the best part of the film. Right after I watched this the first time I started the movie over and watched it all over again. It's a wonderful story and I can't imagine anybody not falling in love with it. I know there will be many reviews from people who saw the original Japanese version and can't except this one but I think they're nit picking. If you don't like the English language watch the Japanese version. It's that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"A magical story.. full of mystery and adventure..

The Crooked Sky test scene towards the end made quite an impact on me so I have always remembered the movie. I watched it most recently on Amazon Prime. It appears the movie has been edit a little to make it more suitable for family viewing. The little bit of nudity was removed at the start and the Crooked Sky test towards the end is not as vivid as I remember.

Because it is largely his fault that she was taken, he decides to go after the sister, hunting for the unknown Indians as he goes. Along the way, he meets the usual Western characters and finally ends up \\"racing the sun\\" across a valley to help his sister. I've watched this a bunch of times and always enjoy it. It's about in the same genre as \\"Across the Great Divide\\" and \\"Seven Alone\\"(which also stars Stewart Peterson, if memory serves) as well as \\"Where The Red Fern Grows\\" and makes a good family movie to watch.

The music is harder with grungy guitars,stomping drums,heavy bass and keyboards.( I found the keyboard sound the weakest element of this album due to it's \\"modern rock/new wave\\" influenced experimental sound. It comes accross skimpy at times, like playing a little toy keyboard.) Other wise, it is a very good album, mature and focused with somewhat political and philosophical lyrics about the fear of growing old, politics of everyday life and the lack of personal and artistic freedom. The album was released in the UK and other parts of Europe under The title \\" Works\\" also. It helps to know Hungarian to comprehend the Lyrics but not essential. It is a solid and good record from this veteran band, still drawing tens of thousands of people through out Europe, a testimony to the most successful Eastern European rock group.

Far too often the writers tried to be cute and/or stylish, and they completely missed the point: zombie stories fascinate us not only because they're us, but because we are curious about how we'd respond in a world in which everyone around us not only is indifferent, but downright threatening to our continued existence. Too many times the writers take the point of view of the zombies or depict them fascinated by television or the trappings of middle class or (on and on fill in your own cliched examples).Occasionally the stories rise to something close to what probably most of us are looking for. \\"Like Pavlov's Dogs\\" or \\"Choices\\" are the 2 stories most rewarding in terms of survival horror.

The Craftsman is a true professional lantern with a sealed beam bulb (real glass). Solvents and gasoline will not damage it. It won't scratch or discolor like plastic. It is very bright with a white color to the beam. It also projects very, very far. It's truly the best flashlight I have ever owned.Disappointingly, the Dorcy Lantern has a regular Zenon flashlight bulb with a plastic reflector and lens. The beam is yellow compared to the Craftsman sealed beam, and is not as bright nor does it project as far. Unfortunately, for those of you looking for an excellent flashlight I am sad to say the the Craftsman Lantern is no longer available. I thought the Dorcy was an exact replacement, but I was fooled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I used this lantern quite a bit until the bulb burned out.

The poem/story sets up in the young reader's imagination a simple yet heart-warming land to live in. Where the book fails is to teach any lesson.

Their instruments blend seamlessly and then rise and fall in swooping solos. But, best of all, the four band members cluster round a single microphone and rely upon their own natural abilities (and not a mixing board) to create their soaring and yet perfectly harmonized vocals.

The plot mostly stayed true to real life events, how someone can come into your life within the blink of an eye and force you to look at yourself and inspire change. The way Angelina Jolie's character changes these girl's lives is inspirational, some become strong, one questions her sexual identity, all of them evaluate themselves...

Then, a week after seeing it, (and I was still mulling over the movie in my mind occasionally,) the bright cover of Joyce Carol Oates' book FOXFIRE, upon which the film was based, caught my eye. I didn't even see the title, just the bright oranges and pinks of the cover. I picked it up, and was thrilled! I read the book all in one sitting that night... *who needs sleep? and that homework can wait, too!* I immediately passed it on to my closest friend, and she raved about the book with me.

Finally, 'nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelina Jolie","review":"This movie works because of Angelina Jolie. Any other actress and it wouldn't even be worth watching. She brings danger and excitement to the film which it desperately needs. The film starts out with a bare butt naked man running through the forest.

I have now learned that when a film is compared to something, you are better off seeing the film that it is being compared to. \\"Thelma and Louise\\" had character depth and this does not. \\"Thelma and Louise\\" was inspiring, and this is just simply tiring. This film has been done. If you like tacky, \\"girly\\", overly-dramatic, bad visuals, and terrible scripts definitely check this film out.

Ruthless and intoxicating. All the women fall under her spell and go with whatever she says. She shows them to stand up for themselves and rule their own lives. Legs unfortunetly shows how to rule life in the baddest of ways: Stealing cars, Breaking and entering, and hitch hiking. Soon the girls pay for the choices they made with Legs. Good Movie.

I want to see it I want to have a hollywood movie that gives it to me....but.... It's not here, unless you are brian dead. The movie is cheesy, badly filmed, badly directed, badly scripted, badly adapated, in consistant, and yes as the creepy sexist guy said it feels like an after school special.

I never used this system before -- learned pidgin Japanese with \\"Learn in Your Car\\" system which was fine -- but I'm a Pimsleur convert, now.The words are pronounced with great clarity, brief explanations in English of key issues or cultural idioms are provided, and the mix of little one-item quizzes as you go gives unexpected confidence.

The Conversational Hebrew just has two extra CDS. I feel ripped off by Amazon--they advertised both-- and I had the impression that one would get more from both. No! They both have the same content!

I have a friend that is currently living in Israel and I have been practicing my conversational Hebrew and I was told I am doing very well. The only bad thing I have to say, the pronounceability with the man is different from the woman. I am not talking about the male female differential but the way common words are said. Also, I have caught the male saying a word in english as he was supposed to be saying it in Hebrew, but it isn't keeping me from learning the Hebrew or causing any confusion, just seems like that should have been something caught in the recording process.

The book takes us to the ballrooms and mansions that were the norm at the turn of the century. But more that that, it is a love story of the times. Anne Foster isn't very attractive, so she is the perfect wife to discard. Henry Owens weds her to fulfill a demand by his grandfather in order to get his inheritance. She tries to make him suffer for his thoughtless act, but her heart breaks in the trying. There are sub-plots that are just as captivating as the main story. All in all, I loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a ZERO - because of the \\"hero\\".","review":"I can't believe this is considered a romance.

Of course, she fails. Because no heroine can ever get justice from a hero, no matter how horrible their behavior is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Romance Book","review":"This book was dull.

Shocking had been discontinued for decades but was reintroduced sometime in the past 10-20 years. I purchased a large bottle of the modern incarnation and was extremely disappointed. The original perfume is a sophisticated blend of white flowers, cyphres, and aldehydes. It was probably made with real musk or animal ingredients, as was many other perfumes in the 30s, 40s and 50s. The new formula probably uses synthetic musks, and it just doesn't have the same appeal. The new formula screamed floral, without being tempered by the amber/aldehyde notes of the original. It was harsh and cloying. I'll have to continue to find vintage bottles of Shocking rather than buy the new version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghhh...","review":"There are some artists who have been active since the 60's and 70's and who are still producing vibrant, excellent music.

Maybe I don't rate as a JM fan because I've only heard Blue, but I've listened to that album hundreds of times times over the years.I wanted to find out what she was up to since then, and bought this album. All I have to say is, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I was EXPECTING her to change and grow, but not into some pale ghost of the 60's droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism.

Anytime two groups of people fight over the same place, one wins and one looses - both suffer. Had the Arab forces won in 1948, the Jews would have had a book called \\"All that remains...\\". HOWEVER, this is not to say that those who suffered should be written off, and reality and history are facts. So a book like this is important for the process of reconcilliation between both Israeli's and Palestinians. How can it be rated? Well, it is essential for anyone wanting to understand the conflict to read books like this, however biased they may be. But, because of this bias, as with any Israeli or Arab history book that is slanted to extremes, it can't be rated too highly. Read it to understand, not to form opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well they look good.","review":"I bought this book a while ago and thought it was wonderful - beautiful pieces!

Having never heard of The Robert Cray Band before the t.v show i feel ashamed that i could have missed out on many earlier albums which now i need to catch up on.

So if your looking for a book that will give you an idea for that unusual or elusive name this isn't the book for you, but you might still enjoy it for it's other apects. There is an interesting segment on celebrity names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this all?","review":"I was surprised to find out how few names the book included. I don't consider \\"Gabriel\\", \\"Gabrielle\\" and \\"Gabriella\\" to be three different suggestions. I bought this book based on the reviews, but was surprised to see that I didn't agree with the majority. The alphabetical section is not user friendly in listing the names. I think I'll need to buy another book or go online for other resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blecchh!","review":"This book makes the mistake of interpreting rather than defining some of the names. For example, Aidan means \\"fire,\\" NOT \\"warmth of the home.\\" Spellings are capricious as well; the most common and traditional spelling of Rhiannon is omitted in favor of several modern misspellings. No guidance is given as to pronunciation, but this is a failing of most name books. If you want to know the meaning of the name you choose for your child, keep browsing--this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"User hostile program!","review":"I began using 3D Home Architect years ago and found I could do most anything I wanted with version 4 deluxe. Then I tried this POS, which is as user-hostile as any program I've ever encountered. Not intuitive, takes ages to set up defaults to make it do what you want it to do, pitiful documentation and tech support, not able to import plans from previous versions (even using the industry standard DFX files - but the did warn me). Version 4 and earlier were written by Chief Architect; later versions by Punch Software. Go try something by CA, like Better Homes & Gardens Home Designer. The only reason I gave this product 1 star is because there is no lower rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No progress in 10 years--even regressed","review":"This is the first review I have ever written for Amazon, and I didn't even buy the product through Amazon, but I was so moved because this product is the absolute worst! I bought an earlier version about 10 years ago and found it somewhat cumbersome and restrictive, but gave it another shot thinking that some significant improvements might be made. WRONG! Added complexity that is less limitting to creativity, but added nonsense as well t hat makes it too cumbersome for the non-professional.If you're looking to design your dream house, use a pencil and graph paper -- or another company's product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Useless for Nonprofessional Decorator","review":"I bought this to try to do some easy interior decorating and layouts--basically to see how to best put my furniture in a new apartment and figure out what color to paint the walls etc. But the software is NOT intuitive at all; you really have to spend a lot of time learning how to use it before you can do any little thing. Then I thought there would be a sample of a living room that I could just open and edit, but no--there are only sample interiors for a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Also, the paint samples are quite limited, and I could not figure out how to customize the colors. To top it off, all the styles offered (things like furniture fabrics) are like Goodwill rejects: ugly green plaids, for example. Anyway, this program definitely seems geared more toward pros who are building houses from scratch than amateurs who just want an easy decorating tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"In a word.

It is possible to get a good design but just not worth the frustration. Prior Home Architect 3 user and I would much prefer that if it was a little more flexible.

Can't import either from v3."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate this Software","review":"I wrote a review under the 'Special Edition' of 3D HA. I bought this when it was $60. I hated it. It wasn't nearly as usable as earlier versions, and through all the years it has been out, has declined in functionality, rather than improved. I still can't create a simple roof in my design with this product. Doesn't do any landscaping (like different level entries).I would not buy this software."},{"rating":"1","title":"3D Home Architect Home Design Deluxe 6","review":"Very basic program.

The visuals gave me a good picture. I was impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"much worse than version 3","review":"I was an avid v3 user. I loved v3 because I could get going so quickly. All you had to do was create a rough outline of a floorplan, and then it was easy to slide walls around to match proper dimensions. Rooms were automatically created with via contiguous walls.Version 6 is FAR behind this. I've been trying to create a simple floorplan that I got into v3 in about 30 minutes. I've been trying for hours now, and the most simple tasks are impossible. The default snap puts dimensions at 1/4\\" snaps. I'm trying to make a 12' wall, for example. Sliding my mouse pointer, I can choose 11' 11 3/4\\", and the next stop available is 12' 0 3/4\\". This sort of behavior is very common. Next, I'd like to define the height of walls in a room. Rooms are not defined, however. I can install a \\"ceiling\\" object.The bottom line is that this software has put me way behind, and it just isn't worth trying to use. All of the intuitiveness of 3.0 is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support available.","review":"Regardless of the quality of this product, I don't recommend it because there is no support. \\"Technician-assisted telephone and e-mail support are no longer available.\\" I installed the product and noticed that it installed AOL on my machine(without my knowledge). When I went to delete AOL I saw that neither it nor 3D Home Architect itself were on the list of programs that I could remove. When I went to the website to ask about this problem, I found that they provide no support, not even for a fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true upgrade from version 4","review":"This is not a true update from version 4 but a completely new program. If you want the true updated verson try \\"Better Homes and gardens Home Designer\\" products by Chief Architect, they were the makers of \\"3D Home Architect version 4 and earlyer.

Don't waste your money on the version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable vendor attitude","review":"I bought this thing the other day (through another retailer). Like others, I was expecting it to be an update to previous versions. Like others, I was surprised to find that it was a completely new program, and wouldn't even import files created by older versions of 3D Home Architect... of which I have several.Even if you don't have any old files to import, ask yourself whether you want to deal with a company that takes this attitude toward its customers. It takes a pretty obnoxious marketing drone to put the name of an established program on an entirely different one, and leave existing customers with no upgrade path. If they'll do it to us, they'll do it to you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"After years of using the previous 3D Architects, with great success, I assumed version 6 was, as they offered, an upgrade. Wrong! It's a completely new program without the ability to import files from early versions. A real let down since I often go back to older files for designs. Futhermore, getting support is a joke. You just get the run around with the automated services. This will be the last Broderbund software I buy. After all, if they do it to 3D, why not Print Shop, or one of the others?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would recommend Punch!

This product is just a little more and it works great and has wonderful features. The 3D element is perfect and the program is easy to use.

I remember watching this film over and over again. Parts of the film seem silly especially now that I am all grown-up, but it's just one of those films that make you feel good because it's simple and harmless. Directed by Carl Reiner, Summer Rental is a about a man who wants his family to spend a great and relaxing summer at the beach but when he realizes they have the wrong address, things take a turn for the worse. Their beach house is anything but relaxing, it's a little too close to the beach and crazy things start to happen. Well I don't want to spoil the rest but I will tell the rest of the film involves a boat.

Richard Crenna is great as the rich, snobby dentist who thinks he owns Florida and tries to run Candy's family out by refusing their rent check (he owns thier rental house). Great performances by Candy, Crenna, and Rip Torn. I have only one problem with the movie....there is a great song by Jimmy Buffett called \\"Turning Around\\" which is featured in full as the credits roll, but the song is not available. I am a Buffett fan, but I have never seen the song in any recorded form, and there seems to be no \\"Summer Rental\\" soundtrack. It's frustrating to watch the movie, hear the song, and not be able to buy the song anywhere. Why Buffett never released it is beyond me.

Hats off to the director for chosing a part of Florida that could be anywhere. Trust me, although a great place to live, Florida isn't really like Miami Vice. I really liked Candy in this role, I think he was a perfect match. Trust me, I have seen hundreds of guys just like him treking the family to the beach with arms full of junk. The worst part of the movie is the end. I fell like we are missing out on a great story, and you get the feeling that they either ran out of money or ideas.

I guess this is more of the same to some extent (no bad thing) but growing confidence in his subject matter shows through songs like Good Day, a bouncy, sexy, uplifting pop number that's great to sing along to.

Unfortunately you could get only partial reproductions in the US market so we bought Series I through 4 from Amazon UK. Also unfortunately, you need a region-free DVD player to run them but I found one for a reasonable price. It was, all-together, an expensive process but we really enjoy them.The one bad thing is that, just like the Northern Exposure DVD's, there are still some problems about reproducing all of the music. You get some samples here and there but not nearly the whole thing and music was VERY important in these series, especially in Ally. Boo Hiss! Why can't the musicians and the DVD producers get together on some kind of compromise? We need a consumer's bill of rights to force them to get together and give us the whole thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace","review":"I really tried to like this but it is so overtly sexual it is actually degrading and disgusting, but with today's world it is probably seen as wonderfully funny and even relevant.

It's not a bad text, but it's really not that great either. On the upside, the book gets into things like Hiragana right away (and Katakana a little later on), so you can quickly ditch romaji, but the Kanji lessons don't start until somewhat later. The recorded materials for Nakama are somewhat lacking in quality, but they're managable. Mostly I guess it's just a textbook, not particularly interesting. It covers new grammar patterns and such pretty quickly, and the explanations aren't always completely clear. There are a number of very useful tables of counters and verb endings and such in the back, though. Overall, it's an okay textbook, but from the things I hear, something like Genki would probably be a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proofreading problems galore!","review":"I used this textbook during an intensive course. I think it was chosen for political reasons (the author's reputation or connection). But I found it to be lacking in many ways. First of all it is FULL of typos. In fact, one whole chart was mislabeled. An unsuspecting student might think they were learning the past plain form of the adjective when in fact, they were looking at the polite form. I was very frustrated by the typos. Secondly, I could never find clear grammar explanations. A grammar point would be introduced but there would only be one or two examples of it. Then another grammar point would be thrown in, all mixed together in the examples. I ended up buying a dictionary of grammar, which the teacher recommended when she realized how frustrated some of us were with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seller & Fast Service","review":"I got this book the third day that I placed it.

The built-in foil cutter on my \\"Boomerang\\" brand waiter's corkscrew works more reliably, and requires less effort, and the whole corkscrew hardly costs more than this foil cutter.I had expected that a purpose-built, standalone foil cutter would excel at the task, but this device came up short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better foil cutters are out there","review":"I have used a number of foil cutters over the years and have found this one to be near useless. It is not a question of quality but rather poor design. I highly recommend the Screwpull brand foil cutter as an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Horrible!

It worked just fine for cutting foils off wine bottles, but it failed in quality - the rubber/plastic (not quite sure what it was) seemed to corrode over time and became sticky. It was not like that when we first purchased it. We tried cleaning it with soap and also tried picking off the sticky bits that collected on the black part to no avail. We ended up tossing this as it became too icky to use and went for a screwpull cutter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, when it works","review":"I have the four-wheel cutter. It works fine on some bottles of wine, but is useless on others. It takes too much squeezing effort, too many turns, and the result is too iffy.

Should have known better and saved myself the 7 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"The rabbit wine bottle opener is fantastic, but the foil cutter is, as someone else noted, near useless. Doesn't fit most wine bottle necks, so you have to squeeze hard and rotate at the same time to get a good cut, and you need the grip of the Incredible Hulk to accomplish this. Don't waste your time. I'm going to go for the Screwpull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another foil cutter","review":"This is a very disappointing effort from Metrokane, with too much work for too little payoff.

There are much better options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not able to cut through about 50% of the foils I try to open","review":"The blade on this foil cutter is not sharp enough to open about half of the wines I drink.

My book club read it before I joined them, so I read it on my own to see why they were raving so gloriously about Tumbling. There was absolutely no storyline. Mc Kinney just put together a series of events that may have seemed like a novel in her head, but she could not have been further from her goal. I was very, very disappointed with the story.

Don't waste your time on this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tumbling","review":"Tumbling became an instant hit with me. After reading Mc Kinney-Whetstone's novel I couldn't wait until she came out with another. From the beginning to the end, each page leaves you wanting to turn page after page to get to the end. But you dare not read it to fast because you don't want it to end. That is unless you are sure she has another book waiting for you. \\"Blues Dancing is the one I searched for until I found it. Now I'm on pins and needles waiting for another. Maybe I can rush her along if I offer to help her write the next one. Diane call me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Magical","review":"The one thing that I can definitely say for Whetstone is that she has a knack for beautiful language. It is very poetic and portrays the characters in a way that seems to mirror some of African-American life in times past. The language just seems to float. The characters are also captivating, although I think that Noon and her experience could be more \\"fleshed\\" so that the reader can really understand what happens to her, because as of now it sounds sort of rushed and not purely authentic. It leaves room for lots of questions. Also some of the other characters need more to be said of them because at times they are so vital. Otherwise, I am so inspired by Whetstone's writing. Simple yet magical.Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my first","review":"A friend of mine suggested this book. I am so glad that she did. It reinstated my love for African American authors.

What a beautiful novel; it actually reminded me of Toni Morrison's Jazz and any novelist who can conjure up images of Toni Morrison with only her FIRST attempt has got to be some kind of genius. Noon and Herbie love each other but have never been able to consummate their marriage due to a horrible secret in Noon's past. Within a span of five years they find not one, but two children sitting on their doorstep and they create a surrogate family for themselves.

We get to see them go through the joys and pains of childhood as they interact with each other and with the adults in their neighborhood.

This movie has almost everything that makes a movie great including some very clever scenes. One thing it doesn't have is the kind of storyline that Americans are accustomed to having in films. I suspect that may be the reason one person gave it a bad review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful film about provincial French children","review":"This episodic story of a year in the life of a group of children and their families in provincial France is one of Truffaut's most delightful films.

This book made me feel like these girls were prissy little preppies.

Finally all levels of women's athletics have been covered. As a high school basketball player I was able to relate to everything in the book, and was especially touched by that. Blais offers a complete and realistic look into the lives and emotions of The Lady Hurricanes, a high school basketball team putting it all on the line for the ultimate goal. I reccomend this book to any athlete male or female who understands how rewarding it is to be on a team, and how wonderful attaining a goal can be after a season of sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Agony of Victory","review":"Blais creates an elegant tapestry which depicts the struggles of families undergoing the rite of passage of adolescence. Her characters embody the sacrifices which they and their families make to achieve success.Why should you read this book? First, Blais blends humor and pathos in telling a 'feel good' story. Second, her prose and style simply inspire all readers to improve their writing. Third, she illustrates the generational transition resulting in the empowerment of women and the role athletics has played. Finally, she captures the spirit and the vicissitudes of the relationships between her characters, for example the two hour phone conversation where the team stars become friends instead of rivals.You don't have to worship at the sports altar to enjoy this book, but it won't hurt. If you make the small effort to read this outstanding book, you may understand better how life has improved for your daughters and sons, your peers, and yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle","review":"My wife requested that we get the book.

The story of a girls basketball team warms the heart with the high hope of determination. The book proves if you put your mind to something you can go all the way. The lives of the eleven girls are explained in detail and is boring towards the beginning,but towards the middle, this upbeat book becomes wonderful to read. The book has a good moral and a great theme. I also enjoyed how Jen and Jamila gave realistic vibes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST books I have ever read!","review":"This book was outstanding! It was such a good story and it was really well written. If you are looking for some inspiration about basketball and teamwork then you should read this book! These girls are just amazing. What made this whole story better was the fact that it was a true story so you know that this REALLY happened. It was almost like a fairy tale- everything went as planned. I can't really describe my feelings for this book, it was incredible. When Jenny hugged her dad after the game I almost cired. Everyone should read this book whether they like basketball or not! I would also like to wish Jamila Wideman a happy birthday! She will be turning 24 on October 16. So, HAPPY BIRTHDAY JAMILA!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A low on Belmondo's carrer","review":"It is a waste to have Belmondo on such a film.

I appreciate Mir's service, but I wasted money on this book on my last deployment, introducing it to the burn pile rather than lugging it back home.

If you wanna learn about anything before 1974 - go somewhere else. The history of the ranger up to 1974 is compressed into 100 pages and I found one MAJOR mistake - the author claims that the 2nd ranger bn was not the first unit on top of point du hoc, he claims that the 116th reg of the 29th infantry was there first. He even quotes a section of stephen ambrose's \\"D-day\\" to back it up, only he quotes from the chapter about the 5th rangers and the 116th at Omaha. If he made a simple mistake like that one, how do I know that the rest of the book isnt filled them? All in all, I'm glad I got this book as a gift, because it isnt worth the money....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"As a former 2/75 Ranger I basically bought the book to find out about more recent missions and activities of the Regiment. I found the book to not be a history as much as a personal opinion of political decisions, the Regiment and the Army.

I wish I hadn't of spent the money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like But very disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Interesting information, the use of actual events to bring the history alive, and an easy writing style are all in its favor. But I can't get around the authors constant politicalization of events and decisions - esp. as he relates more modern history. It becomes VERY obvious that the author has a bias against certain people and their decisions (ok, we all do, that's fine) but when relating the chronology and facts about a battle or a fire fight that is not the place to beat the reader over the head with your views.

When I hear the Love Story theme I immediately think of Ryan O'Neil sitting in the bleachers at the end of the movie.

I am totally devoted to the movie. I bought both \\"Oliver's Story\\" and \\"Love Story\\" and finished reading in one afternoon. For me, I like the Love Story more than Oliver's Story. The 3/4 part of the Love Story was a pleasant story. Both of them loved each other very much and would like to sacrifice for each other.

Love Story, which stars Ryan O'Neil and Ali McGraw, has brought tears to the eyes of millions of movie lovers both young and old. It is Romeo & Juliet of a different type; class (economic) differentiation and youthful rebellion against parental authority.

The plot is far from complex: boy meets girl, boy loses girl to untimely death. The concept is far from original: Rich boy falls for girl from wrong side of the the track. Like we've never seen that storyline before! But for some reason everything just clicks in this charming tearjerker.

It was 1970, I was 6, and my parents took us to the drive in. That may be one reason I like it so much, but I've seen it many times since and it's one of the few films I don't ever get bored watching. The great soundtrack sets the atmosphere for the relation between Oliver and Jenny, 2 sophisticates at Harvard and Radcliffe who fall in love in the wintertime. The ending set in New York City strikes an especially relevant chord post-Sept. 11th, when so many faced similar, but even worse circumstances.The general feel of the film is one of emotional intensity, and a slice of reality from 1970 in Manhattan and Massachusetts."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Yes it's a schmaltzy tearjerker, but it's a successful schmaltzy tearjerker that develops characters we care a reasonable amount about; if you're the audience for Love Story (you'll know if you are) and haven't seen it yet, then bump it to the top of your Netflix queue."},{"rating":"1","title":"love story","review":"This movie was very short and I remember it being much longer.

Ali McGraw, although beautiful to look at, was one of the worst actors to ever grace the silver screen. Guess being married to one of the top honchos at Paramount at the time did wonders for her career! Ryan O'Neil also was rotten. I just could noy buy him as the preppie Oliver, he just didn't come across as the Ivy League type.As I recall the book, Jennie was a fiesty, spirited girl, McGraw sounds like she's reading her lines off cue cards, with absolutley NO emotion. She is not at all convincing. There was NO chemistry between either McGraw or O'Neil, they appear not to even like each other.Not a very good rendition of a sweet little story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker! Stinker!

And hey, it was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture of 1970. Of course, \\"Airport\\" was as well. So I purchased this to add to my collection of 6,000 plus dvds. This movie makes \\"Airport\\" , a classic stinker, look like \\"Gone With The Wind.\\" It is so bad. The acting is horrendous, the plot so cheesy. I could not believe how bad this movie was. The music, which I liked, was making me sick by the end. I swear if I ever hear Ali MacGraw say preppie again I will probably spontaneously combust. Maybe things were different in 1970, but how this movie made so much money is astounding. The one kick I got from this movie was seeing Tommy Lee Jones as O'Neals college roommate."},{"rating":"1","title":"why does everyone think this love story is so great?","review":"well it's not. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and i don't absolutely despise it, but I do strongly dislike it it. Why?, well, first of all, the story itself is very unoriginal. It's all been done before. Poor little rich boy falls for the actual poor girl. Parents dissaprove, and then, in the end, the girl ends up dying, and the guy mourns. I'm sorry, I just donot find any sentimental value in this film.There is no real chemistry between the actors, and the try way too hard to be all witty. There are too many cheesy lines between the two main characters for this to ever qualify for a great love story. Love stories are full of sincerity, and life. Not sappy,overacted bull. That's not called a love story, that's called a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flatware","review":"Oneida Chateau used to be a fairly popular flatware pattern a few years back, but can't be located in many of the usual department stores at present.

The traits included are very significant and deserve serious treatment, not matter-of-fact tips that can be found in any parenting magazine which is what the book contains.For example, the chapter on bossiness - a complex and serious negative behavior trait - gives three overly simplistic tips and then asks the parent to consider a series of questions about why the trait is bothersome. It does a very poor job of explaining the root of bossiness and gives overly simplistic advice, like \\"raise the child's self-esteem.\\" If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't have had to buy the book!Try another resource. This one won't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for our child","review":"The title was rather seductive ... but I was disappointed, if validated.

The characters that come with the ship have room inside for storage but must be placed in an exact & specific way usually too complex for a toddler, While there is an area to snap the treasure chest into that will secure it, there is no way to keep one of the characters behind the wheel.

There is a molded piece of plastic inside the boat where the figures are stored. It is balloon like (hollow but enclosed) with indentations for the figures. It attaches to the bottom of the boat by two screws. But there are also two holes all the way through to the bottom of the boat (which I didn't see until it sunk) so when you put it in the water it fills up with water and capsizes. Now there's about 1/4 cup of water inside this balloon like thing that I can't get out. I don't know if I received a defective one or what as other reviewers have said it floats. If you take your chance on this toy, be sure to look for and seal the holes with silicone or something. Also, the sail does not stay attached and the treasure chest looks like it should scoop and sprinkle water but it's pretty much useless. I am very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This was a great idea, very poorly implemented.

However, we cannot have a pirate adventure in the tub, because the figurines cannot stay on the boat unless it is totally immobile, and even then you have to place them very carefully. They slip and slide as they are plastic and so is the boat deck. The sail constanly comes off. I have had to glue it on. We mostly play with this on the bedroom floor.Also, it would be nice if the other pirate characters were available, even at an extra cost, but I have not seen them anywhere.

Now that I am an educator myself, I was pleasantly surprised to see that there is a Grammar Schoolhouse Rock DVD that I can play for my students.

What was most intriguing about this book was the heroine, Anne's, somewhat jaded, cynical and self-deprecating outlook on life(usually that's the man's role in a romance novel). The hero was noble and good, sexy and romantic, and the romance between Christian, \\"Christy,\\" and Anne is divine.The anti-hero is not your typical brutish lout - a bit more interesting and well-defined than the outragiously monstrous, errant husbands in novels with similar plots.In \\"To Love and To Cherish,\\" Gaffney respects the vicar's Protestant beliefs. Rich in textured descriptions of characters and the quaint village of Wyckerly, one never feels Gaffney is just filling up page space; rather, you are transported to another place and time.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice size.","review":"I was very pleased with the dog except for its nose.

I tried to tinker with the nose and make it look better, but couldn't. I'll just have to try and angle the pics from another direction so its nose isn't that visible. The nose resembled a fold in gift wrapping; How the paper is tucked in and folded over. The little tip that usually ends up being taped on the back of the present. That is exactly how the nose looks. It's just material folded down. Nothing like the life-like nose in the pics. For most people, this wouldn't matter at all.

I was very impressed with this edition. It’s a great introduction to the history of male nude photography from the 1850’s to the present day. It’s a fascinating look at the changes the male nude has experienced in body type, structure, and sexual content over the past 100 years. There are images from almost every photographer you can think of during this time period.

Well there are many nude men within its pages, but nothing I found spectacular or new in approach. It seemed this book was done with a gay tilt to it as well, which is fine if that's what one is looking for. Several of the images are of men together, hugging, admiring, etc. I hoped for more nudes on their own, instead of images provoking what happened before or what will happen after the photo was taken. Regardless, there are some nice physiques here, and the book is laid out in chronological order from the 1900s up to present day.

With deep regret, and wishing the thermostat worked, I am returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love/Hate","review":"I loved this heating pad due to its ability to provide a high temp moist heat and it is constructed so that it has a nice weight to it. What I didn't like about it was that the switch went out on it after about a year. I was able to fix it, temporarily, but ended up having to throw it out. I bought another one with a thermostat of the same brand and it was wonderful...until it wasn't. It only lasted about a year also. I use a heating pad about once a week, on average, so, for the price, I feel they should last longer.

I refuse to have surgery and I need all the help I can get with my neck and back pain. This heating pad is used daily and really helps me with the aches and pains. I have one for work and one for home.It does have a variable temp that cycles for a one hour period. Then it shuts off automatically. You decide the max temp and max time , then it does the up and down of variable heat in the range you have chosen. It is a moist heat that does get very hot if u lay directly on it. For example, I only use a 130 degree heat when i lay it under my back when i lay in bed because otherwise it gets too hot. However, if I use it for my neck while sitting up on the sofa, I use a max temp of 166 degrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the money","review":"I love my heat super hot and this product delivers. Heat is even over the entire product. Digital controls are easy to navigate.

Every once in a while(1 out of 200 attempts) it may actually show a temperature so I try to bask in that lovely moment which doesn't last if I deign to move the pad or my body 1 centimeter.

The heat is distributed evenly and this size is plenty big.I had one before and it did stop working. Calling/writing their customer support yielded no response so don't expect to get great customer service from TheraTherm but it was good enough that I purchased a second one. I believe the first one lasted 2-3 years and was well worth the money, I used it very frequently, packed it on trips, etc.Pros:Heats up quickly, digital thermostat, large sizeCons:Does go past the level you have set and then cools offControls do not retain settings through power loss"},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"I am very disappointed in this product.

I have fibromyagia and arthritis--the warm, moist heat feels so good! The only problem I have is they don't seem to last very long. I don't know if this is due to having them wrapped around your back, then sitting on them for low back pain. Mine gets a lot of use in many different areas and bent a lot.

In theory you can set and adjust the temperature and duration. However, the pad seemed to reach the set temperature and then turn off. Then it stopped working completely after 2 1/2 years. I just called their warranty person who basically said \\"what do you expect - it only has a 1 year warranty.\\". The sad state of American industry.

It worked great and I liked the auto shut-off feature (although i wish it maxed out at 120 min instead of 60). I didn't one it all the time either, probably 50 times throughout 15 months. Last week, I tried to turn it on and it crapped out on me! There was no damage to the cord, the pad, the remote - it just stopped working! I called the manufacturer and they have a strict 1 year warranty policy. So now I'm SOL. I guess I'll just buy a sunbeam from CVS.

Buzzer sounds longer when plugged in and 'ON' button is slower to activate. I am concerned that this is a sign that there will be more problems soon.

Nearly every time I have used this pad it has relaxed a nasty trouble spot within 20 minutes. My VERY WORST back spasm required two 30 minute sessions. Phenomenal.The controls are wonderfully logical and idiot proof, the workmanship and design first-rate.

I don't understand this stipulation at all although I am abiding by it. When the pad is in use, I'm either sitting up (in a forward leaning position) or lying down with it on top of my back. So far so good and I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing slight tenderness in their back or to help alleviate simple back soreness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promised but not delivered!","review":"Very disappointing!

Big surprise when I opened the box and did not find the TheraTherm Brand but a very poor quality GJO Global brand. Anyone ever heard of them? Very poor quality and controls made so cheap I can't trust the timer.I purchased this moist heating pad through Amazon and was surprised that Amazon allows this type of deceptive advertising.

The digital temp settings are said to be adjustable with a low temp of 113. Mine never was any lower than 128 - too hot for me even when I set it a 113.Be aware that if you want a low heat setting than this pad is not for you.The obnoxious odor was deal breaker from the beginning.

I put it back in the box and one week later took it back out to use. This time, it would not heat up at all. The controls would not operate,I followed closely all the directions but all I could get out of it was a high pitch squeal. I boxed it up and sent it back.

Some of the poses are easy and provide immediate beneficial effects. Others are more difficult and bring a sense of accomplishment when they are finally attained. However, some yield almost no relief or are too difficult to attain without sufficient strength. The postures are all pictured individually with tips and instructions which are usually easy to follow and are grouped into levels of increasing difficulty. There are also suggested flows and tools for partners to develop their own. Overall, this book can guide beginners into developing greater flexibility and trust as well as suggest more difficult movements when partners are ready to advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"This book is not at all as I expected.

I've used this cleaner for about 15 years--best I've ever used for pet stains; the stains seem to almost disappear! One small drawback is that it has a very strong odor and must be used in a well ventilated room, but the great results are well worth the inconvenience of the chemical smell.

He is now on the fourth book, having passed me at the end of the third one (SOMEONE has to go to work, after all). While I prefer Tolkien, and my son prefers Robert Jordan, we were both nevertheless engrossed with Marsden's story and characters. This is a very good \\"young adult\\" series that adults can enjoy as well. This volume (The Third Day, the Frost) returns to the form of the first book, after just a bit of a let-down in book two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"John Marsden is the best Austrailian author that I have ever read.

This book is grimly realistic, as well as incredibly exciting, and the characters are very, very believable, even to the fallout and boredom. My only complaint is that only the first four or five have been released in the United States. A very good, exciting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!","review":"I would just like to say, you've got one thing wrong, the fourth book in the Tommorow When The War Began series is not called 'The Killing Frost' it is in actual fact called, 'The Third Day, The Frost'. Why have has it been changed in the US? I think the original title is much better and it is how John Marsden would like it to be called. John Marsden is the most brilliant author to come out of Australia in years. His books, especially this series, are amazing. The characters become part of you, and they make you laugh and cry. It is must for every teenager around the world to read these books, it's a necessity. The only down side is that you never want them to finish, and when they do, you just want more and more. So a big thank you to John Marsden, of whom i have been lucky enough to meet on several occasions, and keep up the brilliant writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-Rending Debut by a Skillful American Artist","review":"Dryer, fronted by former Texan Rachel Browning, grabs the reigns of alt.country and gives them a good shake. Browning crafts beautiful songs from the American musical idiom: a reworked blues scale, country time, her plaintive voice (reminiscent of Neil Young), and a little feedback. Pianos, steel guitars, and acoustic instruments make frequent appearances, but seldom distract from Browning's archetypally spare style. Northwesterners can catch Dryer's frequent live performances at smaller venues from Bellingham to Eugene, but this disc is the next best thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - THIS IS NOT THE POP-PUNK BAND FROM NY","review":"Who wuddah thought that two bands would name themselves a name like that, but this record (outside line) is not a cd by the same band that recorded OUT OF THE LOOP and SATURDAY IN VAIN.

Eventually audio completely stopped working. The optical signal through this long cable is likely too weak for a robust connection. Any stress on the cable during install will result in failure. Trying digital coax instead, but I'm really bent that I have to run new cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended to the rich.","review":"Defenitely too expensive for too little music, but the music is fine. I don't get it why they had to put the album version of 'Not dark yet' on this cd, but they certainly managed it! 'Senor' is very well done, the best live version I know of this song. 'Tears of rage' gets lost somehow in the rich tapestry of guitar sound; the original version of this beautiful, heartfelt song (on 'The basement tapes') is so much better. 'Boots of Spanish leather' is the glory of this album: very intimate, obviously sung from the point of view of the looser in this funny yet bittersweet song. Bob Dylan's voice these days rather reminds me of a craw, but sometimes it fits perfectly with the song, and the artist certainly can't be accused of a lack of emotion. Don't know how he does it, but he still does it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I read this book while my boyfriend was out of town, and I must say it wasn't bad company. I first read 'The Kadin' as an impressionable young girl, and this book cemented my harem fantasy for life. 'The Love Slave' offers more of the same, albeit an even more implausible plot.But hey, I don't read these books for a dose of reality. (:The ending was fairly laughable, with the demise of the rogue Ali Hassan. I was unsure as to wht there was no resolution regarding the fate of Regan/Zaynab's sister back in Scotland -- I kept expecting her or one of her brethren to pop up in Cordoba, but was disappointed.Highly entertaining title, will keep you warm at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bertrice is always good","review":"It is true, to me her books are always good but be forewarned this one like many of her books has its shocking scenes- this was one of the rare times where I was actually more into the beginning half of the book than the second!The only thing I would really like to have seen/ known is what happened to her twin in the end- how it all worked out. That and a little payback to the nun!For those of you that love the bread and butter one man- one woman forever romances, you will probably not like this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"This is a very sexy book. How refreshing! If you are looking for a typical romance novel, stay away. Ms. Small's books are sexy and hot and historically accurate. This book is one of her hotter books, but it is fantastic! I love the story. I love the heroine, and I have read it and reread it countless times!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooooo emotional and not in a good way!!!!","review":"I read and rated another of Small's book and didn't like it. I had just started The Love Slave and all was going well at that moment. After I finish my other rating I ended up staying up all night and finished this book. I KNOW that I will never read any of Small's books again. There was no need for that much emotion and I mean VERY sad and upsetting emotion. Granted, Small does know how to write erotic sex scenes but that's it. I found myself not at all liking her stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book should be marketed under EROTICA, not ROMANCE","review":"This is the first Ms Bertrice's book I ever read and still don't Know what to make of it. The two main characters, Zaynab and Karim, fell in lust at first sight. Although the author tries to justify their \\"love,\\" I still can't believe that a relationship can be based on sex only. Zaynab also comes across as a pompous, pretentious person who needs to justify her actions to the reader. If she believes her actions are necessary for her survival, they need not be justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"So fake!","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that I have nothing against erotic romances. In fact some of my fav authors are Susan Johnson and Nicole Jordan who write really erotic stuff.But this novel had such an utter lack of characterisation that I was bored out of mind after the first few chapters!Even the so called 'erotic' scenes were a complete turn off. If you cannot feel anything for the primary characters, reading the steamy stuff becomes a bore, like reading the Penthouse letters or something.People looking for erotic romance should try Brenda Joyce's earlier works or the authors I mentioned previously.AVOID THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"kiddie porn","review":"I am sort of appalled that so many readers would rate this book so high. 5 stars for a story of a young girl (yes, girl) and a 28 year old man than a 50 year old man who use her sexually? The fact that so many find it \\"erotic\\" that a man would insert silver balls, use dildos rectally on a (age range in this story) 13-15 year old girl is sort of creepy. This is Ms. Small's idea of romance? Regan, a young Scottish lass, is sent to a convent at 13. Instead, she is sold as a slave to be tutored as a love slave for a Moor. Regan's twin sister, Gruoch, is to be married to a family enemy but is pregnant at the time of her wedding. Regan takes her place in the marriage bed so all would assume Gruoch was a virgin like Regan. When the wedding Regan is sent to this convent. Anyway, the story would have worked far better had Regan actually stayed at the convent for a few years than be sold. Again, the age of Regan is really crude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy...skanky...slutty sex!","review":"I needed a shower after reading this potpourri of porno, pillage and pretense!Ok, alliteration aside, this books is a poor excuse for a romance. There is no romance--just sex ad nauseum.I am no prude, but I like a plot here and there in my novels. And, lest we forget, a little romance would be nice too. This should be reclassified as historical erotica because the love scenes were devoid of love, the characters were hard to relate to and in some cases downright unlikable, and the ending was trite.I miss the books Small used to write...I guess all good things must come to an end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have read and enjoyed Bertrice Small before, but this book was nothing but erotica. In the beginning I thought it had a good story line, and I was very excited to read the book. After around page 50 or so, I had to give it up, and cut my losses. Up until this book, Ms Small had a place of honor on my library shelf. Not anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful ending","review":"this book was really touching! it is the moving story about a girl who never got the chance of experiencing love and belonging during the most vulnerable years of her life. when she finally finds love it is for a steep price! it is not hers for the taking!the story takes different turns and our heroine faces more than her share of challenges....but ultimately true and pure love prevails in the end.regan and karim are united forever! if you are a sensitive reader with a lot of empathy ,,,this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy twists and turns!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with the sexiness of the story but more than that I loved the places she speaks of and all the twists and turns if the story!!!

Otherwise, read it--you won't be disappointed. Purple prose it may be, but I have yet to read a romance that isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"This is one of Bertice's best. It has all the makings of a true love story, with all the steamy sex scenes. I couldn't put it down until I finished the whole book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dissappointed","review":"When I read the reviews I thought I was gonna read about a hot hot romance between Zainab and Karim....Unfortunately this book was not a romance. It focussed entirely on the heroine. Karim was there only in the begining of the book and then towards the end of it. While the love scenes were quite ok, most of them were with Zainab and other guys, which I didn't appreciate. In fact I was quite happy when I finished the book and stared reading The Lady's Tutor by Robin Schone....Now that is what I call an erotic romance.After reading The Love Slave, I have not bought anything by Ms Small as I feel she she dosen't write an erotic romance centred on the H&H; (which I like), she writes more about the sexual experiences of the heroine and focusses only on her(which I absolutely do not like)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Small-hot, hot, hot","review":"There are some books you leaf through and forget-this is not one of them. I couldn't put it down. The characters are great, the plot keeps moving and the rest---well, we all know what Small is famous for. The best of all Small's novels to date and a strong female lead. If only they could all be like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bertrice Small","review":"This was my first Bertrice Small book. I had run out of reading material and my friend loaned me her much read and mended book. I loved it, it had everything you read a romance for. Regan was a character that I could like. She was not silly, but at the same time she was not too hard. This book made me cry several times and that is always a sign of a good book. Set during a time period that I have never read before, and a harem... I must admit that I was not to sure, but don't let that put you off. It is a real page turner. The Love Slave is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excedllent Rosary prayer resource","review":"This is an excellent little resource for praying the rosary.

I highly recommend this book along with the other Rosary books by Larry London."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the rosary was meant to be....","review":"The rosary involves meditation on the mysteries specified and prescribed for CENTURIES- Joyful, Sorrowful, and Glorious. The idea of using an APPROPRIATE and RELEVANT scriptural verse (or any other short sentence or idea that is pertinent) seems to me to be a great way to say a rosary and meditate on the desired mystery...using just ANY-OL' verse, even a scriptural one, not-so-much....sounds like just-so-much distraction away from what a rosary is meant to be and accomplish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appreciation from an Art teacher","review":"I find it hard to believe two things -- one, that Patience Brewster has never won a Caldecott, and two that so many of the books that she has illustrated are out of print.We've missed the boat!

Each bar packs a significant amount of protein and tastes great (other than double chocolate, not so good).

That though is about the best part of the book, I wish it had been longer actually. It seems like they just filled out the remaining pages with outtakes from shoots. Only one or two of the prints seem to really capture the photographer the initial interview sets up. If you are a Bruce Weber fan, this book is only worth buying for a few bucks used, to get a sense of his process. Otherwise if you want to enjoy his work you're betting off spending your money on one of the several books he has published himself.Branded Youth: and Other Storiesis a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Results run 10 to 15 % Higher","review":"I switched to this product from The Ultra One Touch and my results jumped almost 15 points.

I even ran the positive control and everything tested fine. I'm not sure the product is accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but FWI the kit doesn't come with everything","review":"I haven't had a chance to try this out yet. The meter instructions look easy, most reviews I have seen rave about the lancet device and a fellow employee uses this brand and recommendeds it highly. She likes the fact that it uses very little blood and gives a reading quite quickly.If you do order this, be warned that it DOESN'T come with test strips or control solution and includes only 2 lancet drums ( ie 1 dozen lancets ) So pick up these 3 items along with your kit. I suppose it makes sense that they wouldn't want to include parishable items. The jar of strips won't fit inside the case, but it wouldn't be to hard to put a rubberband around the two. I liked that the kit came with a working battery, a nice warranty ( 2 years ) and a $15 off rebate as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it is supposed to do","review":"This is the first time I bought a glucose meter, so I dont have anything else to compare this against.

There is a sort of \\"calibration\\" you need to perform every time you are opening up a \\"new pack\\" of strips.

It was totally misleading. Secondly, it is nowhere mentioned that you also need the control solution in order to start using the whole thing. I was planning to give it to my parents who are leaving the country shortly. Now I don't have sufficient time to purchase the other items.

Fifteen years ago, Dees promised to stop fundarising at $55 million, only to raise that to $100 million two years later. Now he has $120 million and spends $6 million per year on fundraising and only half that much on helping victims of civil rights violations.

Although it has successfully filled its role as a conversation piece, as a book on leadership it is quite lacking. While I can't say I necessarily disagree with any of the advice given, none of it is presented in a very convincing or interesting way, and none of it is original or groundbreaking in any way. If you're looking for a real book on leadership, this isn't it. If you're looking for a book on Attila the Hun, this still isn't it. If however you're looking for a book to proudly display on your desk to make new hires do double takes, then this is the right book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great leadership training reference!","review":"We recently used this as a reference for supervisor training -- the book provided excellent material to facilitate a round-table discussion.

It's not selling out, it's not losing an edge, it's progression. The songs are not as heavy as before. They are prettier, more melodic, and more produced. This is one of the best produced CD's I've ever heard. The songwriting and composition has improved tenfold. They have grown up as a band. There are a lot more background, layered vocals than on the previous releases.There isn't anything that is over-produced or cheesy, but it is definitely produced. I'd compare this to what the Deftones have done - they're not as heavy as they used to be, but they've progressed and the new CD is absolutely GREAT. This is the type of CD you can pop in your CD player and listen to 15 times in a row and not get sick of it. It's amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.....","review":"I just stumbled onto this CD by dumbluck and it's pretty amazing. This reminds me of a little more harmonious Jimmy Eat World, very catchy stuff here.The only complaint i have is that the vocals are mostly unintelligable without the lyric sheet. I guess you could say it adds ambience and whatnot to the songs, but how the hell am i supposed to sing at the top of my lungs to it in the car if the vocals are unclear?I would recommend this CD to anybody who is a fan of rock music- whether you like At the Drive In or Hootie and the Blowfish.

Reminiscent of NYC's finest Quicksand, Elliot play beautiful, emotionally charged RocknRoll with pure vigor and astoundingly tight muscianship. Hats off to Kevin Ratterman who drives the band with fluid masterful drum work and fills that would make Neil Peart proud. Chris Higdon's guitar playing and vocals are also solid ranging from soft and pretty to powerfully strong and emotive. With a style similar to Gloria Record, Jimmy Eat World and Texas is the Reason Elliot melds their influences into one of the most infectious indie rock albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER","review":"My boyfriend introduced me to this cd like 3 months ago, and since then, I've been searching for it EVERYWHERE!

They stand miles above today's viscious, badly drawn, stupid cartoon-lookalikes. The cover promised a few all-time favorites such as Quickdraw McGraw, but sadly, there was only ONE Quickdraw film in the whole show -- and no Huckleberry Hound, no Yogi Bear, no Mr. Jinx, etc. In one segment there was a round table discussion of experts on the creation and uniqueness of the Quickdraw series, but it did not make up for the absence of at least 2 or 3 more of the real thing itself.

In trying to co-opt and explain away the radical thought Cruse exemplifies, Crouch comes off as an interloper trying to mute the legacy of an independent intellectual giant.I prefer any version of this classic other than this latest New York Review of Books printing which gives an unoriginal literary lemur like Crouch free reign to propagandize his views into legitimacy. Get your hands on an \\"Apollo Edition\\" or the version published by \\"Quill\\"!! Stanley Crouch could easily find a home for his essay in the neo-liberal journal of his choice, but including his introduction as part of the book itself is a travesty.

In this effort he returns to his roots and offers a brilliant collection of songs on par with his first solo album (Del Rio, TX 1959). Hopefully, he'll abandon further attempts to break into country top 40 radio play and settle in among an elite peer group of singer songer writers (Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen, Kieran Kane, Kevin Welch, and a scant few others)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaguar","review":"Jacob has to stayin a old persons home so his dad can go on an adventer in the rain foriest to catch a Jagaur for a presurve and the guy that won'ts this done is very rich and like Jagurs but he's gready and won't help.Then a mounth later his dad faxed him at the old folks home and told Jacob he could vist for a while so he packed his stuff then Jacob went over to the airport and seen a tall linkey man holding a sigh saying his first and last name so Jacob went over there and the man said hi then he said you must be Jacob and they both left in his old rusty truck and went to his warehouse it was old to they were there for a while his dad showed up and he was very happy to see him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderous Adventure","review":"Jake is a very curios and adventurous kid and he has just come back from an adventure in Kenya when his father goes down to brazil.

It's especially disappointing because I was actually an extra on it (when I was rather young, and I didn't make the final cut, which isn't why I dislike the film). The film was a chore to sit through, another example of taking an SNL sketch (a memorable one, mind you) and stretching into an 85 minute bore. It doesn't help that Franken, who I never thought was hilarious, is not a great lead actor and he can't really carry this film. He's a decent writer who is quite overrated in my opinion (and rather smug on his radio show). The film tries for seriousness at times, but then Stuart Smalley is so silly and over the top, you're not sure what the filmmakers intended. Despite the fact that the actual shoot was very, very enjoyable, the result here is very poor and disappointing.

Besides the \\"proof being in the pudding\\" so to speak, Permatex dries (after about 3 coats) to a black finish that can be painted over with replacement or touch up paint, or a full vehicle or item paint job. I have used it on the fenders of my truck as well as a wood stove cover plate to convert a fireplace to take a 6\\" stove pipe.

In desperate attempts at troubleshooting on our own, we discovered that it would work intermittently, then found that this was due to a rod in the hinge slipping out of place and somehow not allowing the circuit to complete. A few whacks with a hammer and tugs with pliers moved the rod back into place, and we were merrily sealing our cookie bags once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Sealer got here within no time i love it i use it for cookies... looking for a vacumm sealer any ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs the tapes","review":"This entire book is designed to be used with tapes that are not included. In order to buy the tapes you must purchase them with the book again. The book and tape set came highly recommended. But all of the excercises, all of the dialogs, and all of the pronunciation must be derived from the tapes. I believe that it is criminal misrepresentation on the part of the publisher to sell this book separately. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I have not read this book, but I saw the TV movie starring Bing Crosby in one of his last roles back in the 70s. It's a chilling story about how we can rationalize ourselves into doing morally repugnant things.

There are some discrepancies, such as \\"I want to eat cake\\"---most likely you would say \\"I would like to eat cake\\", but my tutor says I wouldn't get thrown out of a restaurant or someone's home if I said \\"I WANT\\"!Phrases are grouped by topic and are listed by page number in the index. Pronunciation is below each phrase. Don't be confused by the \\"floating\\" /y/--it is explained, but can still lead to one saying the y sound, instead of softening the preceeding consonant (they probably should have used a non-letter symbol).A good starter book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Look but Not a Timeless Construction","review":"I have been searching for a classic stainless steel bottle opener that did not have any plastic in it's construction to replace the tchotchke openers that I've collected over time. I realize this item is only five bucks, but am unimpressed with the cheap stamped steel construction. The metal is pitted, and the finish on the tip of the opener chipped off almost immediately. This is a kitchen tool that is supposed to remove metal bottle caps and open metal cans.

The only difference that I could find is that the store bought pairs tag was made with Lycra Spandex and the Amazon bought pairs were made with Spandex...That said the new pairs from Amazon did not seem to have the same elasticity to them and therefore, did not conform the same way...

This specific technique is very useful in dealing with emotional stress preventing overload of unwanted emotions leading to emotional balance.The pearl (the product of Fusion meditation) is then projected out through the crown to form an energy or soul body which an spiritual aspirant needs to connect with the stars, planets and God Source.The contents of this book when applied by a meditator of eastern or western traditions hold the key for manifesting the spirit through the energy or soul body."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Bible du Kossa Kossa","review":"This piece is the best one among makossas be it encompasses many makossa song in one piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT DANCE COLLECTION!!","review":"ANOTHER GREAT DANCE COLLECTION FOR TRUE LOVERS OF DANCE MUSIC.

After a few pages, I wished that, further than reading the back cover blurb, I had flipped through the book to glean some of the choice accusations, then I wouldn't have wasted the money. As another reviewer puts it, I too can't believe the audacity of the publisher to have endorsed such garbage.Of course it's not outside the realm of possibility that a young, then unknown actress might have had an unwanted pregnancy... but the author is clearly quite insane when he claims to be a victim of unsuccessful attempts of assasination commissioned by his 'mother' not to mention the possibility of his being the result of possible Nazi experiments performed on Hepburn with her knowledge.Stuart Byscynki needs professional help and he should get it quick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a book","review":"This \\"biography\\" doesn't even deserve one star. It is filled with ridiculous fantasies of the author. Do not even attempt to take this book seriously, as it is complete and utter nonsense. I can't believe that anyone would have the audacity to publish this type of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't be taken in","review":"The author of this book makes many wild claims that totally contradict all known knowledge of Audrey Hepburn. The main thread of his book is his claim that he is the unrecognised illegitimate son of this fine and noble lady. Yet, Audrey was well known to have been deeply in love with her children and to put them a long way before herself. The claims made by this man just do not fit at all. If you are an admirer of Audrey and all that she stood for, you will find this book disturbing and painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is all lies","review":"This book is completely full of lies. DO NOT BELIEVE THE AUTHOR! Being a huge Audrey fan, and having read many books on her, I would recommend \\"Audrey - Her Real Story\\" by Alexander Walker. It is most enjoyable and accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies! All lies! This is not a good book to read.","review":"This book or piece of trash, to put it lightly, is extremelydemeaning to Audrey Hepburn. Anyone who possesses any sort ofadmiration for this very talented, very beautiful, very benevolent woman should know that the facts in this book are a great deal contradictory to all the knowledge we have of her. Audrey had many miscarriages and was completely devastated each time. She loved her children very much. In fact, she was kind and generous to everyone. I think that this Stuart Byczynski, whoever he may be, ia a liar and has entirely too much time on his hands. He probably has a severe oedipus complex and only wishes Audrey was his mother out of lust. At any rate, I do not reccomend this book. It is full of painful lies and all Audrey fans just might decide to find the sick man and put him out of his misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe a word in this book","review":"Unfortunately the author has picked Audrey Hepburn as his mother- he should have picked Greta Garbo or somebody like her.It would have been more fitting.Audrey's life was full of sad and unhappy experiences and certainly did not lead the life like this author says she did. I am very disappointed that the world has people that write trash like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoid egocentric conspiracy trash","review":"This guy blah, blah, blah's forever without producing any substantial evidence. He blames Audrey Hepburn for the abuse from his adoptive parents. Plus, he think she has controled every aspect of his dismal life--from his jobs to his girlfriends. He writes in circles. He never says anything. He is delusional--a conjoined twin separated after his birth? Audrey Hepburn's son? He wishes his life was interesting--his fiction isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless nonsense","review":"In this hyper-world of gotcha this ranks right up there with the sightings of Elvis. This trumps all including the Vegas odds makers who likely would rate an Elvis sighting a better bet! Why in the world would anyone publish such rubbish?

In a word, SHAME on any one who gives support,moral or financial, to this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"pulp fiction","review":"I give one star for his effort and congragulate Stuart on his audacity to print such fiction.

A quick read of this book takes me a few months to complete. However, the time is definietly well spent. Edwards powerfully showed how the work of redemption was carried on through the time from the fall to the end of the world. It is truly amazing how edwards cover the redemptive history with a strong link on the destruction of Jerusalem, the time of constantine, reformation, the rise of anti-christ, etc. You must not miss this book if you want to have a good perspective of biblical history. Don't settle for anything less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant speculative science","review":"This book is of incomparable value in adding to your collection of works designed to stimulate imaginative ways of looking at the universe and of freeing one's point of view from conventional thinking. As a springboard to highly imaginative speculation about the nature of physical reality, Tom Pawlicki has journeyed alone to places that are valid and worthwhile, where conventional thinkers rarely go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"Forget about the \\"plans and ideas about earth-shattering concepts... free unlimited energy... powerless international telecommunications..... how to build a flying saucer and other rad stuff...\\"Buy it because it does a great job of leading you to the concept of a three-dimensional standing wave pattern..... The true definition of GRAVITY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science denied by prejudice","review":"This is an outstanding book. Not so much by the scientific true that it reports, but mostly by the fresh new insight into some matters that scientists have blacklisted from their views of science by sheer prejudice. It is not written with the illiterate reader in mind and it's not a book for everyone. However, if you have some interest in science, you should read this book. Not only it will make you think (which is the primary purpose of any book), but it may lead you to read further on the more controversial matters (namely Velikovsky and Tesla). If you do so, you will find yourself wondering why the whole scientific community made a spectacle of itself by rejecting any scientific approach to refute Velikovsky theories. Instead they all threw out their irracional gut feelings and fears - What is so appaling in Velikovsy's work that can make all \\"scientists\\" act this way? Decide for yourself - Read on and have an opinion! That's what's it's all about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected,","review":"the book is not what I expected.

Willie is concerned because a man is stalking him and he wants Sharon to find out why. As she begins the investigation, the stalker is killed and Willie is the chief suspect. Sharon begins to uncover some strange occurrences in connection with the murdered man, and before it's all over her own life is put in jeopardy. This is a good mystery which Marcia Muller fans will want to read and it has some romance thrown in for good measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muller too early","review":"Probably the least enjoyable Muller book I've read so far. This shows her early difficulties with character development and plot excitement. Her more recent novels have a lot more to offer the picky mystery reader. (McCone's life gets a lot more exciting as she ages!!!!)Mixing up the torah business with the Santa Cruz mountains and PTSD and the flea market just somehow didn't work for me. Usually I enjoy Muller's ramblings around Northern California; however, the wandering just didn't work for me here.Also, wondering why so many reviewers on Amazon.com feel it necessary to do a plot summary and possibly spoil key plot developments? A review ought to be our opinions, right, not giving away most of the story before we even open the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the selling?","review":"I subtracted one star because the author heavily favors drawing with pencil and paper and then scanning the image into the computer and going digital from there. You can scan the Mona Lisa into the computer, that doesn't make Da Vinci a digital artist. I felt it also gave short shrift to vector based art, as a result of the paper & pencil origins.From four stars, I cut the rating in half, because there is only half a book here. If it had been called \\"How to Draw Digital Cartoons\\" I would have left it at four stars, but the title says \\"and Sell\\" so I expected something about selling. In fact, that's really what I was looking for in this book. There are only three pages about making money, and over 1 page of that is graphics. The bottom line, apparently, is that you won't make money with digital cartoons. Fine. But if that's the case, then the title is very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Man Standing...again?","review":"How the hell can they release two movies named \\"Last Man Standing\\" in the same year,especially when they have nothing else in common except that they are action movies(And that the one with Bruce Willis is better).Well anyway in this movie Jeff Wincott plays this cop whos being chased by both sides of the law and he actually gets stains in his suit(He wears the same kind of suit all the time in different coloours)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Jeff Wincott film","review":"This was a great action film with top-notch performances by the multi-talented Jeff Wincott (sporting an awesome pair of snakeskin boots!) and a quality supporting cast. The stunts (especially the opening ones in the hotel and the bank) were teriffic. For being a straight-to-video film, I found the action and the storyline to be of better quality than a lot of bigger-named films in the theaters. I've rented this one twice and will probably rent it again. Wincott's films are almost always guaranteed to be worth watching. He's way too under-rated for his acting and martial arts talents. I look forward to seeing more from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Wincott the actor","review":"Last Man Standing is by far one of Jeff Wincotts best performances as an actor to date! Many other reviews of this movie have stated the same. Car chases, fast martial arts action, tough bad guys (and lady). Most of all, the acting was very impressive. This cast really rehearsed its scenes which earn this movie a five star rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous.","review":"The shootout in the Hyatt totally lost me before it was even through.

She recommends an action-oriented consulting approach that ensures the real problems and potential solutions are identified before selecting training as an intervention. Her approach is practical and recognizes the time and resource constraints that learning consultants, managers, and their companies operate within. I have ordered copies for all of my staff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Met my needs","review":"I bought this collection for the sole purpose of providing a relaxing environment prior to going to sleep and found it available as a used cd for a ridiculous low price. I can't evaluate it in terms of quality performances because it works as I intended; it makes me drowsy and aids in preparing me for sleep. But for the used cd price, it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of crap","review":"Less than one hour, this recent documentary has a few interviews with the little people such as fans and locals who recall the 1967 fiasco of Magical Mystery Tour, a Paul creation done in the immediate wake of Brian Epstein's death a month before. There is no actual Beatles music here, just muzak instrumentals of the soundtrack songs. There is a fair amount of cutting room stuff of the group on this fall 1967 jaunt around the south of England, but very little actual soundtrack material, aside from a couple of radio interviews done at the time. Spencer Davis and the guy from the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band reminisce a bit, as does Mike McCartney. Victor Spinetti narrates. Because of licensing, there is no footage or music from the rarely seen film itself, which makes this product of interest to Beatles completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy!","review":"if i could give this video less than one star i would have. i unknowingly purchased this video for my husband as part of a special BEATLES birthday gift along with other beatles movies and a 'beatles' encyclopedia. this DVD was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent. it is nothing more than 90 minutes of depressing interviews with people barely involved in the making of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR who have nothing of any importance to say. even our children, who have been to liverpool and sung on the stage of the 'new' cavern and are die-heart beatles fans, begged us to 'turn it off!' i'm not even wasting money to return it. we feel it is a sad and desperate way to steal money from die-hard fans like us."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is his worst and not worth anyone's time","review":"Don't waste your money on this.

I found it dull and unappealing. It lacked the suspense of the previous books in the series and to me the main characters did not really connect--there was very little chemistry between them Quentin and Diana. It was a very basic story that lacked a real punch, unlike the other stories in the series. I was extremely disappointed and will think carefully before reading the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Book Review","review":"Listened to the audiobook. Originally thought it was more of a mystery/thriller novel, but it ended up being more of a romance novel instead. The first few chapters (disks) were engrossing enough to get me to listen through the end. But, the end itself and the second half of the book in gerneral was disappointing.As the novel moves more from paranormal mystery to romance in tenor it bogs down quite a bit. It's not horrible, but I can't recommend it given the opportunity cost of bypassing something more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill of Fear","review":"As usual, Kay Hooper has written another outstanding book! Her Bishop Triologies are my favorites and this one was awesome.

The larger premise--a special wing of the FBI staffed by psychics--completely hooked me, but this novel quickly devolved into standard genre schlock with all its weaknesses: \\"Characters\\" who interchangeably spout exposition, contrived romance, and so on.Here's hoping other books in the series are more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great mystery.... not a romance","review":"I got about one third of the way through before giving up on this book. Without knowing anything about the author, it seems like a romance novelist trying to write a mystery, and I think readers of both genres will be disappointed in this book.This is my first Amazon book review, from an avid mystery reader who hopes to write more reviews to help others as I have been helped by these reviews. I am not overly critical of books and if it's an enjoyable read, that's what matters to me. I won't spoil the plot, but will give my honest opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I am a big Kay Hooper fan and a big fan of the SCU gang. I did enjoy this book.

Also, because so much of the \\"suspense\\" part of the story was background info. and previous incidents, it just didn't give me the same sense of urgency as a suspense novel should. Not bad, but not really good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good","review":"I am a big Kay Hooper fan and have been looking forward to this installment since the day I finished the last one, last year. I am very dissappointed in this one, it wasn't quite worth the wait. I did enjoy it, but it doesn't have the grip her stories usually do. The characters didn't have the strong connections of most, they seemed to be lacking a little bit. The ending was unsatisfying for me. The interaction between Bishop and the other characters was almost nonexistant, and that was a little let down as well. In her other books he has always taken a big roll in the story even if it was behind the scenes. To see him left to minor mentions left the story out of balance to me. I will continue to read this series, but may not rush out on release day and drive around town to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"chill of fear","review":"Kay Hooper continues to be one of my favorite authors.

Some of the songs rouse our sense of injustice. Others awaken our empathy. And still others evoke personal and familial feeling. Some are just plain fun.It's refreshing to hear music that does more than get your toes tapping. The songs on Gas Money make you think and feel not just about yourself but also about the world around you.Candaele's music has echoes of John Hiatt and Dave Alvin. It tells stories of real people we know exist. They struggle, like we do, often with a sense of humor. The music is both personal and political, sometimes in the sense that the personal is political and sometimes in the sense that we have political responsibilities we too often abdicate. Not that Candaele is preachy or didactic. He's fun and ironic, while also serious and sincere.Gas Money is a great first album. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but not not the original","review":"Awesome new mixes of a great song. Both Part I and II.

Everything goes downhill from here.What was most troubling was that the book contains many factual innacuracies (confusing intra/extra lobar sequestration, creutzfeld-jacob virus as the causative factor in PML, I could go on and on. After doing half of the cases, I stopped believing much of what the authors had to say in the discussions.Many typos which did not bother me. Annoying unrelated questions and long useless discussions. Poor differentials in most cases. Their differential for a JNA was every tumor under the sun that could happen in the nasopharynx of a teenage boy.Having said all that, there are very few case related resources for the orals in pediatrics. I think that for $40, this book is still better than nothing.

The book is okay, at best for its choice of topics and superficial discussions. However, the discussions have little to do with the images. There is no explanation of the findings.

This isnt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Series!","review":"This is the worst of the Case Review series. It has poor image quality. The cases and images are poorly chosen and are not representative of classic presentations.

Try to even find a differential diagnosis in the rambling explanations and you may be eligible for a cash prize!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"better than nothing","review":"Quick release is a poor design. The plate is difficult to tighten, and even at that, slight camera movement loosens it off. The interface between plate and tripod is poor too, made of plastic, the tolerances to fit are sloppy and there is a little snap mechanism to hold the securing latch that loses tension over time, rendering it useless. As a tripod, it is very unsteady with center mast extended and lowest legs extended. If used with just the legs splayed and the camera bag looped over the legs for weight/ballast, it does a fine job, and in that respect, better than nothing. All locks work well with the exception of the plate latch/lock which is the most important one. This tripod is relegated to holding a flash for me.Save your money and buy something more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, Run, Don't Look Back!","review":"After reading the book through twice, I have found it not only confusing but positivly frustrating. There is no way to follow the code examples straight out of the book and expect them to run in the normal compiler. You MUST use the CD which is poorly laid out and a simulation of a vb enviornment. Code Explaination was cryptic, and Examples although ample were useless because they would not compile.

She enjoyed it thoroughly. Blackwell's story is an inspiration to anyone and this book does an excellent job of telling it in a way that a child can fully appreciate. The book is fast-paced enough to keep a young reader's attention yet with enough detail to give them a full picture of the medical pioneer's life. The narrative is supported by a number of text boxes containing background information which truly round out the story. The overall result is that the reader leaves the book with a sense that they know not only about Blackwell but also about the context in which Blackwell made her achievements.

I do agree that it is a good workout and will tone your body gradually, which is healthy. Here are my complaints. I felt this workout was disorganized. Billy often stops to talk to you to try to motivate you but he is so out of breath that it sounds like a mouthfull of nothing. Also, billy is so busy talking that it appears he forgets how many reps per side have been done and many times the reps are unequal (one of my big pet peeves). My final and biggest complaint is that Billy frequently says \\"one more set\\" and there is more than one.

I try to watch this movie at least once a year because I love it so much. If for nothing else, watch this movie to see Mickey Rourke as a young actor who had all the looks any guy could hope for. The acting of Rourke and Eric Roberts is great and they do a great job connecting in this movie. I thought that Daryl Hannah was the worst in this movie, but she doesn't really matter too much. This is a story about the two main characters, their loyalty to each other and trying to get ahead in a world you are stuck in. A lot of humor and drama highlight this film. It all looks great and the supporting cast (save Hannah) is terrific. This is a movie you can watch time and time again, as I think it gets even more interesting as the years go by. 5 stars for this, one of my all time favorites and a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real slice of N.Y. life.","review":"\\"The Pope of Greenwich Village\\" was the ONLY movie adapted from a novel that remained true to the book. It could be because the book's author, Vincent Patrick, also wrote the screenplay.Mickey Rourke was very good in the role of Charlie but Eric Roberts was just over the top as Paulie. Roberts was the movie. I could (and I do) watch this flick over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROURKE, ROBERTS, SINATRA SINGS \\"SUMMER WIND\\"","review":"What more can you ask for (Lou Monte doing LUNA LUNA LUNA, it's here). POPE is Vincent Patrick's best written work and his screenplay works with Rourke and Roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles. The inside buzz is Michael Cimino sat in the directors chair, but evidence to the contrary is offered: The film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors. Instead, POPE is a raucous and likeable tale of NYC bottom feeders whose only place in Trump Tower would be behind a broom. Geraldine Page gives an Oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her Best Actress win for TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL. She's more enjoyable here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!! Two Copies Purchased - Both have video freeze at same location","review":"I purchased two copies of this movie on separate occasions. The first one I purchased experienced video freeze at the scene where Eric Roberts is about to get his thumb whacked. I thought it was just an anomaly and because I like this movie so much I ordered another copy. The second copy has the same problem and freezes at the exact same location in the movie. I've tried them both on a number of different DVD players with the same result. I suspect the company who burned the DVDs has an issue with their equipment or software.I love this movie and will just have to wait until it comes on a premium movie channel and 'Tivo\\" it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cool","review":"How cool was Mickey Roarke? Check this film out and see for yourself. I love this movie. Micky plays Charlie a small time hood tryin to go straight in New Yorks little Italy, No matter how hard he tries he just can't escape the neighborhood or his Lowlife cousin Paulie,wonderfully acted by Eric Roberts. Yes at one time he could act too (See Star 80). Rounding out the cast are Geraldine Paige, Daryl Hannah and Kenneth McMillon, But the movie belongs to Rourke it was a springboard to things that never were to be.

It took my breath away. The pace and depth of the detail and quality this work shows is fantastic. Normally a sequal does not measure up to the first.However this book overshadows its first by far. The emotive writing that was shown in 'Corner House girls' is carried through into the second book. The passion the characters show fulfills all imagination. Every loose end is carried through or tied up, leaving no room for doubt as to how the reader wants each character to develop. These wishes are not all fulfilled but the story benefits from these changes and grows, if possible, even stronger. A great read, again and again. When will another be produced to carry on the story of these much loved characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for likers of Hip Hop and R&B and Love The Lord","review":"I have been sleeping on Canton Jones too.

I had listened to one of the earlier cd's before but for some reason they did not catch my attention enough to buy them. I went back and sampled them and I don't know why I did not buy them in the first place. So, I will definately be purchasing the earlier two. I will continue to search for more artist on fire for Christ that make music like this that young people can enjoy and relate to. This man is annointed.

This gives the novel a fresh style and a natural flow. The true strength of the work, however, is its dealing with the nature and impact of poverty--a thematic element in most of Dostoevsky's works. While this novel lacks the depth and substance of Dostoevsky's later writing, this is impressive considering it was his first published work--when he only 25 years old. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I really didn't know what to expect when I picked this book up. I tell you I couldn't put it down. I love the way Mr. Duplantis talks to you the reader, as if he has known you forever and he is very funny.

The characters are all over the place, the plot meanders and Puzo can't decide if it's set in the future or the present. (He invents a futuristic chemical brain scan as a convenient plot device, yet the story is set in present time.)One particularly irritating facet of this book was that the few women in it are in very minor roles, even the Vice President, and are invariably described in terms of their sex lives.As for the plot being \\"parallel\\" to our current troubles in the Middle East and with terrorism, these problems are nothing new and have been around in various forms for decades. The US isn't known for learning from its mistakes.This is the only book that I have ever thrown into the trash. I read it on a plane and tossed it into a trash can on my way to the baggage claim.

It is my experience that churches, pastors and congregations are totally confused and uninformed regarding music for their church.

I think before we can argue about the \\"Comtemporary Christian Music Debate\\" we need to be well informed on every level. Mr. Miller does just that. The book helps to clarify what is true and what we have heard from others. Every Christian needs to be informed on this subject. His research is both fascinating and extensive.

Lala is dynamite and brings an added dimension of greatness to an album that's otherwise really wonderful. I highly recommend this album to anyone seeking killer percussion.

For me it's very close to being a classic 70's recording, and if you like Stills' songwriting, voice, and guitar work, this is a great collection.In fact it's the best work Stills ever did. I have a feeling that Chris Hillman deserves more credit than is ever given him for the more successful moments throughout. It is Stills' show, but the band is topnotch. At times the instrumentation is overdone (trying to keep 7 players busy I guess), and the intonation of the vocals sounds a little flat a few times, but there are some great songs here, superb guitar playing, and the band sounds alive and spirited throughout (a treat to hear in the era of digital sound)."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WORK OF PURISTS -- THIS IS PURE TALENT","review":"There is no doubt about it. Stephen Stills is a musical purist. He respects music and his talent shines through like a beacon.

The pure talent and great guitar playing and rich harmonizing is such a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great band, but this is the only album you must have","review":"Stephen Stills fought a lot of wars, mostly within himself. His own Civil Wars brought him (back) to Manassas, the one station in his career you can't afford to miss. Originally released as a double-album, 'Manassas' takes you in different directions, from bluegrass to country-rock, to Latin and rock 'n roll.

We liked the reactions of her best friends and how she resisted their trying to control her life. We have watched this movie several times and will continue to enjoy it. My wife and I definitely recommend this movie. In fact, I am several years older than my wife and I hope that when I am gone, she can have such good luck as Jackie in Flirting with Forty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Handel at Home\\" as he would have loved it","review":"The London Handel players played these pieces with great sensitivity and skill. Rachel Brown's flute playing is a sound of ethereal beauty. These pieces gleaned from John Walshes publications of Handel's time were intended to be played by amateurs to recreate those arias which they had heard in operas. It succeeds admirably in meeting this objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - \\"GIVE IT UP\\" is not the live version!!!","review":"Please preview the songs before purchasing. I did a one click download of the entire \\"Blow You're Face Out\\" album and it includes only the studio version of \\"Give It To Me.\\" I am not sure if this an Amazon issue or done intentionally by Rhino. I can't find the live version on Amazon.Other than that this is good stuff. As one reviewer indicated a few of the songs do get tedious and it's not as good as \\"Full House\\" but I would still recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low energy.","review":"Being a huge fan of J. Geils' \\"Full House,\\" I was encouraged by some reviews here to believe that \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" was a similar live effort. But the only similarity is that they were both recorded live. \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" is funky and laid back. Not bad, if that's what you want. But anyone expecting something along the lines of Full House will be tremendously disappointed. In fact, \\"Lookin' For Love,\\" which will knock your socks off on \\"Full House,\\" is done as a slow, elavator Muzac tune in \\"Blow Your Face Out.\\" Why did they even bother?The energy level, which is consistently frenzied on Full House, rarely gets above \\"low\\" on \\"Blow Your Face Out.\\" After listening to it twice, I realized there is no song on it that I want to hear again. Not that aren't a couple good songs on it. There just are no high energy songs other than House Party. I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Live albums.....EVER!","review":"\\"Blow Your Face Out\\" is in a league with only a handful of other live albums. Alongside The Allman Brothers' \\"At the Filmore East\\" and Cheap Trick's \\"At Budokan\\". All three of the records \\"Get it.\\" Not a bad track in the bunch. Every song on \\"BYFO\\" is better than its original studio version.Recorded in Boston and Detroit back in 1975, J. Geils was on, and I mean on. From the intro to Musta Got Lost to the pumped up version of Lookin' For A Love. Geils was having a ball on stage and it comes through loud and clear on this recording. Highly recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live album by Great Live Band","review":"At their mid-seventies peak these guys were known as the poor man's Rolling Stones and for good reason. First, they played straight ahead rhythym and blues based Rock and Roll with fire, passion, and authority. Second, frontman and showman extrordinaire Peter Wolf could have shown Jagger a few moves. This album showcases two shows - in Boston and Detroit - and most of the band's great songs. The liner notes will tell you that the band saw itself as being at their peak and it's Mt. Everest. They're tighter than the Stones have ever been (on their live recordings anyway) and Wolf' s \\"Wooba Gooba\\" monologue sequing into \\"Musta Got Lost\\" should earn him a forefather's award from the rap music industry. Peak 70's Rock and Roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funkiest Band in the Land","review":"I saw the band perform at the Worcester Centrum on Jan. 2, 1983.

Geils Band","review":"An apt salute to the six studio albums of boogie rock that the J. Geils Band had recorded between 1970-1975, this 1976 live extravaganza showcases the band at their best--performing live! It is also a capable followup to 1972's Full House, which remains one of the best live recordings of any American band in the 20th century!Released at a time when live albums were big sellers (Frampton Come Alive, Kiss Alive, i.e.), this underated gem gives the band a chance to deliver their best songs with irreverent energy and unstoppable rythym that'll have you dancing within the first two minutes of the opening \\"Southside Shuffle\\" till the last chords of \\"Give it to Me\\"Some may find Peter Wolf's banter a bit lengthy and/or annoying in between many songs on Blow Your Face Out! Others may find Wolf's pre-rap, D.J.'ish chatter a novelty....Either way it's in-your-face fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Live","review":"I am a child of the 60's and 70's.

I would highly recommend it for grades 6 and on up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Standard for IMAX - but educational","review":"I'm an IMAX fan, so I was a bit disappointed in the limited use of the format and cinematagraphy in The Mystery Of The Maya. It's not that it is a bad documentary; it is indeed quite educational. The problem is that it is just a documentary, without the IMAX eye candy that causes folks to buy big screen sets and pilgramage to BIG screen theatres with each new release. Compare this to Blue Planet or Everest at 5 stars and it's hard to come up with more than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing IMAX title","review":"I have watched many of the IMAX films that have been released on DVD. This one stands out as one of the most disappointing ones I have seen. I actually fell asleep watching it - and I wasn't particularly tired. The film starts out with a great flyover of the coastline with a Mayan temple. After that it quickly loses that special IMAX expectation of panoramic shots and \\"grandness.\\"I found the storyline quite tiring and merely a distraction to what was being taught. While educational, if the focus on close ups and limited camera visual scope is what the authors wanted to get across then standard video footage would have been enough. The dilution of the IMAX expectation knocked off at least 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"40 minutes of nothing","review":"I rented this DVD because I wanted to expand my knowledge, and refresh my memory, on the Mayan civilization since I had an AP World History exam coming soon. The film was a huge disappointment. I expected a documentary with hard facts about the Mayans, but the film gave me more information about the archeologists who studied the Mayan ruins, and their expeditions, rather than the Mayan civilization itself! I think I was better off going to the local library for a better video. Next time, I think I should just stick to documentaries made by The History Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic, etc. as they are more reputable for their documentaries. If you really want to learn about the Mayan civilization and its peoples, this film is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being fair","review":"This documentary is below the image IMAX standard, don't buy it if what you want is to see spectacular landscapes shots, but if what you want is a good introductory documentary about the Maya, pick up this one, you are not going to be disappointed. In a glimpse you can get a good quantity of information about this amazing people."},{"rating":"1","title":"very short, cheap production, not much knowledge to take away","review":"I got fooled by the marketing tagline: \\"as presented in IMAX theaters\\". It sounded like a high class audio and video production. It is actually super cheap: cinematography is un-inspired and technically sub-par.

These knife blades are very thin, relative to competitive products. My Santoku knife has a ding in the blade and a bent tip, just from regular usage. The good news is that Shun will repair or replace any knife for the life of them after purchase, so I'll be taking advantage of this.If you're hard on knives, save your money and spend less on Henckel or Wustof knives; the blades are thicker, heavier, and will withstand more punishment.

I've ordered dozens of DVD's from Amazon the past 2 years without any problems, until, \\"City Slicker's collector's Edition!\\" I do not blame Amazon for letting this happen once, BUT, when this happens at least twice, and they continue to sell it anyway, I think that's wrong!:( If I were Amazon, I would pull all of their stock of this movie and not sell it until the problem is corrected!!! So the saying goes, \\"One is either a part of the solution, or a part of the problem...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time this underappreciated classic gets some attention!","review":"I know how pre-release reviews are kind of pointless, but I just have to express my joy to see \\"City Slickers\\" finally get a proper DVD release. As to the extent of how substantial the new special features will be, only time will tell, but anything's better than the current DVD. I grew up with this film and it's one of my all-time favorites, but even from a non-biased point of view, I sincerely think it's one of the most underrated films of the 90s. Few films have ever so flawlessly balanced hilarity with heartfelt emotion.Can't wait for June 3rd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, horrible dvd","review":"I love this movie! Its among my top favorites. However, the DVD [is bad]! One reason, the dubbing. The first half of the movie is fine, but about half way through, the words being spoken by the characters dont match up with their mouth. It looks like a bad Bruce Lee movie! Im not one to complain, but it just kept getting worse! At one point the whole line was almost spoken before the characters mouth started moving! I just baffles me that those responsible for transfering this movie to DVD took no care at all in doing it! I really dont know how this DVD made it to stores without someone noticing this huge fault and trying to make it better. Like I said, this is my favorite movie, I give it the lowest rating for the lack of dubbing quaility!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Know, I Never Moseyed Before?","review":"You can't not like this movie. Billy Crystal plays such an adorable character, a complacent man turning 40 who gets talked into a crazy birthday adventure with his two best friends. Jack Palance does what he does best; he plays the intimidating roughneck whose hard edges are at times comical.This movie is a good gift for anyone who enjoys a good comedy. The characters seem very genuine, and the plot makes you long for a trip out west."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still funny after all these years","review":"I bought this movie after seeing the PBS tribute to Billy Crystal and remembering that this WAS a funny movie. This movie holds up really well after all these years. The comedy of a man's midlife crisis never gets old and all the players in this film were great. It was bittersweet to see the late great Bruno Kirby and a kick to see a very young Jake Gyllenhall before he was a star. Of course, this was Billy Crystal and Jack Palance's movie and they totally deliver the laughs, and are the heart of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly dated, but still a classic funny movie","review":"There are certain references in the movie (particularly in the setup begining) that give you clues that this is a bit dated, but once the movie gets going and the \\"City Slickers\\" are on the trail, it doesn't miss a beat. Billy Crystal is... Billy Crystal, and if you like him (I do), then this is vintage Crystal. Kirby, Palance and others are also fantastic and the laughs just keep on coming, even as the morals and life lessons come along throughout. To that end it is as thoughtful as it is funny, and if you are not entertained by this film... your funny bone is broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fun","review":"90 minutes of Entertainment. The story is so-so - but still it's fun to watch. Billy Crystal is one of my favorites anyhow, therefore the 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another old disc in new package","review":"Like others have indicated I also have a beef with Amazon on this title. First they sent me the standard edition in the standard edition packaging while charging for the Collector's edition. It was returned upopened and then they sent me the so-called Collector's edition. Only the case was the collector's ediiton, the disc inside was the original release with none of the special features. Is this an accident or is it deliberate? It certainly happens enough to raise the question. It ssems like the line between doing business and out right dishonesty is getting razor thin. I recently purchased two blu-ray players from Amazon and both were defective. In the future I will continue to purchase from Amazon.com but only from selling partners."},{"rating":"2","title":"This new Collector's Edition DVD is \\"Slicker\\" than ever,great job MGM Home Entertainment!!!","review":"I'm so glad that this modern day western classic is finally getting the treatment it deserves,after all it's one of the greatest films of the 90's and the now late Jack Palance won the little golden statue for his stellar performance(doing cartwheels on the stage to accept his award if I remember right). Just a great comedy all around with a great widescreen transfer and some \\"slick\\" extras!!! A true step up from the original bare bones(had a trailer only) release from a few years back. An awesome DVD re-release done right this time by MGM!!! Two thumbs up!

I received it and, while the cover states it is the Collector's Edition with the extras, it is not. So I returned it to Amazon, asking them to replace it, which they did remarkably quickly. Problem is, the replacement is exactly like the first one I received -- no commentary, no featurettes, no deleted scenes although the cover says they are there. So now I am trying to contact someone at MGM or Fox to sort this out. (Having no luck at that but I will continue to try.) I can't blame Amazon for having received mismarked packaging. I love the movie but I bought this as a replacement so I would have the extras and, alas, the extras are not there, so the rating is two stars because the product is not as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"city slickers","review":"I am 52 years old and I remembered seeing this movie when it first came out and thought it would be a great movie to watch with my teenage kids.

I actually apologized to my teenage kids and threw the movie away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alonzo Bodden is a Definite Winner with This Performance!","review":"I recently saw Alonzo Bodden on The Tonight Show, and thought he was really funny, so looked him up on Amazon.com and ordered this dvd, which was mentioned on the Tonight Show as just having been released. I highly recommend this DVD, \\"Tall, Dark and Funny\\" to Everyone, no matter what your ethnic background. He is not overly fouled mouthed, which personally, I like.

Most of the characters are not well-developed, so as various disasters happened on the voyage and characters were killed off one-by-one or in groups I didn't feel too upset as I hardly knew who they were anyway. That 95% of the story is one ill-fated adventure after another gets tedious. The religous aspect of the story is trite and predictable. Likewise the ending was pretty obvious. This is the first novel I've read by Silverberg; I hope his other ones are better. Off to the second-hand bookstore this one is going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silverberg at his best","review":"A small human population lives on an oceanic planet with only floating land masses, nothing that could support a spaceport, no humans will ever leave. They have an uneasy relationship with the native amphibious Gillies and at the story's opening the occupants of island Sorve are told they must leave.The real gem of this novel is the strikingly dangerous native life, the ocean's red-in-tooth-and-claw life, killing on member of the departing expedition after another.Misses five stars only because their ultimate destination, named in the title, is too mystical and vague, something about hive mind and living in accord with the planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solaris in waterworld without the characters knowledge","review":"Were to begin? the story is long but there is really only one character in it and it does not have enougt weight to carry you thru. The end is predictable and unsatisfying.The best part of the book are the monsters encountered during the voyage.Silverberg is quite a prolific writer and I'm sure that there are better books than this one. His short stories are great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jammin through the years!","review":"Monumental!!!! That comes to mind when I listen to this fabulous piece of history.

The music and sounds are also somewhat annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling Dance Dannii","review":"Forgo the 'Singles' collection and head straight for this compilation of remixes of Dannii's early hits. The remixes of the early 90s hits are more fun than substantive, particularly the mixes of 'Jump to the Beat', 'This is It' and 'Get Into You', but you'll enjoy the sugary dance beats combined with Dannii's sweet voice.CD2 is where the compilation hits its stride. The Trouser Enthusiasts remix of 'All I Wanna Do' and the Xenomania mix of 'Everything I Wanted' are magnificent and even over five years later, they have not lost their lustre and sound fresh today. These songs prove Dannii is a dancefloor queen and it's no surprise she followed these dancefloor classics with her excellent 2003 album 'Neon Nights'.Dannii may get overshadowed by big sister Kylie, but she is talented in her own right, and has a small, but impressive, body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaskan to the Core","review":"An Alaskan friend introduced us to this album, during our visit to Talkeetna (Doug Geeting's home town). We enjoyed it and went down to Nagley's Store to buy our own copy. We have played this album many times since our return. Each time we play it, we continue to enjoy wonderful memories of Alaska. But this album is much more than memories. The music is wonderful. It is an album that can be played and enjoyed over and over. Many of the songs are outstanding, and there are no duds. Each selection has something unique to offer. We enjoy folk music and this album is one of the best in our collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, man. This is terrible.","review":"I watch a lot of Asian movies. Lots of them. I consider myself pretty liberal as to other culture's versions of good movies.This movie, however, sucks, even by Chinese standards. The translation is bad, the camerawork is pretty much camcorder quality, sometimes worse. And the story is incoherent.The only good part, is it's like being in China. You see how it really is, which is neat."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAD TO COMPLETE THE SET!","review":"The main reason I purchased this DVD was because I grew up watching the original movie. It's been years since I've seen this one and when I found it on Amazon I just had to get it. I figured why not, I already had the first one on DVD. I just had to complete the set. Plus, I'm a HUGE Robert Fuller fan.The DVD arrived before it was due. Was in great shape and ready for play.Some movie critics blast this movie saying it's not as good as the first one. In my own personal opinion they are equal. But everybody is entitled to their own opinion.Good sequel, great cast.And great service from Amazon. As always.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return of the seven could have waited","review":"The man in black -Chris (Yul Brynner) returns to the mexican village he once saved in the original film. This time he and Vin ( a dull Robert Fuller filling in for Steve Mqueen) form a new 'Seven' in order to rescue the men of the village from the clutches of a mexican bandit bent on building a church as a tribute to his two dead sons. Among the men he captures is Chico of the origianl 7 (Horst Bucholz also chose not to appear in this sequel) rounding out the new Seven are Claud Akins, Warren Oates, Jordan Christoher. The second 'ride for the seven is much darker in tone than the original film and lacks the Panache of the original film (not to mention the cast) no one really cares what happens to this second seven. The film is very uneven with little or no character developement, some of the action sequences are very well done, Return of the Magnificent Seven would stand better as a companion piece to the original film than on the merrits of it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return of the Seven is Less than Magnificent","review":"The producers of the Return of the Seven just banked on the name,on Yul Brynner and on Elmer Bernstein's great score and the result is a very dull ,exhausting western. Westerns like these are the ones that hurt the genre. This sequel not only lacks the magnificent cast,plot,character development,but imagination as well. Whoever sees the Magnificent Seven and decides then to watch the Return of the Seven will be saying what Vin (Steve McQueen's character in the original) said at one point in the film:\\"It seemed like a good idea at the time\\". So follow Yul Brynner's advice.\\"Ride on...\\" and see THe Magnificent Seven over and over these seven will never disappoint you ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass the popcorn.","review":"Return of the Seven is great Saturday afternoon entertainment.

Not as good as the first \\"Seven\\" but good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring And More Boring","review":"Can a movie be this dull boring and still be hailed as a masterpiece by some? Wow. Yes it can. This was one of the most irritating movies I have ever seen. Nothing happens. The most mundane things are shown for minutes. No narrative. The balloon has NOTHING to do with the movie. I watched the whole thing thinking that it would get better or something would be explained. Just a bore. Complete and utter bore. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boresville","review":"This is not a remake of the original 1954 french classic. This is an arthouse inspired borefest that I truely wanted to love. Julie B is fantastic in everyfilm i have seen her in. She cannot even save this drawl of a film. This film is more like a day in a life drama with no real conflict that pulls you in. The director utilizes unnecessary long takes that build up to nothing. The red balloon itself is merely a metaphor and appears only in the first scene in the film and with sprinkles of appearances in the body of the film and in the films odd and depressing conclusion. Waste of time. Stay away and buy the digital remaster of The Red Balloon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get close to this film","review":"About 10 minutes into this film I realized that I had no idea what the characters looked like. Then I realized that every shot was either a long shot, or we saw the sides of their heads and mostly their hair, or we saw the characters through a glass or reflected in a glass. There was one close up of Juliette Binoche but that was all the director gave us. I left the film feeling as if I never was able to get close to the characters I was watching. Which was too bad because their performances were wonderful.Whenever the balloon came into the picture it was also at a distance. There seemed to be no connection between each of the characters or of the balloon. This film has serious intimacy issues. Right afterwards I saw the film \\"Bella\\" and was struck by how powerful a close up shot could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you spell BORING?","review":"I wish I would have read more about this movie before I spent my time watching it. I found it to be amazingly boring. I gave it two stars simply because of the convincing acting (especially by Juliette Binoche). I always give the benefit of the doubt to foreign/non-conventional films, but this one just never \\"took-off\\" (pun intended). I found myself saying \\"okay, maybe the mother has a drinking problem\\", or \\"maybe Song falls in love with the mother\\" or \\"maybe something happens to the kid while chasing the red balloon\\", anything just to inject some life into the movie! I think unless you are in film school or like artistic films or are extremely patient and have nothing better to do, you may doze-off (like my wife did on several occassions). Be ready with the fast-forward button on your remote!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing","review":"Just give it a listen. Approach Branca's work with an open mind, a large room and turn the volume up as high as the speakers (and neighbors) will bear.

I bought this thru moviemars via Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Altman Rides AGain","review":"This is a quirky take on white/native relations in the late 19th/early 20th century, a mad mix of historical fact and whimsical fiction. Newman is masterful as the addled demagogue into which Buffalo Bill has morphed. I recommend this film for students enrolled in our college's AMERICAN WEST class; it is provocative fodder for good discussion, good writing on alternative views of history.Robert Altman fans will recognize stock characters from his other films, but will be entertained (perhaps delighted) throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU CAN DO BETTER, ALTMAN-WISE . . .","review":"When Altman is good he's great.

The only thing that drives me crazy about this DVD is the menu selection. I usually play it in the van and the short songs are great for quick trips. However you have to manually select the \\"Play All\\" feature so that it will go once over all the songs. It is quite a few clicks to get to that option too so it makes it hard when you can't see the screen to know if you're on \\"Play All\\". Otherwise you select one song at a time and since they are pretty short you have to do that often. All in all a great dvd but very poor menu selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"So original and engaging!","review":"I watched school house rock segments between cartoons when I was a kid and loved them. I now have two daughters (7 and 9) that love music and have my abilities with math :( So, I got this dvd to see if they would memorize the songs and thus learn the math without knowing it.

It was great to watch how the then run-down and now closed Bush Stadium was magically transformed into Cincinnati's Crosley Field and Chicago's Comiskey Park. The ensemble acting group is top notch including David Straithan as Ed Cicotte, the player ringleader of the Black Sox and John Cusack as Buck Weaver playing well the \\"guilty by association\\" role. Even Paramedic DeSoto of \\"Emergency\\" fame (Kevin Tighe) has a great role as the gambler masterminding the big fix. A fascinating movie that is well-acted and very under-appreciated. And they even got the fact that Shoeless Joe Jackson batted left-handed correct (unlike Field of Dreams).By the way, to respectfully contradict a previous poster, the White Sox did go to the World Series one time after the 1919 scandal, in 1959, where they lost to the Dodgers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not even a baseball fan, but I liked this film!","review":"A really interesting sports drama regarding the infamous White Sox scandal surrounding the 1908 World Series.

Pop/ska/punk, however you want to classify Goldfinger, there is no denying the sublime (no pun intended) genius of this album. From the opener \\"I'm Down\\" to the final jolt of \\"99 Red Balloons,\\" there's enough substance here to satisfy many different kinds of listeners. There is enough power and raging riffs to satisfy the metalhead like myself, yet still the hooks and choruses to get the girls. The tracks themselves are quite diverse as well, from the heavy \\"Bro\\" to the mellow \\"Margaret Ann,\\" or the addictingly catchy \\"Counting The Days,\\" there is not a moment to be missed here. This is certainly one of my favorite non-metal albums, and has the kind of sound that will appeal to a great number of rock fans. Add this one to your collection today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Release from Goldfinger","review":"This release from Goldfinger lacks the ska feel from previous releases, but is great nonetheless. Every song is memorable with a great hook and will have you singing along after repeated listens. \\"Stomping Ground\\" demonstrates and captures the high energy of the band along with very good musicianship that they display in their live shows. John Feldmann (vocalist) and Charlie Paulson (guitarist) and company whip through some great rapid-fire punk anthems like \\"San Simeon\\" and \\"Counting the Days\\" along with the Limp Bizkit-like attitude filled \\"Bro\\", and even a great cover (they are a very good cover band) of Nena's \\"99 Red Balloons\\". They continue to impress and I look forward to more releases from John Feldmann and Co."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldfinger's Great CD","review":"I have been a Goldfinger fan for a little while, and I recently purchased \\"Stomping Ground\\". My friends first got me into Goldfinger's music. So, I listened to the CD, not expecting anything great. But I was shocked when I finished listening to the CD. It was an awesome CD. I love it sooooo much. I think it is one of the best punk CD's I have ever heard. It has both elements of punk, ska, and rock. It is a great CD, and I reccommend it to anybody, even if they aren't really big punk fans. This totally changed my opinion about punk music. I was kind of a fan, but ever sice this CD, I've turned total punk. I got all of my other friends into punk, too. They also love this CD!! So what are you waiting for??? Go buy this!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but not the good ol' Goldfinger","review":"I first bought this CD remembering their old ska CD's like Hang Ups. This is a great CD with great songs, but the reason I gave it only four stars is because there is no ska at all in it.

If you like Goldfinger you'll like this CD anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Hang-ups","review":"First of all, this CD is FANTASTIC.

You will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I like \\"Don't Say Good-Bye\\", \\"Carry On\\", \\"99 Red Balloons\\", \\"Counting The Days\\", \\"San Simeon\\", \\"I'm Down\\" and \\"Pick a Fight\\".. and a few others.. this CD is simply amazing! If you like their first two full length albums, you'lol love this, as it has a little of each put into it.. and then some ... they add some alternative rock and 80's lyrics, and it makes for an awesome album! About as good as their debut and Hang Ups... The enhanced part is nothing special, but it has an awesome compilation video, with parts from almost every song on the CD and live footage... of them hopped up and caffeine... as always!

(Unless of course you have it in your walkman) I know for a fact that any owner of this cd isnt going to be putting this one in the back of the closet any time soon! Its a cd you'll never get sick of and when your really really old youll tell all the kids in the neighborhood \\"Stomping Ground is a classic! what the heck are you listening to that other music for!?!?\\" Its my favorite cd of all time. so take my word for it. its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great CD by Goldfinger","review":"I have three Goldfinger CDs. I have S/T, Hang-ups, and Stomping Ground. These are my 3 favorite CDS I own. Stomping Ground is an awesome punk rock CD.

They get more than decent results on some songs, but on others they tend to hang back a little, and sometimes just get plain weird. A prime example of this is the one song off the album that I WILL NOT listen to: YOU THINK IT'S A JOKE. This album sounds like The Clash on valium, and the resulting song is quite tedious. However, there are songs that completely redeem this cd. FORGIVENESS is one of the best songs ever to be recorded from any band, likewise COUNTING THE DAYS, and 99 RED BALLOONS is one of the best covers out there. If I dock one star (I would rather dock half), it's because of the two songs that are not good on this album, and the fact that there is no ska. Other than that, if you are a fan of Blink182 or MxPx, pick this album up."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart cd (but no ska)","review":"Having got into (Goldfinger) when i first saw them in camden i've grown to love there ska punk sound.This cd is totally different to their other cds.If your looking for a more juvenile adolescent sound don't buy this cd.On the other hand if you want 42 minutes of different sounds and vocals buy this cd.My favourite songs are (counting the days)(99 red balloons)(pick a fight)and San simeon.I've been waiting for this cd to come out for what seemed like ages and it does'nt disappoint,though I still think (hang up's) is the better cd.But buy anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd, but not their best","review":"I,ve been a Goldfinger fan for about 3 or 4 years now, so i think i know what I'm talking about, even though im only 14. this is a great cd, but I think it's their worst one, because of the lack of ska. They have built their entire career on ska/punk (ex here in your bedroom, all of the hang ups cd) and by not putting ska in the cd, it kind of loses its total potenial. Don't get me wrong, i love this cd, but i don't listen to it nearly as much as all of their other albums. so if you're into ska, get hang ups or darrins coconut ass. if you're more into punk, i recomend this or their selftitled (even though it has some ska), which is my personal favorite. also, see Goldfinger live. i highly doubt you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"this is the first goldfinger album i have bought and its really great. my favorite song is 99 red balloons. i think im gonna go out and buy some of their other albums since i enjoyed this so much"},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST BUY !","review":"At first the cd wasn't to great but as you get farther into the cd....it gets better and better!

Gary Cooper was I think one of the best actors of his time, along with Walter Brennan. The two made the movie well worth watching. Its a shame that Hollywood can't remember how to make movies like this anymore.

Judge Roy Bean has a silly fettish with Lillie Langtree and Cooper plays on that fettish in order to save himself from being hung. The entire movie is mostly dialogue between Cooper and Bean and I found it thoroughly boring.

However, after finishing the book I continued to think about it and realized the message is quite an important one. Sonnett's character, Vega, says several times throughout the book that desire is her goal. Desire itself is the ultimate desire and left unchecked by morals and decency that raw desire, I don't think it even has to be sexual, can lead to the ultimate sin.

He was completely suprized which made it even better. He put it together with the help of a friend and they had it up in about 2 hours. They said the instructions were terrible and there were some left over pieces but it seems very sturdy and made well. Other reviews said there were a lot of bounce outs, which there are, but I think it's more the way the dart is thrown rather than the board itself. Most of the bounce outs still register which keeps the game going. The darts that come with it are not the best quality, but I think that's expected. We went out and purchased our own darts and use the ones that it came with for guests. The extra tips have been really handy as well. We have had so much fun with this dart board!

The only reason I gave the CD 4 stars instead of 5 is because of it's length. I agree with another reviewer that they really should have added some tracks.

That doesn't help when it comes to meditation and achieving deep relaxation.2. The volume level seems to change on about the 2nd or 3rd trak, it suddenly becomes louder then the previous tracks. So if you start it our loud enough to hear, it late becomes too loud, and you would have to get up and turn it down.Overall, very inneffective for those looking for deep states of relaxation.In a pinch, irt's better then nothing.

What is equally important, and it shines through between the lines, is a relaxed mind set.A few related books:Macrobiotic DietCooking the Whole Foods Way: Your Complete, Everyday Guide to Healthy, Delicious Eating with 500 VeganRecipes, Menus, Techniques, Meal Planning, Buying Tips, Wit, and WisdomChristina Cooks: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Whole Foods But Were Afraid to AskGlow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great read until halfway through","review":"Dirk writes an entertaining tale of his life and romance with, health food and macrobiotics long before the latter two were common terms.

The performances on this cd are wonderful though! Idina Menzel and Brian D'Arcy James blow me away! They are so wonderful and they BOTH get 5 stars in my opinion. This isn't Taye Diggs best work. Julia Murney does a much better job of Queenie than I expected. She is emotional yet ignorant and fun... just like Queenie. Alix Korley as Miss Madelaine True cracks me up! She is great \\"old-fashioned dyke\\"! This party is definitely worth buying for fans of RENT, Rock Musicals, The Wild Party Poem, or any of the performers.

And I was right. This is bland. It's easy. It's safe. LaChiusa pushes the musical into a more sophisticated direction, continuing the work of Stephen Sonheim, Kurt Weill, and Leonard Bernstein. While LaChiusa's score restored a bit of dangerous cool to the musical, Lippa only revels in its cheesiness. Compare the two opening numbers and you will see where LaChiusa employs a wonderfully theatrical metaphor to describe Queenie and Burrs, Lippa has them practically INDICATING their emotional states. Not very dramatic. Buy the LaChiusa version. Toni Colette gives the best performance in a Broadway musical since Donna Murphy in PASSION."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wilder of the Two Parties","review":"Having compared and contrasted the two versions of \\"The Wild Party\\" that ran simultaneously on- and off-Broadway, I find Lippa's rendition the superior. It's more stylistically coherent, the vocal talent is superb, and \\"Queenie Was a Blonde\\" should supplant \\"All That Jazz\\" as the sultriest, sexiest, smoldering-est opening number of all time. Of course, the LaChiusa version does have Eartha Kitt, so that's worth the purchase price right there. Own 'em both and do your own compariosn. And if you ever get a chance to see \\"The Wild Party\\" live, jump on it! Just don't go with anyone who's easily offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this now.

The music, while fine for a more traditional-type score, does little to establish its locale (late 1920s New York), and never really succeeds at bringing its subject matter to life. While the performers are obviously talented, and Lippa demonstrates remarkable technical skills as a composer, his work doesn't seem to jump off the disc in quite the same way LaChiusa's version does. While an interesting and, overall, worthwhile purchase, this recording preserves well a score that sounds like it was never completely fleshed-out or completed."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Did This Show Not Make Broadway?","review":"In 2000, there were TWO new (and very different) musicals based on a 1928 poem about an evening of decadence: Michael LaChiusa's Broadway \\"version\\" (starring Mandy Patinkin, Toni Collette & Eartha Kitt) and Andrew Lippa's Off-Broadway \\"version\\". Mr. Lippa's version clearly outshines the other.With a remarkable cast, including Julia Murney, Brian d'Arcy James (\\"Titanic\\", \\"Sweet Smell Of Success\\"), Idina Menzel (\\"Rent\\", \\"Wicked\\"), and Taye Diggs (\\"Rent\\"), this musical character-study is powerful, with a terrific score!Best tracks include:Out Of The BluePoor ChildAn Old-Fashioned Love StoryMaybe I Like It This WayWhat Is It About Her?The Life Of The PartyLet Me DrownHow Did We Come To This?This version would probably have lasted much longer on Broadway than the more \\"artful\\" LaChiusa production.

Performance is good with respect to its specs i.e. Core duo, 1GB RAM etc. Keyboard is not too good, it is just OK. Speakers are worst I have seen in any laptop however if you mostly use headphones then sound card is reasonably good and it should not be a problem. Microphone is absent, which irritated me most becuase always i needed to use external mic for chating.Handling is also not too good, like a sony product should be.

This movie takes the major themes of the book -- religion, education, temptation, and man's curious position in this world -- and summarily discards most of them. It injects \\"erotic\\" scenes that were absent from the book, plays extremely fast-and-loose with Jude and Arabella's relationship, shreds the characterization (cf. Aunt Drusilla), and just generally makes a muddled mess of things. Arabella and Sue (sorry, Winslet fans) are terribly miscast, and Eccleston is a doubtful Jude indeed. From the abridgement of the book's title, which is Hardy's finest and among my favorites, to the choppy scene breaks (admittedly, a flaw of the original novel), this movie just doesn't do the book justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooooow and depressing","review":"Slow moving, very depressing account of a young man's subconscious drive toward achieving unhappiness - every decision he makes is another step towards that goal.The sex scenes are totally gratuitous."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the book, you will not love this movie","review":"I had high hopes for this movie when it first began (though I thought Kate Winslet would have been better cast as Arabella). My hopes dimmed though as I realized how they left out the most important elments of the book. It seems as though they had forgotten about Sue's fear of sex and slight physotic tendencies. In fact, one would get the impression watching this film that she quite enjoyed sex. They seemed to forget that \\"Little Juey\\", was called \\"Little Father Time\\" in the novel which was far more fitting. I am also left to wonder why they left Jude's tragic death scene out of the film. It nearly appears that Atrabella was an alright person in the movie, when in reality she was quite evil. Do not see this film if you treasured the book. It only angered me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jude...","review":"...was one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. Kate Winslet is the most talented actress of my generation. Her performance, as usual, was in my eyes flawless. She is an asset to any film that she appears in. The scene where her child takes it upon himself to take care of their problems is one of the saddest scenes on film I have ever witnessed. Her heartbreak and saddness made me feel as thought that horrible thing had just happenned to me personally. I loved this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly depressing!~","review":"Dead children hanging in a bedroom-images of crows flying through a black and white sky--Kate's genitals covered in blood (not MY idea of a fun film), a plot that goes nowhere, the gorgeous Liam Cunningham wasted in a useless role--what a mess this movie is. Doom, gloom--if you are depressed or prone to it, do not watch this movie. It will take you DAYS of Marx movies to recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"Bleak, harrowing melodrama.

I was amazed with its power, influence, and disturbance. It was still with me, now. There were some scenes (i.e. animal cruelty, ) I disliked. But they partially strengthened the movie. I watched it with surprises and depression, but I like it because c' est la vie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life doesn't always have a happy ending.","review":"I fell in love with this film. Wonderfully acted to the last bitter moment. Jude is a melancholy movie and there is no relief at conclusion, because the focus is grief not redemption. The film dared to portray how horribly tragic the outcome of classism can be. The title character longed for something more, better than his daily existence and was denied that opportunity solely on the basis of class. The university town is cold, perfectly gray (nothing thrives or grows there), narrow streets (akin to the narrow minded people), and gives the impression of intense limit (knowing one's place). This film is not for everyone. If you cling to happy endings then pass this one by, but if you're looking for depth and intense passion (albeit painful most times), and loss of joy never to be regained... this is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Pursuit of Love","review":"A movie of forbidden love between cousins. I wish I could say I enjoyed the story, but when you watch individuals making pointless choices in life, I often don't find it very entertaining. I love Kate Winslet. The woman is brilliant in anything she stars in frankly. You can see the very young actress in an emotional role. As far as the story, \\"yawn.\\" Perhaps I would have found some satisfaction if the man wasn't just driven by his male appetites, but had actually pursued the true love of his life - knowledge. The movie has its deep tragedy that changes everything, but leaves the audience with a sad and raveled ending, which comes to no real conclusion or a lasting theme to make you feel satisfied after the words \\"The End.\\" Not my favorite story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Winslet Rules","review":"Kate Winslet is the best actress in the world she has done so well in her movies and her work is extrodinary.She has proved alot for women in the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Winslet is a great looking actress","review":"Seeing Ms. Winslet was very enjoyable;however, I found the book to be very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"If you have a tender heart toward children, then do not watch this film. All other elements aside, what ultimately happens to the children in this novel made me drop to my knees in front of my television and weep. When it was over I proceeded to have my worst night of sleep for the year. True, the character studies are excellent, including that of the oldest child, and the faithfulness to Hardy's vision is sufficient. There is a gratuitous nude scene involving Kate Winslet that was, nevertheless, nice to have to endure (the nakedness of her character, I suppose, is meant to reflect the nakedness of emotion between the cousins during that moment of their consummation, as well as their naked position in society with regard to social taboo). Ultimately, however, I do not like graphic depictions of children suffering violence, and I do not recommend this film for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh so wonderful and emotionally draining","review":"This movie. Well, what can I say. I myself being a big Kate Winslet since 1994 with her first movie, Heavenly Creatures, decided to check this one out. I couldn't find Jude at any local video rental stores so you could image how excited I was when my friend told me she ound it at the bookstore. Imediatly I went and bought it. It took me about a week to watch it, and when I did, I was a mess. This movie brings you beyond crying. You feel every emotion possible. This is perhaps, in my view, the best movie of all time. I would recommend it to almost anyone, but you must be an emotionally strong person to watch it. I have recently purchased the soundrack online for Jude, really, its the music that brings the tears to our eyes and the pain to out hearts. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"OHHH Jude","review":"When I first saw the movie I was overcome with tears. Not only does the ending leave you heartbroken, but the acting is amazing. The performance by Christopher Eccleston was electrifying. He plays Jude, a working class man who wishes to become a teacher. Jude then falls in love with his cousin Sue. Sue is played by Kate Winslet. If you think she is a terrible actress, then you should see her in this movie. She is wonderful and totally outdoes herself. All I can say that this is movie worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"A hard lesson on pride, fate and destiny...this movie stunned me. Some images were really hard to see, but I welcome the realistic cinema.

And some details made it so real! A great movie overall, it made me reflect on many things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching representation of life itself","review":"I first read Jude the Obscure after finishing Thomas Hardy's other classic Far from the Madding Crowd.

I have bought the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie and book are excellent","review":"I am a huge Kate Winslet fan, and I had heard about this movie so I really wanted to see it. I had read that it could be very hard to watch, but I found it riveting. It drew me in so that I cared so very much for the characters and what was happening in their lives. I was so moved by it that I didn't really know how to describe it, I just knew I wanted everyone to see it. The best way I could think to describe it is terribly beautiful, or beautifully terrible. I am a firm believer that Kate should have been nomitated and won an Oscar for that movie. And then I had to read the book too. I didn't like Thomas Hardy when I was in high school, but I have a much different viewpoint of things now than I did then, and I found the book to be as emotional and beautiful as the movie. I would definitely recommend watching the movie before reading the book, but I urge anyone to do either or both.

Captions are minimal; these provide anecdotal background to establish the episodic human significance of a given site. The streetscape changes captured in then-and-now images suggest how techological and cultural evolution conspire to alter the character of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave's rating","review":"Good and prompt service.

Darwin refers to the diagram on many occasions, notably on page 75 of this edition, \\"The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding...,\\" except there is no diagram accompanying this edition, so our understanding of this great book is to remain unaided, against the author's wishes. I checked every single page in the book by hand - the diagram is nowhere to be found. The electronic search under the \\"Look inside!\\" tool also shows that the diagram is not included. This edition is simply a waste of ten bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwin","review":"A free copy of Darwin's Origin of Species. How could it not be 5 stars? This is a great read for anyone!

Although for certain individuals the book may be dry and long-winded, the final verdict is favorable and the book is generally well liked. It took me a while to get through it - what with classes, work, and perpetual studying - but when I did finish the work, I felt I had a firmer grasp on the subject. Anyone interested in the field of Biology (including medicine) should read this book at some point in their academic career. I also recommend individuals who disagree with or effectually negate the theory of evolution read this volume before continuing their persecution of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a forgery","review":"As the sub-title to this \\"Special\\" \\"On the Origin of Species\\" version attests, it seems some of the christian persuasion have gone and done it again. This time taking a classic text and altering it to fit their agenda. This particular version adds little lies and deceptions I'm sure the Darwin family takes issue with. I expect no less of the ignorant to defame and use lies and deceptions to keep their true religious views from being known, but it's hard to believe Amazon would allow this forgery to be displayed and distributed as a book by Darwin. The Darwin family has been notified just in case they were not informed by Amazon that they are promoting this thing. Please download or obtain the real \\"On the Origin of Species\\" by Charles Darwin. Not this christian version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for answers to evolution questions","review":"I wanted to read this book to see if there was some confirmation regarding the theory of evolution. There has yet to be the evidence to prove what Darwin said would be needed to prove his theory. He wrote in the chapter on difficulties that if there wasn't proof to back up what he had written, that it would lead to unresolved issues.I always wondered how there could be fully preserved fossils which are said to be very old as typical bodies decompose in just a few hundred years. I also was wondering how there are marine fossils on the top of mountains and the book couldn't explain why.I had to conclude that the theory of evolution doesn't have proof Darwin said was needed to back up what is taught in schools as he had predicted.I will now have to look for another answer to my questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"great musicians, not great music","review":"I am a big Jazz fan, I like some of Duke Ellington big band stuff and I really like most of the small combo stuff I have heard him on. So when I got this as part of a larger boxed set (reviewed on my blog - click my name to see link to it in my profile) I was excited and full of great hopes - especially as it has Stefan Grapelli my favorite Jazz Violinist. I was sadly disappointed. The numbers don't swing for me and overall the artist sound lifeless and without spirit. I was surprised that most of the other reviewers here are so positive and listened to the album a few times to be sure. What can I say - for me is does not work.

In the section \\"What other items do customers buy after viewing this item?\\" section it lists a dewalt saw blade. I bought both.***IMPORTANT!!! - This saw does not take a 10\\" blade!!!!!I know it's not the fault of the product itself but this saw came all torn and tattered and the packing foam inside was rusty like it sat in water.

The bad news started when the UPS driver delivered it to the door by flipping it end over end and bouncing it on the driveway. After unpacking there were a few minor dings. The big flaw with the saw was that the back of the blade face (replace blade immediately as it is a piece of junk) was binding on the slat in the cutting table that runs parallel to the blade. So the blade would not turn. I called QEP and they told me how to align the rip fence, obviously clueless about the saw.My simple fix was to put a washer behind the blade arbor to push it out 1/8\\". Now it works fine. I don't think I should have to compensate for a manufacturer's design flaws, hence the 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of expensive junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My family bought this saw for me as a father's day present. I needed to complete 3 different projects at home, a craft room, the kitchen and a bathroom. I used it once and had nothing but problems it broke half of every porcelain tile I tried to cut on it. It rattled the tiles so much on the metal base base that it either chipped , cracked or broke every tile I tried to cut. I had to barrow my brother-in-laws tile cutter again to do the project. I had to cut my squares in half diagonally. I wish my family had bought me that model and brand. The Tile Director by Felker.

It failed. We tried crosscuts on 24\\" tile and had blade runout of almost a 1/4\\" This might be a fine tolerance for a DIY'er or a client who is not picky. We have zero joint lines and this machine ruined several hundred dollars in tile before we stopped the operator. I tried several blades, none inexpensive and had the runout problem with all.

First the QEP people told me that I put the blade on wrong, so they ran me through that, still would not cut without major chipping, so then I decide to buy a new blade, that did not work either. The bride that the saw is to move smoothly on does not, and the thing chips every tile, and sometimes it will stop while I am cutting through. Do not buy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This item is not packaged well and will probably have dents. The pump did not work.

The first time I received it, the box had a hole in it and the water tray was broken. I shipped it back and ordered a replacement. When the replacement was received, the box was in good condition, but the water tray was broken again! Amazon was very good and expedient in both transactions. Since I could not find the saw at my local stores, I ended up buying another saw locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, although not Flawless","review":"This was one of the best tile saws I've ever used. My partner and I tiled an entire bathroom floor in natural slate, and we were able to get even the finest, thinnest of cuts from this. Cleanup was really the only place where I felt less than perfection was achieved. This is, of course, a common challenge with tile saws--the nature of the beast, I suppose--but I continue to hope someone will pioneer a new method of waste control.

She was very excited and we quickly went to work on creating our fairy garden even though we were both very disappointed at the quality of the product. It is all plastic. The fairy statue is a tiny little purple thing. It isn't at all as cool as the box makes it look. We even had to use most of the seeds during the first planting. We quickly had some sprouts, but within 2 weeks we had mold and the entire thing died. I tried everything to revive it, however I think that the $$ spent was not worth it. I will add that I have a green thumb and know a great deal about plants.

That was a grand gesture considering the terrarium is nothing more than a lightweight plastic bowl with an even lighter weight clear plastic dome lid. Her kit was missing the seeds. We prepped the dirt, placed the cheap looking all-yellow-fairy in the dirt, positioned the colored rocks and pinwheel with bells and headed to Lowes to get seeds (as close to what they were supposed to be as possible) -- I was NOT going to contact the company and wait for seeds to arrive. My daughter placed the stickers on the sides of the bowl and we are now waiting. The plants better grow. Hmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Idea, But Fails to Deliver","review":"So we bought this for our 5 year old's birthday, who does believe in fairies. She was very excited to set it up.

This is a big step forward from \\"young team\\" because it moves on from the hard edged loud vs quiet, joy division influenced sounds of that album, to a softer more subtle sound with the old thrashing drum crescendos sparingly used, but with impressive results, breaking up the more tragic/slowly melodic parts of the album, e.g ex cowboy. The instrument playing on the album is superb & there is also good use of samples as in \\"helps both ways\\" and especially in punk rock where an old interview with Iggy Pop sets out Mogwai's views and the scene for the rest of the album. My favourite track was \\"christmas steps\\" because it used the old mogwai formula of soft guitar strumming at the start building up to loud guitar rock in the middle and a spiralling harp,(I think)\\\\guitar climbdown at the end, I also liked it because it was more progressive than it would have been if it had been done on \\"young team\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellowness at its best.","review":"this is some excellent stuff,excellent. It's alot more relaxing and mellow then their past releases, which isn't a bad thing at all. Come on Die Young achieves a very high level of amazement and I would probably put this one down as my favorite Mogwai release.The album starts off right and ends right. It's an album that makes you think. This album is best listened to from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"come on, feel.","review":"Come On Die Young is one of the most impressive, sonic albums I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Full of quiet, it is an unassuming rock album - which soars and glides from track to track, never letting you completely down. Every listen to this album has a nice little surprise in store,as it increases in emotion and complexity. A really great album, which, like most great albums, requires the listener to pay attention before it delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I cannot for the life of me grasp why people like this band so much. CODY is awful. It's like an out of tune garage band that hasn't quite learned how to play its instruments warming up while smacked-up out of their minds. This is the worse sounding album my poor ears I have ever had the misfortune of suffering through. Before you buy it, just email me and I will send you mine for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous.","review":"It always seems that the best albums take some time to truely reveal their intricacies and beauty, and as such, they require a dedicated amount of patience from the listener. \\"Come On Die Young\\" is one of those albums. It will not blow you away the first time around, and you might even find yourself bored half way through, complaining that every song sounds pretty much the same. But give it time, and Mogwai's simple, restrained chords will eventually make perfect sense. An ultimately mesmerizing, beautiful piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredicbly dumb","review":"Cody is one of those albums which really pisses me off. Having seen the glorious Mogs live at the london forum, and having already bought some of their previous brilliant recordings, including 'TenRapid', and 'Youngteam', I found myself both amazed by the INCREDIBLE moments on this album, like the wonderfully brief, and iggy pop featuring; 'punkrock', the minimalist heavy metal of 'xmassteps' and the cacophonous masterpiece of 'excowboy'. Other highlights include the insidiously rapturous 'chocky', and the delightful 'Waltz for aidan'. But, quite simply there are large chunks of this album which are just unbearably repetitive and unnecessary. At least 3 of the tracks seem to just be DUMB filler, and make you seriously doubt this bands' quantity of range and experimentation. To be positive though, the high points that are here are simply stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparisons to Radiohead make me shudder.","review":"Reading previous comments and learning that a few people find similarities between this album and the band Radiohead/lead singer Thom Yorke upset my mind completely. It just makes me wonder if I ever really knew Radiohead like I had thought. Radiohead is brilliantly creative and full of ingenuity. I suppose there is a fine line between the incredible work of those like Radiohead and that of bands like Mogwai, trying to break the boundries of creativity, but not succeeding, therefore leaving themselves with sh*t."},{"rating":"1","title":"the album cover is cool, that's it","review":"I think I have a feeling of what mogwai wanted to achieve with this album, and the sound and vibe of it, but I don't they succeeded at all. It's an album where you have to listen to as a whole, but that proves to be very difficult at times. First off, the album is about 10-15 minutes too long. It just drags and drags, its very monotone and lifeless at most times, and it feels a bit bloated as a whole. The title track, christmas steps and ex-cowboy are all good tracks, but thats pretty much it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant album, lousy mastering","review":"Even though I already own the original CD release of Brain Salad Surgery from 1986 (which follows the original vinyl album very closely), as an ardent fan of ELP since 1972 I decided that I would like to have this Rhino re-issue as part of my collection. On listening I was flabbergasted to hear that the whole sound of the album had been changed, most notably on Toccata and Karn Evil 9. It seems as though the people responsible for the re-mastering thought that Keith Emerson's keyboards should be brought even more to the fore, and that Greg Lake's bass guitar and Carl Palmer's drums were annoyances that should be subdued as much as possible. This may make no difference to someone hearing the album for the first time, but to someone who knows the album inside out it was a huge dissapointment. It's very annoying when listening to an album and you are humming a bass riff that can't be heard from the loudspeakers. So, what should have been five stars has to be only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK [WAS WEAK]!!!","review":"I was assigned this bookit was supposed to be goodit [was weak]....The author was very descriptive, which I usually enjoy, but this guy spend two or three pages describing one little ThINg!!

Robert Mason, the central performer in the group, hand-built his own synthesizer when current models (early 70s) proved inadequate. This was a one of a kind polyphonic instrument, years before its time, and its uniqueness reflects in the music.

The soldiers are really a bunch of civilians thrown into an ugly situation they really want no part of, and they are impotent weekend warriors as well, as they have to fight the Cajun's powerful hunting rifles with nothing but blanks! Powers Booth, and Keith Carradine steal the show as the two soldiers with any common sense , that want to survive the situation...gory and violent, you really get into the story as their situation keeps worsening, and the plot thickens.

The plot was about a group of soldiers killed one by one by unseen enemies. In Platoon, it's the Viet Cong who killed the American soldiers. In Southern Comfort, it's the Cajuns who murdered the National Guardsmen.What supposed to be a suspenseful movie turned out to be a bland picture. The acting look stiff, fake and unemotional. I was never scared during the whole film. In one scene, a Guardsman was so frightened that he went crazy. He cut and painted himself just like an Indian who was going to war. And yet the act did not stir up any suspense or emotion at all. On the contrary, the similar scene in Predator is truly gripping.I prefer The Hunt for Red October and U571. They're greatly suspenseful and entertaining.If you want to watch this movie, please rent it. Do not buy it. The purchase of this DVD cost me only ten dollars but I still think it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Comfort equals tremendous waste of time","review":"The only redeeming element of SOUTHERN COMFORT is the equipment the Guardsmen are wearing/carrying, it's the real thing, right down to the patches on the uniforms. As for the rest of this film, it was a waste of electricity.The acting is awful, there is no plot, the dialog between the actors is sophomoric. The Louisiana Army National Guard should be offended by the way their soldiers were portrayed in this film.

I grew up a Catholic but have been away from the Church for a few years now but after seeing this movie, I want and need a closer relationship with Jesus. I can't stop thinking about this movie. I ordered this book and the soundtrack today and I can hardly wait to get them. The admiration and appreciation that I have for Mel Gibson is beyond description. His courage is amazing and inspiring. I love this movie! I love Mel Gibson and I love our Lord Jesus Christ!! By the way, I'm going to see it again next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"But see Maria Valtorta's books for a source","review":"These pictures are a great way to remember the movie without seeing the movie again and again. If the movie is an emotional issue, having this book serves as a reminder without the need to spend the time of the length of the movie to recall the scenes in the movie. You might even consider framing some of these if you would not hate doing that to the book. These are suitable for that.On a side note, with so many talking about elements in the movie that were not found in scripture may I point to the work of Maria Valtorta (\\"The Poem of the Man-God\\") who was a mystic that had a vision of many details not in the scripture, many of which seem a match for events in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"gratituous violence in stills","review":"It was bad enough that the film was an assault on the senses. Now we can read a book and see it in slow-mo. Fantastic. If you want to pick this up, why not also include forensic journals with pictures of executions and murder?!Gibson has overplayed the violence on film and yes, we get it. Human nature is cruel and bestial when they fear and hate. Who needs to see this book to get that? Simply look at the papers. That's as real and disturbing as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"The book is beautiful. Wonderful, large color phtos from the film. The lighting and color tones are excellent. The shots are terrific. The subjects are amazing. I am now even more anxious to see this film - if that's possible. My complaint is that amazon doesn't carry the Catholic Edition of this book with the Douay-Rheims translation of the Bible verses, which is what I bought. It's a shame. The one they do have has the verses from the New Living translation. Oh well. A must-buy in any case for fans of this extraordinary film."},{"rating":"2","title":"REVIEW ON MOVIE NOT BOOK","review":"THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE ABOUT JESUS THAT I HAVE EVER GONE TO. THE THINGS HE WENT THRU FOR ARE SINS IS HARD TO BELIEVE. BUT HE DID IT TO FREE US FROM SIN, ONLY WITH SUPERNATIONAL HELP COULD HE HAVED SURVIVED. MEL GIBSON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS MOVIE. YOU DID GOOD!!!(GREAT THAT IS) TO ALL PEOPLE GO AND SEE THE MOVIE AND ENJOY AND CRY AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE ARE SINS ARE FORGIVEN.AGAIN THANK YOU MEL GIBSON PLEASE KEEP THE FAITH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning book!","review":"A stunning book of a stunning movie by a gutsy film maker! Spectacular photos and text to look at until you go see it again or while waiting for the DVD! Consider getting the soundtrack at the same time as looking at the book while listening to the soundtrack is an experience in and of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Collection of Torture Photos?","review":"Mel Gibson's pornographic depiction of violence, blood, and torn flesh is not for me. It's disgusting and disturbed. There are more respectable and watchable movies made about Jesus and the Bible. The Passion is sheer torture from a gore-obsessed mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally SNUFF FILM STILLS! with class","review":"Finally a coffee table book for us Snuff Film Addicts.if You LOVE BLOOD and You LOVE GORE, You'll love this book. Fairly Dripping with bodily fluids and all under the guise of Christianity, What could be Classier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased & Untrue","review":"The book is not much different than the movie. It is a shame that Mel Gibson wastes his talent on presenting Catholic delusions from anti-semitic nuns as Truth. It is equally a shame that the best part of the Hebrew/Jewish teachings are left out to give more attention to the false idea of \\"collective guilt\\" no matter what is said about who is guilty. The story is written from a Catholic perspective and in that respect it is biased no matter how you look at it. In addition, alleged events that are recorded only in one gospel and not any of the others (why don't the stories match, did they all witness the same event?) are presented as the whole truth. If the movie was meant to bring more attention to the beauty of Christianity, I think it failed miserably. This movie will only satisfy the bloodthirsty who believe a human sacrifice complete with gory Roman bloodfest is the only method of salvation. The book leaves much to be desired if you have an open mind and a loving heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit of perspective","review":"i am astonished over all the hype over this movie and book. this is all for entertainment; one celebrity's interpretation of events. rather than dwell on this, we should all follow jesus' lessons and teachings. people disregard his teachings all the time but then pretend this book and movie somehow matter. it is entirely hypocrotical. we should follow the christ, not use his death for entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsehood","review":"As a citizen of Israel, I completely reject and condemn \\"The Passion of the christ\\". It is a work based on falsehood: Mel Gibsons work is heavely influenced by the writings of the deillusional mystic/nun Anne Catherine Emmerich.Furthermore, Gibson promised to remove all references to the line from Matthew 27. Although Gibson removed the English subtitle for the line, the words remain in the film, spoken in Aramic. Both the book and the film are falsehoods and should never have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"MELS MESS","review":"Mels movie and book are clear abominations with undertones of racism, hatred, and religious superiority. Neither the book nor the movie describe the events of the Bible as they are actually written. This is a diservice to Christians, and especially Jews, everywhere. I highly recommend not wasting your money, time, and good sense on Mels Mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is for people who were moved --> good and bad","review":"If you saw the Passion (I did) and were moved by it (I dont know how you couldn't be) then I think you would like this book. It is not only for people who loved the movie, but even those who were saddened by it.The photography is so beautiful and so detailed, you might think for a minutes that you are looking at photos of the real thing! It is a beautiful done book about a very powerful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Done - A Wonderful Keepsake","review":"This book is truly the most beautifully done depiction of the Passion movie. Anyone who has seen the movie and wants to recall a memorable scene, needs to buy this book. I find myself picking it up just to remember.....it's also a wonderful way to prepare your mind before you pray. Mel Gibson has given us the gift of a spiritually awakening movie - this book will help your heart to keep it close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"I have'nt heard the Original Original (from 1964). I can only assume this is a case of The Emperors New clothes and no one had the courage to kill this recording at birth. Whoever had the idea that asking Carol Channing to revisit the part of Dolly Levi was worthwhile deserves to be drummed out of the Entertainment Industry. In case there is any confusion this recording is dire. It sounds like Walter Mattau after a very heavy night on the tiles (I have no reason to assume Walter M ever had a heavy night on the tiles). The only reason to buy this is to give confidence to anyone who fancies trying musical theatre and thinks their voice is not up to scratch. If this can reach Broadway there is hope for anyone. I am only familiar with a few recordings of Dolly but would suggest that so far Barbra Striesand in the movie is the best bet if its music you enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's looking at you, Rod","review":"Of all the smoky, anonymous blues clubs, I have to walk into this one. And what a find. A tight combo playing slow to medium paced numbers, delivered with a wailing harp and searing, melodic slide. Rod Price was an unsung hero when he died a few years ago. If you're a fan of electric bottleneck, you need this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat-o!","review":"What a fun and neat CD! One of a kind! Brings back old memories... fun times... Go out and buy it! It's the best of music from Sister Sledge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"The CD arrived on time and was in perfect condition and I have been playing the CD almost everyday! I loooove it! Great job Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Peak of Disco","review":"This is the album where the talents of Nile Rogers and Bernard Edwards met the vocal prowess of Sister Sledge, and it is a legendary success, in fact it is almost a greatest hits CD by itself, what with the anthemic title track, along with \\"He's The Greatest Dancer\\", \\"Lost In Music\\", and more, it represents the pinnacle of dance music during the late 70's, as the production of every track is superior to most disco output from the same era, not to mention much of todays. With very informative liner notes, including biographies and track by track analysis, this edition is definitely worth owning, in fact, this is a disco masterwork!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sledge Hammer Bang For Your Buck!","review":"I've been re-purchasing my favorite disco era songs and albums. The disco era was 'my era' and reflected my love for music and dance. This is a mega find. the sound quality is unbelievably great and the 12\\" songs on this album are nothing short of a gift. Please, Please don't sleep this. We don't know when the next time will be that the music industry will be this wise and actually give the public what it wants. If you loved the song 'lost in music' like I did, then you won't want to pass up the chance to get more then one version of that and so many others all on one compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaunch of JLA is entertaining though somewhat dated","review":"This book compiles the first seven issues of the Justice League relaunch from 1987, following the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths which completely changed the DC Universe during the previous year. Successful at the time and noted for bringing humor and a dose of reality into the superhero realm, it still holds its entertainment value yet can't help but feel a little dated -- check out Black Canary's hairdo on the cover! One should note that Batman and Martian Manhunter are the only two of the traditional \\"Big 7\\" to appear in this version of the team, though Superman and the Hal Jordan Green Lantern make cameo appearances."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW","review":"Had one before and it was stolden.Have been looking for quite some time for a replacement.Best pattern gun for the money, have used one on many jobs with out any problems what so ever.Great for repairs and touch up work also."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A STANLEY","review":"This item is not a Stanley brand as advertized, also when I look into the gun part there was obvious residue of drywall; so the item is not a Stanley and also it is not new.

Roy plays in several different styles ( Jazz, Country, Bluegrass ) and has some fun with the band an audience. There's some great playing and some of his best hits. A lot of fun and a good first Roy Clark disc to pick up if you're looking for somewhere to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Mud Mixer","review":"I bought the Goldblatt G15303 to mix wallboard compound. This mixer is better suited for mixing a full 5 gallon bucket of mud. I tried to mix a half bucket and it did not work well, too much splatter. You need a drill with lots of torque to turn this mixer at a low speed. Make sure you use the lowest gear on your multi-speed drill. I didn't and the my drill motor smoked as a result. I wound up buying a much smaller mixer which worked better for my needs. If you have a full bucket of mud and a drill with lots of torque, this mixer should do the job quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sisters","review":"How could I have a Bette Davis collection without this one. I had my copy converted from VHS to DVD ,but I would not part with either of them. Errol Flynn was a little under his best but it held together finaly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly wonderful film!","review":"This is defintly a great romantic film. It has a great story line and will keep your interest. This film was based on a book. Errol Flynn and Bette Davis are great in it. It's a kepper! Buy it and you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Archive rip-off!","review":"An appallingly bad transfer of a very mediocre film - at one point there's a blank screen period of about 8-10 seconds (between reels?), which I've never experienced before. Are we not justified in expecting a somewhat restored version of a film when asked to pay these prices? Don't go there - and treat the WAC with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I reading a different book???","review":"I'm not sure how my review can differ so much from the other people that have read this book. After 22% I quit. I don't have a clue where the author is going at all and don't even seem to really care about the characters. It sounds like a dysfunctional family (putting it mildly) and there is enough of that going around that I don't need to be hit over the head with it in a book I'm trying to read for enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring me more","review":"Coming from the perspective of a cop's kid, I was thrilled to find a Christian Cop Book! I cared about the characters, and I respected the truth of their lives as told in this book. Cops are people, too - not all good, not all bad. It was interesting to see the growth and struggle of the main character, and I look forward to reading more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Action, Too Much Proselytizing","review":"This is a religious book, not a detective story. It tracks the life of a patrol cop whose life is empty. His new partner is a born again Christian who recognizes he is suicidal and attempts a religious intervention. The description of Tony's experiences working the midnight shift in midtown Manhattan seem authentic, but there is little plot other than Tony finding the meaning of life. For those readers seeking a whodunnit or mystery novel, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Come to Jesus\\" Book","review":"I guess I didn't read all the reviews carefully enough before getting this book. I expected a good \\"cop\\" story, and it started out OK. The characters were well-developed, as was the basic police organization, so I was very optimistic. However, the action was slow. It basically focused on the disintigration of the protagonist, a cop in his 30s still living with his brother and sister in the family house. His police partner functioned as his guardian angel, and presumably brought him around to Jesus. \\"Presumably,\\" because after a number of pages of Bible study I stopped reading. If you like this kind of story, this is your book. But if you want action and an interesting plot, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage that trivializes the great silent stars","review":"As a speculative story on the alleged events surrounding film producer Thomas Ince's death in 1924, it greatly disappoints, offering no clear or conclusive hypothesis and relying heavily on sleazy innuendo. It is rather sloppy on historical detail (e.g. Greta Garbo did not arrive in the U.S. until 1925, John Barrymore was in London rehearsing for Hamlet at the time of the alleged events.) What makes MURDER AT SAN SIMEON truly reprehensible, however, is its trivialization of the silent film era. Fascinating performers like Charlie Chaplin and John Gilbert are reduced to tabloid fodder. Poor Marion Davies comes off the worst here; Hearst and Biddle's hatchet job of her almost makes Welles's mockery of her in CITIZEN KANE seem complimentary. In order to fully appreciate and understand silent movies, watch films like THE GOLD RUSH and SHOW PEOPLE instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murderous Mess","review":"I hate this book. The writing style and flow of thoughts the authors composed were fragmented. Annoying characters like Marion the dipstick, made reading torturous especially since she's on like every page - \\"OOhh daddy poo!\\", talking in her damn baby drivel. The heroine, Catha Burke was soo bland. She never affected me in any kind of way so having to read about her as she pursued the investigation was a bore. This book doesn't resolve some of the main reasons for reading the story, like who killed Thomas Ince, and is mostly flashbacks of boring snobbish parties with a lost heroine going nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish writing","review":"This could have been a crackerjack story if it weren't for thewriting. Both Ms Hearst and her co-author seem to have justgraduated from a sophmore English class and are putting whatthey have learned to use.The characters are cutout figures with no depth and are the sum ofall stereotypes in the early days of the film industry.I could only get through the first hundred pages, before itbecame unbearable to continue.I hope nobody wastes their money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks objectivity and not a good read","review":"Ms. Hearst does not have the objectivity nor the literary skills to make this a compelling or even a quasi-accurate read. She has chosen to besmirch the character of Ms. Davies, in order to make a book sale. I was given the book by someone who knew I was interested in historical houses. If you are interested on reading more about Ms. Davie's life or the Thomas Ince death, I'd suggest reading Ms. Davie's autobiographyThe Times We Had : Life with William Randolph Hearstor purchasing the movie \\"The Cat's Meow\\". Both present different sides of the same story, but without the gratuitous pandering of \\"Murder at San Simeon\\". Ultimately, it is up to the reader to decide the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless riches","review":"This is the first jazz album that I bought (1973), completely by chance, and the moment I listened to it, I knew that I was hooked forever. It sparked me to explore one of the richest forms of art ever to emerge from America.Only recently did I start to listen to this again, and I am astonished at the quality of the music. Truly it is one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. Though it was produced after the heyday of hard bop, it comes across as far more melodic and emotional than Charlie Parker, whose music had never spoken to me like this.Highest recommendation. This is the modern Mozart."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY DIGITAL JAZZ!!","review":"Jazz will never sound as it should when mastered on a digital format. Analog vinyl LP's or magnetic tape (as a distant second) is the best way to go. You will NEVER know what you are missing out on without a decent turntable and tube amplifier. Try listening to Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" or Kenny Drew's \\"Undercurrent\\" mp3 album and then find someone who owns it on vinyl and listen... you will never buy another cd or mp3 again and you may want a refund for all those mp3's you bought. Digital jazz is garbage and should only be used while jogging or when not really paying attention to the music (i.e. mowing your lawn)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Individualism begins to melt away","review":"More stellar cuts from a truly inspired session Coltrane held in October of 1960 was perhaps overshadowed by counterpart MFT, though the quality on both nearly remain interchangeable...not quite up to anointed levels of his most provocative quartet days, but injecting a fresh edge into structural predictabilities so as to render them new once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Minor Feat","review":"Some are put off by this minor mode Coltrane effort. That's there problem as this was one of his most outstanding outings. There is no \\"clash and burn\\" here, even by Elvin Jones. It's just wonderful, tight playing. Equinox probably says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up close and personal--warm horn, vocals and honkytonk","review":"A great jam featuring my favorite horn player Curtis Ousley and the for-real piano blues of Champion Jack. This recording might have been heard live in a bar with 4 people there, (all ex-wifes), outside at someones wedding, or in a stadium with 20,000 screaming fans. Nothing pretentious, and great tunes. A good representation by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine blues by a great band","review":"The sound on this recording is very good - there's lots of space and the bass is excellent. The two Duprees - Champion Jack and Cornell - are at the top of their form, Cornell's guitar work is some of the finest around. And King Curtis rocks. The band gets into some excellent grooves and extended improvisations. It is worth getting for the music, but for me Cornell Dupree's work is the highlight here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy van M takes you on a progressive ride","review":"This album isn't released yet...but how have I heard it? www.protonproject.com has a link to a i-net radio station that only plays progressive house. And this has been in regular rotation on this station. I cannot give you many specifics, but this mix is beautiful. Jimmy van M is a DJ who we should be hearing a lot about soon, and he could break into the upper echelon of DJ's. Bedrock 2, grabs you from the get go and takes you on a progressive ride that really lays you back. This isn't a poppy trance dance CD. This is a deep, progressive, moody mix that allows youto experience every emotion. I strongly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Trance","review":"This CD is veeeerrrry trancy. By that I mean, the selections are not meant for dancing, don't have highs and lows, and transitions are very smooth (the strongest aspect of this CD). At times you can't even tell when the current song ends and next song begins, which I think is talent that Jimmy Van M has mastered. The song selections are good and their genre falls somewhere between the 'dark' (downtempo) trance and progressive (electronic) trance. If you like this genre (like I do), then you'll enjoy this CD. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Atmospheric...4 1/2 stars","review":"JVM is a master at crafting intelligent mixes that have superb flow and develop a sense of atmosphere. This mix(disc 1 especially) is no exception. It's very deep, dark, and organic sounding. I just wish there were more DJ's still playing this style. So, if you you like your electronica deep, dark and intelligent then def. buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked","review":"Worked as advertised, like the packets as they are easy and no mess.

Smart scripts and a wonderful cast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"Ah, now I know why I'd not come across it on television before. I didn't have Showtime! Saw the movie, and then the DVD of the first season. I agree with the person who wrote about the pilot episode. I'm happy that the rest of the episodes aren't like that. Still, I think it sets up the premise very well, and I enjoyed the TV shows better than the movie with Russell. (Of course, I'm just slightly biased towards Anderson!)I'm really glad that the episodes are coming out on DVD, since that'll allow me to watch everything in order, which will probably make things make a lot more sense. Wish MGM'd make sure to release them regularly. Doesn't have to be fast, since it costs to collect these set, but just so that we can be sure to get everything! For the people comparing this to Star Trek, however, I think I'd still rather watch Star Trek, if I absolutely had to choose.Incidentally, does anyone know what's happened to the show on Sci-Fi? Has it just disappeared?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hathor","review":"Premise sounded pretty weird, with the idea of an Egyptian sex goddess but the producers really made it work well!

Strange topic but it worked well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"I usually don't like to watch reruns but this was one of the best shows on TV right now. There are some episodes were you wonder what the heck but 90% of them are cool. If your still not sure watch a few episodes at night check the official stargate site for tv watch times. Richard Dean Anderson makes this show happen. When season 2 comes out I will be there with my Credit card."},{"rating":"2","title":"What television can be...","review":"This is one of the best Sci-Fi TV series ever and my list of them is very short. The acting is very good and the episodes are well written. With a little work each one could stand on its own as a movie. The characters are well played and consistant with themselves and each other. The end of the series with the tenth season was probably a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it'd be","review":"An associate of mine has every season of this series and raves about it. He's been lending them to me for a month now, and I must admit, the series is somewhat addictive. I have all the Star Trek NG collection, and the Stargate series is less \\"even\\" than STNG, but the same can be said of most TV series. One thing I have noticed...There certainly are a lot of Alien Worlds that very much resemble Southwestern British Columbia. Hmmm...My seven year old daughter is now a dedicated fan of Stargate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV Show!","review":"I recently gained interest in this series and am excited to own it on dvd. Anyone who is interested in Science Fiction or adventure films should watch this show. My personally favorite episode in this season is Children of the Gods.

Basically, as the producers and writers have said, you'd eventually get pretty annoyed listening to Danniel/whatever other translater might be there translating every single thing that is said by anyone not from the SGC.Right now, Stargate: SG-1 is the number one weekly hour long show, with one planned spin off and a potential movie in the works. If you want to check out the series, you really should start by watching season one, either by getting the DVDs or watching it in syndication. Unlike other shows, jumping into the middle of the series doesn't work well, since it'll take a while to pick up enough information to understand the intricate and lengthy plot, beyond \\"Goa'uld are evil, SGC is good.

No doubt it is done nicely, and it garnered more viewers, and more viewers allowed this awesome show last 10 years.Sadly, now that it has been over a decade since it premeired, there is no need to \\"catch up\\" as most viewing will already be fans, and probably are watching it in a marathon sitting.You can safely skip this episode in my opinion, as it does not advance the plot, and is not interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tin Man","review":"Pretty good scifi stuff with SG1 having their conscience implanted into bots.

Instead, you get a much older box set in a slipcase, with the older artwork, etc.Secondly, it's unfortunate that MGM has chosen to release such a poor quality set of DVDs. The picture quality is extremely grainy to the point that it seems like you're watching a VHS tape, during the dark scenes. This might have been fine 10 years ago, but for anyone who has become used to HD quality, you won't just be disappointed, you'll likely find your viewing experience far less enjoyable than you were hoping.Sadly, it appears that this is our only option for purchasing these on DVD, and it seems unlikely that they will get remastered soon, if ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"SG-1: Awesome Entertainment","review":"The Stargate series is a creative, imaginative and truly entertaining series. There is plenty of action, great special effects, a lot of humor and great story lines. The series' producers have been able to work a great degree of realism into what is obviously a science fiction theme. The characters are great - loaded with great lines, drama, compassion and heroism.I look forward to this weekly show on Showtime and was very pleased about finding a complete boxed set of the entire first season. Looking forward to MGM putting the other seasons on DVD also. Not sure why they are waiting - does anyone know why?I hope MGM figures out how popular this series is and puts more seasons on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect gift for any sci-fi fan","review":"The SG-1 series is terrific! I bought the box set for my husband, and am now hooked myself. Plot and character development are well done, as are special effects. At times it is funny, serious, though-provoking, suspensful....all around entertaining. I can't wait for season 2 to be released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every SG-1 Fan Must Have item.","review":"I have been waiting for many months for this release. It was sure worth the wait. These DVDs play perfect on my audio and video surround system. I recommend this gift set to every SG-1 fan out there. The only place that I have been able to get these DVD's are from the United Kingdom. MGM should be proud of their accomplishment on releasing these episodes on DVD. Thanks MGM, and look forward to future releases of Season 2,3,4, and 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only complaint is how long we had to wait","review":"Definitely a must-have! It's great to finally be able to watch a crisp-clear version of the first season of what I think is the greatest sci-fi series ever to grace the small screen--it very quickly passed up Trek in my book. The bonus featurettes are great, as well--definitely love the behind the scenes snippets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Word of Warning if you're buying this used","review":"Make sure you're buying the repackaged version (the one in the picture) - I'd check with the seller to ask whether their item is the one pictured, because Amazon doesn't seem to be making the distinction. The ISBN from an older set may be the same, but you want to be sure you're getting the right version (guess what, I didn't.)I don't hate the show, I'm just annoyed that they aren't more careful in making distinctions in packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but gets better later on","review":"I had never seen a Stargate show during its entire run on TV, but I have always had a soft spot for sci-fi, so I purchased the first season when it was on sale. Admittedly I was a bit underwhelmed at first, I would have liked a more edgy show, something more like Firefly and not Star Trek. Still, from experience you know how it takes new shows a while to get their story line set up. I trudged on, watched the whole season although you have to suspend disbelief at many things...i.e. they obviously shot scenes from different planets from the same location on set...the scientists in SG-1 can easily kill/fight against trained soldiers who can't seem to hit anything standing in front of them. And when will Teal'c quit grimacing! ARgh.Richard Anderson made the show for me, so that helped each episode. I just finished season 2 and can honestly say it is much better. Overall, it is entertaining and interesting, with improvements as the season goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning","review":"This is the beginning of a great series. When I first got the set I thought it was more to have the whole series than to watch the episodes, but after watching them I remember why I became such a huge Stargate fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"Le langage franais est disponible sur les DVD donc j'ai apprécié encore plus ce coffret . Parfait pour les fans de Stargate-SG1 . Je vous le recommande !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it for the advid fan...","review":"One of the best buys I have ever purchased. If you are a fan who could not be there to watch it on TV and who wants the widescreen format and DVD quality...this box set is a great buy. Some nice bonus features too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargate SG-1 is the best show on T.V. today!!!!!!","review":"Alrighty, my opinion is as follows: The Stargate SG-1 series is cutting edge technology and very mind boggling. It continuously amazes me the alien characters and races they come up with! Let's not talk about Apophis (My Favorite character), He gets not credit whatsoever and he is the best actor in my opinion. Stargate would not be Stargate without Apophis!!!!! This is why they cannot get rid of him, he always finds his way back to the show somehow. We need a protagonist and Antagonist and Apophis is it Baby!!!!!!! Teal'c Rocks also, Jaffa Cre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Singularity","review":"At first I was not liking this episode too much, was a little boring and I did not like the girl. Soon it picked up and there was some good tension and I was left wondering how the issue would be resolved. Good watch but I like action in my scifi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever!","review":"After coming on board during Season 3, I had to buy the boxed Season 1 & 2 DVDs to catch up. Now I find that the program will end after Season 6. Why all the hassle of moving to the Sci-Fi Channel with Season 6 just to end a great series? Pay MacGuyver and all the rest of them what ever they want. They could squeeze ten seasons, easy, out of this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE SCIENCE FICTION","review":"When I was a kid I watched Star Trek (the original, Battle Star Galactica, Logan's Run.

I know episode names and events by heard and I can almost recite all 5 Seasons in order. Sad huh?Anyway, I got hold of this Boxed Set a while back (during Exams actually, a good idea... no study!) as it was the only way to get the Season 1 eps on DVD (I had most of Season 2, but wanted Season 1).Anyway, these DVD's are excellent. A few of the eps are out of order (usually by one though ie. Ep 11 is really Ep 10 and so on) and there are a few that are totally out of order (Ep 12 is NOT The Nox, The Nox is Ep 7 in the series).The quality is amazing, WIDE SCREEN RULES and the sound is great. Plus its every Ep, including the excellent Pilot.I await the Season 3 box (as I've already got all of S2 separately).BYE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality dvd","review":"I am not one for writing reviews although I do appreciate those people who do. But since I have been a fan of this series since its birth I feel complied to to write and let anyone thinking of buying this DVD or any other season know that the quality of these recently released DVDs are terrible and the company really should be embarrassed selling them. I have recently had to split my original 10 season set so I am forced to keep the ones I recently purchased. And even then I had to return Season 1 because it had no sound. There are a lot of Stargate fans and more to come but if I were just beginning to watch the Stargate SG-1 series I am not sure I could sit and watch ten seasons of such poor quality DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! Full frontal nudity on the first episode. Not for kids!","review":"I purchased this product thinking it would be a good family series to watch with my children. I could not believe my eyes when in the middle of the first episode these idiot producers had to completely ruin the story with a totally out of place scene of full female frontal nudity. What were they thinking? This is supposed to be a prime time series. Please avoid watching this with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"SG-1 is cool... MGM shafts fans...","review":"I am enormously disappointed in Season One, Stargate SG-1. I became a fan of Stargate during the 4th season.The main reason... the ONLY reason... why I am disappointed is that the last episode on the last disk is a \\"TO BE CONTINUED\\" episode. They did not include the episode in the Box set.3 Hours of TBC'ed on the last disk not to get the end? For $... I expected to see the last episode of Season one. Season one never airs, and season two is not out yet on DVD.Very disappointed about that.. What's even worse... I NOW I have to get Season 2. ....At least the Saprano's Box Set includes the last episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent \\"B level\\" science fiction","review":"Entertaining but not in the same league as Star Trek, the new BattleStar Galactica, Buffy, or Roswell. Never explained why every alien they meet speaks English, especially as language barriers were important in the original movie. Some of the acting is wooden, especially Teal'C and Carter. However, Jackson, O'Neil and Hammond are well-acted characters. The plot lines do not bear a lot of scrutiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"goa'uld reproduction","review":"So how do they reproduce. The series is inconsistent. In Children of the Gods, Skaara is taken to be host for Apophis and Aumanet's (sp)son. Later on, Hathor is 'mother' of all Goa'uld as Egeria is mother of all Tokra. So... can it both? Not for the Tokra since they are facing extinction I believe.I love the 1st ep as it sets the tone for the rest of the series. I love Shank's impression of Spader. (I prefer nerdy Jackson, to macho Jackson) Tapping's Carter is so-so with that horrific 'internal plumbing' line but gets better. Quickly. Its always a darn shame a TV series can't equal the big feel of the movie, even just extra-wise so a movie population of 5000 isn't pared down to a town of 50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansion Primer","review":"I enjoyed this extension of the great Feature film. I was a little taken aback by nudity in the Pilot. I felt the original airing of the Pilot went over very well and that this addition was not needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humble Beginnings","review":"Stargate SG-1 is an incredible show, it completely satisfies the Sci-Fi nerd within me. With new worlds being explored every episode you never know what is going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargate is an enduring classic","review":"As a science fiction show that doesn't use a lot of modern technology, this show will probably be a timeless classic. Of all of the movies and tv series of the Stargate franchise, it's the most watched and has the largest cult following.Totally Socks just did a parody of this show, where all of the characters were sock puppets. It just show that even 5 years after the show ended, it's still relevant.For me, Jack (Richard Dean Anderson) and Carter (Amanda Tapping) make the show, while the other characters provide the necessary balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emancipation weaker episode","review":"This is a stand alone weak episode and involves a primitive human species who enslave their women. Very uninteresting and irrelevant to the overall series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set, however disc one is Rated R","review":"I purchased this set for my husband as he loves the show. The rating on Amazon indicates it is rated NR. All of the discs in the first series state they are rated NR except the first movie. It is rated R. There is a scene with full frontal nudity and parts of the first show was graphic. This does not offend me or my husband, however it was my understanding from the website that the first show in the series would have been something my children could watch. My only problem with the set is how it was advertised on Amazon. It should have stated part of the set was an R rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy filming","review":"Not sure why the disk was so low quality. The picture was fuzzy and sometimes pixelated. I cleaned my dvd player and tried it again. still the same problem. so i tried it again on my other dvd player on a different tv. still the same problem.SG-1 is a wonderful tv series and would recommend the series to all sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gread SciFi addition","review":"When the series debuted on ShowTime, I avoided it. \\"Great, another movie rip-off\\" I thought. Then one evening when there was nothing on the other 200 or so cable stations, I watched a re-run of SG-1 on ShowTime. I was blown away. Way better than the Movie - especially the direction it took with the snakes. I purchased some of the DVD's as they were released so I could catch-up on the episodes I missed (most of season 1 and 2.) Then the boxed set came out, and I purchased it. Sure, I now had three duplicate DVD's...The DVD's are great. The quality is great. Just wish there were more extras!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to a great series","review":"Picking up where the movie left off, Stargate:SG-1 is a great continuation of the action and excitement we saw in it. It is icredible what the creators of this show have done. When I saw the movie, I was amazed. When I saw the pilot for the show \\"Children of the Gods\\", I was completly blown away. If you're into sci-fi, buy this. If you like the military, buy this. If you like fantasy, buy this. I have the first season on DVD, and am counting down the days until I can buy season 2. I can't wait to see what happens. This series will completly astound you! Long live SG-1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargate SG-1 First Season","review":"With amazing sound, storys and visual efects, Stargate has become one of most interesting TV cults. It opens with an excelent first season. The episodes are a great combination of science and mithology. The stories are well adapted, with a good development of the characters through the series and excellent quality. Episodes such as Children of the Gods, The Enemy Within, The Nox, Thor\`s Hammer, The Torment of Tantalus, Fire and Water, Hathor, There But For the Grace of God, and Within the Serpent's Grasp are shocking. The villains are great, although Apophis is defeated so many times, (reason why villains lose fans), his faliures in this season will lead to the opportunity to rule the largest military empire in the galaxy, (so do not laugh at him). Few series have begun with such a strong season. Won't regret it, buy it right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"5.1 Dolby Surround","review":"While the cover for Season 1 clearly states audio is in English 5.1 Dolby Surround it is not true. The epsodes contain only stero sound. I was very disappointed by this. I already owned it and only purchased it again to get the improved sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great collection!","review":"Stargate SG-1 has become one of our favorite shows, so we naturally wanted to buy the season 1 and 2 DVD collections. Unlike something like ST:TNG, this show was great from episode 1 on- none of that first season trying to get into character or sub-par special effects. The storylines are well thought out, well written, well acted, and overall very fun to watch.The quality of the season packages themselves is high- very professional and well done. I would highly recommend both season 1 & 2 collections and can't wait for more of them to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Sci-Fi, maybe for 2 year olds","review":"I can't believe people are giving this 5 stars, the acting is bad, the whole movie looks cheap, and the script is bad. The script is written like a comedy as the actors try to make a joke in every situation. The budget for this series must of been low, as everything likes fake, it seems to be targeted for children, it can be compared to the Power Rangers show. The movie Star Gate was great, but this doesn't compare. I love Sci-Fi movies but this is really garbage, if you have any interest in this, watch an episode on the sci-fi channel before you buy it. I bought this set along with a x-files box set, If you like sci-fi the x-files is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargate SG-1 Season 1 (Thinpak)","review":"My daughter and I have enjoyed this series so far.

What made this disappointing is the frontal nudity within episode 1, thus our children aren't able to watch how the season began. Having watched all episodes buying them was something we wanted so that the kids could enjoy them. Rhetorical I know but, what is the value of releasing a R rated version of episode 1 when the PG-13 would be just fine?

This is so stupid and the production values are poor at best.I do not see why anyone would waste their time on such drivel.

If you don't believe me, watch it yourself and see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"mystified","review":"I had a lot of friends that were big fans of the show, so I gave it a chance and rented season one. I was mystified in that I couldn't see how it got renewed let alone become the cult hit it is.The production values were low, the characters lacking in charisma and originality, acting was mostly bad, and the writing was nothing more than knock offs of other shows. The only thing that seemed to stay amusing was seeing the aliens based off various forms of mythology, but it has been done before and this didn't break any new ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Sci Fi Show","review":"I entered the realm of SG1 after being spoiled by the Farscape universe. I understand that SG1 is very popular (and I will try to give it a second chance) but the acting, the sets and the writing are horrendous. The show lacks intelligence and depth. The SG1 universe has great potential but this season makes me miserable as I watch the poor acting in this show. There is no chemistry between the actors. The closest analogy I can think of would be a simple comic book turned into a TV show. It is difficult for me to understand that the Sci-Fi channel keeps producing this junk while other more creative and deserving Sci-Fi shows (read Farscape) are terminated. The quality of SG1 (the first season) is truly mediocre (acting, writing, sets! Perhaps the other seasons are stellar (after all - the show is popular) but this first one certainly did not make me want to go there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not family television...","review":"The rest of the season, might be ok to watch as a family, but NOT the pilot. What is the deal with Hollywood ruining a perfectly good show with nudity? The pilot has quite a LONG scene that shows full nudity for quite a while. I fast forwarded it as long as I could, and had to turn it off. It was too much to see, even with the DVD player going in fast forward. Give me a break! All the reviews say Not Rated, with no idication of any other ratings. But if you look at the back of that disc case, once you get it home after buying it, it says rated R for nudity. I don't think people should be surprised with that content being in the movie. Why don't the websites say that in their reviews, so parents can know what they are bringing into their home. I will not keep something that filthy in my home, and am sure other parents wouldn't want it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"Item was shipped as promised and in great condition.

The only thing I found lacking was the extras, and the reason I gave the set 4 stars instead of 5. MGM (is bad) when it comes to stuff like this. The reason for DVD over VHS is simply because of (a)better picture and sound quality (usually), and (b) the extras, like behind the scenes, interviews, commentary, etc.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"quality dvd pack and quality tv show","review":"I was concerned about ordering these dvds because of the negative reviews of the quality of the dvds themselves.Thank goodness, I overcame that concern and decided to try at least one of these - the first season as a sample.My pack has not demonstrated any problems with the dvd quality at all --- still have a couple disks to go and will update this review when have completed viewing all the episodes.As for the episodes, it is great to be able to view one of my favorite tv shows without the interruption of commercials.I am ordering seasons, two and three, next month and will continue to order 2 seasons per month until have the complete set.Please note, this review is for the separate seasons in the white packs and not the boxed set."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows ever","review":"Stargate Sg-1 is the epitome of great television and Season 1 started it off spectacularly. It is rare to see a tv show produce such well developed characters and plot lines in it's first season. And the show gets only better. If you like Sc-fi you will love SG-1. If you are not a huge Sci-fi fan... you will still like this show as the foundation is reality and drama, set in a plausible modern day scientific setting.My only issue is that the last episode is a cliff hanger.

The series (aired on Showtime) developed an outstanding concept first presented in the movie Stargate, which stared Kurt Russell. I have to say that Richard Dean Anderson was a brilliant choice to fill the role vacated by Russell. The stories are extremely well written and the performances by all of the cast members shows TV at its finest. Backed with imaginative and exciting special effects, this is a series that will be popular for years to come. Although saddened that it is in its last season, I was overjoyed when the first season was released to DVD. I hope that all remaining seasons will follow suit. Well-done Showtime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Series and Sci Fi Fans","review":"This box set is a wonderful addition to any Sci Fi fan's collection. The quality - sound and video - is excellent. Having the entire first season has allowed me to catch the episodes I have missed and fill in a few blanks in more recent episodes. The featurettes are nice, but the primary reason for buying this boxed set is to have the first season and be able to revisit it at your leasure. The special effects are wonderful for a 45 minute/episode series. The scripts are well done and the acting is excellent. It is nice to be able to watch the episodes closer together a see the character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eck!!!","review":"I ordered this dress and when I received it, I thought that it was very pretty.

One of the reviews says the DVD version restores the original music, so I am going to buy it. Can't wait to see the original version. This movie is one of the best feel good movies I've ever seen.

Like many others, I really do not like the alternate release from MGM. I see alot of people who don't know how to tell the difference. If your movie opens with the song \\"Mama Says There Will Be Days Like This\\" you have the alternate version from MGM. The original version is Tommy Page singing \\"Shag\\" and would could forget when the girls take off to Myrtle Beach along with the song \\"Saved\\" I used to smoke! I used to drink!You will enjoy this movie no matter what though and it really is \\"The Most Fun!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I Fancy \\"Shag\\"","review":"This movie was probably greenlighted after the success of \\"Dirty Dancing\\". All I can say is this movie has it all over that slick article. What I like about it is that it feels real. You're transported into a time and place and it feels authentic. In this case it's Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in the Summer of '63 and what I like is that this film does not resort to cliche in depicting the South during that turbulent time in our history. The four leads are full-bodied characters written and performed wonderfully nonesomuch as Annabeth Gish as Pudge. Only through some plot contrivance would you consider her fat. Her performance at the shag contest is ebullient and puts Jennifer Grey to shame. I thought the music in the film was great but it's been pointed out by other reviewers that some of the songs have been deleted and substituted. I guess that would be my only debit to an otherwise perfect flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"The movie shag is funny, romantic, and fun filled. I have literally seen it at least 75 times. It is my all time favorite movie, and I reccomend it for people 11 and older. It takes place in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. It's about four young women who are best friends and decide to take their last vacation together before college. While they're there they discover their inner selves and along the way run into romance, and challenges. And it is deffinately worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The songs on the DVD are unbearable!!!","review":"I have watched my VHS copy of Shag (my all-time favorite movie) at least fifty times and always sing along to every song. When the DVD copy arrived in the mail last week, I immediately watched it and could not have been more dissapointed! Listening to new songs take the place of the old songs that fit perfectly in the movie was UNBEARABLE! I honestly could not finish watching this version because it drove me crazy to hear the replacement songs that don't even go with the time period or mood of the scenes.MGM, please release another DVD version of Shag that has the originial songs on it! I would buy it in a heart beat, no matter the cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD remaster Sucks...Buy it on VHS instead.","review":"Don't buy Shag on DVD. You will be very disappointed.

That's why only two stars. My Sony WEGA TV has 4 picture settings and I tweaked the Vivid setting to make this DVD watchable. Phoebe Cates and Annabeth Gish were great.

I'm just so afraid my VCR will eat my original Shag! This movie is extremely endearing. At times, I think I relate to one of the characters, and then I see myself in another.

That is more evident in movies then in any other source of entertainment. If you want porn, you could view it as such.

Be careful when you order these types of things to insure that you are getting actually what you expect and not an inferior replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I should not have spent my money on this...","review":"I am one of those guys who dutifully changes the oil in his car when the mileage is up. So, of course, when my Brother printer hit the 20,000 mark and started telling me it was time to replace the drum, I spent the money and did it. Of course, the drum I had was printing just fine, but who was I to argue with scheduled maintenance?Now with my NEW drum, I get ghost printing when I print envelopes. I get a weak image of the first text and then a second even weaker image of the text again below it. It is like the toner is sticking to the drum and getting put on the paper a second time as the drum turns. If I move the blue slider back and forth a few times it will clear up for a little while.I need to call Brother and let them know my problem. I regret, though, spending the money on a new drum, when my old one was working perfectly fine. Unfortunately, I through the old one out before we discovered the problem with the new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very truthful advertisement","review":"I don't know how many times that I have to respond to one little purchase I have done.

It plays like concert from beginning to end, and never slows down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"live\\" classic","review":"No studio album ever captured the \\"magic\\" of the J.Geils Band.

But this was not only a god awful western but this overall was a god awful movie. This sucked hard because the plot was extremely stupid, the acting was terrible, and the characters were terribly written and the director did a terrible job. The entire script was terrible and this movie had western cliches of the charts. Another big problem was that for a movie called posse they didn't act like it. Throughout the movie they didn't work together well and 2 of them died early in the movie so overall this was terrible and shouldn't be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo so bad","review":"How anyone can give this even 3 stars, let alone five is beyond me.This is so bad it's painful to watch. The acting is awful. The story terrible. The music, frankly if I were black, I'd find it insulting. Plus Van Peebels' wardrobe looks more YMCA than cowboyThis is the biggest turkey I've seen in a while. It's a kids film... I think it would be ideal for 8 or 9 year olds - who might quite enjoy it.

You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE CRAP","review":"This is not what I thought the film was about, the film had nothing to do with a posse. The original film \\"Posse\\" with Kirk Douglas was excellent, the film defined the term \\"POSSE\\" deputizing men and searching for the villan or villans. This crap shoot involved a bunch of thugs an early version of a western hip hop gangster. The film sucked from the start to the very end. The only reason I continued viewing the awful film was I hoped that it would improve as the film progressed, however, that never materialized. If you have approximately 2-hours to waste, spend that time watching something else. I have seen better westerns, this was the worst (acting was second rate). There was even an attempt to use sex to improve the film, the sex scene with Mario Van Peebles and Salli Richardson-Whitfield did not add anything infact it detracted. Don't waste your time watching this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD does not work","review":"I'm sorry, but I must have purchased the wrong DVD.

This movie tells the sad but true story of the injustice done against the Afro-Americans though the \\"Cowboy\\" age and up till today. The story is about racism, hate and fear but just as much about friendship, love, hope and trust. This movie has comedy, action, drama, romance, tragedy and adventure. You name it. This movie has it all. A very touching and moving movie. If you don't cry in the end you got to have a heart of stone. I have used this video in my English class in High School and the children liked it very much. Now they seem to understand under what kind of conditions the minority grounds lived (still do? ) and what they were meet with in the \\"land of dreams and freedom\\".

Mother is dead but we will see her as a memory displayed as if in a commercial. Lots of cute animals acting more like household pets than wild animals - very educational. Animals don't really die they just change into an ad graphic.

As a mother who trying to raise her children to conduct themselves better then this young man did in this movie I feel it was inapporiate lanugae, and therefore we will not be watching this movie again.

Total Eclipse was more adventurous and varied. This album is somewhat mellower, excellent playing by all, some uptempo stuff, but I wish that the music would take off - the \\"gung-ho\\" of Spectrum is missing here.

I didn't get a chance to watch it in theatres, but I did watch it on VHS with a few friends back in late 1995. This movie just could not hold my attention (or theirs, for that matter) nor was it anywhere close to have us laughing in stitches. I don't care if it was meant to be Michael Moore's way of being perpetually condescending and opposed to conservatives or if this movie had been done by a conservative. It just flat out wasn't worth the money to rent it for wasting our time to watch it.According to Wikipedia, it appears that the film didn't win any Razzies.

The movie itself is one of the jaw-dropping cinematographic works of the 20th century and there's nothing I can add to the numerous reviews and analyses which universally, and rightfully, praise this film. Having seen the original in theaters I may never be satisfied with ANY transfer.Ok, I watched this on a 40 inch HDTV with built-in and simulated surround sound. I was enchanted, entranced, and spellbound. If NOT for having seen the original I would be raving about this to my friends.

But it's not for people who are looking for light entertainment. Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, the film may leave you with a feeling that there's no hope left in the world. The battle and massacre scenes at one of the castles are stunning. It's what I imagine Dante's Inferno would look like. And the images of the old lord leaving the burning castle are truly unforgettable.Tatsuya Nakadai plays the lead character, Lord Hidetora. He starred in dozens of movies, many of them classics. But he gives perhaps his finest performance in Ran. It's also worth seeing this movie just to watch Lady Kaede, played by actress Mieko Harada. She is the one person everyone will remember. Kurosawa has a knack for creating female characters who can make their macho samurai husbands look like wimps. If you've ever seen Throne of Blood, then you'll know what I'm talking about. The scene where Kaede finds a bug on the floor is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!","review":"Ran is the Japanese version of King Lear. It is hypnotic.

Now.This is, in the opinion of many, the finest movie ever made. It is easy to see why so many hold this view, as it combines great writing (It's based on Shakespeare's King Lear afterall), incredibly cinematography (the reason it is ONLY availible in widescreen in that Kurosawa is one of the only directors who knew how to use the letterbox format), and great action.At the time of it's filming it was the most expensive Japanese movie ever made, and it shows. The costumes were given great attention, as were the spectacular battle scenes, all involving thousands of fully costumed extras. The battle scene in which no sound effects were used creates an incredible amount of tension and shows the collapsing mind of King Hidetora literally.All in all this is one of the best movies ever.

For those sorely dissapointed by the two previous editions of Ran on DVD this could not come as better news! No word yet on other extras or number of discs. There is a chance, of course, like past Critereon releases that they could lose the license quickly (reverts back to studio that owns the film) and that it could be run in limited quantities (like \\"Straw Dogs\\" was).Hope this makes the discussion on the so-called Masterworks version versus the Fox Lorber edition moot.

Through out the first 40 min. of the film, there are intances of both horizontal and vertical blanking - a static which appears on all vertical and horizontal lines. It is also obvious that this film was mastered from a film print and not the interpositive -- the blacks are fuzzy and the dark scenes look as if they have a scrim or screen over them. I also noted two instances of sound drop outs.All of these are issues which could have been fixed.

It really is a shameful, shoddy piece of work. By all means, order the movie. It's Kurosawa's magnum opus, great in every detail.

Now, does any one else agree with me that the painfully long scene involving Heditora and the jester rather...boring. I'm sure many of you feel Kurosawa is the greatest filmaker of all time, and can surely give me some input as to the importance of this scene. I thought the point was made much faster than the part lasted.

Outrageously melodramatic. This isn't my favorite Kurosawa, but being less of a Masterpiece than, say, \\"Seven Samurai\\" still makes it more of a Masterpiece than most directors could hope to achieve.

Filled with action, battles, drama, intrigue, Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear takes a unique flavor with a serious undercurrent of Buddhism. The message of the film that God is watching as men destroy each other; that God mourns the cruelty is pushed home directly in the final scene as the image of Buddha lies fallen on the ground below one of the old ruler's victims.Emotionally touching, it is a heavy, but enjoyable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen.

Alas, this is the work of amateurs! Looks more like a 2008 Blu release (the term \\"upconverted\\" has been thrown around a lot, and after seeing screen captures I can see why). Shame on you, Studio Canal, for pushing such a sub-standard transfer on us Kurosawa buffs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent version of King Lear from Kurosawa (set in Medieval Japan)","review":"This classic Japanese Samurai film from 1985 is full of fantastic images, costumes, sets and scenery. The budget must have been tremendous to pay for all those extras, sets, etc. Really a great visual film. The story, based on King Lear, and acting are also very good. The only weak point is that I feel a half hour could have been edited out of the film without losing much. There are bits that drag a bit, especially when you are watching the film for a second or third time. Nonetheless, a classic film that serves up a unforgettable visual feast and a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent book, but not one of Ms. Mayhew better books","review":"\\"Those in Peril\\" by Margaret Mayhew tells the story of Louis Duval who after the fall of France to the Nazis decides to leave France for England.

Louis then enbarkes back to France as an agent for Allan Powell of the Royal Navy.This is not one Ms. Mayhew's better books. The characters seem flat and not that interesting.

Looking back at it, I should have gone with something that can cut holes quickly and without creating a mess....anyway....this tool is good for marking a circle in the drywall but it doesn't have the ability to cut all the way through. I ended up using a drywall saw on every hole. Useless tool in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product quality control","review":"I am a carpenter by trade, and unlike the previous 2 star reviews, I am well aware that this tool isn't meant to cut clean through drywall, rather it is meant to score the paper face of the drywall to make the final cut nice and clean.My complaint about this product is what I can only assume comes from a lack of product quality control. The adjustment knob that locks the pin is incredibly stiff (to the point that I had to use a set of vice grips to loosen it). Additionally, the adjustment knob is shaped similar to a flying saucer and the edge of the 'saucer' is very sharp. On other circle cutters I have used, the outside edge of the knob is similar to the edge of a quarter, and the ribbed edge seems to make it significantly easier to make quick adjustments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use and barely cuts...","review":"I liked the idea of using this to cut holes in my ceiling to install in-ceiling speakers.

I had much better luck using a roto-zip tool and bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"In your face, no apologies Jazz","review":"Okay, I admit it upfront: I am a Herbie Mann fan, and this CD captures the essence of what he was doing at the very end of the 60's.The musical style is very R&B focused, and the band provides a gritty, chunky foundation for the solos of Mann, Ayers (vibes), Coryell (guitar) and Sharrok (guitar). The recording leaves a little to be desired, but the playing is outstanding. Mann's playing is strong, and the rhythm section captures the overall feel of the time, with strong bass/rhythm lines that sit in groove all day long. The sound is somewhat dated, but to me it's *history* - an important part of the jazz tradition. Regardless, the album certainly has something to say to today's listener.Overall, think Steppenwolf with a rocking flute over the top. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality of a great Movie","review":"For me one of the best gangster films ever made this film shows great action with terrific playing stars Charles Bronson and Alain Delon. The quality of this Essex Entertainment/D-vision Edition of the film is horrible. Its somewhere between black and white and coulor picture in the quality of a bad video pirate copy. The voices of the actors seem to sound out of a deep cellar. There are no additional features even no chapter choice or sound setup.

Even if they do, shipping is over $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"great desk mug, not so much for my travels","review":"I bought this mug to keep my protein drink cold in the car until after my gym workout. It keeps the drink fairly cool if I fill it completely with ice, but liquid seeps around the sliding sipper and drips. Does not keep the drink cool in a hot car in summer - maybe it would with the regular sealed lid. After dripping on my clothes in the car for a week, I decided it works better for me as a water mug at my desk. Keeps H20 plenty cool indoors, lid keep dust and gnats out. I stick a straw through the sipper (I drink about 2x the amount of H20 with a straw). It is pretty and pink and still professional looking. It does leave water with a definite metallic taste like all of the stainless steel bottles I have tried. P.S. The BEST bottle to keep my protein drink cool for two hours in my hot car is the Blender Bottle from GNC. I mix the powder with H20 and the blender ball works great, fill the entire bottle with ice and it stays cool until I am done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product - broke first time we used it","review":"We were very disappointed in this product. We purchased a set of four to anchor a portable soccer goal. The first time we screwed it into the ground, it broke. The metal didn't snap, but it bent. The corkscrew shaped portion kinda unwound. So now it's useless. Won't go back in the ground when we move the goals. (I don't know if it hit a rock or something, but our soil isn't **that** hard. And after all, we are using it for it's intended purpose - it's supposed to go into the ground.I've seen similar (or identical) products offered by other vendors.

Presley was never an actor, and proves it once again here. But the songs are even worse than his acting. There are no good ones. None. Not even the title song, whioch was never a major hit for him. The rest of the cast is the usual melange of unknowns or semi-knowns who either totally non-act, or overact with the extremely limited talent they have. Only Harry Morgan, who was likely the only really talented one in the bunch (OK, Strauss to a degree, too) seemed to be having a good time; it's almost as if he went into the movie with a \\"Hell, it's a paycheck\\" attitude. The ending goes beyond trite into fantasy. And what can you say about Donna Douglas? Well, she was slightly better here than as Ellie May Clampett.

Bernardi misinterprets many of the episodes, taking certain scenes and characters way out of context, and ignores the vast majority of scripts that would counteract his hyper-PC argument. I found myself disagreeing with him in almost every paragraph. For example, Bernardi seems to think that every use of the color black in Star Trek and other Sci-Fi shows and movies is an automatically racist gesture (!); this is a paranoid, ignorant and ridiculous assumption. And just when it seems like he's about to make a valid point about a particular episode or scene, he takes it too far by making grandiose statements which have no basis in reality.

Like most diatribes of it's kind, it hinges its indictment of Star Trek's racism on the most petty and ridiculous things and has no connection to reality but to the author's black and white version of reality.

This moron thinks anything relating to the color black in \\"Star Trek\\" is immediately a racist gesture. I assume if there were more pale colored aliens, he would consider it an obvious exclusionary act and therefore also racist. Not only that, but this guy spends an entire chapter spitting out a point that could be summed up in a page.

I love Moroccan food and always want to learn how to make those delicious dishes my mother-in-law made. When I bought this book, my husband and his brother thought the recipes must be westernized. After they tasted my Briouats(shrimp and ground beef) and B'stilla (seafood and chicken), they changed their minds. Most recipes are authentic and easy to follow. It's a great book. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not many recipes","review":"hi, i am a moroccan from casablanca but i live in the united states, when i first saw this book and read the reviews, i thought i found the perfect cook book, but when i got it, i was not too happy with it, first off, there are only a few recipes, some of them are traditional , well this book is perfect for someone who had never tried the real moroccan food and is a beginner, but for someone who knows moroccan food and what it is suppose to taste like should try to find another, i personaly was iffy about getting a moroccan cookbook from a non moroccan author, but some of the FEW recipes are good but i would rather get one that is writting by a moroccan author. i give the book a 2-3 star but it is not EXCELLENT, and i want EXCELLENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous - Demystifies Morrocan Cooking","review":"Finally, a book that makes Moroccan cooking approachable, flavorable, and beautiful.

This CD is mostly for salesman that sells to large accounts. Although I think the attitude he is talking about is good, I just don't get that many actual tips or techniques I find helpful. Plus, I would challenge that if the product that you are selling is great, it is not as impressive you can sell it. It would be that you can sell something that is just average.

The authors seem to really dislike most of the places in this area, so almost put me off visiting a really nice town, and their restaurant research seems confined to the few standard tourist offerings and then a listing of fancy expensive restaurants. It's not difficult to find a good meal in France for 35 EU, any hotel can recommend one, we wanted the book to help find which was the best of the cheaper places. I saw a ton of restaurants in Marseille with menus 20 EU and under, but no clue which of them were good.

Its not loud in low rpm but in mid rpms you hear a nice rumble. It runs at 90db open and about 80db standing(this is with a stock setup with intake, maybe louder on straight pipes(catback) without resonator and converter. Best thing with this muffler is there is no drone when at a constant speed so its highway/long travel friendly. On Wot it really opens up and roars, on 4 cylinder engines there is no nasty \\"Brrrruuppphh\\" sound, but a nice clean mellow performance rumble. Performance wise there is a small difference. Same with mpg, I say maybe 1-2mpg increase on my part thats if your not lead footing for a sound.

I'm sure this one has been discussed in junior high poetry classes for decades. Stills was a talented guitarist and his work with Buffalo Springfield holds up pretty well, but stuff like this clearly demonstrates why CS&N were always trying to get Neil Young to hang out with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the Amazon reviewer an idiot?","review":"What could the reviewer possibly mean that Stills was not the most accomplished of the artist in CSN or CSNY. Yes we all love the gritty Young, but the truth is he barely showed up for the recording sessions traveled separately from the group and has given half hearted efforts into several projects tHey are a better group without the sulking Mr. Young. As CSN goes, Stills is the glue that held the group togther musically. He wrote most of the better songs and arranged them all Crosby and Nash would have been spares without Stills' glaring talent to lead the way. I' ve own this album, tape, CD in some form since 1970. It show cases the individual talents of someone who just wanted to make music not headlines."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REVIEWER....","review":"Suffice it to say that the Amazon reviewer in this case is... an idiot. Anyone who knows anything about Stills knows that he is a GREAT GREAT musician and player. He can run rings around C, N, Y... yes, even Y. And most others. This is his best solo album, a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will it be the same, being remastered?","review":"Chilling, that is how it feels to remember this music, when I first heard it, in 1970. I haven't heard this remastered version yet, and I wonder if I should. Will it be the same? Stephen Stills was one of the exceptionally gifted natural musicians of that era. Could he make that Martin sing? He was a brilliant and sensitive arranger, as evidenced here and on the later LP with David Crosby and Graham Nash. One only hopes that original brilliance is not obscured by expectations of current taste in the remastering. That would be a great shame. (Note: my five stars are for the original LP version.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Editorial Reviewer Gavin McNett is off his nut.","review":"Stills inferior to Crosby and Nash? Who plays every lead instrument on their first album together? Stills. He also wrote their most sophisticated hits, \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Carry On.\\" Further, Stills' compositional, instrumental, and vocal skills evolved considerably after he wrote and recorded \\"For What It's Worth.\\" The style of that old chestnut bears no resemblance to anything on this album; McNett mentioning the song is little more than name-dropping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick The Seeds Out Of The Reviews","review":"The Amazon.com review didn't quite hit the mark here. Stills, in fact, *was* the most accomplished member of CSN. He also wrote the best songs that will last the longest of the trio. (..leaving out Mr. Young here since it would be tough for anyone to top that poet/visionary..) Strongly advise picking up both of Still's first two solo albums; they fit together well. Stills continued the great work with his band Manassas. Soul is a good word to associate with Stills. He sings and plays with soul, and examines the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Without any doubt, this album is an great eclectic mix of rock, blues, gospel and acoustic, each masterfully executed by a musician who has been under rated for years. The only way these tracks could be enjoyed any more is to actually see Stills perform them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not accomplished?","review":"I'm astonished by the comments of the amazon.com reviewer. Stills is the most accomplished musician in CSNY: He played every instrument except the drums on the debut record and almost all on Deja Vu. While all the guys in CSNY have their strengths, Stills is the one with cache with serious players. Incidentally, it's Stills, not Clapton playing the solo in the middle of \\"Go Back Home.\\" (Clapton plays the coda). Listen to Stills handle the Hammond B-3 on the jam with Hendrix. It's a shame this guy never lived up to his talent, but when this album was released he was at the top of his game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"An often overlooked solo artist, Stephen Stills has been an instrumental part of Rock and Roll and this CD showcases his talents as a singer, songwriter and guitarist. Great guest artists like Hendrix and Clapton round out the sound. If you love music, this CD should be part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"these are classics","review":"love the one your with... stills hits it on the head with his music and writing and singing... he is the man... a must listen to this album over and over please...Charlie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maestro Stills","review":"The Amazon Reviewer guy must not know...such a pitifal description of this album. Stills includes some of his most astonishing and acomplished guitar and recording saavy on this vinyl. It's a favorite and has been since its release (at my house). Stills' artistry knows what sounds to keep and which to toss and a master who knows how to tease just the right licks out of his instruments and then ices the whole deal in the technical realm as well. Stills is THE de facto cross-over country, island influenced and GREAT rock n roll bluesman of this age. And a real smart man as well, just listen to his lyrics!

At one time, I only used one to carry my hand tools to work every day, but once I discovered that it was also the perfect size to store my climbers, work gloves, rope lanyard, pole strap, extra gaffs and wrenches all in the same bag, I have been using one for that purpose as well. I have one of these bags that is probably close to 20-years old now and still in use. Over the years, I've repaired a few small holes in the canvas with a Speedy Stitcher awl and replaced the four rivets that hold the leather handles on, but other than that it is all original and still in one piece.

It's on disc 2 of that album. It's definitely worth it for just that song, but the album itself is pretty good as well. \\"Purge The World\\" was originally written when Steve Souza was in the band but it was called \\"Crime Of The Century\\". That song wasn't allowed to be released with the lyrics that either Souza or Holt had written because it was about how Century Media records screwed them over, at least that's what I heard about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thrash but not Exodus","review":"Imagine a band that has re-vitalized itself with a classic sounding album with a (nearly) classic line-up a few years ago (Tempo of the Damned). Imagine that you loose the singer (Steve - Retro - Souza), one of the guitar players (Rick Hunolt) and the drummer (Tom Hunting) from that comeback. What do u do? For Gary Holt the answer was simple.Recruit Paul Bostaph (ex Slayer and Forbidden), recruit a fit thrash guitarist (Lee Altus, ex-Heathen) find a new singer Rob Dukes. And go on...Although the name is still Exodus, the sound is Exodus no more. No offence to the guys. This is AGGRESSIVE, angry and pure thrash. No doubt that this is metal. A good album with classic thrashy riffs, good vocals, good drumming. It is not a slow album also. This is pure Bay Area Thrash with roots in the underground scene. Why 4 stars? Because it does not sound like Exodus..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy","review":"Yeah this CD is heavy alright and Rob Dukes vocals are killer but it kind of loses the feel of an actual \\"Exodus\\" CD.

I was shocked when i heard Rick Hunolt was gone but the new guy steps in well! Exodus has one of the best guitar attacks in all of metal i love their tone and shred!!! I have to admit i miss MR. Souza on vocals but the new guy holds his own very well!!! By all means pick this up!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their best","review":"First off, their new singer isn't terrible but he is bland compared to Souza. A lot of the riffs start to get repetitive after a while and some of the lyrics are corny. But overall this album has some very fast drumming and great solos, it's just lacking the energy of their previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Thrash Metal","review":"I was really looking forward to this release. All I can say is that I am very disappointed in it after all the hype I read online. Rob Dukes is a very average vocalist. He is way to monotone in his vocalizations. Everything he does is pretty much the same tempo, no screams and no yells and the same vocal phrasing style in every song. The riffs are pretty generic as well. I've listened to this several times and I can't remember one song where with Tempo of the Damned every song was memorable and catchy with that monster Exodus groove. All in all, I'm not to happy with this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Folks...","review":"This is NOT EXODUS! Yeah, Gary Holt is present but it's like he's appearing on another bands cd.

A distinguished historian at University of Hawaii, Stephan analyzes the place of Hawaii in Japanese military strategy in WW II. Obviously, this raises the question of the fate of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The issue has received illumination in recent books by Greg Robinson and Eric Muller. Stephan offers a politically incorrect interpretation that indicates that the Japanese military thought they could rely on using American Japanese for their purposes following a successful invasion of Hawaii. The prospect cannot be denied. With internal national security issues more vital than ever, Stephan's book should be on the minds of all serious students and citizens today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Mystery","review":"Sorry to disagree with all the enthusiastic reviews, but this novel has much more interest as a slight character study than any sort of mystery. The killer's identity is pretty much concealed by the author not by the story.Kava does spend some effort building up sympathy for a large number of characters, and, in part, does it well. I found her description of life from the point of view of a victim of early onset Alzheimers to be quite haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is so special about Kava?","review":"I've just read that title and wonder what do some people like in Kava's novels? A simple story? Gore? Melodrama? \\"She had a look at his strong legs and surprised she noticed that she liked them.\\" (sorry, I'm not a native speaker and I read it translated to Polish, but that is a fine example of the author's \\"prose\\"). If you like other Kava's books you will probably like this one too, but if you didn't go for Thomas Harris, Dean Koontz or Jeffrey Deaver and other master story-tellers: one page of their prose is often more interesting than this entire novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deft and suspenseful plotting leading to a let-down at the end","review":"I originally was inclined to dismiss Alex Kava as just another suspense writer catering to mystery fans of the female gender, but have rapidly discovered she is much more than that.I found this Meg O'Dell one of the very best with sklllful plotting, but quite disappointing in the denouement. However, Alex redeemed herself in my eyes with the nasty little twist in the epilog. This is bound to please her presant fans and bring her new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary Read","review":"I love the first two books by Alex kava but this one seems so ordinary. The ending seems like it is rushed. Like the editor/publisher is rushing her to finish. There is no suspense like the two previous books. The characters are not well develeoped. Lillian, Calvin and Wally had so much introduction than basically disappeared into the story. The relationship between Gwen and Tully also seems to be rushed.

There are antidotes, however, and this disk is one of them. Glazier is an incredibly intelligent (as well as technically skilled) performer of Gershwin and, on this disk, the performance of the Rhapsody in Blue in particular will knock off your proverbial socks. (Think of Carlos Kleiber's / Vienna Phil. performance of Beethoven's Fifth by way of \\"Why didn't the last 300 times I heard this sound like this?\\"). The piece is completely dependent on syncopation, and syncopation on syncopation, and Glazier nails it at every turn.

I have loved ones in heaven and as I read this book I envisioned them there in her description of what she believes is heaven. One day I will view all of this myself, and I'm sure earthly words can't describe what it will be like. I think Mrs Springer did a wonderful job describing her venture.

When it comes right down to it, it is just us and the Lord. Everything else in our lives must fit around this.The marvelous key to the book is that Jennifer has lived her life following the principles in her book. She does not trivialize or belittle marriage in the least (since writing this book, she has become a bride and a mother!), but the goal is to inspire girls to look beyond marriage as their purpose in life.Our goal in life should be to glorify God and be wholly content where He has us. Until we are happy and fulfilled as singles, serving the King of Kings, we will never be happy and fulfilled being married to our \\"Knight in Shining White Armor\\"--who, will unfortunately, have as many flaws as us.I recommend this book without hesitation, but as with all things, keep the information in balance and do with it as the Lord leads in your own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't waste your singleness","review":"A study on the first half of Proverbs 31, appling the verses to the single woman. I've heard the question, \\"How can I be a Proverbs 31 woman if I'm not married?\\" This book is an answer to that question. Jennifer Lamp gives ideas and encouragement to single women who aspire to be a Proverbs 31 woman. You probably won't agree with everything in the book, but it's still well worth reading.This book is important, because every woman is single for part of her life. A single woman who is like the one in Proverbs 31 will be a married one like the Proverbs 31 woman. The book encourages single women not to wait to get married to \\"get started on life\\", but to live an active, Godly single life, which will also help to perpare for marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-shirt was perfect","review":"I would recommend this site for their prompt service and fine quality.

I will continue to make future purchases on Amazon anyway but will be careful about purchasing used items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a disappointment","review":"The book goes into little detail about the practice, theory, or results of past life therapy. The 28 'case histories' promised are nothing of the sort - just dialogues from the various seminars Sutphen has given.The most irritating part is that some portions of the book really are intriguing - just enough to make you suspect that Sutphen really could write an exciting and valuable book on the subject.

This can be a touchy area for some adoptive children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like I was on the Ship","review":"This book covers the period from February 1798 to January 1800. We follow 1st Lt Nathaniel Drinkwater as he sells on the War brig hawthorne to the Red Sea. I have not read any other book in the series and found this enjoyable. I actually felt like I was on the ship. This is a true action book. And the author must really know his seamanship and history of the period to develop his world.

The series takes you all over, from England to Africa, the Red Sea, the Baltic and more. Also, quite historically accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Brien without the wig tugging pomposity.A great read.","review":"Readable and authentic from page one, Woodman does himself and us a favour by aiming under his obvious peer, O'Brien. This is compelling story telling without the pat-on-the back pomposity that makes O'Briens work so popular with our patrician class and so jarring for the likes of me. Woodman's fiction does its job well. It's not going to change history as we see it, but it does more than just pass the time. We quickly suspend disbelief, slip out of the here and now and settle back to enjoy the ride. It's good stuff too. Well researched and frequently thought provoking in its detail. It leaves its mark. But this stuff is meant to be read for fun. That's what I did and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If that's what you do, you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Stuff Here","review":"This is a great set Horror High, the Crater Lake Monster, Creeping Terror, Land of the Minotaur are all a lot of fun and the whole set is less than the price of any one of these campy classics individually. The prints are all complete and of a good watchable quality, I'm glad I added this to my collection even though I already had several of the movies on other sets, for me Horror High and the Crater Lake Monster alone are worth the price of admission here, and the rest is sweet retro gravy on my cheesy entrée."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cult\\" is not quite accurate","review":"It is odd to find a collection of schlock movies that does not contain at least one I have already seen or own. But it seems that somebody acquired a bunch of 60's -70's Crown International losers. I've not watched them all, but they are representative of the genre. Parents, please note that a lot of these drive-in flicks contained a fair amount of nudity (for the time) and that these should probably not be given to children. Although I am sure that 10 year old boys would be thrilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call It An Education","review":"When these movies were made, you had to go to drive-in theaters or decrepit old movie houses to see this kind of junk. If you were lucky, you were necking instead of watching the movie. These are the kind of films that promised to thrill you with extreme violence, horror and/or nudity, and almost never delivered. Nowadays, this crap goes directly to dvd, or is made for cable, like the stuff on the sci-fi channel. I think this collection serves best as a time capsule of a bygone era for those who were trying to \\"get lucky,\\" too loaded to remember, in prison, or for the very inquisitive young film lover. As is usual for a Mill Creak release, it's a very mixed bag. Some are OK and some don't really belong in the set. None are what you'd call good. Worth whatever you're sucker enough to pay and not a penny more. \\"The Teacher\\" does deserve 4 stars for the nudity of a really hot nobody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh these are baaaad","review":"There are bad movies, and there are 'bad, but watchable' movies... The majority of movies in this collection are bad. REALLY bad. Atrocious acting, bad audio, godawful direction and weak stories simply make them unbearable. I love schlocky movies, especially old cheesy sci-fi and classic horror. There's a line though. Cross the line, and you simply can't enjoy them. There's nothing to enjoy!Some of the movies in this collection appear to have been produced on nothing more than a Budget of $20 and a dare. Give me Ed Wood over this crap ANY day.There are only two 'bad, but watchable' movies in this entire set: \\"The Hearse\\" and \\"Bloodlust\\".And the title is misleading. These aren't cult hits, which it implies. These are unknown residue, movies scraped off the back floor. (Vienna sausages have a higher ranking in the sausage world!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just offal!","review":"This collection is pure rubbish.

But I am focused on my major and really do not want to spend too much time in my GE so I chose Chinese history as I am a fluent Chinese speaker who received modern Chinese history when I was young in Taiwan. However reading this book made me realize a lot of the history lessons I received as a child contains some mix of propaganda that obscured the subject. The Search for Modern China: A Documentary History included the original archival record relevant to the issues raised by Cheng et al. with some unbiased introduction. Together with the J.Spence's, The Search for Modern China, both books perfectly complemented each other. The translation of the archival record is easy to read (much easier to read than the original classic Chinese version) and is a pleasure to go through even for leisure read. I highly recommend this book together with Spence's textbook on The Search for Modern China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Informative Read","review":"A good companion to Spence's \\"The Search for Modern China.\\" All the documents are clearly introduced and all necessary background given.

The picture was crisp and clear, the colors bright. I can't comment on the quality of the sound, since the unit was hooked up to a - to put it mildly - inferior sound system.Unfortunately, the initial favorable impression didn't last too long. The player has problems with about half the DVDs we have tried. The picture is fuzzy and very dark.

Gerrold looks at the technical aspects of the Line, as well social-economic impacts of such a transportation system on those who live on and off the planet. The second book takes a similar look at Lunar colonization, including living conditions, transportation systems, self-sufficiancy, and the economy.

There is a solid explanation of vectors, bitmaps, gif, jpeg, etc.The problem is when you pick up the book and actually go to do something, there are large gaps in the basic information provided. To draw an analogy, its like finding out (in detail) how to hammer, saw, plane, sand and drill... and discovering that you still don't know how to build a bird house.The TIPS are really handy.

My suggestion is to read this one without trying to figure it out ... and boy will you be surprised ... what a shocker! Please Mr. Richards I want more.

Thank you for an enjoyable and exciting adventure into the past and the future all at once. js"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy reader","review":"This book had a weak storyline. The book contains spelling, word usage, punctuation, syntax and grammatical errors on every page. The characters were flat and unreal; the dialogue stilted and boring. Every character sounded the same. This author has a great deal to learn about presentation of a book and telling a story. I probably won't read another book written by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combat MUZIK","review":"Mobb Deep are one these duos where I could go out and buy the album without even listening to it, and know I'm going to get my money's worth. They haven't let me down yet. In a time when groups like Wu-Tang are few and far bewteen, the Infamous are in a class by themselves. This album deserves 4 1/2 stars. I've only given out two five star ratings ever: The Infamous by Mobb Deep & Forever by Wu-Tang (Ya gets none here Puffy!). It takes alot to get there and Murda Muzik was nipping at my heels. Gritty lyrics and tyte beats along with Prodigy and Havoc's QB style set them apart from the rest. It's \\" DEEP. Deepa than Atlantis\\"! A MUST FOR THE REAL HIP-HOP fanatics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best way to say farewell","review":"mobb deep, the inevators of rap music right? wrong. another terrible rap record tried to pull up out of a slump by putting popular artists on there songs like Nas & Lil' Kim. i think that mobb deep should join every other rapper who is old and done for so that we don't have to be \\"blessed\\" with this brand of music. i can't believe that anyone would put an approval on this record, unless it was the same producer that worked with cam'ron. the track with lil' kim is blazin, but only because she is in it. and not for nothing she isn't no excellent artist either. i think that mobb deep should just throw in the towel, before they go bankrupt and don't sell another copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Production...Street life","review":"This dunn style is played out with this album.

Mobb Deep!","review":"Yo, this album is hot. Word Bond! I would of gave this CD a four and a half but since there ain't no four and a half I had ta give it a five 'cause even though the CD was hot, it wasn't classic Mobb Deep. The beats are bangin' but they not as up-tempo as they usually are. But it still hot. The beats and lyrics on here are mad nice. I still don't think this album beats out \\"The Infamous\\" but I would just say it's a lil' better then \\"Hell On Earth\\" 'cause of the lyrics. \\"Spread Love\\", \\"Adrenaline\\", \\"Quiet Storm\\", and \\"It's Mine\\" are the best joints on here I think. It's a must pick up if ya a mad Hip-Hop fan. If ya don't think it's hot, ya ain't know ya real Hip-Hop like sayin', \\"DJ Quick Is Phat!\\" F That Son!

Yeah, the beats may carry the same style as all the other Mobb albums but isn't that the reason people keep koppin em'?Sometimes with all the mainstream hip-pop rap goin about you jus need something that is truly street and grimy to thug out to and this album is exactly that.Havoc doesn't fail in his producin skills as 'Where Ya Heart At' is a gem on this album and also with Alchemist producin 2 songs (Murda Muzik & The Realest) how can you go wrong.Bottom line is, great album and i dont juz giv 5 stars for nothing so if you like hardcore tru rap, kop this otherwise, cop Ja Rule's latest effort. One!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tight","review":"This was the first Mobb album i ever bought. Since then i have bought the entire collection and found that this is probably the least inspiring work of theirs. i bought all their cd's in reverse order, so when i'd heard everything of thiers, i went back and listened to this album again and found it lacked some of the underground, sorta \\"new to the game\\" feel. Of course that happens to many rap veterans, but Mobb Deep don't sound that hungry anymore, and it dissapoints me to hear the same lil dunns i heard thuggin it up on The Infamous to be sucked into this black hole of modern rap where most veterans end up these days.

This record is flawless and earned Prodigy \\"Dopest rhyme of the Year\\" in Source Magazine. What makes Mobb Deep so significant is not only their lyrics but the callabos with top notch MC's like Raekwon, Kool G Rap, Eightball, Nas and etc...Another thing about Mobb Deep is alongside Capone-N-Noreaga, they were the only east coast artists that weren't afraid to respond to Pac's \\"Hit'em Up\\". Peep \\"Drop a Gem on 'em\\" from Hell on Earth and \\"LA,LA\\" from CNN's War Report. In conclusion, this is a dope record and I believe the source should have gave them 5 mics instead of 4 1/2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mobb Deep 'Nuff Said","review":"I copped this album the minute it came out.

May be it was a smart move to tone down, since this album went Platnium on the first week, with the club banging \\"Quiet Storms\\" and with third LP on a row where Nas and Raekwon made their cameos. But with many cuts like \\"What's Ya Poison\\" and \\"Allustrious\\" shows why we fell in love with the Mobb Deep.

When I heard the Infamous I was amazed at how much potential they had. But then Juvenile Hell, Hell on Earth, and Murda Muzik a.k.a. Hell for the Listener. Potential that was once great is slowly being wasted and it is time for this duo to stop rhyming about cash ad killing, because they could issue a death threat to the President and not even the Secret Service would take notice. It's become time to stop taking the beats from their earlier albums and tinkering with them to make ones that sound like they will pass, and actually get back to work.

Even though there's no mention of things we expect in current mysteries like DNA, cell phones, or the Internet, this book still felt very much as if it could have been set now instead of over 30 years ago.It's a good solid mystery that has held up against the passage of time. For old time fans, it's fun to go back to the beginning. For new fans, it's the start of a great journey.So why only 4 stars?

Yes, she's somewhat uneven - sometimes she seems totally green, sometimes skilled, sometimes savvy, sometimes stupid. That's a bit of a bother, but if you can accommodate for that, the stories are worth going into because she feels much more like a real person.Remember that this series was begun in the late 1970s and you will see that this author really did us all a good turn by creating this series which is still worth reading 35 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"So fun to read how Sharon McCone started out!","review":"This is a great mystery, in a great setting, starring Sharon McCone - BEFORE she was a bona fide PI!

This is not it, maybe because it was an early book? The characters don't make sense, particularly sharon's relationship with a cop, who is first nasty (in a way that i would consider \\"over the top\\" for teasing) and later becomes just as inexplicably friendly. This was very jarring for the reader. I kept wondering why the beneficiary of the will, rather than the executor, was making legal decisions about the estate -- doesn't everyone know that there has to be an executor? this mistake bothered me.

Huber scanned the text of George Orwell's \\"1984\\", analyzes it, and uses it to write a sequel. The point of the sequel is not to develop the Winston Smith character, who doesn't even make an appearance. Instead, it Huber examines the telescreen device, and explores its potential to undermine the ruling Oligarchical Collectivists. The parallels between the telescreen in their world and the internet in our world are clear, but what is amazing is that Orwell's Revenge was written in 1995!

Instead, it tells you how the author published his book using on-demand publishing and how he marketed it to sell copies. Unfortunately, the writing is amateurish and most of it reads like a commercial for the book he's still trying to push. The meat of the book (5 chapters' worth) takes up only the first 30 pages; the rest is a \\"glossary\\" of odds and ends including reviews of the author's book and -- for some unexplained reason -- the results produced when he did a search for the title online.If you've already written a book and are interested in publishing and marketing it at your own expense, then this book might help you the tiniest bit.

But to actually learn for the CPA exam, I'll toss this one aside for one that provides a solutions manual. Authors who withold the manual for the instructors benefit miss a fundamental point about economics - who the customer is. It's the student that the book is written for and it is the student who pays for the course.

Right off in the first chapter, hypothetical situations are presented without any background information in the text. If you haven't had some experience in Accounting, you are going to be left scratching your head. The instructor in my class says that it causes you to think. Hard to think if you have never come close to experiencing anything that is being discussed. Some guidance would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain, straightforward, and utterly brilliant.","review":"Vallee's book is seminal.It was one of those few UFO books that will always be classic and \\"now\\" because it probes the unknown with an enlightened and interesting perspective. Having read a lot of books on the subject prior to 2000, there are few that add anything to the dialog, but this one is central to study of the paranormal. His history of similar events recorded through history shows concisely how repetitive and ancient these odd phenomena are. A must read for anyone.Personally, I think Vallee closed a LOT of minds in his time by presenting something unthinkable. Decades later he is opening minds to possibilities as people communicate more information about the phenomena. This book should be endlessly reprinted as a POD book; it is a true pity this book isn't accessible anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 with the tapes","review":"This is a book for people who wish to walk before they learn to run. You will not be bogged down with kanji, and the like, but will learn prononciation and structure of the Japanese language very quickly. It's very well structured and the easiest of five self learn books I own. Learn to speak then learn to read is my advice. The book alone only gets 4 stars as UK/USA English pronounciation differs from Japanese so, as with all language books, I strongly advise anyone considering this book, which I again state is the best I've come across, to get the tapes that go with it, I then give it 5 stars+....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I laughed so hard my gut ached when I read this book. It is a witty, extremely well-researched investigation into the monarchy, both intellectually stimuling and filled with gossip. The reviews were right. This is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monarchy, yes; truth, no","review":"I purchased this book in the hopes that I might learn more about some of the contemporary issues/public opinion surrounding the monarchy of the United Kingdom. I was horribly disappointed. Quotes taken out of context, unattributed quotes, and silly gossip form the basis for a nasty polemic. This is the kind of distortion one probably should expect from an acolyte for republicanism. It is not the kind of book, however, that anyone interested in serious discussion about the monarchy would want to waste his/her money on. It is so unbalanced a perspective, that even those few positive contributions the author feels forced to cite during his diatribe are attributed not to generosity of spirit but to psychological disorder. It is sad that this kind of royal character asassination does not still carry a penalty of some time in the Tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"Derivative and unimaginative this book adds little to the debate about the monarchy. Reading like an extended undergraduate essay, it relies too heavily on secondary material and exposes Hari to the allegation that he has only written it to advance his career in journalism.There are simply better books to read on the subject and should you feel an urge to explore Hari's opinion on the subject he has repeated it in both The Independent and The New Statesman (both articles were in fact almost verbatim copies of each other).No wonder that John Pilger referred to him as a \\"non-journalist\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Editorial","review":"This book is very well written.

This book shows why he is so acclaimed. I loved its mix of gossip, political wisdom, and intellect. I cannot imagine anybody but the most crazy monarchist disliking it (and even they would have to admit there's some great anecdotes here...)(by the way, the other commenters here on this book seem to be slightly insane. An EU coup in Britain? Uh... yeah...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Derivative and unimaginative this book adds little to the debate about the monarchy.

I work out of my house and needed to upgrade my fax and printer. I settled on a laser due to the high cost of inkjet inks. I was leaning towards the 390 with its USB support...the purchase was made,... read the install directions and set it up. Installation was a breeze. I think the interface is very intuitive. The machine prints great text pages. I clocked 12 pages / min after inital start-up. I really like the ability to be able to make copies. At 300 dpi they are not as crisp as the printer but very pleasing. Also after using an injet printer, the lack of printer head noise from the 390 is greatly appreciated. The sheet feed scanner works great for documents. I use an Epson 610 Perfection scanner when I scan photo's. Lastly the fax is a pleasure to use. A great purchase. Very happy with my decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repair Costs!!!","review":"A little over one year ago I purchased a Workcentre 390 and was pleased with the performance until, for no apparent reason, a \\"Fuser Error\\" appeared.

The liquid is just gone.As the other reviewer states, replacement vials are impossible to find!SHAME ON YOU STANLY TOOLS!You might get 2 years out of it before the vials start to dry up but that will be about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album but could be better","review":"I suppose when most fans think of Black Sabbath, they think of the years when Ozzy Osborne was lead singer; so it's only fitting that the vast majority of this set features songs from that period. In that respect, this set is great for beginners who are unaware that Black Sabbath had quite a successful career without Osborne handling vocals.For those of us (like me) who were keen to hear some of Black Sabbath's work without Osborne, however, it was a bit of a letdown because only a few post-Osborne songs are featured here.If you prefer Black Sabbath's work from the 'Osborne era', then this set is for you. It features all of the band's big songs from 1970-1978 and is well worth a look. There are all the songs you would expect to hear from that era and some you would not.This is a very good place to start for people who are just discovering the band all people who prefer the material from the Osborne era. Well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"basic","review":"This book doesn't even come close to what you need to know for the service and support exam.

STAY AWAY! buy the poplite popper instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap","review":"This popcorn popper blows about 50% of all the corn into the bowl unpopped. It also blows hot kernels around the counter top. I am going to need to spend twice as much on popcorn kernels to get the same amount of popped corn that a product of actual quality would make.Do NOT buy this product, Toastmaster makes junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even as good as the other reviewers have said","review":"I have the Toastmaster TPC3 Hot Air Popcorn Popper, which appears to be identical to the TMPC4 that is discussed here. I primed my popper with 350 kernels (1/3 cup) of popcorn and ran it until it cleared. When I sorted through the resulting bowl of popcorn, I counted 228 un-popped kernels. That's a 65% failure rate. Just to validate the experiment, I put the 228 un-popped kernels into a microwave popping bowl, and (even though some of them had been half-cooked previously) all but 33 of them popped on the second try. The obvious design flaw of this contrivance is that each popping kernel propels about two other un-popped kernels out of the chute. The Toastmaster Hot Air Popper is essentially worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing popcorn popper!!!","review":"Good news first, this little popper is easy to store because of it's small size. The bad news is that it shoots out alot of unpopped kernals, and it also shoots out the popcorn all over the place outside of the bowl (yes, I've tried tall containers to catch the popcorn)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad negative stars is not an option","review":"If you are looking for an appliance that will entertain your entire family, this is the appliance for you.If you are looking for a popcorn popper - This is not the appliance you are looking for. I'm not even sure it can be called a popcorn popper. It pops about half the kernals, however, it does put on a magnificant display of flying popcorn and burning hot kernals (don't try to catch them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Dave Duncan is truely an excellent writer, in the novel The Gilded Chain he demostrated his mastery of his craft. However, I was rather disappointed with this book. He was writing beautifully up until the end when he seemed to cut the story short. It sadden me, to see such a sudden end that was not as rich as the first half of the novel. Which, is why I can only rate this novel with 2 stars, since the ending just killed the story for me. A tale needs to keep the same pace throughout, and this just didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novelette","review":"This was more of a novelette in length. But it was a rip-roaring read. I couldn't put it down. A straightforward plot. The ending was a bit of a letdown and the sense of urgency created in the first chapters diminished as the book unfolded. Nevertheless, it's worth taking a look at. I look forward to the next installment of the King's Daggers."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"These photo envelopes work great. They are super rigid and really protect your photos.

I recommend it. It's short and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Mystical, Magical Anna Riva","review":"Ann has done it once again. Her small but informidable books are always full of information. I found the Modern Herbal Spellbook to be enlightening as well as easy to understand.

If you are looking for some new and different spells and desire to create a little magick of your own I reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"A well organized, well written book. I have been a nurse for 17 years and whenever I ever hear of a healthcare worker murdering those who depend on them so heavily, it just blows my mind! It just defies everything you were taught or learned.HOPEFULLY, the medical establishment has learned something from stories like this, and have ways to police it more QUICKLY than they did Shipman's case."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the unthinkable!","review":"The only reason that I am giving 4 stars is because the author did not list all the victims of Dr. SHipman's unsuspected reign of terror in Lancashire. In his long career, he probably killed at least 200 victims--men, women, children, for no apparent reason until he was stopped by the law. Sadly, I cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see Israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in Lancashire. Dr. Shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all. The book is an easy read unless you're trying to find out the victims and give them a proper memorial. This book is for those victims and their families! Maybe we can learn from what happened in Lancashire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sleepers' Less An Object Cd","review":"This is absolutely THE best cd that I have heard in a very long time. The Sleepers' music is dark, powerful and, at times, disturbing. The vocals of Ricky Williams are highly unique,intense and personal. As well, the guitar style is jagged and dissonant with psychedelic overtones. If you like Second Edition era Public Image or Joy Division than this is the band for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classis '70 punk from San Francisco","review":"Perhaps one of the best band of the first punk era of San Francisco.The CD includes all their first works.The first single was a good punk in the same level of Nuns and Avengers.The rest is new wave and it is less interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke quickly","review":"My son was ecstatic to receive this Iceman, but within a week it fell apart completely! Total bummer. Super glue not helping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the Boss!","review":"A true classic.A great selection of songs, unified in approach but full of subtle variations as one would expect from such a stellar cast of musicians in the small/medium backing band, including Pete Johnson on piano and five significant Basie/Ellington alumni. Whether slow or rocking, every tune is the product of masters of the Kansas City blues at the peak of their form. Walter Page's bass sound is unmistakeable to lovers of the Basie band (Freddie Green is here too). A triumphant return to the roots at a time when Turner was enjoying success with his excellent R&B/Rock&Roll recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb Music-Dreadful \\"Stereo\\" Remix","review":"As wonderful as it is that this classic continues to receive attention, the stereo remix on this disc is just terrible. The high end-particularly the cymbals-swims around and hopelessly clouds the entire image.I'm guessing that the remix project was a labor of love, so I'm sorry to conclude that it was misguided and very poorly executed. Listeners would do far better to head for Collectibles' [Atlantic/Rhino-licensed] 2002 edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kansas City through Fifties eyes","review":"Joe Turner's magnificent voice stars in this session, with some fine backing from his Thirties partner Pete Johnson and other great musicians, including some of the young stars of the mid-fifties. Perhaps the arrangements are a little restrictive but Joe Turner was at his peak and the horn players deliver distinctive solos. I particularly like Jimmy Nottingham's trumpet introduction to I Want a Little Girl and Pete Brown's rolling piano introduction to Cherry Red, that's real mood music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The fotos are nice...","review":"I am a slobbering Rush fan but the writing in this book is just so...well...awful that I couldn't get past the first 25 pages or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Contents Under Pressure\\" could have used more \\"Content\\"","review":"I, too, have been waiting a long for a book about Rush. After all, they have been a very private collection of talented musicians. Perhaps this secretive position has helped fuel the production of this book.I was expecting to find more rare photos and deeper insights into the lives of one of the world's greatest bands. Instead, I found it repetitive. Not only where some of the sections repeated within the book, the contents were no different than what you could find on the web. Nearly every photo in the book was taken from some other publication, album liner or tour book. There was really nothing new.Overall, I found this book to be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING NEW HERE!","review":"Nope. No amazing revelations. No juicy gossip. No dissing and hissing. What you get is the story (that everyone already knows) about three hard-working musicians from Toronto who made it big on the arena rock circuit. Loved by millions, and still in the business after 30 years, these guys are friends who love touring and playing their music for their fans. End of story. I guess that is the problem with Rush: they didn't get into the biz for the fame, money, and excess. Got in it for the career...boring. These guys are really accomplished musicians, but you are not going to find any of the wild tales that made the Stones, the Who, or Led Zeppelin legends. Treating being in a rock band on the same level as, say, running a law firm does take all the fun out of it. So, pass this one by, unless you want to hear about that story again about these hard-working musicians from Toronto who made it big..."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not recieve item","review":"you better not have re charged me for this item that was cedited back for non delivery!! never recieved!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush love-fest, very little meat here","review":"Look for the quotes, the rest is garbage. Rush fans know what the albums are like, we don't need the over-dramatic descriptions of them. The pictures and quotes are worthy. The contributions by the author are worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I've been a Rush fan for a long time, this book was a nice look back at all of their recordings and past tours. I enjoyed reading from the band's point of view. It was interesting to know what the writing process was, as well as what it was like on tour throughout the years. I respect what they have accomplished as artists, and musicians. They will continue to be a favorite of mine forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I love this book!It also contains some fantastic pictures.If you are a Rush fan, this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just can't get enough","review":"What else is there to say. When you are a true fan of an awesome, talented, 3-man group such as Rush, you can't get enough material to read. Always interesting, always a pleasure to read about someone that you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Agree","review":"This is just one of the books about Rush that should've been written long ago. Another that needs to come to fruition is an exhaustive biography detailing every minute detail of the bands 30+ year career. This book is more of a album by album, tour by tour account, which is fine and quite fun. The interviews are all recent and it's fun to read the boys think back to the feelings and thoughts that come with each particular record. Rush fans keep tabs on all the albums and the differences/production/covers of each one. This book knows that and gives quite a treat. if you are a fan you'll read this in one sitting...I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"I will buy and read just about any book about Rush. On the positive side, the interviews with the band are recent and (if accurately) uniquely honest. Some interviews capture less-than-positive thoughts about certain individuals--such as the producer who blew them off for Simple Minds arouhd the time of the Signals album.On the negative side, many of the pictures are not new and Popoff at times needlessly uses less-than-clear language to get his point across.Still, I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious & Stock","review":"All of the negative reviews you have read here are true. As a 26 year Rush fan, I was dying to get this, and then was grateful I bought it with a gift card. I've read numerous Popoff interviews over the years, and I expected much more.

Back then, my hair was bleached as light as I could get it. Nowadays, my poor hair cannot handle such high doses of peroxide, so I went natural light brown over my new dark growth. After about a week, the brown faded and I figured it needed a golden refresher, so I used the rest of my Electric Banana over the brown and now it looks bright golden. This product doesn't stain too badly since it's light, and it is very long-lasting. Cheaper than Special Effects brand, too. If you're a fan of yellow, I would recommend it! Bleaching your hair as light as you can get it first will ensure the yellow stands out its truest, then apply. Keep in mind bleached hair that is TOO processed will not hold color as well. This product doesn't contain peroxide or ammonia (lightening agents) and does not damage hair.

While it had been the best book we had read so far, the story itself was missing many key ingredients. I think more discription would be neccessary. Vivdly describing Boston, Agawam, and the Indian settlement would have made the novel more interesting. A good example is John Steinbeck's The Peal. The lush descriptions form pictures in your mind.

Put me in the latter category. I'll grant that the story line was fairly interesting -- who doesn't love a story of revenge? But the writing was hackneyed (...) and the dialog embarrassingly awkward, particularly the rapist's internal dialog as he awaited his victim (\\"Yum yum\\" as I recall). In the hands of Scott Turow or Dennis Lehane this would have been a much more satisfying novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refried fava beans","review":"When I heard the hype about this book I was suspicious and borrowed it from a friend rather than plunk down good money. Wise move. This has got to be one of the worst debuts I've ever seen and I read a couple mysteries a month. Cardboard characters? Try Saran Wrap. Lazy plotting? This woman's main cultural reference seems to be teen slasher flicks. It takes a really talented writer to make a serial killer story fresh, and this one is as stale as old fava beans. (a clown mask? puleeze!) And the ending is so dumb I laughed out loud. A part of me feels sorry for the author because I don't see how she's ever gonna live up to the big bucks and hype over this book. She had a \\"good\\" concept (ie Hollywood book) here at least.

While Hoffman and Turow share a background in the legal system, the key difference is that Turow is a superb writer. Hoffman, sadly, should have kept her day job: she can't write at all. Her characters are one-dimensional at best (and that dimension is uniformly unpleasant). Her pace is plodding, and there are so many upscale brand names studding the pages that she apparently has mistaken them for adjectives and nouns. (No one answers a cell phone in this book; they \\"pick up the Nextel.\\") The touted plot twists are telegraphed from the get-go. The protagonists' blatant racism and homophobia, and the gratuitous sadism of the crimes, only add to the bad taste this book leaves behind.

They were priced right. Upon receiving the dice, I noticed that some of the white dots (Known as PIPs) were smeared or off center. The plastic cubes also had indentations, or sink holes on a side probably from the injection process. What these dice looked like overall was that they were factory 2nds bought from the manufacturer at a dirt cheap price (no doubt from China) and used for re-sale to people like me. They are okay for little kids, but definately low quality. It was not worth it to pay to ship them back, so I bit the bullet and now sort through the bunch looking for good sets of 2.

No. The return policy was great, but it wasn't worth paying the freight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my Purpose!","review":"The dice are exactly what you would expect for the price. I use them to construct 3X3X3 block puzzles and Soma Cubes. It is easy to glue them together using just plain acetone.

Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seconds Out..the Genesis VIDEO concert","review":"Back in the mid 80's, USA Network broadcast the rare video of this memorial 1977 concert of this Genesis tour of \\"Seconds Out\\". This was the first time that I saw this concert and the following year, I managed to grab a video copy from the repeat broadcast.Then, finding this album (vinyl version) in the stores not too soon afterwards. Yes, I played that one out pretty well until a CD set arrived to enjoy this concert...along with the rare video copy that I have..I fully agree: this is when Genesis was at it's peak - definitely an \\"ART ROCK GROUP\\". Afterwards, Genesis and the eventall solo career of Phil Collins just wasn't the same as with these earlier recordings of Genesis. Like radio stations changing formats..just not the same anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live CD Ever","review":"Seconds Out has it all...great songs and great sound.

This is the best live CD I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful music...","review":"From the mind-blowing sounds of Steve Hackett's guitar on Dance on a Volcano and Robbery, Assualt and Battery to the frightneing accuracy of Tony Bank's synth, this album has to be, in my opinion, Genesis' finest. And just to ensure that no other of their albums comes even close, they throw in the 23 minute Supper's Ready to polish things off.I have to say that i was certainly surprised to find that Phil Collins performed the keyboard solos in both Robbery, Assualt and Battery and The Cinema Show, which are both astounding songs in their own right, their beauty accentuated here.I may be only 16 years old, but i appreciate their music tremendously - especially from the post-Gabriel period onward to the departure of Hackett. This album encapsulates everything great about Genesis on a double CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I had this disk in vinyl, and finally I have decided to have it in CD.Amazing, the sound and the presentation.If you are a Genesis' fan, and specially about the Peter Gabriel's period in Genesis, you should have it.

I am sure it was as fantastic as the two shows i saw.The only down point i could possably give this CD is that it doesn't have Phil's talking between the songs. That is part of the show they cut out and it is missed. Phil is an excelent stage pressence and it should have been put in.While hil is out front singing (in the recetly gone Peter Gabrial's place) Chester Thompson ( and on one track Bill Bruford from YES) play the drumsthis tour did have Steve Hacket on guitars and shortly after he went missing for a solo career.Mike Ruthaford and Tony Banks are there too"},{"rating":"2","title":"You must be joking........","review":"This baby deserves five stars just for the ending of \\"Supper's Ready\\" alone. It may just be the best finish to any song I have ever heard, except for some to be found in classical music. But there is so so much more that is great on this album. It is the ultimate long road trip in a fast car album. And the girls love it too.This is amazingly profound music, even if some of the lyrics may be a little whimsical at times. This is some of the most amazing live work I've ever heard, and the songs are almost all fantastic and I personally feel far better versions than the studio versions, though I can definitely appreciate anyone loving the studio work more.Great stuff. Enjoy!Over and out.(The Professor recommends: \\"The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys\\" by Traffic; another perfect long road trip in a fast car song.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definetion of a Live Album","review":"Genesis has been around since a really long time but seen most of its best times in the 70s.... there have also been great changes in the group.... the biggest change being Peter leaving and Phil filling his shoes. This album contains most of Gabriel times songs ... of each which is a classic..(Including the great progressive piece Supers Ready ) all which are sung by Phil Collins who has done a lovely job of it too.. , the album also contains songs from Phil's First Genesis album as lead singer 'Trick of a Tail'The main contents that a live album must have are good songs ... the songs should also sound a little different from the studio versions and last but still really important , the recording quality should be good ...Seconds out has all 3 of these qualities .. which makes in One of the best live performances in progressive rock history... A must buy even if you owe all these songs on studio albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered Edition ? quite disapointing sound","review":"I wanted to purchase this album for enjoying Genesis while driving (having the good old LP's) but as for other Genesis so-called \\"definitive remastered edition\\" I am very disapointed with the \\"flatening\\" effect of the end result : all guitars from Steve Hackett that are usually so crystal-clear and play like watermarks over Tony Banks keyboards are \\"drowned\\" into a melting pot and even the famous drums solo duo looks like an anemic copy of the first recording.Too bad as well that the CD cover inlay does not include more infos, or a small booklet to give more infos for the \\"definitive edition\\" : in fact there are less than the original album (some pictures have been thrown away)My advise : this album is great, but aim for the non final mix edition or better catch the LP's if you can"},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing excellence","review":"\\"Seconds Out\\" is an achievement without parallel: in this reviewer's opinion, it's the best live album ever, the best Genesis album, and one of the three best progressive rock albums of all time.From start to finish, this album is astonishing in its excellence. Tracks like \\"Squonk\\" and \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" have immense sonic power; \\"Cinema Show\\" and \\"The Carpet Crawl\\" offer the delicacy of angels. And all of this is captured in a recording of incredible clarity, warmth, and dynamic range.Perhaps most amazing of all, the band takes songs from the Peter Gabriel-era and, with Phil Collins singing, actually improves on them with better production and engineering. Truly a pinnacle of modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have one Genesis disc, it is this set!","review":"I first heard this two-album set -- yes, I said ALBUM -- back in 1978, and was utterly blown away by it then.

Its tied with Three Sides Live as the second worst Live Genesis album. The absence of pictures of Peter Gabriel in fancy costumes and his stories is understandable but Collins sings the songs that he made famous very poorly and they are better suited for early Genesis live especially Suppers Ready (better both on the Gabriel archives and Foxtrot). On top of this only the mundane sacherine commercial ballad Afterglow is featured from Wind and Wuthering and not quality material which would have been good live like Eleventh Earl Of Mar and Wot Gorrila. Even worse though Steve Hackett plays very little on the album (possibly another reason he left the band) when it should have been a perfect conclusion to his career with the group. This is not an album thats worth collecting for any Genesis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karl Jenkins Requiem","review":"An inspirational album that combines Eastern and Western forms of music.

I just can't agree with the previous reviews. This is the worst AT book (by far) I've read.I've probably read about 6 of them.Anyway, it takes a lot of gall to write a book about hiking the AT when you haven't hiked the whole thing.That's right. He doesn't finish. An AT memoir without the triumphal summit, no victory dance or witty last register entry. He just sort of stops.But really, that's not such a shame. Lots of people don't finish (see Bryson), and a well written book of a shorter journey would be welcome. This isn't it.Very poorly written, hackneyed, trite accounts of his inner battle to continue, and flowery ramblings concerning his spirituality made me squirm in my chair.It was so bad it made me angry and I actually threw the book in the trash.Of course, that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Appalachian Trail, A Journey of Discovery","review":"A very good description of the sights and scenery along the AT and the personal and emotional impacts of the psychological highs and lows of a long distance hike.

I do have to admit that it can be slow paced at times, it is certainly no \\"Walk in the woods\\". But few books give the kind of insight into the hikers mind and emotions with such honesty and clarity. if your looking for a 'cannot put it down' adventure story, this is not it. If, on the other hand, you are looking to get into the mind and journal of someone who walked the AT (see \\"onward to Katahdin\\" for the second half), it is a worthwhile purchase.There is an aspect to the book that others may find anoying, that is that he does go into some depth on the spiritual enlightenment he gains while hiking the AT. I, personally, would expect no less from someone journaling their journey on a thru-hike. Make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Journey to Male Menopause","review":"This is a poorly written book with minimal content concerning the trail or hiking in general.

A retired army colonel, used to having his own way at all times tries to hike the AT and doesn't handle it very well. Much of the book is taken up with his mental ramblings in search of enlightenment, which he doesn't achieve by the time he quits at the Maryland border. It astounded me that a person could reach the age of retirement and have so little insight and maturity. There is bad poetry at the end of each chapter and a lot of whining about people who pissed him off. A bad read that made me feel embarassed for Curran. If that's what he has inside it's better hidden.

Great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a hard act to follow","review":"A 1969 classic! Perhaps, Roberta's best album. The tempo doesn't change much throughout the album, but enough variations in song formats, tokeep the album interesting, as well as beautiful. Roberta actually sounds, close to, angry on a couple of tracks. \\"Compared To What\\" and \\"Trying Times\\" are social observations still relevant today.\\"Angelitos Negros\\" is sang in Spanish. A beautiful version of Leonard Cohen's \\"..No Way To Say Goodbye\\". plus one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded, ( \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" ) make this album timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Quality!","review":"What a disappointment! I had this album years ago, and absolutely loved it. Was excited to find it offered on CD through Amazon by the seller NAGIRY, and was eager to hear it again--assuming that the sound quality would at LEAST be as good as my LP had been.

There just isn't even a sub par song on the entire album. I'd say maybe one in 100 albums can say that. My personal favorites are I told Jesus, Our ages or our hearts, Ballad of Sad Young Men, and the timeless First Time ever I saw your face.On most cuts it's just Miss Flack, a piano, and some very understated accompaniests.

My favorite songs are \\"What a God\\" and \\"I Am Living a Life of Love,\\" but \\"We Will Be Changed\\" and \\"His Name is John\\" are great upbeat songs in typical Perry's style. A few of the songs don't use as traditional instrumentation as is usual for the Perrys, which can be a little distracting, but overall I haven't found it to detract from my enjoyment of the music. The last song, \\"David and Goliath,\\" is really not done justice by the Amazon clip. It is actually one of my least favorite songs on the CD, but that is just the introductory music and the song itself is more in the style of \\"City Not Made With Hands.\\" If you are a Perrys fan or just like traditional mixed quartet Southern Gospel, I would highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accel Coil","review":"Fit fine, worked as well as the stock coil for nearly 7 months.

When the coach takes his young protege to his private mountain cabin he makes a failed attempt to seduce him. as a result their bond of trust is broken. They each go their separate ways. Then for some illogical reason the film has the boxer begging the molester to take him back, at the risk of losing a million dollar contract from a Cable network.

My husband and I make waffles at home on our waffle maker every week and know how to make a good waffle, but this iron doesn't perform."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"After many years and uses, my wonderful old PS belgian waffle iron died. So, what do I do? Buy another PS belgian waffle maker, right? Wrong. This is the worst waffle iron I have ever owned. It has hot and cold spots, so when the part of the waffle is crisp and done, the other part is not. And, do they really consider this a belgian waffle? This item is getting returned. Don't waste your time, money and batter on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"If you are going to be in London for 4 days or less and want to see the sights, this book is not for you. Focusing mainly on bars, restaurant, and shops, this book would be more useful for someone staying there for a while who had copious time to hang out and browse everywhere. The section on tourist places was short and not very informative, though the day/night map in the back saved the book from being a total loss.For a trip to London, I'd recommend getting the AAA Spiral Guide for a small city travel guide, buying a city map, and downloading Vindigo London on your Palm(tm) to get the restaurant, bar, and shop info. It worked well for my second trip out to London, especially Vindigo, which could recommend the nearest good restaurants to exactly where I was standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"G-ZUS!","review":"Are *ALL* These Nina DVD's almost identical copies???!!I liked the cover... looks very nice although it appears photoshopped... Cannot honestly find much more to be enjoyed or learned from this 2 hour session of nauseating intercourse between a 50-55 year old Nina Hartley and some much younger plain jane woman thabkfully without deep wrinkles, engaging in a highly unappealing lesbian encounter. The rest, is mainly yadda-yadda-yadda, with more talk still, and a session with a much younger man that does'nt teach anything that you don't already know from common sense, with a few clinical details about clitoral and birth canal sensitivity, and that is really pretty much it. Nothing you could'nt find good info about on the net for FREE. So if you like Nina Hartley, here's your opportunity for 2 grueling hours of a very boring lecture... truly mostly all talk, and highly unattractive and obviously unpleasant \\"routine sex\\" demonstration, then this is *definitely* for you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book describes how dolphins might see the world.","review":"I am a 3rd grader and I liked the book, Venus among the Fishes, very much because itis dramatic and action-filled.

The size was just right and the outer band smoothly spins around the fixed band. As in the image, the outer band is silver and the underlying band is a dark background bringing out the pattern, however, in the image, the outer band of knots appears to be raised, whereas the one I received is flat. Also, my ring looks much more like a series of figure 8's ,overlapping in places, rather than actual knots with the over-under as appears in the image. Where the design begins and ends there is an obvious seam.That said, I wanted this as something I could wear to Ren Faire and the crude design lends itself to that rather than something overly fancy.

Last century it was John Denver & the Muppets Christmas album. After 36 years was the exhumation of this artifact really necessary?At it's best Miss M. proves that she could sing (occasionally). At it's worst it is shrill, crude, vulgar and musically annoying. Much awaited, much ballyhooed by other reviews, but ultimately a piece of nostalgic junk.I lived in Cleveland once upon a time, if you could call that living. (RIM SHOT and BASS THUMP) It was a dump then and it's a dump now. It's a lot like Buffalo. Buffalo is best described as Cleveland without the frills.Now in her late 60s, today's Bette is still selling out Las Vegas lounges at an astronomical ticket price. If you have the cash to blow, by all means be my guest. If I wanted to ride sometihng old and held together with duct tape I go into my garage and push my 61 Corvair around the block. I wouldn't toss Bette a dime for cabfare if she was \\"working 42nd street\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The first time I heard this album I couldnt stop laughing - Bette is so funy and obviously she is enjoying performing.One of the most fascinating things about this live album is that its shows how hillarious and touchingly sentimental Bette could be - often in one song after another.She is really great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC BETTE -- SENSATIONAL","review":"Bette's best, most energetic and funniest live CD. Her voice is in topic shape, the personality is incredible. It's worth the price just for the opening and the finale's \\"tribute to the bi-centennial.\\" Plus, Vicky Edie is hysterical and the famous \\"Sophie Tucker jokes\\" are ones she would probably be embarrased to tell today.

The television registration of this show created a furore and a cult following as far away as The Netherlands. A superb opening which begins in a hospital bed is followed by great songs such as My dreams of Dr. Long John, Around the World in Eighty Ways, by great Sophie Tucker jokes concerning her boyfriend Ernie, and a very direct and spontaneous contact with the audience about her hotel arrangements for that night. Experiencing Bette live on this album is appreciating her incredible dynamism and tireless energy from up close. Glad it is back on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit is too loud","review":"I planned on using the Tripp Lite UPS unit for Home Theatre cabinet, but when I got it, the fan on it was too loud.

I googled her just to see if anyone else thought she sucked (they did), and though there was barely any info online about her, what there WAS was shocking. She's actually acted in other films!! How?! The male main character is no Robert Deniro himself but he gives an Oscar worthy performance in comparison to his female counterpart's. I really think she should be forced legally to give anyone who paid to watch this their money back, plus twenty bucks. She plays a struggling actress who can't get cast in anything, which I wish were only true. The girl playing the psychic is totally overdramatic and just as awful so no saving grace there. Decent storyline though- why I needed to see them walk around a ghost town for twenty minutes, pretending to be stuck in a jail, I don't know, however. The director is awful in all ways visible, including his acting.

However I just didn't get this, the set up was there, the acting was well, acceptable, but the camera work and directing was terrible, at times it felt like it wanted to be a hand held camera film, then it would move to a mounted camera and your standard acting fair. The premise was well thought out but such a terrible execution, no horror at all, no goosebumps, just a mild chuckle that I had wasted just over an hour and 30 minutes for possibly the worst ending to a horror, made even worse by the poorly buried head that any half decent Sheriff would have found!However is giving the move 5 Stars and saying it's really scary have clearly never seen another horror film, or are in fact friends and family of the director!Don't buy, don't watch, just ignore all the mock hype, nothing new here, nothing special and for sure nothing scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want the last 1.5hrs of my life back!!","review":"Wow!

Although its cheap, you get what you pay for. This chain can bust into pieces pretty easily. I had this on my trek 930 for about a week. While riding though my neighborhood I changed gears. One of the chain links busted open and jammed in my drivetrain, gouging out chunks of paint. I'd expect this to happen maybe while mountain biking a real trail, but on a paved road?! That has to be a really substandard chain for that to happen. I suggest you avoid buying bike parts anywhere that is not a bike shop.

The quality is very good (and that is considering I'm watching them on a 50 inch screen and these were made over half a century ago). If you like Charlie Chan, pick up this set. With 7 movies, it comes up to less than $6 per movie, less than half what it costs to buy one individual movie. Each movie lasts just over an hour.

Reading this book, I became convinced that the author's real focus was himself--to demonstrate how learned he is, how clever he is. Further, his compulsion to belittle others (Jack Newfield, Franklin Roosevelt, many others) is too frequent and, at times, too intense to ignore. Finally, he does not make a good case for his premise: that Robert Kennedy was not who we thought he was and that only the author has been smart enough to discern Mr. Kennedy's real self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price!","review":"I bought this bag several months ago anticipating a Eurotrip. I was only in Europe for about two weeks, but this bag definitely did the trick. I'm a girl, and usually pack more than I need, but I found this bag to be quite roomy, and I was able to fit about two weeks worth of clothes in it. My only complaint is that it doesn't have double zippers in order to use a small lock to guard personal items (passport, money, etc.). Other than that, this bag is very nice for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Value for the cost","review":"You cannot go wrong for the price. The plastic clips are not the best and I did have two break on me during my trip to hike in Thailand."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Although the pack looks great at first, after actually using it on vacation, I would definitely recommend paying the extra $25-50 and getting a good durable pack from a known brand.The clips that hold the lid down are made of obviously low-quality thin plastic that simply aren't going to hold up to any remotely demanding use.I used this pack once, taking it on a 2 week trip in Europe, and by the time I got back 2 out of the 3 connectors on the front of it were broken to the point that they're no longer functional. Since the lid doesn't snap down all the way anymore, the bag is no longer worth using and I already had to replace it.I've had a smaller Vaude bag for about 10 years that's been on many vacations (as a checked bag a few times) and camping trips, and its still going strong with absolutely no problems. This Harvest bag was horrible.I would have given it one star, however I did make it back from Europe with everything still inside of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bears revisited","review":"This book is a reissue of one published in the 70's. My three kids loved it then & now. We only have the one orginial copy, so it was a joy to be able to purchase for all. Anyone who reads this will get caught up in the bears' adventures. Wonderful story! The only downside was the size. The orginal large golden book was much bigger & therefore more fun. I would be gald to pay more for a larger copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book appeals to children","review":"We've had this book since my daughters, in their thirties, were little. I never liked it that much but my girls always enjoyed it. One of them tells me that she loved it back then. My two grandsons are now requesting it and obviously also find a special appeal in the story of the bear parents and their eleven girl cubs and one boy cub, little Theodore. The stories, one set in summer and one in winter, are simple tales of family fun. All the girl cubs live in their own hollow tree, each with a different decorative theme, and that probably appeals to a child's sense of wanting their own independent and unique environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Time Favorite","review":"I read this book to my daughter about 25 years ago and it was one of her favorites. Each of the bears has his/her own personality and they are all charming. Remembering the names of the fourteen bears was an evening challenge.

From the time my mother first read to me, this was my very favorite. She says she read it at least once a day to me. For years it was difficult to find and copies were going for hundreds of dollars online. Then a few years back they reissued it and I was lucky enough to get a copy. I now have a 2 year old daughter who loves it as much as I do. We read it every night before bed. It is the absolutely cutest little bear book I have ever seen. If you have a child who loves bears, or even the outdoors and being in nature, this is the book for you.I would love to see Amazon go back to carrying this for the holiday season.

The book is large and the pictures are excellent colour.The reprint is very disappointing.

It was so well written and so unpredictable that I had to stay up all night to finish it. This book has many things going for it, such as a substantial story line, interesting and thoroughly explored characters, and a surprise ending. I also liked how long this book was, usually these types of books are only a few hundred pages in large print. Definitely get this book, you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressive technically- artistically trash","review":"I love many Russian films, but not this one. Trash in the guise of art. It is technically remarkable, being filmed in one shot. The message, however, is conceited and extremely nationalistic. There are people of culture in every country, and they are united by their sense of culture. This film implies that Russians are more cultured than everyone else, and in doing so destroys a fascinating premise and denegrates the \\"art\\". Could have been great, but came off as banal. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film is in Russian... with subtitles","review":"If the fact that the film is in Russian was advertised in the description, I must have somehow missed it. While I don't particularly object to subtitled films, this was a gift for someone who doesn't appreciate them, and given the fact that so much of this film is about the visuals, and the accompanying narratives, having to read subtitles while your trying to appreciate the art and the building the art is housed in is nearly impossible...My criticism here is not about the film... it is what it is... Rather it's about Amazon needing to do a better job of drawing attention to the fact that some of the films it sells are in a foreign language and to give people the information necessary to make an informed purchase. This was not an inexpensive item, so finding out after the fact that the film was subtitled was problematic, particularly since the purchase was a gift for someone else...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some parts work others do not","review":"The positive reviews of this DVD motivated my ordering it. I was not able to see this DVD completely only some fragments. The image was not stable and some times stopped completely.

It has no story, no interesting characters, nothing to keep your attention. I saw it at the cinema upon its initial release and I was bored stiff. It has approximately zero redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all in foreign!","review":"The makers of this ludicrous film expect me, having paid a good 15 pounds to either a) learn Russian or b) read what they are saying - no thanks I'll buy a book if I want to read! Not only that, I have no idea what the film is about or what was going on. They were wandering around a gallery or something. Hardly Godzilla! Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"Russian Ark is a stunningly beautiful movie that has to be seen to be believed. The technical accomplishments of the photography are genius, but can't compare to the perfection that is the Hermitage. The music, the art, the people; Sokurov's portrait of Russian culture and history is breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"Probably one of the best overviews of Russian History in the time of the maximum decadence in Tsarist Russia. The great thing is the wonderful tour of the Hermitage. I recently toured the Hermitage in one day and I strongly recommend that anyone going to St. Petersburg see this movie before going."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's not HD, don't bother...","review":"I first saw \\"Russian Arc\\" on HDNet movies on my Sony monitor, and was spellbound. An amazing feat of cinamatography. I had to own it. But I mistakenly did not check to insure the DVD I was buying was in HD. Watching this movie in anything but HD is not worth your time. The incredibly intricate detail of the costumes, the fantasticly clear works of art in the background, all gone. And camera pans are blurred compared to the HD version. Almost my entire enjoyment of this movie was due to the amazing HD. Without it, this DVD will sit on my shelf, never to be watched again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Fell Asleep In the Russian Ark","review":"I have no doubt that through many viewers' eyes, this is a masterpiece. However, this film perturbed and bored me. I forced myself to watch this for 40 minutes (without interruption)and then gave up. There just seemed to be alot of confused and straggling groups of costumed actors wandering around through darkened tunnels and corridors, and an overvoiced character off camera asking where he was. Well, I certainly didn't know - and my metaphor-o-meter was broken for this film. Just not my cup of Russian tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie?","review":"These Ark is good! My English is not so good but I try. Oui? And am practicing because maybe Bush he invade France after Iraq? Non? Oui? I mean yes? At any rate this Ark is good cinema, non? Because without Mister Noah and the boy giraffe and the girl giraffe and getting on the big boat with Adam and Eve and all the monkeys maybe we would not be here? Oui? Non? Yes? So thank you Mister Russian man! Thank you for showing us this nice ark movie and I most liked of all the storms and the boat rocking and the lightening and the thunder of it all.Merci beau coups and we like to make Russian man honorary French! And please oh so please vote me helpful because I learn to good English speak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a time and place for this movie, this wasn't it.","review":"I'm usually far more fair and descriptive when writing a review of a film, but I took 3 honest tries at this one and the best words I can describe it are an artsy, plotless Russian sleeping pill. Certainly the attempt at doing an entire film in one shot is admirable and presenting Russian art and history are worthy, but the guides through this stunt are absolutely coma inducing. Their voices are beyond subdued and unenthusiastic, oft-times the interaction between them and others appearing in new scenes disjointed and full of non-sequiturs. To be fair to the reader of this review, if you are prepared for this type of effect and presentation, you may come away with more than I was able to, but I certainly recommend a healthy dose of caffeine, an early evening viewing and preparation for art for art's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible transfer do not buy!!!!!","review":"This is the first review I have bothered to write and have bought hundreds of products of amazon.com. I didn't listen to other reviews about the blurry quality and found out the hard way that this is $12 for a reason. I wouldn't be surprised to learn it was pirated. In fact, there was some \\"Canada only\\" stickers on the package. The disc also stalls out on a famously contiguous 90 minute no-cut first-of-a-kind film. Garbage. Especially if you have not yet seen this film, do not watch this version as you will be cheated out of a fantastic cinematic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook style movie. Yawn!","review":"I tried to like this movie, but it was so boring. I don't even think more than a few high-school students, looking for a diversion from the usual classroom materials would find this one interesting. One problem is that the \\"guide\\" is so obnoxious you want to leave him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no thank you","review":"This is one of the most boring and pointless films I have ever seen. It's just a couple of guys having a pissing contest about whether russians or europeans are better at this, that and the other. Apparently it's a technical marvel and other filmmakers find it marvelous yada yada blah blah, but the marvels of making a single-shot film don't substitute for a plot and characters of interest and substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"The copywriter must have watched a different movie than I did. Not only was this movie completely plot-less, but it failed to spark the interest of the period that I was looking for. It was poorly put together. Despite grandiose costumes and settings, it failed to meet my expectations"},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof Of the Value Of Editing","review":"The DVD needs an English naration option. Trying to ignore Russian, while reading subtitles, and while trying to see the actual content of the film images is impossible. Add in a slow story (I think the slow pace made it easier to get a 96 minute continuous shot), and this is hard to tolerate. Some of this did remind me of Monty Python, a sort of movie as farce, but such was not the intent of this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice for film students.","review":"There is always some snob people who feel they have to say experiments are art, just to stay \\"avant-garde\\". A shame.Guys, this is just a nice film experiment. 15 minutes of it would be ok to enjoy, no more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"I was truly dissappointed with this film. Its crap, there is no real story line or plot, you have no idea of what is really going on at any giving time. Sure you supposedly encounter famous russian people through the film, but you never truly know who your looking at, and when you do, there are never any really good close up shots of any of the greats, such as catherine and nicholas. I think this film is a monumental waste of money, time, film, so forth and so on. I wouldnt force anyone to watch this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I saw this film by chance and was completely blown away by it. After the initial viewing I watched the commentary disk to better understand what it was that I just saw. Immediately after that I put the movie disk back in and watched \\"Russian Ark\\" a second time through. Wow.I am very much surprised to see so many 1-star and negative reviews in Amazon.com. I can only say that I wholeheartedly agree with all of the previous 5-star reviewers and their thoughtful analysis. Negative reviewers are entitled to their opinions, of course. But with such disparity in ratings, I think everyone who enjoys films should see \\"Russian Ark\\" and decide for themselves. As for me, \\"Russian Ark\\" is a unique and dazzling film shot in the equally spectacular Hermitage. I will long remember 96 minutes in one breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spek-tacular!","review":"The movie is a metaphor for the pre-revolution Russia told through the treasures and beauty of Hermitage. Spectacularly shot in one single take, this is a poem, not a movie. Only a person with good understanding of Russian and European history will fully appreciate what this film has to tell. It all sadly ended once the red criminals took over in 1917. The Russia and the Europe will never be the same. Parts of our souls had been taken away for ever.No wonder some viewers in US discarded the movie as a pretentious art experiment. An illiterate person can stare at thousands of books and never grasp a single word from those pages. This is a movie for conoseurs of art, history and good cinema. If you are expecting pure, superficial entertainment, stay away. There's plenty of junk out there for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Ark","review":"Russian Ark, A film in one take going through the life of the Hermitage fromCatherine The Great to the Revolution. Absolutly engrosing and breathtaking.Also the other material regarding the making of the film was very enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Ark review","review":"It is a wonderfull, but rather allegoric movie. It is defenetly interesting to watch and for those who have never been to Hermitage - that's definitely a good opportunity to have a glims of what's inside. I probably would recommend to whatch it after you have made a short introduction to the history of Hermitage, because most likely you will be confused by the flow of caracters. But from emotional point of view - this is 100% worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A movie to admire more than like, Russian Ark is a technically-brilliant (the entire movie is one take) journey through Russian history in the guise of a time-traveling trip through the Hermitage; it's often slow and rarely riveting but it's a film I'm glad I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Boring! Boring!","review":"From my perspective, Russian Ark is painfully boring. I say this as someone who watches a lot of films that could be similarly characterized as arty or experimental. I only finished watching this film because I was with friends, and it seemed best to just hang in there. When the film was over, we checked a number of websites to see what others thought. My mind was blown by the high percentage of positive (often glowing) reviews by critics and non-critics alike. While the technical skill required to record the entire movie in one shot is impressive, the lack of compelling characters or plot resulted in my desire to stop watching the film shortly after it began."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I thought this was an complete and utter prententious waste of time. I watch hundreds of videos a year & this is the only one I've had to fast forward through most of just to keep a glimmer of interest. It's not really about the history of Russia at all. In fact, it's not about much of anything. It's more of an exercise in cinema, a bad idea that should have been tossed aside. The cinematography & art direction was nice but other than that it was cinematic doodling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie in Good Costumes","review":"The costumes were great.Everything else was horrible: plotless, uninformative, idiodic dialouge.I kept having the feeling that the effort it took to make this picture could not possibly have been wasted on such a flat and pointless script. One could learn more about Russian history by spending half an hour with an encyclopedia.Please watch 'Moscow Doesn't Beleive in Tears', 'War and Peace', 'Freeze, Die and Come to Life', 'Battleship Potemkin\\", or anything other than this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps useful as a technique of torture","review":"The first time I tried to watch this film, I was five beers and a vicodin deep. I fell asleep and tried again the next day, completely sober. If you find that you must sit through this movie so that you can talk about it at pretentious parties or something, I'd recommend accompanying it with the cocktail I had the first time around. Just be careful to avoid an acetaminophen overdose -- that's about the only thing that might make your night worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Ark--An Art Journey","review":"The Russian Ark is an art journey for the mind. Having been to Russia twice and so impressed with the beauty of the Hermitage I decided to give this a try. The video is so impressive. This is the story of a ghost who is elusive to the current day visitors to the Hermitage. The ghost describes the days he worked at the museum and his experiences. The degree and depth of the photography is awesome. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys the out of body experience studying art gives you.

I went out and bought it the next day. It took about 10 minutes for me to realize that I'd made a huge mistake. The soundtrack is not really a \\"soundtrack\\". I could hardly pick out the songs on the CD as being songs in the movie.

This is one CD I won't be buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What sound track?","review":"Saw the movie on Friday went looking for the sound track on Saturday. To say it was a joke was an understatement. The movie's got a great mix of classic rock and new rap including some great AC/DC cuts. You won't find ANY of that good old stuff on this CD. Want to see how bad this CD is? Go look and see how many copies of it are sitting on the shelves of your local music store. The National chain I went to find it at had 5 slots full of these drink coasters. Ended up buying some other CD's that were on sale.

I liked Err time but it gets old quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The BEST","review":"This is one of the BEST soundtracks I've heard in a long time. Nelly is one artist that is good at anything he does. If its sports, he's good, rapping, or acting he can't help it, its the way God made him. With people like Lil Wayne, Ali, MurphyLee, and the rest of the people on the cd, it had to be a winner. I'm so glad to be a part of Nelly's i-squad because that's where I get a lot of information about him and if you are not a part of his i-squad you should check out i-squad.com and become a part of it cuz its hot.Taryn"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the sountrack?","review":"I could have sworn i heard 2 AC/DC tracks in the movie, and they even played Thunderstruck in the trailer and tv spots.

But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed. As for those of you interested in that Lynyrd Skynyrd song playing during the car chase, it's called, \\"Saturday Night Special.\\" The soundtrack wasn't bad, just a disappointment.

I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong CD","review":"I had ordered this CD for my husband.He likes the movie \\"The Longest Yard\\" and he wanted to get the soundtrack of the movie. Unfortunately at the time of ordering it did not specify what songs were included in the CD, but I thought if it was from The Longest Yard movie, then it would be the soundtrack.Well, I received the package and gave it to my husband for him to open, he started playing it and was very disappointed.He ended up getting a CD full of stupid rap songs. I am not happy with what I received, if I could send it back and get something else I would,but I know it will be a hassle to even ask for an exchange.My suggestion to other people is to find out exactly what they're lookin for before placing an order and just because the cover looks like the original,it does not mean it's what you're really looking for.

It's perfect for excersizing -- or for the upcoming high school football season.

But when I checked it out on Amazon I was disappointed to find that not even one of the songs that I remember from the movie was in the clips. I agree with the people above, the movie is supposed to use music from the movie, not just dedicate the album to a rapper in the movie. (The songs that I did hear on the CD weren't that bad, but again not from the movie.)

The words \\"Inspired By\\" came into play when a movie didn't have enough songs in it to complete an entire soundtrack. With this movie \\"Inspired By\\" is just a tool to push lesser acts. Only five of the songs on this soundtrack actually appear in the movie. With the amount of awesome songs that were in the movie you'd think there would be a soundtrack to match. The two songs that I most wanted to hear from the movie were Nelly's \\"Boom\\" and Union Turnpike's \\"Oh\\". Guess I won't now. I guess you could also argue that licensing and royalties come into play too, but being that Nelly produced the soundtrack and put most of the people in his \\"stable\\" on the soundtrack I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck","review":"ok, this is pretty much just another nelly cd. dont get me wrong, i love nelly. but i want a soundtrack that actually has songs that are in the movie. duh. thats what a soundtrack IS. dont buy this cd if you want the kick-ass songs from the movie, because you will NOT find them on this. buy it if you want the new nelly cd with a few other ppl, cuz thats all this is. its total bs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD Ever Made!!!!!","review":"I just recently saw The Longest Yard, and I absolutely loved it to death!!

This soundtrack features one good song from Nelly, but that's all to see, ladies and gentleman. I would rather drink one hundred kegs of beer, get a hangover, and puke my guts up for the rest of my life than listen to this CD!!!

The characterizations and storyline are largely outdated to modern kids. Also, they will not identify with a lot of the British idiom the characters speak. Even the mindset and worldview of these characters (who even by 50's standards must have been living under a rock in some fairy land), are laughably quaint. The writing itself is passable at best. Blyton's pacing is painfully slow and she knows little about building suspense. If adults want a trip down memory lane while reading \\"safe\\" suspense to their kids, try \\"The Hardy Boys\\" instead. The concept is the same, but the writing is better and American kids will identify with the material much more easily -- even if they still find the characters too scrubbed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SHOW EVER","review":"I love the DVDS, I have all of the ones out now, and I watch them religiously.

But alot of her songs just aren't deep enough, didn't have enough dynamic to make me love her. This is honest, and believe me I've given her a fair chance. At times I just couldn't listening on to some of her songs, they just repeates too much without really making the lines truly shine.I think if Lily work on it, she can produce great things; if she can write songs like Welcome to Slaughterhouse, I have confident that she can make it really big."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed","review":"I checked this cookbook out from the library and am glad I didn't buy it.

It is about creating and nurturing a joyful, peaceful, Catholic home. Coming from a more authoritarian approach to parenting, it has helped me to realize that having the most well-behaved kids should not be my #1 goal. It has reminded my husband and I that our primary goal should be to love our children and teach them to love--one another, the Lord, his Church. Within that primary goal of love, it gives excellent discipline approaches that are firm and effective. Although it does encourage attachment parenting, which I have not practiced so far, I was not offended at it's presentation or made to feel that I absolutely must or my kids would suffer terribly. It is presented in a very loving, intelligent way as being ideal for children, and I will be revisiting this section as I would consider it for our next baby.For parents who truly want a vibrant, loving Catholic home, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Parenting!","review":"I truthfully enjoyed reading every page of this book!

It was frustrating that he was so bent on this perspective that I literally could not garner anything from the book. If you are not extreme attachment parents, this book probably isn't for you. For us, it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even wittier than Grafton!","review":"Gayle Roper's Merry Kramer is one of the spunkiest, most loveable characters I've 'met' recently. She's got enough human foibles that I can relate to her, but she's clever and sharp enough that I admire her deeply.

I couldn't put it down and smiled all the way through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Third Book","review":"Merry is back for her third book, and she's still got what it takes to entertain. This book has everything you'd expect from the other two, great characters, great mystery, and personal problems for Merry that make life just a little more interesting. But she faces them all with her faith in the Lord, which helps her through everything. I was a little disappointed because the mystery takes a back seat to the plots involving abuse. Still, a very entertaining read that I plan to read many times myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pic shows ratchet not blade scam","review":"I bought this as the rachet and the blade was the only one shipped I don't own the cutter so can't use the blade that cost 30 dollars scam"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edmunds first outing with a prototype Rockpile lineup","review":"Edmunds third full-length LP is his first with what would become Rockpile (Nick Lowe, et al.), an on-going partnership that would alternately back Edmunds, Lowe and produce LPs of their own.The sound of \\"Get It\\" is a lot fuller than his previous two LPs (\\"Rockpile\\" and \\"Subtle as a Flying Mallet\\"). There's the requisite pub-rock standards (e.g., Bob Seger's \\"Get Out of Denver\\"), but also new to this LP (for Edmunds, anyway) is the songwriting of Nick Lowe.The combination of Lowe's clever lyrics and tributary melodies with Edmunds' recreations of productions past is terrific. It both freshens Edmunds own sounds and gives Lowe's songs a retro feeling.Edmunds (and Lowe and Rockpile) produced several more excellent LPs (including Lowe's stellar '78 LP \\"The Jesus of Cool\\"), but this is the one that really marked the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Mitch Ryder Fans, Stay Away From This One!!","review":"This album is totally out of character with anything else that Mitch Ryder has ever recorded before. The music is modern techno/rap, Mitch's vocals are so heavily treated electronically that you'd never guess it's him singing, and the songs are unmelodic. In other words, it doesn't sound anything at all like a Mitch Ryder album. I'm sure there are people out there who would like this, but I doubt if very many of them are Mitch Ryder fans.

When the loupe is fully extended it could fit on the surface of a Nickel 5 Cent Piece and barely hang over the edges. To be a 20x lens it has to be this small. The people in previous reviews do not seem to understand this fact. You will not find a true Hastings Triplet 20x that is bigger. This lens is not for coin grading or to see bigger objects where 10x would work. If you are buying this lens for coins it would be great for things like Repunched Mintmarks, slight doubling, die scratches and other things where you would almost need a microscope to verify. If purchased for the correct use this will be an outstanding tool. If you reqire viewing a large surface or area of a coin or other object consider getting a 10x.

I have purchased many \\"triplets\\" during the last 25 years and find that it is wise to get a Bausch & Lomb or better 10 power triplet. Some cheaper ones have one thick lens and therefore are not triplets which should have 3 lens for optimal field depth and less distortion.

In fact we benefit from economic prosperity overseas: it means better, cheaper goods for us to buy and growing markets for our goods. Unfortunately, as recent experience atests, the Japanese have done a great job of producing and marketing industrial products, but have never put together a modern financial/service sector. Japan's economic demise is drag on the global economy and if the global economy is to right itself, we can only hope the title to this book is correct!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a part, of my rock-n-roll shower","review":"Unbelievable album! I haven't heard it in years (15+) yet I found myself replaying the songs in my head, singing the tunes in the shower, and now, finally, purchasing it on Amazon.com. Only a truly great peice of work such as Desolation Angels can stick with me that clear, for that long. While \\"Rock-n-Roll Fantasy\\" is the most famous commercially (on this album),it is, in my humble opinion, by far, not the best of the album. This is a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This is a great album. It was released in 1979 afer their last album, Burning Sky had produced no hits. It is not as good as Straight Shooter but its one of their best.Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy- One of the greatest rock songs ever writtenCrazy Circles- A very good song.The acoustic guitar makes it feel like a folk-rock song.Gone, Gone, Gone- Pure R&B;Evil Wind- They may have added synthesizers on this album but at least they're put to good use o this song.Early In The Morning- A very laid-back tuneLonley For Your Love- First love song on the album, its alrightOh, Atlanta- This song is country rock and almost country.Take The Time- Fun songRhythm Machine- Soulful vocals and the rythym section are the highlight of this song.She Brings Me Love- pretty good love song.Bad Company are one of the greatest band ever. This is one of their best. ROCK ON!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine set of British Blues...4 and 1/2 stars","review":"Bad Company got little attention from critics during their heyday (the mid to late 70's), presumably for being a \\"formula\\" rock band, but they were nonetheless a mainstay on turntables and in 8-track players of most teenage guys. \\"Desolation Angels\\" was second only to their debut, \\"Bad Company,\\" in their canon of rock-n-blues releases.Paul Rogers' voice still stands (next to Roger Daltry and Robert Plant) as one of the great rock voices of the time while Mick, Boz and Simon were all in great form for this one. \\"Rock'n'Roll Fantasy\\" and \\"Gone, Gone, Gone\\" are the radio standouts, but \\"Crazy Circles\\", \\"Early in the Morning\\" and \\"Evil Wind\\" will stay with you too, and Paul wrings out his awesome voice on \\"Lonely for Your Love\\". If you like Bad Company and you don't have this CD, get it! If you're unfamiliar with Bad Company, but like British Blues, buy this one AND the debut simply called \\"Bad Company,\\" you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, not bad","review":"I'm not sure if this has their hits.

First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched. When I pushed delete, the menu came up.

Boy was I disappointed! After a few weeks the camera would turn off by itself, flash internal diagnostic malfunctions, and basically just refuse to work. Not only is it useless but it burns through batteries (rechargeable and alkalines) faster than the speed of light. I usually got less than 15 pictures or four minutes of video. I could not find my receipt to return it but with shipping and drama I have decided to turn it into a boat anchor instead and live-and-learn.

She bought it at 14 years old with her own $ to take on a school field trip to Washington. She took about 50 shots and then the power button would only work randomly or the lense would freeze coming out or closing. Being an electrical engineer I would guess that the motor for the cover/lens draws so much current that the battery voltage drops so low that the camera shuts off. I have tried brand new Eveready Copper tops with no luck. If I try it 4 or 5 times and can't coax it to life I can sometimes set it to view the pictures and then slide it over to the take picture mode and it will stay on. I feel bad as I talked her into a $300 Sony telling her to buy a good brand name and it would last for years.

I've been using Sony cameras for some time and this was an upgrade from my older 4M. Similar features, but I recall I bought my old one at $400.00! Expect to get nice large prints (>16X20) from this 6M if you're into printing posters or large photographs. (If you don't care about larger prints, a 4M is plenty!)I didn't give it 5 stars for 3 reasons:1. The camera is a bit heavier than others in the 6M range (non-SLR of course). Nonetheless, comfortably fits in your pocket.2. It may prove challenging for some with larger hands as the size is smaller than others.3. No rechareable batteries included.. Plan on buying some. Keep regular ones for emergencies only!Highly recommend a 512M memory stick (or two 256Ms).

The size and handling are great. The pictures are pretty crisp.My only complaints are that the battery life seems to be very low. I just purchased rechargeable batteries and they work somewhat better, but you should make sure you always have a spare set with you.I also am not really happy with the zoom quality, but this may not be a fair assessment since I am used to a bigger camera.Also, the LCD panel is very difficult to see on a sunny day, almost useless.Otherwise, for a small backup camera, the Sony has worked out quite well. I would definitely recommend it as a model to carry in your purse or pocket as a backup, but if you're going on the vacation of a lifetime..... go with something bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing!","review":"NOT a good tape; the songs are super cheesy, and are also the same songs on her 'disco' tape; ...

It is a prime example of laid back and yet guitar-driven classic rock of the 1970s. Songs like \\"Can't Get Enough\\", \\"Rock Steady\\", and \\"Bad Company\\" are all classic rockers. \\"Ready For Love\\" is a sultry, slow anthem. \\"Movin' On\\" was another rock radio hit worthy of mention. These five songs are all ones I remember hearing on rock radio, and all are great. The pretty harmonies of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and the laid back, accoustic nature of the closing track \\"Seagull\\" are also very enjoyable.I love the Paul Rodgers-led Bad Company years. Surely this first album still is still a classic after all these years. Soulful singing with blues-based guitar riffs is my simple explanation of how this album sounds. Nothing overblown, complicated, or real heavy here. Just great '70s classic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"you never heard it like this before","review":"Bad Company's first and best album. I still remember hearing the original British LP playing in a little record shop in Houston Texas, before it was released in the USA. I was transfixed, and bought the store copy. This disc has seen a couple of releases on CD, but neither sounded as good as that original British vinyl. Audio Fidelity, however, hit a home run with this release. Over a year was spent just locating the original master tapes, which were then lovingly transfered and remastered by Steve Hoffman, one of the best mastering engineers in the business. THIS DISC SOUNDS INCREDIBLE.If you're a Bad Company fan, this gold disc is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth 10 stars!","review":"Bad Company's very first album is one of the best rock albums EVER!!! Played it so many times I had to replace it a few times on both vinyl & cassette and now I have it on cd and it sounds better than ever.

If you don't already own this, get it soon and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This plus \\"10 from 6\\" is all you really need","review":"What can said about \\"Bad Company\\"? It was a smash when it was released and cemented the band as one of the \\"supergroups\\" of the 70s. It is by far their best album; sure there were other albums that produced some hits but I really don't care for playing any of them from beginning to end like I do this one.What else? I think \\"Seagull\\" is under appreciated -- just Paul Rodger's voice and a guitar; be sure to give it a listen (ditto for \\"Silver, Blue, and Gold\\" off of \\"Run with the Pack\\").It is their first and best album; so unless you're a die hard Bad Company fan or 70s rock aficionado, \\"Bad Company\\" and \\"10 from 6\\" are the only two Bad Company albums you really need in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I purchased a used CD that is no longer printed.

My first reaction was no reaction. After experiencing truly remarkable groups like The Who, Cream, Hendrix and of course, The Beatles, I found Bad Company to be, at best, a decent-sounding garage band. A group lacking originality, depth of lyrical content, personality, and ear-catching musicianship, I found listening to them to be a dull, enduring experience. And, by the way, the first \\"supergroup\\" was indeed Cream and certainly not this one. And Simon Kirke a great drummer? Come on-Keith Moon was the greatest rock drummer of all time, in my opinion. Paul Rodgers a great rock singer in his time? I think the Who's Roger Daltrey had him beat easily. Bad Company should have called themselves \\"Sominex\\" instead. Why? Well...you know the answer why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Honest","review":"The debut album by this British quartet is straight ahead rock n roll at its finest.

My problem is mainly with her underdeveloped \\"hero\\" Colin Montgomery. For the first half of the book he does no more than pop in and out of the story at weird times and in odd/unbelievable situations.

Actually, I wish I had never picked up the book in the first place.What didn't like about the book? 1) the heroine was not at all likable or someone you could relate to, 2) the hero was non-existent and 3) there were three murders of innocent people that were in no way necessary for the plot.Don't waste your money or time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful historic love story","review":"Lady Kenna Lennox is a strong heroine whose bravery is ahead of her time. She meets Colin and they have an instant attraction. Througout the story he appears unexpectedly, and I loved the element of suprise.

My remote is clearly too big for the batteries because they slip instantly.When the batteries stay in place the remote works perfectly. When the batteries slip, which they always do, the remote does not work at all. The reason I bought this remote is that I didn't want the hassle of programming a regular universal remote.

I took a chance and not only was it cheap but it looked brand new. Very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful before ordering","review":"I ordered 2 boxes on Oct 26. They are currently scheduled for delivery on Jan 17, after being rescheduled twice. Do not believe the 3-5 week delivery estimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"never going to show up","review":"Same thing happened to me--I ordered a box, but there seems to be no intention of the item actually being shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I purchased this book for the $3.49 price. To my surprise, it really is 4 pages, small pages, and the list price on the book is $1.50. There are about 24 small stickers, the size of a quarter. Save your money, it's not worth the cost of the book plus shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"addicted to stickers","review":"I have a lot of stickers. I love them. I am not sure why, but - there we are.These are fun, cartoony drawings of horses. There is a decent variety and I have used a handful of them. A couple were a little difficult pealing from the page, but everything worked out fine. I like them a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"I've never been more disappointed in something I ordered from Amazon. Tiny four page book with just stickers; no activities even suggested much less included. Marked on the back for $1.50 not $3.49. Don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues People","review":"This is a really interesting look at the evolution of black culture through the lense of music. Some of the author's opinions about later music (50's-60's) may seem out of touch to today's readers, but overall it is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very honest&breaks all chains","review":"this book not only puts the music into perspective but also the struggle that still goes on too this day.very upfront&honest about problems that still linger.it traces the journey&challenges it's reader too better understand the reason for the whys??one of the best Books that I have ever read from start too finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic in every sense of the word","review":"This book is probably the greatest ever written on the early history of black music in America. With rare clarity and glowing intensity, Baraka traces the evolution of black forms such as blues and jazz back to Africa, and presents the reader with genuine insight into the world of the creators of these important 20th century art forms. The book is as gripping as any novel you will ever read, and also crammed with facts and mindboggling lines of thought. Anybody with even the slightest interest in modern black music needs to read this book, and consider its contents thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better suited for grief workers, not those who have had a recent loss","review":"I lost my fiance to suicide several weeks ago and have been frantically trying to find information regarding how to deal with this sudden loss. I picked up the book based on the title and also the description inside the front cover of the book. What I found after reading the first few chapters is that it is really a support manual for those who help the survivors of sudden death, not necessarily those who are experiencing the first weeks and months of a sudden loss. I really wish the title of the book were more tailored to its contents and that the description inside the front cover was also a little more clear regarding who the book is really meant for. That's not to say in any way that the book isn't well written and very helpful for it's audience, but as someone who just experienced a loss I am definitely not the intended audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with little details","review":"This book is almost worthless. There are no detailed descriptions of any installation methods. There are no illustrations. Basically, this book is a trivial overview of the installation of ceramic and stone tile countertops."},{"rating":"2","title":"MaxSteel 16' Tap measure","review":"This tap is a very good fit in the hand tap. I droped it off a 40 foot roof once, it cracked the housing but it still worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tape ever","review":"Since I first bought this series of tapes I have been nothing but satisfied. When most tapes get wet ant get dirty they start to stick and not recoil, but these tapes don't have any trouble. They also go out further than most other tapes which greatly helps when you're trying take measurements up in the air."},{"rating":"1","title":"false publicity","review":"The tape they send you IS NOT THE CONTRACTOR GRADE that appear in the picture. it is still the Max steel but doesn't have the red rectangle. that indicate is a contractor grade, an make it much durable an better I still keep it because returns take weeks and who has the time ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not contractor grade","review":"Even though the title says contractor grade, this tape is not contractor grade! It is the same one you can buy at the same price at your local hardware store and not have to pay shipping. Do not be fooled like I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cabinet Maker Must","review":"I can't find a tape measure to compare. I like this over the Powerlock, and I find the FatMax to be a bit combersome. I like the 32s on the first 12\\" so I couldn't go with the FatMax. It's alot easier to eyeball a 64th with a 32nd reference. The Durability and comfort of the MaxsSteel is alot better than the Powerlock. I've used a few different brands and I keeping coming back to Stanley. I have no problem with Lufkin or ProTape, but I find that Stanley has come up with a great combination with the 692. I will mention on thing, I ordered two tape measures and when I got them in the mail, the hooks we either bent, or rivetted wrong, because one was off 1/64th and one was off a 1/32. I sent them to Stanley and they sent me two new ones promptly and they were right on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eight Years","review":"Prior to my purchase of this 16' model from Stanley I would go through one 16' tape a year. Those included some of Stanley's other models as well. This tape is exactly what it says it is...contractor grade. I have dropped this countless time and have yet to bend the end. What I really like about this product is that I take it for granted. I trust this tape with helping to put food on my table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great movie!!!

The story was awful. The acting was awful. For such a great actress like Murphy who starred in 8 Mile, Don't Say A Word and Sin City, to do this movie she must have been kidnapped and held at gun point or was flat out desperate. I would even go as far as to say this movie could have ruined her legacy.... but lucky for her no one watched it.Here's something funny about this film.... they spent $32 million making it. The same budget as Source Code starring Jake Gyllenhaal, which was a box office blockbuster and went on to make $147 million.. Just goes to show a movie about time travel in an alternate timeline >>>>>>> cooking ramen.RIP Murphy, so sorry you were involved in this stinker just before your untimely death."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really bad","review":"I'm a Brittany Murphy fan, but this is just horrible, and it is Brittany Murphy at her worst. Just simply terrible, don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I love chick flicks! I'm all for the independent girl on a new adventure. I also like Brittany Murphy. It's really disappointing that this movie is horrible. A perky American girl gets stuck in a country where she doesn't speak the language, but don't worry, she has her English-Japanese dictionary with her which really helps her learn Japanese (because the language is that easy). She just so happens to decide to learn how to cook ramen which apparently is a challenging dish (I don't know about you but I boil the water, open the bag, and drop the noodles in...then I add the flavor packet). Anyway, because she makes ramen, she's hailed as a neighborhood hero and everyone LOVES her. The movie shows the Japanese in a negative light while the blonde haired brown eyed beauty is sweet and bubbly and a total hero. Yeah. I couldn't buy it. It's a shame because I really like Brittany Murphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chow, Not so Fun","review":"This movie of an unmotivated girl, love-sick in search of a career in and of itself was a lot to handle. Add to that she doesn't speak the language and wants to learn how to make ramen? I fast-forwarded through most of this and still thought it lagged. Not a recommended movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't even bother finishing this one","review":"I was looking for a light movie, but the story is contrived in a way that made me lose interest in the heroine and the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty corny.","review":"This movie is pretty corny. A slap in the face of true Ramen chefs and the eaters of Ramen. Tampopo was way way way better. This is another stupid hollywood rip off of a beautiful foreign film. What's a matter Hollywood? You run out of talented writers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss Brittany Murphy","review":"I didn't see everything she was in, but I enjoyed all the ones I did see. She was especially good in the romcoms, but this movie was a little sad, romantic and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old world Japan","review":"I'm half Japanese and lived in rural Japan until I was 13. this film struck a cord with me.... true to life in the characters, accurate Japanese, and deep truths about the Japanese heart. I loved the scene with the ramen sensei's mother. as mentioned in other reviews, I found the very Chinese music annoying-but the noodle shop sign says chinese noodles, so we'll let that slide. if you've spent any time in Japan, you'll appreciate this film. Just remember to look below the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"No awards but worth a watch","review":"Others have provided more in-depth reviews of this movie, The Ramen Girl, so I won't bother trying (not my forte anyhow). I thought it was fun, sweet, moving, a little silly at times, insightful, and just a really good watch. I truly appreciated the lack of four letter words that most movies seem to get more than their share of these days. I did watch the alternate ending in the Special Features too and think the right decision was made to use the one that was included with the movie. I really love watching Brittany Murphy - she's cute, a great funny girl, serious when she needs to be. But even though, here in America at least, she was the most recognizable actor in the film, I thought all of the actors were really good and certainly integral to the film. Brittany blended into a fun cast, and they all shined together. That's my two-cents! I plan to buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"We had never seen a B. Murphy movies and did not know who she was...came on cable, late one night, we were hooked! We both lived & traveled in the Far East to include Japan and we could visualize this scenario actually occurring. Sweet movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Amusing story starring one of my favorites, Brittany Murphy. Simple story but enough to keep you entertained.The constant talk and visuals of ramen will make you hungry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"This is seriously one of my favorite movies. It's a comedy so don't take it too seriously. I love Ramen also and it's a big part of the movie. Overall a wining combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girlie movie","review":"Great movie for the single woman cuddled up in bed with a comforter wrapped around you as if every time you pulled the cover tighter you were receiving a big hug. i loved the innocence, the truth about life's quirky way of always throwing you a curve ball and finally it is a fairy tale where the nice girl's dream comes true. I wish this for all woman who is trying to just be at peace, enjoy what they do and truly find passion and purpose in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute","review":"This movie was cute. I love Britney Murphy. I can not say it is recommendable. It is a good movie to watch when there is really nothing else on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Parody Please","review":"Frankly the only way I could begin to appreciate this movie even a little was to view it as parody. Ditzy Brittany as a \\"seeker\\" in Tokyo? Puhleaze. But once you put that ditz with the phony lips who refuses to learn even a little Japanese in with the drunken ramen \\"master\\" and climax it with that masterful portrayal of a very tired, seemingly blotto ramen \\"grandmaster\\" the movie has some laughs, for me at least. (Meanwhile, next to me in bed, my Murphy-loving girlfriend was eating it all up as straight \\"drama.\\" Sigh.) Ditzy Brittany should have stayed with her Tokyo copyediting job, which apparently consisted primarily of editing bathroom signs, changing \\"flash\\" to \\"flush,\\" which is a telling inside joke about the two pejorative ways to view this silly movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Very entertaining movie, so much I found myself pausing it just to go get a snack because I didn't want to miss anything. I rarely ever do that! I truely recommend it if you're looking a good relaxing (funny) and entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What you expect, but great none the less.","review":"I thought this would be a romance movie- just your typical romance movie when I originally watched it on Netflix instant play. I was surprised. Brittney Murphy actually did a great job in this. I won't spoil it for you, but it''s more less telling you before you settle for something you've grown accustomed to, you need to explore, take a chance, and find yourself. At least that's what I got. This is now one of my favorite movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Supplement","review":"Leon McBeth adds his Sourcebook for the Baptist Heritage as a larger extension of footnote material for his \\"Baptist Heritage: Four Centuries of Baptist Witness\\" (Broadman, 1987) The student of Baptist history will certainly appreciate this extra volume because of the effort that McBeth has included in its pages to carefully illustrate not only the genuine scholarship that he has put into his work, but also the 'human' side of the people about whom he is writing. (There are some personal letters included within the Sourcebook to give the reader some glimpses into the lives of the people or the events connected with the materials presented in the BH.) Furthermore, this book gives the readers the chance to read the primary materials for themselves and to dialogue with McBeth's conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph of the Small Press?","review":"Mr. Tilston's well researched and competently written book is published by a small press, probably a subisidy publisher. The real question is not how good the book is, but whether established publishers like Harper Collins, Bantam or Simon Schuster would have published it.Are we losing out on good writers and good books because money making has become the name of the game?Perhaps Mr. Tilston can answer my question. Is he satisfied with the way the book is published? Has he recouped his investment or a well caressed ego is worth the outlay?I'll be interested in hearing from him. He certainly has the flair of the language, hall mark of a real writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Overlook this J Geils!","review":"I was a big J Geils fan, but I never went for the slick productions. This CD is very satifying, without falling into that trap. I had Monkey Island on tape years ago. Not all of it has aged well, it has the indellible stamp of the '70's guitar. The shining stars are the strong vocals and music on \\"Surrender!\\", the rollicking remakes of \\"I'm not Rough\\" and \\"I Do\\", and the very poignant \\"Wreckage\\", which was the track I remembered most. The ballads are well turned out and the title track is interesting, and if \\"I Do\\" doesn't get you dancing, I don't know what will. This album deserved a lot more attention than it got. One or two listens, and you will find yourself hooked. It's a mixed bag of styles, but it does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting album...uniquely J. Geils Band","review":"I loved this album when it first came out and I still love it today. This is the kind of album I wish someone (anyone!) would produce today. This is an album with an attitude -- it's funky, it's groovy, it's tough, it's fun, it's sad and it's even sweet at times. There is truly something for everyone on this album -- from the hot, hot, hot Surrender featuring Cissy Houston to the unbelievable harmonica solo from Magic Dick and Seth Justman's stellar keyboards on the hauntingly jazzy and beautiful Monkey Island. Wreckage, the final track, closes the album on such as achingly satisfying note that you'll want to play the whole thing over again. Justman and Wolf really hit this one on the mark with a combination of rock and roll, blues, and jazz that shows off their great dimensionality, highlights their musical roots and gives a glimpse of what's to come on their later albums. I HIGHLY recommend this album!"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],H={key:0},N={key:1};function R(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(B,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-f7bdec2d"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/65.md","filePath":"library/65.md"}'),W={name:"library/65.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
