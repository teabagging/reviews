It's currently the only stand-alone burner sold in places like Best Buy or Circuit City. It overheats (or something) after about 40 mins...this is power time, not 40 minutes of burning time. At this point it starts introducing static-hellicopter sounds over the music...utterly useless. It is marketed as a cd archiving device for transferring lp, cass, VHS, DAT...whatever. Nobody would buy this thing to just play discs, as it only reads cd and cdr and is 300 bucks retail. On it's main selling point of burning, it fails miserably. I'll get my money back, but not my time wasted on this thing.

I didn't want to believe the negative reviews I saw before purchasing - I should have. If you do get one, get an extended warranty. I got one for 2 years and they're refunding my purchase price. Sony decided it's too costly to repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product.","review":"I had a Pioneer real-time burner that I used for about 7 years prior to buying this piece of junk. The Pioneer unit worked fine until it finally gave out. The Sony deck was initially OK, once I worked my way through an extremely confusing operator's manual. I succeeded in making several good-quality \\"needle drop\\" CD's from older lp sources. However, after about 90 days, everything went wrong. I could still make whole CD's and finalize easily, but 4 out of every 5 cd's I made skip when played back in any other player, be that the car, my computer, or at the office. In short, all the time and money spent have been for naught. I won't buy any Sony components again."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the Rescue","review":"I am no techie, but I had no problem getting this up and running and making good to great CD copies of my LPs.

When it worked, it worked just fine. However, after owning it for a couple of weeks, I found that it was temperamental, and that it would refuse to finalize CD's randomly, claming they were dirty or defective, even though I just taken them out of the box. Sony's customer service is worthless. I learned my lesson and returned the unit, and purchased the more expensive, better made equivalent Denon product. I will never buy a Sony product again.

My suggestion for improvement would be that the remote should be able to turn the player/recorder on and off. Also, I have other Sony products and this item is similar in that it's operation is far more complex than similar items made by other companies. I think that is because Sony consistently tries to include every concieveable function in their products. However, after reading the manual several times, I think I've learned the system. I'll review it again though before attempting to do any recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sont RCDW Compact disc player/recorder","review":"This piece of equipment is just awful!

It reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high tech- incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone's tastes.

The reconditioned recorder worked fine-it just wouldn't play any cd's. Back to Sony it went.

I have many older albums that I wanted to try and record on a CD format. I spent about a week reading over the manual and another day or so getting familar with the controls on the deck. I am very pleased with the sound of the albums recorded on a CD format. The sound quality seems much better to me than the sound of many albums I have as CD's. The sound quality seems very smooth and has much more range than a cassette tape. I have never had any problem getting a CD to finalize. I am using TDK Music CD-R's to record. If you take your time reading over the manual and to get familar with the controls, you should not have any problems. It is very enjoyable to get an older album on vinyl on to a CD format.

What this means is that no player will play past that point when you try to play it. Unless your player has a \\"Shuffle mode\\" that will skip the gaping gap in the CD you're up the creek without a paddle. All of your time will have been wasted.I'll NEVER buy ANY SONY product again.

I bought the extended warranty, because this is a SONY (duh!), so I took it back to Circuit City and exchanged it for a second one. The second unit inserts scratchiness over top of the recording. Some here have described it as static, or a helicopter sound. It's all the same. Don't believe Sony's electrostatic interference BS explanation. If that were the case, you wouldn't be able to burn a CD in your computer! Back to the store for a third unit...I have 3 years on this warranty, I'll go through 50 units if I have to.

I was informed by Sony Service center to send it to the Sony Exchange to swap units with an operational one. (I had to pay another $191.41, to have the unit repaired, because I was unable to obtain a proof of purchase invoice), and the exchange center would not accept the packing invoice.

I am on my third Sony TV in the last thirty five years; the second is still working for the person I finally gave it to.I am very comfortable with the technology of the RCDW500C. Once learned, this unit is a dream to operate. It is user friendly, displaying all of the info the user needs for optimum use. If you have questioins, the manual is well written, and will usually enable the user to solve any problems. Sony is a very reputable company.

I got one when I first traveled abroad a decade ago, and it turned out to be something of a nightmare.

TheFlexolinelaundry line has long been preferred by people traveling light, and it's strong and stretchable enough for anything. Woolite packs can be bought on their own at greater number for less cost. The sink stopper, being a simple slab of rubber, can be had for pennies in a store near you.

Discussion on the usage of imagining the tones before playing them is excellent. Some of the later tonal exercises lack a good pedagogical focus but are useful. Some of the altissimo exercises incorporate too many overtone partials that are typically NOT in tune with Well-tempered tuning. This can cause learning to hear these tones out of tune.

I have heard nothing but good things about it, even hailed as his best. That plus the Grammy he got for it made me think that it would be a very easily accessible album (like Mule Variations), but that is just not the case. This is some of the roughest sounding music he has ever made. The album is almost entirely his growling, and the music is almost all distorted guitar. It was no surprise to see that Les Claypool played on this album, because I got a Primus feel out of it.This is a very good album by a very good artist, but this is probably not the best album to start on, like I said, pick a much more accessible album (like Mule Variations or Rain Dogs) if you are new to Waits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebirthing","review":"I'm particulary linked to this album, heard during a sort of depression.

If I was unconvinced that Tom Waits had genius in his blood, this would dispel it. At the same time this is not a recording that I can whip out at any time and enjoy. For openers, I can not play this this one when my wife is at home or awake. It drives her nuts. Musically this makes the Delta Blues seem like a chamber quartet. Harsh guitars compete with rattling and pounding percusion instruments. Waits voice sounds like it is about to give out from too much screaming. Lyrically it is just as harsh and seems obsessed with Death. In the midst of this cacophony lies the beauty that is Wait's genius. Waits has taken the direction begun on Swordfishtrombones to it's end. What on the surface sometimes seems deranged is keen with details and a dry sense of humor. If you are a fan of Flannery O'Conner, try Murder in the Red Barn on for size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"When one breaks this music down to its poetic merits, it is one revelation after another.

Dr. Yamazaki spent several years in Nagasaki before returning to the US to continue research on the effects of radiation on children (as well as having a general pediatric practice.)In addition to his pioneering medical work, he also talked to government commissions about nuclear disarmament. He told them what he saw in Japan in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. His medical knowledge gave him the authority to speak as a peace activist as well.A highly recommended, highly moving book.

For the most part this is what I wanted. The infamous \\"Black Metallic\\" was the initial highlight, but after more listens I like most everything. \\"Indigo Is Blue\\" and \\"She's My Friend\\" are both wonderful, and I love \\"Tumbledown\\" and \\"Bill And Ben\\". However my current favorite track is easily \\"Flower To Hide\\", possibly because it reminds me alot of a good Lush song. Overall I hesitate to call it the masterpiece some do, but it is damn good. Now if they could just drop a \\"Best Of\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yeah - this is the one","review":"Hey this is the album with the hit Black Metallic. Certainly a milestone in the whole shoegaze movement. Say what you want about Catherine Wheel, they had a pretty cool song with that and that's more than most bands.

It's my all time favorite song. Give me a tissue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever heard of Ride?","review":"This album is not the pinnacle of shoegazing that a lot of people seem to think it is. This band seems to have stolen most of its ideas from the band Ride, and its album Nowhere. If you like Ferment, take one listen to Nowhere (released 2 years before, in 1990). You'll hear what I mean. Don't get me wrong, Ferment is a nice listen in places (I like \\"Flower To Hide\\" and \\"Balloon\\"), but all I can think when I hear most of it is \\"rip off!\\".To the band's credit, they really honed their craft on later albums and concentrated on songwriting, rather than trying to take your head off with walls of guitar noise. If you compare this to their 2000 release Wishville it doesn't even sound like the same band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcends Time and Space","review":"While not as good as their two subsequent releases (Chrome and Happy Days) the debut by England's The Catherine Wheel still manages to transcends time and space and bring the listener closer to the infinite.The head trip guitar layers of Texture starts things off well and I Want To Touch You is a cleaver bit of obsession. But Black Metallic was the song that was played on the radio at the time. It defined Catherine Wheel's original sound. The live version of this song is even better. Buy it if you can find it.There is plenty of ambiguity in Catherine Wheel's lyrics as well which makes the experience of the avid listener all the more enjoyable. A few songs are reminiscent of groups like Psychedelic Furs (Flower To Hide), early Blur (Balloon and She's My Friend) and Ride (Indigo Is Blue and Shallow). But all have the indelible mark of genius.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"album that changed my mind","review":"I admit it. When I was younger, I hated My Bloody Valentine. I couldnt get into it, mostly because if I didnt hear the hook right away, a screaming, WHITESNAKE-esque \\"here I go again, humpmyleg\\" chorus, I would think that the song was incomplete (not that I actually like or LIKED whitesnake, mind you)...when I heard CW, though...it had the makings of a great rock band-hooks, melody, rhythm--wrapped in the candy shell of the best shoegazer band in the world. This is a good place to start if you want to delve into this genre...it gets easier once you listen to the bridge that CW is. An amazing record, texture is one of my favorite songs of all time, and its gets better with age. And hey, they helped me understand how great MBV were, too. And that, my friends, is a good thing.

She looks great in both films and has very good supporting casts, including Raymond Burr and Keith Andes, and she is, of course, an excellent actress.

Though well 20 years old it still holds up. Mr. Bugliosi writes as he tried this true life case: to the point and only the facts. From the first murder all the way through to the People V. Palliko-Stockton trial. You are taken both in front of and behind the scenes of an actual murder investigation/trail. We are given excepts of actual transcripts and interviews. I learned a lot about the legal system from this book. For those of you who think that non-fiction can't be as exciting as fiction: You are wrong! All the elements are here from a classic Holywood murder mystery: Greed, lust, betrayal.

Not only are they built right (cutter outboard of crimpers), but they have 2 crimp jaws AND 2 final crush jaws (something that's not mentioned in the description, and barely visible in the photo). The crush jaws are really the clincher on these UNDERPRICED pliers: once you've crimped the connector to the wire, crushing it makes it ~3x tighter, and less-likely to pull apart, even if you try. With these crimpers, unlike most higher-priced brands, you can actually produce crimps that look like industrial wiring. And they cost ~1/3 of those other brands. The only reason I didn't give them 5* is because they're not made in USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"I agree with A. Edwards completely. The jaw is too wide to do terminals. You either end up crimping the wire and bruising the insulation or you bend the business end of the terminal. I bought mine locally and only one pair of 6 on the rack had the crimp dies even close to right. Either miss aligned or too sharp. Poor Chinese quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality so it is going back","review":"This tool crimps by having a U indent on one jaw blade and a smaller u sticking out on the other jaw blade. They did not line up on the one I got, off by about 1/4 so the u that sticks out was at 1/4 of the U that is the dent instead of at 1/2. The other interesting about this tool is that the tool is very wide, more than twice as wide as the other crimping tool I have (IDEAL 9-1/4\\" Multi-Crimp Tool from Lowes). That seemed like a nice thing at first but it greatly lowers the force per square inch you can place on the crimp as the crimp is more than twice as long. In comparing the crimps, the Ideal crimp tool produced much stronger crimps. The finish on the tool was nice and it was very smooth to use. Perhaps mine was just a dud but with the issue of the extra wide jaw, I had no need to risk trying another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than cheap crimping tools","review":"This crimping tool works great and makes a much more solid crimp compared to the cheap tools that you can get at the local hardware store. I always had problems with loose wires, but with this tool the results are much better. At this price, it's a no-brainer. So far, I've used this with Anderson Power Pole contacts (15 and 30 amp), and a variety of insulated and non-insulated terminals, and it works great on everything so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't reccomend these...","review":"As a car audio/security technician I use crimpers everyday. They are probably used more than a screwdriver. Years ago when I first started and knew nothing about anything, I bought a set of these. Horrible purchase. As someone else stated the jaw is too wide, and the handle is too short to provide good leverage. I have to exert more energy to make a solid crimp than I do with other crimpers.Do yourself a favor and pick up a set of Kleins, Irwins, or Channel locks. Anything but this. The only thing I can think of worse than these are the cheap multi tool crimper/stripper/cutter tools you find for like $5 at home depot. But those aren't even THAT much worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"These do fine without ratchets","review":"I've used these on several different size lugs, and they work fine.

To compile the best of the Blues Magoos, you start with the first selection of Electric Comic Book and end with the last selection of Basic Blues Magoos. Never Going Back to Georgia deserves recognition, but it didn't capture the fun of the original line-up. As for Kaleidescope Compendium: the Best of the Blues Magoos,my review is based on the vivid memories that I have of playing the original LP's, which I recorded on to a home-made 8-track cartidge tape, so that the original LP's wouldn't get trashed from wear and tear.

I bought it for the standbys such as \\"Eye of the Tiger\\", \\"Burning Heart\\", \\"The Search Is Over\\" and so on, but in the process I was introduced to other material with which I was previously unfamiliar. \\"Moment Of Truth\\" and \\"American Heartbeat\\", are, note for note, two of Survivor's BEST tracks. The latter especially stood out, since I bought the CD shortly after 9/11. It is not a political or patriotic song but it brought me out of extreme sadness over the tragic day, into anger and proceeded to pump into me the adrenaline of wanting to \\"beat somebody's ---\\" (while I didn't actually do so). Two unreleased tracks, \\"Hungry Years\\" and \\"You Know who You are\\" are the weak spots here but all in all, an awesome CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"good group, good album","review":"The first seven songs with the exception of \\"You Know Who You Are\\" are all huge hits and the reason i bought this album.

For the first 7 songs, this album is great. The rest of the songs are good, but they don't come close to comparing to the first 7 and I didn't even know but one of them. That's the only downfall I could find with this album.After listening to Survivor, I thought they sounded a lot like Journey, but they never got quite as much hype and didn't have as many hits. They are still a great 80's group though, and I recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which decade do you like ?","review":"I regret why I chose this title.

I listen to Dimmu because they put some melody into their music, but this cd is for those who prefer black metal like dark funeral. However, Old Man's Child, a band I usually don't care for, wrote some stellar songs for this album. Their 5 songs were more \\"dimmu-ish\\" than those that Dimmu did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why exactly did Dimmu Borgir need to produce this album? I suppose it was to give Old Man's Child the opportunity to release some material. The Dimmu side consists of four tracks: \\"Master of Disharmony\\", \\"Devil's Path\\" and two, count them two versions of a Celtic Frost tune \\"Nocturnal Fear\\". The superior and \\"canonical\\" if you will version of \\"Master of Disharmony\\" is found on \\"Enthrone Darkness Triumphant\\" rendering this one almost entirely irrelevant. The title track is decent but nothing great. But why on earth do we need two nearly identical versions of a Celtic Frost? To take up space on the album no doubt. Old Man's Child gets the better half of the disc but even here the music is quite mediocre. All in all a pointless and disappointing release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garden rack","review":"The garden rack works well if holding all your items, but a little difficult when you pull off a rake or something because it will pull everything else hanging up.

At any rate, Kathy's early \\"Lonesome Standard Time\\" is a brilliant collection of heartbreaking ballads and fun up-tempo tunes. This young lady from West Virginia is a class act and deserves much more recognition than she has received.

The music is more or less as haunting as music could be, slipping in and out of tempo in absolutely unpredictable fashion. This is a work that makes the listener question music itself, absolutely appropriate as Beckett's works make a reader question literature itself. Feldman is so faithful to the feel of Beckett's text that it seems nothing is happening here as the music moves at a glacial pace for the majority of the opera. As the case is with Beckett's work, you finish the piece and your mind is swimming with possible interpretations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Papers: German/US Social Comparison","review":"What a great find. Dr. Kurt Lewin, a Jewish Sociologist, moved to the US at the start of WWII. He wrote many papers comparing the social-culture of pre-war Germans and US-Americans. This book has provided me with some great clarity into the methodology of great-grand-relatives and the like; I can even see which cultural traditions seem to have been passed down and along and how that's played out here in the States: very fun!.....I would say he (Lewin) was a pioneer in the field of Sociological Sciences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Band","review":"Excellent quality, very comfortable, extra adjustment holes, beautiful color and high quality hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed for the $$!","review":"I'm surprised to see people giving this vacuum a good review for pet hair. I don't know if it's the suction or just the brush on the head, but during each cleaning I have to flip the head over, pull the hair out of the brush, and poke it in the hole while the vacuum is running! It also won't pick up even the tiniest little hard item, like a 1/4\\" sized stone, even if I go to the trouble of setting it right on top so the brush doesn't interfere. This is very aggravating and always makes me wish I was using my GE which picks up hair and much bigger stones very well and cost half as much.I do like its maneuverability and quietness, but I wish it was free standing with the floor head on. Overall, not so impressed and won't buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"If you enjoy Christian historical fiction, you will enjoy this boook.

I read it in one day, non-stop! It is absolutely one of my favorites. Even though the story line has been done i still love the way Ms. Wick portrays the characters and events. I love her writings they are wonderful! It is one of those book that you finish and feel satisfied. It is wonderful you must read it if you enjoy soft romance novels. I love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loving and Scholarly Work on the Life of St. Joseph","review":"Among the many books I have read on St. Joseph, this one stands out for the high quality of scholarship and loving balance with the author's insights and poetry. It must be acknowledged that the book was written in the 1930's and draws on the work of many previous writings on St. Joseph. It includes many important sources in the body of the text. However, the version I have lacks a bibliography. This is particularly unhelpful because many of the source documents are otherwise difficult to find in our 'modern times' and they likely provided a great deal of insight to the author. Aside from this, I consider this to be a fine book for revealing many aspects of the spiritual life of Saint Joseph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This was my fourth Rough Guide, and was perhaps the best of them all. It contains an incredible amount of detail on all sorts of historical monuments, large and small. This guide helped make my trip to Scotland perhaps the best of my vacations.

The Tetons are some of the most beautiful landscape out there and David Love is one of the most knowledgeable geologists around.There are about 60 pictures and graphics and they reference specific areas. I'm looking forward to finding as many of the places as I can, and see how much I can learn.I'm reading Annals of the Former World by McPhee who references this book and the complete descriptions and many pictures and graphics have helped me not only understand what David Love is saying but better appreciate the McPhee text"},{"rating":"1","title":"Void of Detail and Humor","review":"This book read like an eighth-grader's diary. Easy to read, but more frustrating and irritating than entertaining and informative. I wanted to vomit everytime the author spoke of how much she loved her trail mates, and especially the second half of the book when she gushes puppy love about her new husband. The author spends too much time discussing her fear of snow, and not enough time telling the history of the trail. I wanted to learn about the development of the trail, and the history of the many national parks the trail runs through. I guess I have been spoiled by other books. If your goal is to get a feel for the day-to-day of being on the trail, and want something that doesn't challenge your mental facilities, then this is the book for you. If you want something that is informative and humurous, in the mold of Bryson, skip this book. For a more informative read about the PCT, take a look at \\"Along the Pacific Crest Trail.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Journey on the Crest\\", a journey of extraordinary endurance","review":"I admire Cindy's extraordinary edurance and her finally fulfilling her goal although I cannot relate to her need to do such a thing. Cindy wrote of her experiences with clarity. Also, it was interesting and humorous and I enjoyed the book very much. For anyone who comtemplates doing the same thing, I heartily recommend they read her book first and for anyone not thinking of doing the same thing, I recommend it anyway just for the great entertainment, education and enjoyment of reading about a grand adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't hike ever, if this were my intro.","review":"The first three pages would make you return your hiking boots. This woman's bitter and utterly humorless writing style make a concentration camp look like a better destination.

Both of us being women, Cindy's trail experiences were different than mine in many ways, but also very similar in the most important ways! As humans walking through the most strikingly beautiful country in the US, we all share in the same wonder and awe of God's incredible creation. If you are interested in long distance hiking stories and want a taste of that life without having to sell everything you own and disappear off the grid for six months, then this is a great book to read! Or, it might be just the thing to convince you to go ahead and hike the PCT yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning the hearts of the fathers to the sons","review":"Talk about a major flashback. Half of this story takes place in the past as the hero has to consider that he might be like his father - and if so does not want to jeopardize ruining the life of his true love. Gritty and edgy scenes of teenage reality combined with the innocence of childhood and the naveté of seekers of true love present an interesting contrast. An interesting confrontation between father and son put me through a emotional tug of war. It was evident that both parties were the victim of divorce. It was also very obvious that people can't live in the past and dwell on prior hurts if they wish to lead productive and satisfying lives. The content was obviously not constructed to impress the Dove folks, since there are several scenes that will cause them to use their red pen, though there was nothing that caused me to throw a flag."},{"rating":"1","title":"dougv","review":"A slow moving film with too many flashbacks to the boy's past.Many dysfunctional people in the cast, and thus a mostly unhappy movie.Can't think of anything good to say about it.Glad I rented the film and didn't buy it.Don't recommend you see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a letter to dad","review":"movie was very slow and no subtitles or captions to be able to read what is going on. do the makers of the dvds think we all can read lips. movie not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction to precision","review":"my partner and i wished to move away from american standard to a more simpler system such as ACOL,i picked up a book by reese and wei on precision and we were very taken with the openings ad the strong club,i have been searching for the next'' book of enlightenment'' and found it in this book,for a pair starting out in PRECISION , i would recommend this as my number 1.the downside so far im huge precision libray of 3 books on the subject , is explanations of how to deal with interference,this seems to be a case each partnership making up their own rules etc..this is ok, we arer having great fun in duscussing this but it would be nice for an author to write about interference over each opening and how best to use this information and alos the best recommended way to descibe responders hand .etc..but, I love this book,. it has almost everything,a great buy,"},{"rating":"1","title":"first impressions","review":"This author must have ADD.

A self confessed techno phobe, Freeh was the worst person to have in the position. But he's a great family man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freeh is proud of Freeh","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read recently. There are paragraphs and stories repeated multiple times throughout the book. It doesnt mention the FBI and his job as director very much. He does his write about his family and the wall with pictures from his children in his FBI office over and over and over.... It is clear that Louis Freeh likes Louis Freeh and wants us to know it.Freeh mentioned in the beginning that it was not his intention to write a book. He shouldnt have!Wait until the used price comes down to $1.00 then it wont be such a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a simple heart doctor","review":"I'm the author of \\"What Your Doctor Won't (or Can't) Tell You and I have worked with very difficult if not duplicitous types myself. I was interested when I heard Freeh decided to write his book and I felt the book was fairly revealing but not enough revealing. Some of the chapters discussed his ancestors and his family - not what most of us bought this book for. Others bounced around a bit too much- it lost focus. But in the end i decided I was glad a read this book and found out more about Sandy and Bill and Janet. And I got the feeling that this guy is a decent and honest man who truly was troubled by the lack of investigation of the disaster in Saudi Arabia."},{"rating":"1","title":"My FBI... Extended Resume'","review":"I think the writing of this book expresses Mr. Freeh's personal and professional life, as he saw it. I also think that this book's content reveals a self-indulgence under the gist of humbleness... enough so that my antenna was raised. There is perhaps a degree of CYA as well... after all he was appointed by Bill Clinton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"What an utterly biased, self-serving book. Mr. Freeh was/is a political opportunist - nothing says that better than his own words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Pompus FBI Incompetent","review":"Self-angradizing should be the title of this book. If Louie had spent more time investigating terrorism and less time worried about the antics of the President, then maybe we could have prevented 9/11. After all, Louie, your own agents were sending in reports of suspected activity. And his attack on Richard Clark and lableing Clark as a low on the totem pole person, clearly shows why the FBI has a hard time catching people. Maybe, Louie, you should listen to those people low on the totem pole - you might just catch someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This is a very lame attempt by the former FBI boss to excuse himself from the 9/11 failure. The theme of the book can be described as two-fold. First is to criticize former President Bill Clinton on no grounds. The fact out of this book is that Clinton thought Freeh entirely incompetent and publicly stated that he regrets the nomination. Second is to make excuses for himself on the 9/11 debacle, which can be largely attributed to the failure of FBI, and especially Freeh.Very very lame and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bitter man","review":"What a self serving book this is! There is no loyalty when it comes to writing a book for profit.Louis Freeh is so upset with the fact that it has come to light that he did not do his job when it came to investigating terrorist that he is looking to place the blame elsewhere.If all these things were going on, he should have resigned and spoke up then. But he waited to write a book to tell us.If he were donating the money from this book, I might give it some credibility.The name of the book says a lot--MY FBI--really, I thoughtit was our FBI."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Be Told","review":"Finally a major player from within the Clinton White House has come forward to discuss the apathy and laziness of who may very well be one of the worst leaders this country has ever had. Freeh describes many situations throughout the book that clearly lay out the notion the President Clinton not only did nothing to prevent terrorism but that his actions may have been a major factor in the ability of terrorist to launch attacks on the US Mainland. Louis Freeh may not have been the best director the FBI has had but his actions detailed in this book show a man who acted very cautiously when doing his job with someone who shared a despising view of one of our nations oldest and most respected law enforcement agencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, provocative book","review":"Very detailed descriptions of important events in the life of Freeh, including the controversial and underreported errors and scheming that consumed a great deal of the Clinton presidency. Freeh really delivers explosive insight into the constant scandals that plagued President William Jefferson Clinton and how he conveniently manipulated the law in order to serve his own purposes.

This little-known and less-seen film has its moments, and many of them are due to Morricone's terrific score. It's paired with his experimental score for the erotic comedy Sessio in Confessionale, a nice example of Morricone's atonal versatility, though not really my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, this album blew me away","review":"An amazing mix of styles and influences makes this amongst my top ten of '99 (in case you're wondering the others would include Gomez, The Chemical Brothers and the groundbreaking cd from Sasha).

There isn't one thing in the book that \\"grabbed me\\". It's hard for me to believe that it was written by the same author. Well, there are many giving it 4 or more stars, so I eagerly bought it. Disappointed, yes, but really just BORED."},{"rating":"1","title":"freezing","review":"I share many of Kris Dotto's opinions about this short novel by Ms Renault but I have some of my own to add.The plot is strangely detached, far away, a sort of foreign dream told by a confused stranger. All the characters share the same trait: it is not that they are not well rounded, they are distant, someone you cannot care for. The story of Harmodios and Aristogeiton is cold, contrived, but even Simonides, the main hero, never really comes to life.More than this, the writing is often very convoluted, rather unclear, sometimes even clumsy. Dialogues are often spoilt because it is not clear whom each line belongs to.All in all, a work not worth the general praise Ms Renault always gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circus Delight","review":"This CD reminded me that I dont like lots of accordion in bellydance music.

I like it... but I feel incredibly price gouged!! Amazon listed it new for sale at over $200, so I thought that the $50 used one I found must be a good deal. The list price on the back cover is $12.95!! It is a TINY book... and it only covers a portion of available essential oils regarding their fragrance properties.

This album came to establish Kampfar as one of the best bands in this style nowadays. The sound presented here is as much the same on their previous albuns: typical norwegian black metal with additional folk influences and with an incredible great production. The cover art, pretty as always, combines exactly with the sound. The album starts with a beauty acoustic guitar intro that leads to the first song \\"I ondskapens kunst\\", one of the album hightlights, with great piano parts. This album brings \\"Norse\\", the first song from Kampfar with lyrics in English; all other lyrics are in norwegian and are very beautiful, sadly some people can't understand this idiom. The one and only negative point here is the short lenght of the album (about 37 minutes), but this fact doesn't compromise at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Few Hits...","review":"...Greatest Hits Vol 1 had all of the most popular songs that Elton ever sang. This is Vol 2 and it goes a bit deeper into his vast musical history. Some songs may not be known by anyone who is a casual listener. Whether you know these songs or not, this is an excellent disc. You gotta hear Elton's fast paced cover of The Beatles' \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\". Other highlights are \\"Levon\\" and \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\". If you got Vol 1, don't stop now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton at his best!","review":"Great songs from one of the best in rock. From mammoth hits like \\"Tiny Dancer\\" to the obscure, but spectacular break-up song \\"I Feel Like a Bullet(In the Gun Of Robert Ford) it's all here.

Levon, Tiny Dancer... you'd have to be on LSD not to like this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion to first Greatest Hits","review":"This album overall isn't as great as Elton's first Greatest Hits collection but it does have some of his greatest songs. 'Tiny Dancer' and 'Someone Saved My Life Tonight' may go down as being some of the most beautiful songs ever written. The second half of the album is just OK but does contain 'Levon', a great track. I'm not really a fan of Elton's version of the Beatles' 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' but the rest of the tracks show Elton's skills as a singer/pianoman. Elton's songs are most always catchy and enjoyable, even at their worst, and that's really saying something about his genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I debated between buying this CD and the soundtrack to \\"Almost Famous.\\" The one song I really wanted was Tiny Dancer. I didn't recognize the titles of any of the other songs. Since I have Elton's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 and LOVE IT, I decided to get this one too. It was a big mistake. No wonder I didn't recognize any of the other songs -- they stink. If you like Elton and want to get his best work, get Greatest Hits, Vol. 1. Tiny Dancer is a great song, but it's not worth the price of the entire CD. If you know and like all the songs on the CD, go ahead and get it.

Though this disc is not as superb as the original 1974 'Greatest Hits' package, it still is a fantastic listening experience. All of the songs are bonafide classics. \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" sounds as good as it did 25 years ago, what a timeless arrangment and novel use of the flutes (and one of EJ's favorite personal songs he has co-written).If you love EJ, you'll love this album, but you'll already have all of these songs on the original albums from which they came. If you are just getting into Elton, this is a disc you *must* have.

If this was the band's best of then I have to say the band was a complete waste of time. \\"White Lightening\\" is the only thing that resembles a good rock song, it has a good solid riff and chugs along quiet nicely, but the best song on the whole two discs is the re-working of \\"Walk Away Renee\\".

This is easily his best, most well crafted album of his long career because he avoids silly polka medleys, etc instead this is a straight album parodying hit MTV songs. The lyrics are twisted in just the right way and the music cloned as to be out and out hilarious. This is Al's first Grammy winning album. For example, Taco Grande is a parody of Rico Suarve and The White Stuff is a parody of The Right Stuff.

The author really lost me when he said that Princess Diana told him that she and Mother Teresa wanted to start a hospital on the other side!

I would have expired from boredom. I had to read the Hitler chapter, though...Hitler was trying hard to relay his messages to Mr. Solomon...while Mr. Solomon kept telling him he didn't wish to speak to him...even though Hitler told him that he, Mr. Solomon, was the ONLY medium he had actually EVER spoken to since his death. Such a flattering remark didn't impress the author, however...leaving one to wonder why he even put the chapter in the book in the first place.

They are unhealthy for your pet and they are made with god only knows what. They actually like these treats. They are hard enough for little dogs to help with the oral care and since they are not made in china I personally trust them more.

If you love the Nylons, as you are accustomed to hearing them on albums such as One Size Fits All, you'll wonder who the heck is singing. Only Carol of the Bells is actually done as the Nylons do what they do; the rest are very generic, stereotypical light-jazz treatments with lots of over-sweetened strings in the backgrounds. The accapella work and sense of rhthym and excitement that make the Nylons so wonderful are missing, except for Carol of the Bells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodster","review":"I wish I had taken Bobbbb's review to heart before I bought this album. I agree wholeheartedly that, while this isn't bad, and may be something different to those unacustomed to a capella groups, it is NOT the innovative sounds of the Nylons when they were the original group. I'm a big fan of their early work, but anything from the 90's on just is not the Nylons. I was very disappointed in this album, and I'll be playing my \\"Rockapella Christmas\\" album by the group Rockapella over and over again instead of this one.

I certainly don't see the attraction to this author and why she has sold so many books. The characters are so one-dimensional. Transitioning from scene to scene and scene breaks in general are terrible. The same with transitioning the dialog from one character to another. Of course, the conversation was the equivalent of cave men grunting; I have a hard time believing that educated people talk like this. The love scenes -- horrid -- made me want to skip over them.

Talk about phoning in a story. I didn't sense any real commitment to delivering a compelling murder mystery or advancing the growth of characters in Born in Death. In fact, in the beginning especially, I wondered if someone else was writing the book. There are a ton of inconsistencies in the tone and jargon that were completely offputting and consistently took me out of the story. The fact that the editor allowed this to happen makes me wonder if everyone involved is bored with Eve. If Nora Roberts is ready to move on, fine, then wrap up this series in the style fans have come to expect. But don't crank them out for the sake of cranking them out. I will give the series one more chance, but if the next one isn't a return to form, I'm done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more warm and fuzzy story","review":"Born in Death covers two mysteries: the cold, clinical murder of two rising young financial professionals (who were engaged) and the disappearance of one of Mavis' friends who is also expecting a child.As others have remarked, I thought the way the mysteries dovetailed was a bit too convenient - also, their resolution almost seemed a bit too easy. I also thought the \\"oh, the horror\\" reaction from both Eve and Roarke about babies was a bit overdone (if very funny).However, I really enjoyed the character growth from Eve, watching Peabody continue to assert herself, and, best of all, how Roarke was integrated into the plot. In some past mysteries, getting him involved has sometimes felt obnoxious or contrived. The tension between his profession and Eve's professional advancement is interesting and well done. I also liked the ending VERY much - it was touching, believable and consistent with how the characters have been depicted. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep 'em coming!","review":"Although this was not my favorite of the \\"IN DEATH\\" series I still enjoyed it. I think JD Robb strung it along too much before what I and many others were waiting for...that being the birth of Mavis' baby and Eve and Roarke's reactions/feelings about it all.I read this book really fast just to get to the end which was the best part. Nevertheless I did enjoy it and eagerly await the next in the series due out in a few weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner for J.D. Robb!","review":"J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) hits another homerun with Born in Death. I love the humor that she includes in her book.

However, again as always, and isn't this why we read her--there is a Happy Ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but predictable","review":"This was of course a good read, as most all of the 'In Death' books are. I very much liked the two mysteries that Eve had to solve (the murders and the missing person). So glad Mavis finally had her baby.

I have read every book in this series, and this rates in the top 6. The first chapter was so funny and absolutely in character for Eve and Roarke. A few of the middle chapters were a little Ho Hum but on the whole a great read. I know very few authors who stay as true to their characters as J.D. Robb[a.k.a. Nora Roberts] does and yet they are never stale. That is what will keep me looking forward to the next \\"..In Death\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone else write this book?","review":"I LOVE J.D. Robb books but Born in Death just felt like someone else wrote this book. The writing style of not the same as the previous books. In the other books Nora doesn't use words like addy, vid, wit ALL the time and there is wayyyy too much description of what people Eve is interviewing have on. I felt that this book was not up to her usual HIGH standards and was very disappointed because I had waited so long. I will continue to read all of Nora Roberts books and will hope that she returns to her usual style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd hoped","review":"In preparation for the (very) long awaited release of \\"Born in Death,\\" I had re-read the series. Unfortunately, re-reading the older books was more entertaining than was the original reading of this one. I had wished otherwise. ::sigh::"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite \\"In Death\\" Books!!","review":"I really loved this book, and I think Nora Roberts did an excellent job of writing an interesting story for those of us who were waiting for the birth of Mavis' baby.She has woven two stories and cases in great detail, and has them come together as one in the end. And as Mavis is such an interesting and flamboyant individual, she could not just have had her baby without a little drama and some great fun, too. Both Mavis and Eve are polar opposites, and are such good friends, that it is truly wonderful watching them interact with each other, with love and friendship as the foundation of their relationship. If you are a JD Robb fan, I think you will truly love this book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born in Death","review":"I am a big fan of J.D. Robb and this book did not fail me. Enjoyed it from start to finish. Read it two days."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"The book arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. I am going through the series and have not been disappointed yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, predictable disappointment","review":"The complete lack of a convincing mystery could be forgiven because everyone who reads this series has been salivating for the birth of Mavis' baby. I had been especially looking forward to this because Mavis is my favorite character. However, Nora Roberts disappoints in a huge way. She opted for no originality and instead pulled out every predictable heart tugging moment ever written.I felt like I was reading an episode of All My Children"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to others in series","review":"For those of you reading the entire series of \\" In Death\\" books this is a real disappointment. I'm wondering if someone else wrote it. There is no candy bar thief, Peabody, McNab development, insights into Eve's past, just nothing! Yes, Mavis having the baby is progress but that could have been done in 5 pages. Please Nora, spend a little more time with the characters in the next book. Or if you are tired of them, wrap it up. This one is a real stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"JD Robb","review":"Absolutely love this series, have read every book twice and can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mavis Finally Gives Birth","review":"All of the books in this series are great fun, in my opinion, but I've been anxiously waiting the birth of Mavis' and Leonardo's baby for ages! This novel not only gives one the birth of Mavis' baby, it gives one another emotional birth, as well. The character development and the interaction between the characters keeps getting better and the main plot has one really rooting for the good guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice resource","review":"I read this along with Plantagenet Somerset Fry's book \\"The Kings and Queens of England and Scotland\\" prior to a visit to London. Both were excellent resources. This one lacked some of the visual appeal of Fry's book, but it made up for that with more information. I am very happy to have this book as part of my library now."},{"rating":"2","title":"So interesting!","review":"Very thorough and interesting book! I bought this to give as a gift to a friend who is interested in English history and read it first myself! Learned a lot and it was fascinating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"I love this book. Even with all of the reading I have done on the British Monarchy, this book had never before seen pictures. My only complaint would be that it often focuses more on political events rather than personal lives. But, there is wonderful information in this book, and I have enjoyed every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Thru Biography","review":"Until I read this book, the history of England and her monarchs was clouded in confusion. No longer! A beautiful book, full of color and informative graphics, \\"Lives\\" packs much information in one volume. Antonia Frazier has done a wonderful job editing the work of many authors. \\"Lives\\" draws the reader into the life and times of kings, queens, bas***ds, pretenders, earls, dukes and mistresses. The role and evolution of Parliment is explored, as well as brief outlines of the world at large in order to maintain historical perspective. Often the authors attempt to correct what they feel were previous historical inaccuracies and judge the reigns of each monarch. From the Norman conquest in 1066 to the present, the history of this great country (and Empire) is one we need to better understand because of England's great influence on not only the US, but the world. I can't wait to read the updated 1998 edition, which I just thumbed through at a local retailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great for both the student of the subject as well as the mild enthusiast. Simple to follow and understand. Comes complete with helpful lineage/geneology charts of the different dynasties. Beautiful pictures and interesting story-type verse. I wouldn't be caught dead without a copy close at hand! It helps me look up quick facts as well as learn more of the cultures of the different eras. I couldn't have survived four years of college without it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge & Quite nice...","review":"A beautiful book, I bought is used listed as 'good' it was like new, very satisfied. Very large. Interesting on Henry VIII part, always pictured him obeast, but in his younger years he was built as a greek god, surprised me. All the pictures were marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing account of the Monarchy of England....","review":"I, as a history fanatic, Love this book! It is easy to read and easier to understand.....it has come in handy when I was needing referance material for reports and essays for my Western Civ classes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$5.95 worth of nothing","review":"I bought this to copy and give to our spelling bee winner for our school, and all I received was a partial sentence. There is nothing else available. There may have been an interview and an article, however, it is not on here. Do not waste the money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ireland's NYPD Blue?","review":"When I read VIXEN I kept thinking of the long running television police movie \\"NYPD Blue,\\" which is not to say that this novel is in any way derivative, only that one work of art reminds me of another. The Vixen here is a cold-blooded murderer who will kill her partner in crime without batting an eye. The police officers are tough men's men and all too human as they use the N word to describe their black colleague and the F word to describe a gay police officer. Unfortunately some things are universal.Mr. Bruen's sparse prose is quick and deadly. You'll be through this little prize, if you start it at take-off, before your plane lands.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yeah","review":"Excellent album, I like the percussion side of it, kind of like Calypso or salsa. And then add Ray's distinctive vocals and you have one great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, Ray.","review":"The best offer from the Doorsworld post Jim Morrison. A lot of this could have been qualified for a great Doorsalbum WITH Morrison and the orginal group. If that would be the case it would of course sounded better. But here is much musical ingredients that shows it was not too long ago sience Manzarek was a Door. The sound, the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twist on a tried and true.","review":"Pip Merriem lands herself in a pile of trouble when she finds she is stuck up the Nile River with a friend in the throes of a difficult labor. When she sends for help, the last person she expects to come to her rescue is her childhood friend John Henry Lovell. He is equally stunned to find himself summoned to help the woman he has loved since childhood and whom he fled to India to escape. Determining to wed to protect the now orphaned child and Pip's reputation, the couple is put in close proximity and must face their emotions, past and present.Katherine Kingsley has taken the much clichéd forced marriage scenario and breathed new life in to it. The glory of ancient Egypt comes alive through Pip's love of the civilization. Suppressed passion flares between the couple, manifesting itself as temper. It is this volatile history shared by Pip and John Henry that makes this story such a commanding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from Katherine Kingsley","review":"I have read all of Kingsley's previous books and enjoyed them, but this one was just dreadful. Both of the characters were unpleasant and unattractive. There was too much back story between when they were presented as children in a previous book and their subsequent meeting in Egypt. Moreover, the circumstances behind their second meeting in Upper Egypt were absolutely preposterous. Kingsley's presentation of Egypt was incorrect in many aspects. Instead of researching the country, she appears to have simply read a number of the (very good) Elizabeth Peters Amelia Peabody books.It's a shame that when an author becomes successful, her editors don't feel the need to continue doing their work and pointing out flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a chauvinistic book","review":"The tension and conflict between the characters makes for a powerful emotional chemistry, which kept this book interesting most of the time. However, what bothered me was the unusual resolution of conflict: that Pip should discover how flawed her character is, obey John Henry, and apologize. Once or twice, John Henry briefly apologizes, but only after Pip confesses and apologizes repentantly first. Never mind that John Henry's deception caused many of their problems. Worse still, in the book's final happily-ever-after scenes, John Henry admonishes Pip to \\"behave\\" for the sake of their future. What an uneven and unfair resolution! I've never read so chauvinistic a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tale","review":"Somewhere in my youth, I've read this story as a fairy tale, but I can't remember where. Of course, back then, it was without sex and it was so much better.Pip was nothing but a spoiled, lazy woman. She was made out to be such a good mother, but yet she let her maid raise the child. Every single time she got a little tired, she let poor Aaefth finish her mess without one thought that poor old Aaefth was probably worn out.Why in the world John Henry loved her so much was a wonder to me. She didn't deserve him.Ms Kinglsey is a good writer. I just wish she would either write novels or fairy tales and not combine the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the world, Monotone Pictures","review":"This was passed on to me by a friend and my ears have been greatful ever since. There is a future for this band--it begins with this album. Favorite tracks: \\"String\\", \\"Avoiding Summer\\", and \\"Slip Away\\", but with each listen, another favorite is added to the list.

This is highly recommended for those who wish to fully immerse themselves into the zeitgeist of the gold rush era."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly boring and confusing","review":"i despise books like this one. All it is is people trying to make sense of something they really don't and can't understand. Allthe terrific reviews i've heard don't represent this book at all. If this is considered poetry i must be confused about the meaning of the word poetry. There is no way to read this book without5 haveing a large knowledge of science or a dictionary. Does he think using big words evry sentence will make it a good book? First of this a college level book and even then you would have trouble reading this. I would never recomend this book to anyone and if you are thinking of reading this save yourself the time and the suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"The John D.

He was in the MBA program in 1938-39. Was Thomas in the medical school at that time? MacDonald died in 1986 while undergoing heart surgery. I guess if Thomas depressed him, he had it pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe Inspiring","review":"In recommending this book to an acquaintance, I remembered how much I loved it. I read it a long time ago, perhaps 20 years ago, and still feel that it was one of the best reads of my lifetime. Contrary to reinforcing a rift between religion and science, this book seems to marry miracle to biology; it also marries macrocosm to microcosm. My reaction when I finished it, was to want to dance and sing! The content of this book is simply amazing! If you want to have your awe and curiosity piqued, I recommend it--with enthusiasm and joy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't intrigued..","review":"Though I understand other reviewers' opinions of this book, and I agree that some of the book's ideas were interesting, The Lives of a Cell just didn't appeal to me. I have always loved science, but not in the way this book displayed it. I got extremely bored with this book and found myself skimming chapters. Lewis Thomas seemed like he was trying to sound too intelligent while getting his opinion across, where a simple explanation would have been much more powerful. Some may like this book, but I think there are much better reads out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rollercoaster!","review":"I felt that this book was good at some points and horrible at others. A few of the essays are interesting and you can easily draw similarities. Then others are ridiculous and you spend more time with a dictionary than you do with the book and you'd have to read it over 5 times to get just a general idea.So, I suggest that if you like challenging reading and science that you buy the book, but if you are like me and HATE science and just enjoy a good book, you look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, thought-provoking, beautifully written","review":"Many years ago, my father, a research chemist, introduced me to this book, as well as Thomas' other best seller, The Medusa and the Snail. The connections Thomas draws between the fascinating facts of biological life and the meaning of human life as a part of that grand scheme, are truly inspirational. As a teacher, writer and lover of the English language, I continue to marvel at his talent for expressing difficult ideas in fresh and flowing prose. I'm glad to know that his work is now studied by students in high school and college. I only wish that more of them were equipped to fully appreciate his extraordinary skill, intellect and gentle humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Review from a Biochemist","review":"I remember reading this book when I first began my undergraduate career in biochemistry (2008). As a current PhD student (2012), I look back on this book with fondness. It is written well and was an easy read for a young scientist. I actually had the chance to re-read this book earlier this year and surprisingly I was still intellectually stimulated by it's content. Overall, the book is well written and would be appreciated by anybody who has at least a general interest in biology. I probably would recommend this to the average student who remembers bio class as \\"that tortuous hour three times a week\\" but I would suggest it to anyone interesting in or studying science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whimsical and entertaining","review":"Lewis Thomas' essays offer the creative and whimsical perspectives of a scientist. I doubt the non-biologist would appreciate these 'notes of a biology watcher' much, but as a biologist myself, I have to say that this is one of my favorite books for light reading.No, I don't get a great deal of new knowledge from reading Lives of a Cell, but he clearly looked at science and the world in ways that I wouldn't have thought of. I've caught myself chuckling at his wit with each and every essay - and there are quite a few in there - and I re-read them when the occasion arises (usually while passing the time during traveling).And so, in a phrase, I'd describe this book as 'light reading and wit for biologists.' If that's what you're looking for, it's a very good book indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For insomniacs only","review":"Can't sleep? Call Dr. Feldman!

For most people the love songs collection is far more even. these are the singles that launched the pop star, not the songs that made the superstar. but it is the only collection that tries to balance the artist and the emerging pop star. it succeeds opening with 'your song' and 'daniel' but fails with too many or the wrong 'yellow brick road'tracks, the lack of 'tumbleweed' or 'madman' tracks and one fault that couldn't be avoided...the inclusion of 'crocodile rock'. yes it introduced me to rock and roll, yes its a sweet homage to a bygone day, but its also thinner than the paper it was written on and ej's first #1. for the best of the early years one should find the album that is closest to thier hearts. though a string of classics that does not mean they belong together. rairaikandy@msn.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elton John","review":"This item was supposed to be Elton John's Greatest Hits...well, the CD case was Elton John, but the CD was ABBA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect example","review":"This album really puts Elton John's music and displays it for all to see.

All 10 tracks are great and truly capture Elton John's greatest hits of the 70's. I am only 16 years old and many of these songs were recorded way before I was born, but I still love the CD. There's nothing that I like to do more than go to my girls house put this CD on, smoke a blunt, and chill all night, while enjoying the great music this CD has to offer. Any music fan should get this essential CD. This CD truly reminds me of the Occidental lifestyle, and I love listening to it while I'm there.

I hope this review was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good, but a Mere Ten Songs Don't Do Him Justice","review":"Ten songs from Elton John's glory years up to 1974 are compiled on this hugely successful greatest hits disc. This is one of the most popular greatest hits CDs around, and who would be surprised? Say what you will about Elton's material of the 1980s or 1990s, the deal is this: he came up with some near-classic stuff in the 1970s. \\"Your Song\\" could very well be the ultimate love ballad: its power lies in its simplicity and the modest lyrics thanks to Bernie Taupin. \\"Daniel\\" and \\"Crocodile Rock\\" are also timeless as well.

There are so many heartwarming stories and sensitive definitions. You laugh, cry and realize that you have not been alone with your feelings"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"Many people favor gardening as a form of recreation; for others, the opportunity to commune with nature imparts to gardening an almost meditative character. For the author, a third dimension makes an even bigger impact in an unexpected series of visitations from his late, beloved mother, at times just seeking his companionship, and at others bearing specific messages from God to be more attentive to his family and form a closer bond with his father. This is a risky mix that might turn maudlin, or worse, in lesser skilled hands. Fortunately, Matott is more than up to the challenge, and the resulting portrait of his mother adroitly mixes amateur horticulture with personal memories in a \\"garden\\" made almost palpable by Victoria Kwasinski's lilting watercolor illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"I used an on-line recipe for making a graham cracker-like pie crust for the Atkin's lo carb peanut butter pie.

While her advice is sound enough, she almost uniformly fails to follow it herself. Her book doesn't follow the schemata, the grammatical rules, the proofing rules, or the design rules, that she sets out for others. The ultimate example of this was when, in the section on political correctness, she advises the reader to refrain from using perjorative or demeaning terms for \\"handicappeds.\\" \\"Handicapped\\" is itself considered perjorative and demeaning.

His Baroque conducting was praised too and it is no surprise those Russian modern composers would enjoy working with him. Sadly, He passed away in November 2003. I had the chance to play Schnittke's concerto for Piano and Strings in April 2003 in Omsk, his last concert. Although he was a frail man, his determination was unaltered as soon as he stepped on the podium.I would also recommend his recording of Schnittke's third violin concerto with Oleg Kagan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz is the best of his genre!","review":"I've read all of his books, even under other pen names. I have hardback cover and paperback... Dean Koontz is not like any other horror, thriller, suspense, and you lock your doors, even to your bedroom. *Midnight* is one that is different, yet like many of his stories, which the main fact I find, is that they're not like other horror writers of unrealistic ideas. He wrote about scientific matters before it was released to the public of these studies. So ... if you read one, don't be surprised if you find out that it is a true subject matter of scientific technolgy being tested and may not be made pubic to the world. One thing I heard him say on Larry King live,\\"There is nothing that can be put on film, more scary than the imagination of the human mind!\\" I completely concur!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I rate this as one of his best. Technology has it's consequences and Dean Koontz does a brilliant job of writting about it. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good but not his best","review":"I first read this when I was on my Koontz kick. (My Koontz kick started with Strangers, then progressed to Watchers and Lightning. Midnight was the 4th book I read of his, and I was a little disappointed with it as compared to the others. The other three did a much better job integrating horror and science fiction. In Midnight, the horror elements almost seemed like caricatures (loony/megalomaniacal scientist, nasty shapeshifting creatures, etc.). Still, the suspense was there (the scene with Chrissy in the closet was quite well done. And the dog, as always, was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not-so-bad but Not-too-good","review":"I wouldn't say that it's one of the best Koontz novel (even if there are many that claim so). It's just an avarage story with nothing special and nothing original. The caracters are excellent although and the suspense is real good (as in all of the Koontz's books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes he gets it, sometimes he doesn't","review":"Dean Koontz is a decent writer who falls short more times than not. Sometimes the suspense he delivers is powerful but lately I have been getting tired of his prose. It's as if the author himself is getting burnt out. You have to question an author who dishes out so many books. It takes the value out of the individual novels in my opinion. Midnight had a good premise but became unbearably boring in the middle and I almost didn't finish it. This book has many similarities with other of the author's books. Now if the similarities were interesting and fresh, than it would have been all the better. But they arent. They are boring and tiresome. One thing though that I did like about the book was that it had a positive message which is rare for the horror genre. Koontz has the potential to be a great writer but unfortunatly wears himself too thin. If you want to read fantastic, fresh, horror/fantasy, I recommend Dan Simmons, Robert E. Howard, and Ray Bradbury"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW I'm finished, and it ROCKED!","review":"I was the dude who wrote that I was almost done with it.

Still Midnight holds a special place amoung all his works.

The way he mix science with traditional \\"beast\\"-stories is absolutely genious!!! I have recommended this book to several of my friends who have never read a book before, and they could not put the book down after starting to read it!!!!!!!! Thank you Mr.Koontz!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a bang, ends with a fizzle....","review":"After reading the first 10 pages, I was immediately engrossed. Almost like beginning of the movie \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" (which stunk).

I can't think of the reasons why people can rate this book for more than one star. \\"Midnight\\" happened to be my first krontz book and I pomised muyself that it shall be the last. The plot is absolutely slow moving, draggy, boring, not a bit scary at all!!! It really pains me to finish the book and in the end I stopped reading it. The book did not capture and make me want to move on and find out what happened in the end. A total disaster!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Genetic Engeneering","review":"This book was recommended to me because of my intrest in genetics. Apparently Koontz learned his genetic engineering from \\"D-movies\\" (much worse than B-movies) of the '30s and '40s. He didn't learn it from any classroom, text book or journal articles. I was totally revolted by this book and its perversion of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book","review":"It is sooo bad. It goes from bad to worse, and then it gets really bad. I am not a person who will write reviews, but I wish someone had steered me clear of this one. Not only is the plot totally ridiculous, but the speed at which he tries to pace this thing makes it very difficult to feel anything for the characters. There was one chapter that was exactly 3 paragraphs long - that my friends is not a chapter. The crap famous writers get away with based on name recognition is unreal.Do yourself a favor and keep looking for something else to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is what first made me a fan!","review":"I have read most of Koontz book's, but this one is still my favorite!! The action is gripping, the emotion very real, the character portrayal flawless, and the storyline horrifying. It is along the same lines as his book Night Chills -- which I also recommend because it is even more believable than this one -- but carried much farther. If you read any of his books, read this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compeling characters and a horrifying plot.","review":"This book is a great book. Not only because of its characters, but because of its setting. It takes placce in a small town in Northern California called Moonlight Cove. Now the fact that it takes place in a small , in the middle of nowhere town is what makes it scary. The characters that Dean Koontz has made up are especially great, because the ages have a huge range. They go from a 12 year old girl to a 50 year old paralyzed man. In this little town citizens are changing. They are changing into their worst nightmare. Why, because of an amber liquid, and because of the Moonhawk Project. I think this book is great, although you have to have a lot of patience, because it is very detailed and long, but it doesn't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real nail-biter","review":"This has got to be one of his best novels, that is until he kicks out another one, he has so many really. It's a fast read, its spooky, and there's mystery and then it's just really scarey. Read it and you too will be a Koontz fan, thanks Dean. Where does he come up with this stuff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Narrator!","review":"Avoid at all costs buying the audio version of the novel. The narrator over pronounces the words as if he's speaking to a deaf mute trying to read his lips. Ever worse, he has no dramatic qualities to his voice. It's just comple monotone. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mister Roboto","review":"I love Koontz's story Midnight. I listend to the audiobook on cassette tape years ago on a trip across the country. It was rivetting.Over time I lost the tapes and years later I now wanted to hear it again. Excited, I received the Compact Disc version of Midnight as a gift.The narration is awful! It is like mister roboto is reading a book. I'm not even convinced the narrator isn't just a computer voice. If you've ever listened to the weather report at a rest-stop, that's what this entire reading sounds like. It's like Cher in that \\"Do you believe\\" song, with the voice crossing notes like a synthesizer.I tried it on various quality pieces of audio hardware and it always sounded the same, so it's certainly not a hardware issue, its just simply, as a few other reviewers pointed out, a really poor narrator and/or some very bad post processing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely silly, but entertaining","review":"Very silly, pretty much like everything that comes from under Mr. Koontz's pen (he must be moonlighting for the Weekly World News - his story ideas come straight from the tabloids).Yet, Koontz is a talented storyweaver, and despite laughing sometimes in inappropriate places, I was thoroughly involved and entertained by the twisting plot and rich descriptions.My only complaint plot-wise is that he introduced us to the bad guys a bit too quickly, eliminating all suspense from guessing as to who the creatures were. The opening is the best part of the book, by the way, and I knew I wouldn't put it down after an amber-eyed monster killed the jogger. Realizing the nature of the monsters so early in the beginning was a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and Angry","review":"I don't understand why this seems to be the only Dean Koontz book that is available for the Kindle only in the audio version, but not the written version. But then we are repeatedly warned not to purchase the audio version because the narrator does such a terrible job narrating. Are we being railroaded into buying the audiobook because it is the only option available to us? Is this the only way they can get back the cost they put into making an unlistenable audiobook? I very much want to purchase the written version for my Kindle, but even as Audiblle.com member I will not be forced into buying a bad audiobook simply because it is my only other option to get the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"This is probably one of my favorite Dean Koontz novels. I especially enjoyed the setting. It is a small town, though Koontz brings it to life, adding a lot of dark atmosphere. Some of the dialogue could use a more deft hand, but the plot is what captured me and kept me there. This is a good place to start if you have never read this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever written","review":"This is easily the best book Ive ever read. Add the best elements of every other Koontz book and you still wont match the intensity of Midnight. The element about the regressives choosing to regress in order to escape human tribulation is amazingly well executed. Absolutely masterful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, scary, engrossing read","review":"This was the first Koontz book I \\"read\\" -- actually I listened to it unabridged on cassette during my daily commute. As a reader of scary stuff since I cut my teeth on Ray Bradbury books and The Twilight Zone on tv, I consider myself a hard case when it comes to what frightens me, and this book frightened the HECK out of me. Thanks, Dean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a big fan of Dean Koontz' books, I was rather disappointed with this one. The story dragged, the characters were less than engaging,the theme was even less believable than his norm, and it took some effort to get through it. Dean Koontz is usually a very entertaining author, however, so don't let this book put you off reading his other works, which are typically riveting page-turners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read on sci-fi, horror, scary stuff","review":"Okay, I am for the most part a Dean Koontz fan, but that is not to say that I liked every one of his books. I didn't like Intensity and Odd Thomas. They were my least favorite DK books. Midnight, by far, is my favorite. It's very scary and I found myself up at 4am trying to finish the book. Very worth reading if you like that stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living on borrowed ideas","review":"This here's a retread of several other classic books, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I really loved Koontz' Odd Thomas and Forever Odd, and decided to explore his other novels, and found here, quite a stinker. The old adage of if you're going to do a remake, it had better be better than the original is a good standard to uphold, but the author does not apply it here. Although this novel is mildly diverting - why waste time on a weak remake? Also, I got to say the authors photo on the backs of most of his paperbacks is a rather annoying, self indulgent feature. I'd much rather see some information about the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but...","review":"Great concept but ended up disppointing in many ways.

Five men (James Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper, Joe Pantoliano, and Jeremy Sisto) wake up in an old warehouse, unaware of how they got there, who each other is, or even their own identities! We are kept in the dark right along w/ these men, only getting clues in small snipets of memory as they slowly piece things together. I fully enjoyed the mystery and the feeling of being trapped in the warehouse, trying to figure out what has happened, is happening, and will happen next. I love movies that keep me guessing and hold my interest. UNKNOWN definitely works well as a suspenseful puzzler, much in the way the first SAW and CUBE did. So, if you like psychological conundrums, you'll love this! Bridget Moynahan (Prey) and Peter Stormare (Fargo, 8mm) also star. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"This movie was really cool, not only because of it's terrific cast, but also for the way the story is done. At many points this film seems familiar, mainly because it has similar pieces to similar movies all put together into one original story. A group of people wake up locked in a warehouse with no memory of who they are or how they got there. Only one thing becomes immediately clear, if they don't discover the truth and how to escape, they'll all be dead soon. Its not the strongest story or ending, but the way this film was done was just pure genius.

The movie has a nightmarish quality and a few twists that are really surprising.Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Sisto, Bridget Moynahan, and Peter Stormare are the talented actors involved, and if you liked MEMENTO or USUAL SUSPECTS, you'll enjoy this dizzy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"fits my scout 2","review":"eplacing an old, leaky or missing gas cap will save as much as a gallon of gas every 15 days and can pay for itself in less than three months.

Remakes of classics such as The Thing, The Blob, The Fly, and the super-potent TCM remake, all succeeded with flying colors because they brought fresh ideas and technical expertise to classics that we all love. Not so here. This is no more of a Zombie movie than the horrid 28 Days Later. One thing horror should never be is a crashing bore. What is with all those MTV style quick cuts. You never really see anything, which is just as well, I guess. What you do see looks like hell thanks to the insipid computer effects. A total waste of time, except perhaps for the tiny cameos by Savini and Foree. I had to see it; it was posing as a zombie flick. It isn't one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplemente, es Romero!!","review":"Solo Romero es capaz de filmar un refrito de un clasico (tambien suyo) y lograr mucho mas que una actualizacion de una obra maestra del cine de terror. No creas que si ya viste la Dawn of the Dead original sabras todo el guion de esta, como ocurre normalmente con los refritos, en esta pelicula Romero reeplantea totalmente la estructura de la primera dandole un nuevo giro con mas personajes, mejores efectos y por supuesto... mas sangre.

This time the story doesn't attempt to convey any message at all and the actors have a California accent instead of a British accent. It has the fast intro followed by the slow, ocassionally interrupted, waiting scenes and then the ending. If you have seen 28 days later, then this movie is a waste of time. That is unless you wanted an extra couple hours of those slow, ocassionally interrupted, waiting scenes. If you go, stay seated when the movie ends!

I enjoyed the feeling of doom that characterized the whole film, the characters, and the biker scene. Sadly, the remake has none of those elements that made the original so enjoyable. In the original, you can actually sympathize with the four characters. In the remake, none of the characters are likeable. I hated all of them. They were just so lifeless. They were people that simply deserved to die. The attempts at humor were stupid and using tons of humor in a horror movie can only destroy any attempt to make it scary. Another thing, zombies aren't supposed to run. That destroys any tension that we get. If there's a whole army of zombies walking slowly towards you, that increases the fear. I would have to reccomend Land of the Dead over this. That one is not perfect either, but it was much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Galloping Cadavers","review":"Sue them, George!

By the end of it I was snarling. Dawn of the Dead was pure cheese from beginning to end, pure stinky cheese. I've been to family reunions that were more horrific.

Blood, zombies, and mass confusion build the tension quick.These deadish things don't stagger like in the original film. They sprint. They have acquired world-class speed. If you hesitate, you're going to get bitten. If you survive with that bite, well, you're pretty much a goner anyway.If you want gore, this one doesn't pull any punches. Why should it?

They could have at least updated the movie with new technology but no, the way the script was written, it could have been filmed in 1978. I was glad to hear that Ving Rhames was in this movie, until I watched it for myself. Suprisingly, Ving is downright DULL in this movie. The marathon racing zombies were terrible, they aren't even used to good effect. This movie is neither funny nor scary, and never decides which. The original was both. There are TOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY CHARACTERS that we never get a chance to get to know the ones that first enter the mall. the mall was not used for ANYTHING other than just being something stolen from the original. There could have been lots that the director could have made fun of to update the movie: video games, cell phones, the internet, rap music. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO!","review":"It's not enough that I have to hear \\"remixes\\" of classic rock on the radio. Now I have to put up with remakes of the great classic horror flicks! Let's have remakes of The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds while we're at it. How about Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, The Wizard of Oz, etc. How about All Quiet... Oh, that's right, they did that. Never mind. Beam me up Scotty. There's no intelligent life down here.P.S. This hasn't been released. I only put a rating down because I had to. Who knows? Maybe it will be good (and pigs can fly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One resonant note that rocks your eardrums loose","review":"This movie may as well be administered as a shot of pure adrenaline straight to the pineal gland.That doesn't make any sense, but you all know what I mean; this movie manages to dehumanize humanity yet retain affection for the damned. While none of the \\"protagonists\\" are worthy of sympathy, you have to respect their situation and empathize with them throughout their ordeal. Most of the stars are granted for action, the dialogue is predictable, but thankfully sparse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remake that actually bothers to add its own flavour","review":"The last remake of a classic horror film that i saw was the remake of Hitchcock's Psycho, and after that terrible, piece of garbage scene-for-scene remake, i was afraid of just how bad Snyder's Dawn of the Dead might be. But to my surprise, this film was competent in just about every area, and best of all it added its own flavour. This time around, the zombies are faster and Snyder removes the absurdist feel of Romero's original, along with all the humorous metaphors regarding capitalism. Snyder is a great director in this film-he makes it compelling, adds his own humorous touches and the cast are all above average. If I had one criticism of the film, it is perhaps of the end credits, where the film goes a little overboard, adding a rather grusome and silly epilogue to the story, told in almost subliminal flashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like the original, but a solid action flick","review":"That's how I'd characterize this entry in the zombie movie genre: it's not really a horror movie. It's a solid, thrilling action flick. With zombies. The one thing it does have (that most horror or action films sadly lack) is very believable, well-acted, sympathetic characters. The cast is superb, making you feel real affection for people trapped in an awful and fatal situation, so that you'll care what happens to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn Of The Dead","review":"Well I know that a lot of people are going to give this movie a bad rating just because its a Zombie movie, not really much of a storyline except that a virus spreads through the city and a certain group of people try to get out of it, lol pretty much the same for every zombie movie. But I usually just like to check out movies like this.Well action wise, this movie has a lot of it, a lot of shooting the acting is also good. So for that part of the movie youll find that. Pretty good amounts of gore, not ALOT but its alright. Shooting happens alot.Storyline, you wont find much of it here , its just that a virus spreads in the city and a group of people get together and fight it off and stick together anyway that they can. Just the typical type of movie that this is. So if your lookin for a regular horror type movie to watch this is it. I don't really recommend that you BUY this movie, but I think its worth the rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Flick","review":"I gottah be honest, but I didn't see any difference between the DVD version and the \\"uncut\\" director's version released on the DVD. Still, this movie is definitely one of the best Zombie flicks I've seen in years (right up there with Resident Evil, Part I). If you're a Zombie aficionado (like me), you'll definitely want to check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Different From the Original But Still Good","review":"The only thing the two movies have in common is that they spend some of the movie in a mall. With that being said, I still enjoyed the movie. Very gory, just the way I like my zombie movies. Tom Savini made a guest appearance in this movie as a cop! I was looking to see if he would be on here and he was.Overall the movie is pretty good, especially the end. Stay tuned during the end credits to see more of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"Originally I expected to have greater special effects, some better acting, but a few screw-ups. That and I thought it was going to be a real rip-off of 28 days later, but with some creative staff they prevented that problem. This is one of the few new \\"horror movies\\" that had any reaction out of me, but from other people I saw they were ready to fill their shorts. I liked the cameo from Tom Savini, the more in-depth approach to the zombies, and some good character development. This has enough to satisfy just about everyone, and will keep the die hard fans salivating for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This is one awesome movie. It's fun, funny, and VERY, VERY SCARY!!! I would highly recomend it to fans of George Romero's Original, and it's definetly worth owning when its out on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flick","review":"While thinking this movie might smell worse than zombies after baking in the sun all day I was presently surprised.

If the first movie was bad this is worst. Some moments this movie has good and interesting sequences, but there are moments you really wish to hold all the production team, and throw them to the lions. I didn't like when zombies started to run, and of course, the end. Who had the idea of that stupid end? Because we don't know what finally happens to the survivors. Wasted movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome remake","review":"nevermind negative reviews,Of course this isn't the classic Romero DOTD but I think it was done very well.If you want a good zombie movie with some gore check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn of the Dead still alive!","review":"One of the best zombie movies ever made remade to a modern day type atmosphere. From seeing the previews it looks basically the same as the old one which made it great. Hopefully it will be one of the best horror movies of 2004 along with Resident Evil : Apocalypse. Im definatly seeing it and you should too! Brains!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn of the Dead has died","review":"WOW this was a horrible movie. The original was a million times better. The overall zombie makeup was far too polished and Hollywood looking. Tom Savini should have done the makeup effects for this one. One of the main problems I had with this film was the fact that the zombies run. A zombie is a decaying bag of bones and flesh with nothing more than the most basic of instincts and that is to feed. Thus I thought that zombies wouldn't be able to run, and should throw away their track shoes. George A. Romero was nipped out of a good 4 seconds of his name being in the beginning sequence as compared to everyone else even remotely involved in this film (if you can call it that). The acting was at least halfway descent but still getting a bit on the cheesy side of things. So I give this release a rating of 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"They put Paris Hilton in the credits!","review":"The movie was OK. But the neatest thing was that at 1:48:12 on the dvd during the credits there is (what seems to be) a 4 second clip from the Paris Hilton sex tape! Bizarre."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say, I'm A Sucker For Zombie Movies =)","review":"I could not wait to see Dawn of the Dead!!!! I absolutely adore zombie flicks, so this was a treat for me. Ever since I saw it in the theaters I have been eagerly anticipating the release of the DVD.I thought the movie was excellent! Was it oscar worthy? No, but for pure entertainment it was outstanding!!!If you love horror flicks and you do not have a weak stomach this is the movie for you!!! The actors' performances were right on, believable fear, anguish, and frustration.Honestly, one of the best zombie movies I have seen (this includes 28 Days Later,Resident Evil, and Resident Evil 2)Definitely a winner in the horror - zombie genre of movies!!!Enjoy!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is crap","review":"IT,s criminal how bad this movie is ,he world ends in about 10 mins of screen time , there after we are forced to endure 1 hour 30 mins of various idiots trying to get themselves eaten by the zombies.the (....) If you stay for the end of this moronic epic ,your reward is to see the potagonists eaten at the impotent conclusion of the movie.So i have to give this crap 1 star but it gets 5 yawns, my advise avoid it like the plague! and watch the excellantoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal with a capital \\"A\\"","review":"I really did want to like this film. I was excited about its release and I couldn't wait to see it! Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed I almost demanded a refund!I didn't feel for the characters and the zombies were amusing if not outright laughable! The audience laughed out loud 5 times during this film. Having people laughing in a horror film is a major indication of something seriously wrong with the film.The film is a satirical rendition of the original at best! It outrageously lacks depth, character development, gripping music/sound effect, convincing dialogue and horrifying zombies among other things. Such a letdown!I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone. It's a waste of time, money and brain cells that have to endure processing such travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I didn't like this movie, first it wasn't even scary at all. It was too predictable and felt almost like a gory hollywood B movie to me. The director seemed to be facinated w/ slow motion gun scenes w/ casings hitting the floor and stupid hollywood humor w/ killing the \\"dead\\" Jay Leno & Burt Reynolds. Maybe instead of wasting tons of time in makeup w/ the \\"dead\\" ppl they should've spent more time on the plot. Luckily, it was only a rental"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give It a Chance","review":"I'm one of the biggest fan of the original. I've seen it over 50 times and owner 5 copies of the original DOTD movie on dvd/vhs. Jamie Gunn's screenplay has been tweaked, Tom Savini will be in it as a cameo, and the new trailer looks to be a high quality horror film so far. Granted, it's not going to be as good as the original. But if nothing else it will draw attention back to the original old one (i.e. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Also, Anchor Bay plans a new dvd of the original DOTD with tons of extras and a news transfer around the time of the remakes release. There has even been talk cameos by \\"Peter\\" and \\"Roger\\" from the first movie. Stay tuned, and don't judge it until you see it. It's a win win for Dead fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the Dead films!!!","review":"As a fan of the original Dawn of the dead; I feel that the director and writer did a great job in staying true to the original. The entire idea of zombies that feed on human flesh is an excellent way to stir up apocalyptic thoughts. After all it is as Romero himself says, \\"One generation rising up to devour the previous one.\\" In the end we just can not escape evolution. This was modernized quite well, and I think that the new \\"fast zombies\\" bring true meaning to the word horror! I can still remember my reaction to this version the first time I watched it. I was quite shocked at some of the upgrades from the original. Anyone who loves zombie flicks will love this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only blood isn't enough....","review":"When I started watching this movie I was expecting some great biting, flesheating and shocking scenes. The beginning was ok, with the young girl biting a shunk out of her fathers neck. The rest is only shooting some of those zombies in the head. I was waiting for gruelling bites, ripping off flesh, pure gore, but nothing came. They keep shooting them in the head, nothing more and I was getting pretty bored. Even the actors were looking bored instead of afraid. There were never any moments of true fear, no excitement. Good for once, but I think I'll just keep watching the Romero version or Resident Evil again."},{"rating":"2","title":"How dare they....","review":"How dare someone attempt to remake such a classic as George Romero's Dawn of the Dead? The original was one of the pinnacles of horror classics. I assumed this remake was going to be a tragic mistake like Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho. That thinking changed about 10 minutes into this new version. WOW! These new zombies are faster and hungrier. This new version pays respectful homage to the classic while updating the original with a faster pace, interesting characters, and more graphic gore. If you are a horror fan (or a fan of the original), BUY IT. You won't be disappointed.Interesting trivia for flesh eating Zombie movie fans: While you watch the movie, notice one of the stores inside the mall is named \\"Gaylen Ross\\". Is there anything significant about this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"This has to be on my top ten zombie movies.

While not as epic as the original, definitely a well made \\"re-invisioning\\" of Dawn Of The Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for a remake","review":"Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the dead proves he is a good director. I was impressed with the effort put into the special effects. I was disappointed by the fact that they did not stick more to George Romero's original plot. There were major differences and more character's seeking refuge in the mall. A select few of the character's were rather annoying and a few of the actors performance's could of been better. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber gave the better performance's in this film. Their plans to go to an island on Steve's boat go awry and the ending is very vague. My thought is the ending was left that way in case they want to do a sequel in the future. Overall it is not the director's fault the script was lacking a bit. This film would of been much better with a few script changes and a few of the character's being eliminanted. But sill it is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU ALLREADY REUINED METROPOLIS!","review":"WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE SO GOOD IS THAT THE ZOMBIES CAN CHASE YOU, INSTEAD OF WALK AROUND SLOW LIKE SOME SENIOR CITIZENS!

But what I will tell you is that this release on Blu ray for the price you are paying you would have thought they could have included the extras from the DVD version. I wouldn't expect them to be in HD format but at least add them on??? There is no \\"Andy's Lost Tape\\" None of the making or Emergency broadcast extras. They have just slapped it on Blu ray for the sake of the movie. Not good for a collector at all make sure to keep your DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to perfect!","review":"Dawn of the Dead is one of the best movies I've seen in the last three years. As a fan of the original, I was skeptical of how a remake would work, especially after being burned by the DREADFUL remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.I eagerly awaited the release of the DVD and, as far as the movie is concerned, I was not disappointed in the least. The only thing that makes this a little less than perfect is the woefully atrocious acting in the extras. I was really looking forward to the \\"News Footage\\" segement. Not very good. Sadly, Andy's last days were not very well done either.As for the extra footage in the movie itself, I was highly appreciative of the revelation of how they got into the mall. The extra characterization was fantastic. I wonder why they left it out!The special effects extras are a great narrative by the artist.I love this movie. So happy to have a great DVD of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a new zombie movie","review":"All I can say about this movie is that it was much better than house of the dead.

I personally jumped a couple of times but laughed a whole lot more. I hadn't seen this at the theatre so, I very much enjoyed this movie. having grown up when slasher films were making big bucks, I couldn't resist. the movie itself was well done. it surprised me, it being a \\"zombie flick\\" after all. I would definitly suggest this movie to all movie goers. after everything was said and done, I laughed myself to sleep watching my son twitch and moan out \\"No, they're gonna get me!...\\" then earlier today we watched again, at his request..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, well made zombie flick","review":"I don't care for most horror films except for a few from the 1930's and 40's. Most horror films today are little more than slice and dice butchery videos. This one is well made, fast paced, suspenseful, and scary. It rises far above the genre because of good acting and directing. It is still little more than a zombie flick - but one that shows craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a half at best","review":"The movie was fun and had lots of gore but little else.

It came up with the fast zombies and handled it very well. This movie totally rips that off and many other things at that. The pregnant zombie mom was ripped directly from Dead Alive, the editing was copied also from 28 days later. And what the f**k is up with these MTV music video directors being hired to direct all these crappy remakes of great classics? It's bulls**t. As a matter of fact, after watching this, I am through with remakes. F**k em. Saw the Psycho remake, damn it was boring. Saw the Night of the Living Dead remake, Barney compared to the b/w one, the ending to the original scared the hell out of me, where the f**k is it? saw the Texas Chainsaw remake, the most boring, long, and drawn out pile of wasted exposed film stock EVER, and now this. F**k remakes, they suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET REAL! ZOMBIES CAN'T RUN!","review":"GET REAL, ZOMBIES CAN'T RUN-THEY'RE DEAD! (of course, we're talking fantasy here, anyway!) I still say the original 1978 version of Dawn reigns supreme.think about it, when you wake up from a nap, or from 7 or 8 hours sleep, can you run or move fast?of course not! so why do the bozos who made this movie want people to think that walking dead people can run fast? SHEESH!If you want the Real Deal of the Zombie movie genre, watch the 1978 version of Dawn....now THAT'S the way zombies should be!

WITH A BAD ENDING AT THAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: This is ridiculous.","review":"\\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is about some people that set up in a mall and shoot some zombies in order to stay alive. The acting is pretty terrible and the plot is stupid. If you like watching people shoot flesh-eating zombies with a lot of blood and gore, this is for you. But, other than that, there is simply nothing to this movie...this is just not enough to keep my interest.

They totally changed it from the original...for instence the movie starts off as there being no zombies where as in the original this carnage has been happening. Being a re-make and a sequal at that should reflect the orginals and not go for cheap scares. AND SINCE WHEN CAN PEOPLE WHO DIE AND COME BACK TO LIFE RUN! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT! This movie sucks. DONT BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better if named \\"28 days ago\\"","review":"After viewing this film, I thought I was watching 28 days later again. This was a fun film, but to the throw the dawn of the dead name on it was just totally not the best idea. Once again we had super fast quick shots, and it didnt show anything. You dont even see a zombie eat somebody. I guess hollywood couldnt afford the 2 second shot of that, and needed something fast.The movie lacked the great things that made the original so great. The indepth story, the character buildup, Goblins doing the soundtrack etc...Again, i think it was a good movie, but my best suggestion is dont go into the theater thinking that this is anywhere even related to the original. I mean they stay in the mall for what 7 days which equals what, a half hour of screen time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied customer","review":"the ad for this dvd did not state that a HD dvd player was required to view it and I have been getting a major run around with Amazon.com trying to obtain a satisfactory resolution.

The only thing cool about this movie was the fact that the zonbies race full tilt after the living and some of the bonus features were really something to watch.Especially the addition of Bruce Boxleitner and Richard Biggs (from Babylon 5) were the only highlights of this DVD.

I am tired of untalented producers and directors ripping off the classic movies and remaking them. Why cant you guys come up with your own ideas? Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror movies of all time, and it will now probably be tarnished by this soon to be piece-o-crap. I usually would never say anything about a movie before I saw it, but I am just getting tired of my favorite movies being remade so horribly. Why would you hire the writer of Scooby Do to write Dawn of the Dead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great film!","review":"I have never seen the original Romero films, so I really had no basis of comparison. However, I do like a good horror flick. Unfortunately, the good ones are few and far between. This is one of the good ones.There are some things about it that make it slightly different from other horror films. The most prominant is that the movie only ends once. You know how most horror films have about 5 endings, and sometimes it just gets really old? This one ends once, and you are left thinking, \\"That was a really good way to end this film,\\" very satisfying. However, if you keep watching through the ending credits, you see how the story *really* ends. The way the director weaves in the ending of the story is very clever, IMHO.The soundtrack was really good, as well. The jazz version of Disturbed's \\"Down with the Sickness\\" is priceless. There are some really humourous moments in the film, as well, if you like dark humour.I highly recommend this film. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best zombie movie in a while!","review":"Dawn of the Dead is very reminescent of classic zombie movies and is very entertaining.

Very funny, very grim, very good. Aliens meets Dawn of the Dead (Original). This one is now my favorite zombie flick of all time followed closely by the original.Are there unrealistic decisions made? Thankfully, just a few mild ones. There is enough character development to make you care - I even grew to like the chief security guy in the end. Not a lot of social commentary which is a plus. Can't wait for the DVD so I can see the entire flick. There was one transition in particular where it looks like they cut out a couple of minutes to reduce the run time - it's noticeable but things are happening so fast you don't have time to dwell on it.The more I think about this flick the more I like it. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit the snooze alarm on this Dawn","review":"Not scary, not original, tired dialogue, special effects not special, I only jumped once.

I'm glad they didn't go for the PG-13 horror that seems to prevail these days. The unrated version is even better, leaving in some of the more gruesome killings. While it is titled the same as the classic Romero picture, it is more of a homage to the man. Aside from taking place mostly in a mall, the film has all new characters and plots. Also, the zombies are not the plodding Romero dead, these creatures can move fast. Some people don't care for it, but I found the movie was very effective with the running zombies. This is worth having in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Entertaining if you like Zombie films","review":"Dawn of the dead stars a nurse whose boyfriend comes down with a strange disease which turns him into a flesh-eating zombie. Things get worse as she realizes the entire city is infected. Teaming up with a gang of misfits and a terse police officer, the group hide in a mall, until tempers flare.Ultimately, the group decides to try to make a 'run for it' for a nearby boatyard. Can the group make it in time?I enjoyed the team dynamics of this film. I thought there was some great acting and the special effects were overall were great. The plot is basically 'us against them' with an added dash of a timelock. My only disappointment? I really wanted to know what happened in the end!Great, fast moving, gory fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the movie","review":"So I loved the movie, mostly because I love zombie movies.

The topper was the opening and closing credits-dont leave untill you see the closing credits in full.

You could not get interested in the characters as most of them were morons. Case in point, the girl risking everones lives for a dog,don't get me wrong, i'm a dog lover but with thousands of zombies outside and these zombies could move alot quicker then in the original. Give me a break. My view is to pass on this poor attempt of a remake. You want to see something fun and gory and people you can root for then buy the original version and in my opinion you wont be disappointed.I hear The Hills Have Eyes is going to be remade so lets hope they don't screw up that great classic as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remake to a horror classic","review":"While some reviewers will complain that the zombies in this \\"reinvisioned\\" version of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" resemble the zombies from \\"28 Days Later\\", they are scarier and more realistic looking than that film. The new \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" does not have the satire of that the original possessed, but it does contain the same warped and twisted sense of humor.

In the original, the whole \\"mall\\" plot was much stronger and felt more realistic, they lived there, but in this movie, it was \\"all work and no play\\"...which made it a little different, but still better.Since we now have a stronger/more strict MPAA, the brutality from the original is not here, but the gore is still abundant and we get lots of graphic violence, so its not as though all the violence had been cut. But here the violence is more often I think, since its rated R for \\"pervasive violence and gore\\" there are a lot more scenes with violence.And of course, there is more sexual content in this movie, since that is what attracts audience so much now - a - days...so we do see several breasts and a sex scene...Other than those critisims this movie is a pretty good movie, that is at least worth one viewing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbing down.","review":"The original Dawn of the Dead is witty, atmospheric, and (like most of Romero's films) subverts conventions in a thought provoking manner. It laces horror and bleak observations with anarchic fun.This re-make is remarkable only in that it manages to suck all of the intelligence and humour out of the original.

Ving Rhames is believable as a gruff cop and Mekhi Pfifer is good as a father who has to deliver his own baby under unusual circumstances.This film manages to be both creepy and action packed in equal measures and is a worthy addition to the Zombie genre.

Obviously no remake, however well done, can surpass George Romero's masterpiece, but this one definitely comes within shouting distance. And given some of the awful remakes we've seen in movie theaters lately (e.g., House on Haunted Hill), that's really saying something. I especially enjoyed the opening credits with the Johnny Cash song. Great. And Ving Rames was very good as the brooding police officer. Some of the characters, as noted in other reviews, were far too stereotypical. E.g., the loudmouthed yuppie (boy was I glad to see him get blown away) and the vivacious blond, to name only two, but that didn't detract too much from the film. Overall, a very good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armageddon in Wisconsin . . .","review":"You can see that this is a different take of Romero's undead universe. The zombies are similar to the ones in Return of the Living Dead, except that the intelligence and spoken words are taken out of context. The scares, despite having more obvious shock effects, do have the same effect as Land of the Dead and the original Dawn of the Dead. It may not have the same cult following as the original, but it is indeed way creepier. It's yet another classic in the zombies genre.Grade: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"They move too fast!","review":"I liked the trilogy.The remake of DOTD was certainly more realistic than the original.This one takes it self much more seriously.The ending was a shock to say the least,but it makes you wonder,and maybe that was the point.My only objection was the motor capabilities of these DEAD folks.My God they run faster than most 18 year olds.It certainly doesn't give you much hope for the human race.They also seem to be able to reason somewhat,(the episode on the stair case)and that can't be good.

Sorry to all those Romero aficionados, but I have to say it is. Okay, Romero's genius provided the idea without which this couldn't have been made, but this far surpasses his movie in most areas. The standard of acting is higher. The script is tighter. The action is way, way more exciting. The special effects are superb (but then, that's to be expected with today's technology). But on top of that, the dialogue is much sharper, with some really cool, almost throwaway, lines - like the exhange in the stairwell between Micheal and Ken regarding Michael's expertise with a gun. Plus, the characters are much better realised - you don't care about all of them, but you do care about the few that really matter.I don't usually like remakes - they rarely deliver and usually only succeed in watering down the original - but this is the exception to the rule.

This film borrows the \\"fast zombie\\" concept from the aforementioned one, but utilizes none of the stark images or philosophical commentary. Aside from zombies in the mall--blah. There was nothing surprising here, when thinking of other movies I've seen.Comparisons aside, and more importantly, if you agree that a movie is about characters and dialogue--or even just original and imaginative situations--this film does not deliver.

The young security guard and the girl who liked the dog seem to have become an item at one point, but God knows when. Editing is frustrating and counterproductive. There was a particularly odd jump cut when they left the gun shop.Ultimately, George Romero just had that indefinable auteur ability to give his original an inner life.

The beats are harder driving, the guitars harsher, and Joe Elliott just sounds a lot more raw. This CD was their first effort with Mutt Lange (the producer that oversaw all their top CDs) and you could see the growing pains on this one. This CD even more than On Through The Night shows the potential that this group had, and how close they were to breaking through to top the charts. If your Def Leppard collection starts with Pyromania, you NEED this CD. It's probably their best work, and that's not just because it has less of a pop feeling than their later work. This album rocks from top to bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Lep before all the \\"-IA\\" albums","review":"Before PYROMANIA, HYSTERIA, and EUPHORIA there was HIGH N DRY, their 2nd album from 1981.

If you only know the band by their \\"hit\\" CDs, then this CD will not sound like the same band to you. I like the other albums but this one is without a doubt, their most rockin'. Songs like \\"Another Hit And Run\\", \\"You Got Me Runnin'\\" and \\"Let It Go\\" are up tempo guitar heavy tracks and \\"Switch 625\\" is a very cool short instrumental. The band tried another instrumental years later on the \\"Euphoria\\" CD but it wasn't that good to be honest. A must buy for any Def Lep fan old and new. A NWOBHM(new wave of british heavy metal) classic. Also check out \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" by Judas Priest and \\"Killers\\" by Iron Maiden.

This, to some credit, is based on their hits, which do have this tendency. But this album, containing only one such hit, is miles away from what I expected it to be. Rather than the overly pop-oriented rock you hear on the radio, what I found was a mix of the Def Leppard I knew and thoroughly un-pop hard rock bands, like AC/DC. As such, the album is a complete surprise and one I recommend to any that are familiar with Def Leppard only from their radio play and music videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"near masterpiece\\" from Def Leppard that ROCKS","review":"Def Leppard's High N Dry gets 4 stars from me because in comparison to Pyromania, it just falls a hair shy of brilliance. If Def Leppard never recorded Pyromania and went straight to Hysteria, then High N Dry would be their best album by far. This one rocks harder than any that followed it, yet still has the guitar hooks and stellar vocals that propelled Def Lep to Hall of Fame-worthy status.

This album is rock solid and contains other classics like Mirror Mirror (hypnotizing), Lady Strange (cool solo), Switch 625 (builds nicely), and Hit and Run.

When my order arrived it was a box full of the BLUE sponges that are the new, cheap, non-absorbant sponges that really wet your floor when mopping rather than absorb the spilled liquid. These are terrible. Don't buy them. When you dunk the mop into a bucket of water to rinse the sponge out, the sponge never really squeezes out the excess water. Rather, you commence mopping the floor and find that you are soaking the floor with the bucket water which leaves lots of water streaks on the floor. This is absolutely terrible. Buy the YELLOW sponges (if you can find them) or don't use the QUICKIE mop at all. These \\"new and improved\\" sponges are cheap and they DO NOT WORK. Amazon has the yellow sponges advertised, but they send the blue ones. I am so upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as pictured","review":"I bought this because in the picture it is yellow.

I recently had to buy an entire new mop after the pole rusted out - hey, it was old. After a couple of months of light use, the sponge separated from the plastic backing. Quickie replaced the head. Happened again. Once is an accident - twice is a bad habit. I'm off to buy a different brand - metal, American made."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought a Quickie mop recently to use in my apartment. Nothing challenging - small apartment, hardwood floors. It was a few dollars more than I'd expected, but hey, it came with an extra sponge head. After three or four not-very-strenuous uses the sponge separated from its plastic backing. The replacement sponge didn't even last that long.What a rip-off - avoid these like the plague unless you like throwing your money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickie Original Standard Sponge Mop Refill","review":"Quickie Mfg. Corp. and Amazon should be shamed for selling this product. As a previous reviewer has said, the refill does not fit the Quickie Original Standard Sponge Mop. $6.49 thrown in the trash! While we did not get the chance to actually use the sponge refill, since it won't stay on the mop, the refill clearly is not the quality of sponge that comes originally on the mop. By the way, this refill is not made in China, either, but in the good old USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joyva, you gave me no joy...","review":"They were stale. They are not returnable.

That made me sad when I first picked it up, but that sadness soon disappeared and was replaced by this wonderful tribute to Steve's memory. The opening song \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" is not only great, but very funny as well. I also love the ballad \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\" and the sexy \\"Make Love Like a Man.\\" It was on this tour that I saw Def Leppard for the first time (with the very excellent Vivian Campbell), and I had the opportunity to hear all of these songs live. I can tell you, the live Leppard is great, but if you can't see them live, then at least do yourself a favor and pick up this album! It's worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have released Retro Active instead","review":"Def Leppard should have released the rariteis album Retro Active and used these filler songs for the b sides. This album is weak. The only reason i give it two stars is for the only two songs on the disk that are not filler. Those songs would be 'White Lightning' and 'Tear It Down'. This album did well but it was just a poor attempt to recreate 'Hysteria'. Pick up Retro Active instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"If there's any fan of DefLep from the \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Pyromania\\" who likes this album, please step forward and seek medical attention. I suppose if you came to DefLep at \\"Hysteria\\" you might think this is more along those lines, and a good album -- but even then, I don't see it ... since Hysteria was still actually pretty solid, and this is, for the most part, purely awful, Michael Bolton material. Let's Got Rocked is a pretty good tune, and it goes downhill from there.The ballads that are in here helped DefLep stay on the charts, but compare in no way to \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak\\" or even the likes of the song \\"Hysteria\\" itself. They are embarassing.DefLep came back to redeem themselves with some real cool tracks on later albums - which I wasn't sure was possible. But this is the only DefLep album I do not own."},{"rating":"1","title":"a letdown again","review":"this remaster is completely unnecessary, sounding no different than the original. however, it does collect a few good b-sides together (the Tonight demo being most interesting).However, not even all of the adrenalize-era b-sides appear here, so it fails to even fulfill that simple role correctly!this record was a disappointment in 1991 and is a disappointment again today. :(my advice would be to skip this remaster, and wait for the inevitable b-sides collection that will come out someday (perhaps on the band's 40th anniversary...?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning of the end for Def Lepp","review":"I remember full well when this CD came in 92 the year of grunge of course it went in at #1 in the charts everywhere. With a handful of tunes written/co-written by the great late Steve \\"steamin\\" Clark I thought this'll be all right well I was wrong for the most part sugary sweet sappy ballads (well this is the same DL we've had ever since this album). These guys no longer rock I really tried to like the 99 release Euphoria but alas Viv is really no replacement for Steve. You'd think given Vivien Cambell's past Def Leppard would ROCK AND ROLL. I know that Phil Collen was playing all the guitar parts by himself on this album the band should have gotten a tempory replacement in the studio at least (to play Steve's parts). Well at least their are 4 master pieces of work from these guys prior to Adrenalize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Adrenalize is Def Leppard's worst album in their catalogue for sure. There isnt anything more i can add that hasnt been said already i dont think there is any doubt that White Lightning is the best song on the album. The other decent song is called Tonight it looks to me like Def Leppard tried to make an album so similar to Hysteria except for the fact that this album is weak Steve Clarke passed away in early jan,1991 and what a huge loss he was such a great guitarist. This album lacks power, passion and its way to ballad heavy too poppy. Lets Get Rocked has to be the worst song in Def Leppard's catalogue i know its nice to gave guilty pleasure songs but that song is just god awful. Go back and listen to High N Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria to hear good Def Leppard but please avoid this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Get Rocked!","review":"This might not be there best CD, but it does have a few good song by them. Their most famous songs from this album are: \\"Let's Get Rocked,\\" \\"Heaven Is\\" and \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad.\\" The linear notes have some good things in it, for example: there is a paragraph of when they recorded this album and pictures of the four at the time. Overall this is a great CD with a great selection of songs too. I would recommend this to any Def Leppard fan who doesn't have this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrenalize","review":"I've been a Def Lep fan since I was a kid, and their music has had an influence over a lot of musicians...This was their first album that was released after the death of Steve Clark, although most of it was written while he was still alive. It's as sweet as sugar (pardon the pun)and all 10 tracks have a great feel...the album still put out quite a few singles. Highlights are \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\" and \\"White Lightning\\". The guitar work of Phill Collen was incredibly impressive as he handled all of the guitar duties. If you listen closely you can always hear about three or four guitars doing different parts in the songs. Although not as successful as Pyromania or Hysteria, Adrenalize belongs in any rock collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good progression....","review":"I think this is a good progression for Def Leppard. I own Pyromania, Hysteria, The Vault, X, and I think this album is Def Leppard changing with the times. It has a clean sound and, as always, amazing vocals and instrumental. Over all, not a bad listen.You can't sell 80's music in the 90's...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best, But Better Than Anyone Else","review":"This album falls short of their new one, \\"Euphoria\\" or the previous ones like Hysteria...I even like the B-sides on Retroactive more, BUT this album still kicks and is worth the bucks. This IS Def Leppard afterall...no one does it better. And this album has sold 5 million copies. The best tracks are: Let's Get Rocked, Heaven Is, Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion), and White Lightning."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sample of Def Leppards never ending quality","review":"Def Leppard is one of those rare groups that you can listen to all day and night and never get tired of listening. Adrenalize is no exception to that!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Leppard Delivers Once Again","review":"In this day and age it is hard to find a group that never loses touch with that old 80's style of rock. Def Leppard is quite simply the best rock band around and their album Adrenalize is no different. There are a few songs that I tend to skip over but for the most part I love this cd. Personally, I think I Wanna Touch U is the best song on the album, but Let's Get Rocked is a close second. The ballad Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad is also great. The whole cd is filled with energy and is a must for a Leppard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADRENALIZE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Who would have thought that these guys could overcome tragedy twice?!?!?I really admire them for overcoming both tragedies the way they did(Rick Allen losing his arm and the death of Steve Clarke).And what better way to show it than to come out with an album that rocks!!! This album is the best,and is worth the bucks.I'm telling you,it is not a waste at all!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not taking any chances","review":"I watched the VH1 special \\"Ultimate albums\\" on pyromania a little while ago. In the interviews they talk about how music in 1983 was stale and people were looking for something new. Def Leppard took a chance with Pyromania and it paid off big time. When it came time to record their next album, they took their music in another direction with Hysteria. In the making of Hysteria special, they talk about how everyone was still remaking pyromania, and when Hysteria came out it was a shot in the arm. Taking a chance once again paid off for Leppard. That's the problem with Adrenalize. They remade their previous album and didn't try anything new. Music in 93 was changing and Def Leppard put out the same album they did in 1987. Maybe if they would have made a heavier album like Retro Active. Re-record some of those songs and making a rockin' album. Who knows. Adrenalize is just a cheesier, less good version of Hysteria, produced not to change music, but to make some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"just like the greats like Elvis, Jerry Lee and the rest, this can be listened to in any generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio-friendly garbage","review":"Def Leppard attempt to return to their 1980's-era glory with 'Adrenalize'. It's full of weak pop melodies and sappy MTV lyrics. Definitely not a rocker in the likes of 'On Through The Night', or even 'Pyromania'. I recommend you skip this one in favor of when Def Lep were lean, mean, and true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poor black metal project","review":"When I heard about a new Dimmu Borgir members project I thought to myself: \\"Wow! It would be great! They will never play bad Black Metal.\\" As soon as I purchased it I was really disappointed. It sounds like Astennu and Nagash never wrote music for Dimmu Borgir albums. CT is nothing else like another plain Black Metal band that plays boring music without melody and atmospheric influence. It's no use listening to this album. Astennu had better concentrate on Dimmu Borgir than making his own unsuccessful projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The series was awesome, but the CD? It really could have done with at least something from the series soundtrack, like even the original start and end themes are absent from the cd. The sketches are a bit of fun, the sound quality is excellent, apart from the sound clips of the General which really could have been better.It's be great if they would release an album with background music from the series, so you can pop it in your car fire up the V8 and go blasting down some dirt roads screaming \\"Yee-haaa\\" out the window!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' stand-in songs","review":"Would've given 5 if the ORIGINAL music from the show was included as well. Talkin' about the original \\"Good ol' Boys\\" theme, maybe the Waylon version single, end title, and incidental action music during the show, especially during chases. What we all have here is nice, very nice, a fine selection, but the running time (around 40 minutes) leaves plenty of room for more chitlins and polk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got mine autographed by Catherine Bach!","review":"This is not a soundtrack to The Dukes of Hazzard, but rather an album with songs sung by cast members. Most of the actors can't sing, although John Schneider and Tom Wopat have decent voices. One of the most disappointing things about this CD is that the Dukes of Hazzard theme song is not performed by original artist Waylon Jennings, but is instead by the generic \\"Hazzard County Boys\\". Other than that, the rest of the album is pretty bad. \\"The General Lee\\" is one of the worst songs ever recorded by the great Johnny Cash, sung from the point of view of the Duke Boys' car. There is a terrible cover version of The Band's classic \\"Up On Cripple Creek\\", sung by Tom Wopat. The rest of the songs are all originals, and none of them are any good. This album will only appeal to hardcore Dukes of Hazzard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little information","review":"The book gives little to no information per page.

Just take a visit to UMass Lowell and see the impact this book has caused on its students.Textually, I have reason to believe Mr. Moylan intended the 3-paged first draft as a children's book, then discovered a thesaurus while using the book as a counterweight to his pompous ego.

So if you are serious about being able to produce something worthwhile this book is a good read.

The style of writing is not the easiest to digest, but if you devote some time to it and carry out the exercises provided inside on a consistent basis you WILL benefit from it.

It is intelligent, comprehensive, very original and completely relevant in any and every recording situation.

Es desde luego menos ingenuo y se ha vuelto huraño, poco sociable. Quién haya leído El angel caído sabrá porque.Como en la primera novela, esta segunda se caracteriza por su fácil y gozble lectura. Los capítulos son breves directos y nunca desprovistos de humor. Así, el Gambito turco es una excelente novela de detectives. Muy recomendable.

You will not be disappointed with this release, it just keeps getting better with every listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best storytellers of our time","review":"I've read most of Wolff's work, and this is my favorite. The collection spans the colorful spectrum of human emotion and experience, yet there remains a pleasant aftertaste of familiarity in his characters that makes us identify with that life on the page.Whether it's a tubby object of scorn, a disillusioned old man on his 50th anniversary cruise, or a young boy spinning tales for acceptance on a broken-down bus, we feel some sliver of our psyche being worked to the surface when reading these stories by Wolff. He's one of the best storytellers of our generation, and you deserve to discover him. Favorite stories in this collection: Smokers, The Liar, Maiden Voyage, Hunters in the Snow and In the Garden of North American Martyrs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Characterizations that resonate","review":"The characters in Tobias Wolff's short stories are typically ordinary people in relatively ordinary circumstances yet he creates through them such vivd glimpses of humanity that we recognize our friends ,relatives,neighbors and ourselves in them.Powerful writing that is subtle and yet somehow unforgettable.All of his short fiction collections are equally enjoyable and I would have a hard time recommending one as opposed to any other.

The essays are not divided up as units; instead, the book is divided into what it calls sections which seem to cut up the material with no particular organizational principle. The titles of the chapters are not even included. And lastly, the footnotes are crammed amidst the text so that it is nearly impossible sometimes to distinguish that they are footnotes.

Using the theory of memetics (idea viruses), spiral describes the evolution of humans as a progression from one value system to another along a double helix spiral. Pitched to those in management or leadership, Spiral Dynamics offers insights as to why some people need traditional or hierarchical or ordered or opportunistic or caring or project based workplaces depending on their value meme. The text can be stilted and academic at times and the introduction is confusing, however there are some great insights and well worth reading if you are interested in finding the answers to everything!

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!Only buy the MP3 version if you want to be reminded first hand why LP records were replaced by CDs...This has to be the ABSOLUTE WORST quality music I have ever purchased from Amazon... The sound is muddy, but at least you get all the pops, clicks, and noise from a scratched LP album, just like the old days..... It sounds like someone held a microphone in front of the speaker to \\"record\\" this album... I cannot believe Amazon would sell something this flawed.If I could rate this MINUS 5 stars I would..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This was a disapointing CD. The song selection was not that good. Original and not often recorded Christmas songs are rare, but they need to be good, these were not. The songs just seemed to droan on and on. None of the snap these guys are known for. The second problem is the way it was recorded. While I am no big fan of Mega Bass Surround sound, this CD sounded like it was recorded in a tin room with tin instruments. It was just so thin I found that I had to crank up the bass and I rarely do that.If you like Folk Christmas music one of the best one's at Amazon is \\"Christmas with the New Christy Minstrels: Complete.\\" 2 CD's in one case and the first one is absolutely fantastic. Mostly original songs that are good, upbeat, and Christmas sentimental but no droaning on and on. Better recording quality too. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Me Back to Simpler Times...","review":"In my family, this was the definitive 'Christmas Album', even more so than the Firestone records.. From the first notes, you can envision early-60's \\"Fraternity Row\\" before Kennedy's death in those waning times when things were still uncomplicated, where you could actually focus on Christmas and the spirit that came in the weeks before it.I had lost my original copy of the album long ago, and had purchased a replacement on eBay, but this version on CD is so faithfully recorded...and you hear so many new things you could not pickup on those LP's 40 years ago.A powerful Christmas album, a yearly tradition worthy to be passed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Christmas until I hear this album!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, this is a treasured memory from my childhood. I grew up listening to this recording, made tapes from a *very* scratched album and wore the tapes out too. This was the first record my parents ever got! We lost the vinyl copy in a flood, and I have been searching in vain for years to find a replacement. This is a wonderful album, full of the peace and harmony that Christmas should bring! Listen to this and you can feel the Spirit of Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A once missing gem from the James Brown crown.","review":"Originally conceived as three-record set with other King artists, this live recording is his most soulful, partially because it is a complete JB performance, with (reportedly) only two tracks omitted.

Ofcourse it is an indispensible collectible."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME","review":"If you are too young to have caught the God Father when he really was the \\"hardest working man in show business\\" this record could help you imagine what he was like. There is not a slack moment here.Check out Phelps Collins exemplary rhythm guitar work on \\"Ain't it Funky Now?\\" The live version of this track is totally extroverted. Bobby Byrd brings his charcoal vocal groove to the party to lip smackin effect. Then, of course, there is Bootsy is on bass.What can I say? This is JB after he has found and founded the funk movement that inspired the likes of Sly and Clinton (George not Bill). But this is the source!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MR DYNAMITE IS DYNAMITE!","review":"James Brown is definitevely one of the biggest composers of the century.In this performance, all the music oscilate between the Power with strong rythm and brass sections... the Love with intimate moments and very delicate arrangements and passionates voices from JB and his musicians!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best albums I have","review":"This album is just jaw-droppingly great. The energy that was put in to this show and I assume all James Brown's shows is just overwhelming with it's raw power and feeling This is stuff you can't capture in a studio. The timing is perfect, everything is.If you always hear people making big deals about James Brown and how 'funky' he is and whatever, and it annoys you, like it used to annoy me. Listen to me! Now I am rambling about him! And I wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't the truth, really! And why would so many other people risk sounding like idiots blathering about him? Um, I think this album should be owned by everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"power funky jams","review":"I don't think I would have even known this CD existed if I hadn't have been surfing the Amazon site late one night. I was intrigued by the description and positive reviews, so I ordered it. And wowee, zowee, this is powerful stuff. Frankly, I like this more than his other acclaimed live album. This one is much funkier and dynamic. But this was also a few years later when JB and his band were clearly on the funky path. As you would expect, ace musicianship, screams and grunts a-plenty, and some fantastic, funky jamming. The only blip, for me at least, was the inclusion of the downbeat \\"Georgia on my Mind.\\" It sort of ruins the party mood. But other than that, and maybe another ballad or two, this is an uptempo, dynamite workout. Gotta love JB and band doing their stuff before an appreciative crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Superb","review":"This is the hottest live funk album ever recorded. Period.

The video and audio quality was not good, but you can tell the band is on fire. I found out the performance was released on CD with better audio quality and was extremely happy.When I listened to the first couple songs I noticed Bootsy bass solo was cut out for the album. Why? Why can't live performances be preserved properly?To make matters worse on the back of the album there is a note stating that this is the only live recording of James Brown with the original JBs. If this is the only recording of that nature why mess it up?That's just stupid and frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Brown Sees Paris from The Summit","review":"1971 was transitional for James Brown as band members left (Maceo Parker, Jimmy Nolen), joined (the Collins brothers, Fred Wesley) and rejoined (JB's best onstage foil, Bobby Byrd). JB brought them all to Paris for \\"Love, Power, Peace,\\" a show at the Olympia Theatre that is the hottest, if not quite the best, JB live set ever. (1963's \\"Live at The Apollo\\" still gets that nod for historical as well as musical purposes.)You'll hear some of the finest rhythm guitar ever recorded on \\"Super Bad\\" and \\"Sex Machine\\"; a version of \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" as intense as Ray Charles' rendition was sanguine (ending with an on-key scream and JB shouting song titles to increasing applause), and excellent horn and string charts by David Matthews on JB ballads like \\"Bewildered\\" and \\"Try Me.\\" Yes, this is essential for JB fans who know that \\"Star Time\\" started, not ended, their JB collecting.

It is basically propaganda but as propaganda it is quite good, hence the popularity for a book involving an incident whose real-life Jewish survivors have said the novel was false (the Exodus ship). Still, it tells people what they want to hear and so it gets rave reviews. Actually, few notice the anti-Arab racism, the distorted history, and the button-pushing manipulation behind the well-crafted characters and events. The despoiling of the Palestinians is skirted and justified. This should be read to uinderstand how pro-Israeli opinion is manufactured and nurtured in popular opinion rather than as an accurate novelization of history. One day Uris will go down with Steicher, Goebbels, D.W.

Every time I looked at it as a possible read I just got a sense that it would be uninteresting. Well, I have to say that my fears were warranted. This book is almost as long and arduous as the plight of the Israelites. The story itself would be better off without the huge section of dull history stuck in the middle. I did become involved in the characters to a point, but never got a true feeling of realness in them. They just never completely developed. I do have to say that I came out with a better sense of the problems that the Israelites have had to face and I am sure that was the author's purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still crazy after all these years","review":"It is astounding how much loyalty this book can arouse despite its romancing of the conquest of another people. It is well told and in bringing accounts of the Holocaust home, it is good. But it damages its usefulness by appealing to the tunneled-visioned nationalist in romanticizing not the \\"rebirth\\" of anything (ancient Israel was not run by atheistic East European Socialists living on kibbutzes), but the conquest of another's homeland without their permission. Still works, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing literature","review":"Leon Uris bases his story in historical which draws you completely in to the conflict in Israel. The development of characters is ingenious and back stories are told only when they enrich the reader's understanding of the situation the Jews of Israel find themselves in. The body count rises throughout the novel and each one becomes more personal leaving the reader with a sense of desperation for the Jews in a climate that still remains today 50 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of mind!","review":"In the beginning I was assigned to read this book before high school started.

It starts with the smuggling of people to palestine against the blockade imposed by british. It continues to trace the reasons behind the jewish diaspora and the atrocities heaped on the jewish people by the different nations/polupations. It ends with a vivid description of the formation of State of Israel.

One has to remember it IShistorical fiction, and one might describe some of it aspropaganda, but it is powerful. He is sympathetic to thePalestinian Arabs, used as pawns by theArab governments, whoare the main villains of the storythough they don't come off as heroic as the Israelis....I can live with all thecharacterizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is a wonderful overview of the history of the Jewish nation's return to the land of Israel wrapped within a compelling novel about the creation and early years of the modern nation of Israel (book period covers app 1946 - 1951). The characters are well developed (with backgrounds that are used to flesh out the history of the Jewish people throughout the Holy Land & Europe/Russia from app 1880 to 1946) and the story is compelling and rivetting eventhough it is very long (the back story alone on the Ben Canaan brothers is over 100 pages). Much of the historical parts of the book actually happened, but are used as character development for the fictional plot. One thing to note is that this book has an obvious pro-Jewish bias so for those of you who naively believe that Israel is the agressor in the 1948 (or later) Arab/Israeli wars, this isn't the book for you.A great book for lovers of Middle Eastern/Israeli history and great stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"MUST\\" for all Jews.","review":"This book is essential for all jews (as well as others)since it provides a real life backround of what the Jews have suffered during the past.

Conversely the Arabs (except for those who collaborate with the Jews) are described as physically filth, treacherous, cowardly, and physically stinking.The \\"personal\\" dimension is a preposterous soap opera that is supposed to be psychologically profound but is just silly.Read \\"Battle Cry\\" instead, by the same author, to wash the bad taste from your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"poore homework on Eastern European issues.","review":"A quick review. This was one of my biggest disappointments ever, and I am talking about the section of the book associated with Eastern Europe and especially with Poland. I wonder where the author's informations came from. The level of research is extremely poor on the subject and whatever came out of it is totaly misleading , ignorant and unacceptable. There are countless publications on the issue of Warsaw Getto, there is Institut of Jewish Studies in Warsaw with it's archives, huge amount of available studies.....etc. I am sure this was the last book of Uris I had in hand. This seems to be the best way to avoid being missleaded on the other subjects I am not so aware off"},{"rating":"1","title":"To many pages","review":"This book has to many pages to tell us that story, the first part of the book, when Ari Ben Canaan rescue some young jewish boys and send them to Palestine is very interesting and it will have you reading all the time, but when the writer writes why Ari does what he does, and the biography of his life starts since his grandparents (that he never saw) is boring and boring, this part of the book is written in more than 100 pages, the second half of the book is worst, describes the story of the independence of Israel and the problems with the english army and all the arabs, this part of the book has more than 350 pages, this story is written in the book Jews, God and History by Max I. Dimont in less than 100 pages, so if you already read that book, you don't have to read this one.The \\"love\\" story of Ari and Kitty is not even a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK","review":"Exodus is a great book that illustrates the atrocities that the Jews went through and the hard work they put into reclaiming their land. Only God could have kept the Arabs from destroying their country. Uris's view is somewhat biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historic story","review":"I reread this book recently and found the historical information very interesting. Mr. Uris was know for his extensive research and certainly did it for this book. The story takes place before my time so the background information on the wars, geography, politics, etc., were extremely useful for me. It is an epic story that includes many biblical references and spans thousands of years. The story is still changing today in real life. Some of the characters are a bit much but maybe for the time it was written they were appropriate. The story is engaging and made me question some of my education on this period of time. I have enjoyed most of Mr. Uris' books and will reread more of them as I have the time. This is well worth your time just for the historic information alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exodus still a good read","review":"I found it extremely easy to download books on to my Kindle and I am now rereading books that I read long ago and finding that they are still a really good read.

Oddly, I don't think it's even particularly well-written. I think the plot is a bit disjointed, the writing uneven. However it tells such a stirring story that I love it anyway. I've always been half in love with Ari Ben Canaan.There is a bittersweet feeling about this book too, these days, 50 years after the events in the novel - when one looks at the current situation in the middle east. However I think this is a rousing read about the founding of Israel. I think it's a good book. With a couple more re-writes and tighter editing it could have been a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long by far","review":"the story of the exodus by itself is what attracted me, but the author went too deeply into background of many of the characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Sad. To see all these people go nuts over nationalist tripe that is dangerously false on fact and brutally racist in tone does not bode well for the future of humanity, the Middle East or Jews and Arabs.This outdated work appeals primarily to Jews of East European personal or family origin where nationalism (as anyone who follows Yugoslavia and Chechnya or WWII central europe knows) is crude simplistic, violence-venerating, and myth-loving.Sad to see Jewish values submerged in a hack-novel tale designed to jsutify a claim to a piece of dirt in the Middle East by presenting it as a heroic resurrection of a people against others who lived there who are stereotpyed viciously."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth about Exodus","review":"I read this book for school and was assigned a project on it. My class also viewed the movie Exodus. The assignment was basically to look beyond the pages of the book and find out whats real and what isn't.

I, myself am nor Jewish,Palestian or British. I'm Puerto Rican, so don't think I am favoring one side because I belong to that group of peoples. And explain to me this the purpose of the love affair between Ari Ben Canaan and Kitty Fermont is what? There is no point its just to catch the eye of the young adults in America and try to sympathize with the characters.

On the website you have to wait till next week if the current stories aren't your particular cup of tea. With the book, you just turn the page.

My own preference is to enjoy three or four \\"howls of laughter\\" type stories in a row.That said I'll end with a positive comment.

Back to the drawing board Madonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just DON'T!!!!","review":"Yikes!! Stay away from this Maxi-single!! It sucks! The THUNDERPUSS HANDS IN THE AIR MIX sounds SOOO noisy and the THUNDERPUSS CLUB MIX (ON IMPORT) is SOOO silly sounding. Please! The rest of the mixes hardly make an impression. Definitely not ONE OF MADDIE'S BETTER RELEASES.Let's face it. The original version of the song is lame. And the reason why it charted on Billboard DANCE CLUB PLAY #1 was because of the silly THUNDERPUSS mix.I still think Maddie's BEST song is 1984's LIKE A VIRGIN.The reason why I give this single ONE star was because I liked the video. That COWGIRL outfit looked soo COOL!!Case closed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Don't Stop","review":"Don't Tell Me is a refreshingly good single with some great remixes! Fans are treated with 7 remixes of the song, and all of them are spectacular. The Timo Maas Mix is a great urban UK sounding remix, while the Victor Calderone Sensory Mix is a stripped back, slower remix. The Thunderpuss remixes are among the best remixes on this single. Every one is great and they all offer something different (excluding the edits, but hey they are edits of the longer ones) for the listener. As an added bonus, it is an enhanced cd with the Don't Tell Me Video. This is a must buy for any Madonna fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A gamble that lost","review":"It isn't a crime to remix a slow song. Previous slow or mid-tmepo Madonna songs have been successfully remixed, like Secret, for example. The remixes here, though, are sort of a letdown. There isn't any distinct sound or feel, just a bunch of remix cliches by remixers who have remixed too many songs by now to really think about what they want to create.Sad to say, but I am dreading the remixes for the next single, What It Feels Like For a Girl. Another slow song, and the same remixers have been chosen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"This CD has a Thunderpuss Club Mix not found in the US release. It also has the radio edit of the lp version, and Cyberraga. Very good song, good b-side, ok mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"like a calf down on his knees","review":"Finally, the remixes for 'Don't Tell Me' come out in the US. Unfortunately, the best mix of the song was left off the domestic single -- the original Thunderpuss Club Mix (still found on import). The Thunderpuss Hands In The Air Anthem is good -- more clubby for sure -- but it's just not quite as fun as the first one (rumored to be Madonna's favorite). Otherwise, the Tima Maas mix has a nice progressive edge, and the Tracy Young mix, with guitars(!), is a winner. The biggest surprise, though, is Victor Calderone's trippy mix -- for once, not his signature hard sound. (Instead it sounds like a William Orbit mix -- more 'Ray of Light' than 'Music'. But at least he's trying something new, for a change.)The disc also includes the video, which is one of her best -- and for Madonna, that's really saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD COMES WITH THE BEST MUSIC VIDEO MADONNA HAS EVER DONE","review":"Hi. I gave this single 5 stars, not for the remixes, but for the wonderful music video that comes with it. When she came out with the song I was disapoineted that the video didn't come out on dvd like \\"Music\\" or \\"What it feels like for a girl\\", but when I slid the cd into my computer (to play the songs) I was pleasently suprised to see the music video pop up! It is so cool to watch madonna dance around in the sand with her cow-girl hat on and cow-boy boots. This is one of her best songs and in my opinion it is her best video. When you put it in your computer it comes up just as clear as a DVD would be. It comes in as a full screen!!!! As far as the remixes go, they are are pretty good. I prefer the original version, but when I found out this cool music video was on the compact disk, I bought it on the spot! You better add this to your wish list... FAST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the market on the use of the tomahawk and long knife as weapons.","review":"The tomahawk is one of the most effective weapons in close quarter combat. This excellent book is comprehensive in scope with large clear drawing illustrations. Part one covers a basic history of the tomahawk, the grips, stances, drawing the tomahawk and long knife. Part two shows the offensive use of the tomahawk, including the cuts, chops, punch and the rake. The third part explains the defensive use of the tomahawk. Book two of this text covers long knife techniques including the grips, stabs and other methods to use this weapon. In book three various combinations are taught, using both the tomahawk and the long knife. In conclusion, this book is for anyone who is interested in the use of the tomahawk and long knife in close quarter combat. The author has done his home-work researching this practical and unique guide.Rating: 5 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Tanto-Jutsu Official Manual of Bushi Satori Ryu)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"The book was well written, and the information was good. The work is a bit confusing when describing angles and drills. This type of informations is probably better left to an instructor.Great info, with some muddled diagrams and drill instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, Concise and Interesting","review":"The Fighting Tomahawk by Col. Dwight McLemore and published by Paladin Press gives the reader important insight into the use of this rarely studied weapon. Col. McLemore takes his concrete understanding of sound martial principles and distills the essences of the Tomahawk into clear and concise descriptions; making even complex principles easier to understand. To follow this, he adds drills for partner and solo work as well as a sample training schedule. Finally, there are a plethora of illustrations to aid the reader's comprehension of this system.McLemore has also riddled his work with historical anecdotes from the frontier and finished it with an excellent bibliography. Both of these show the extensive research Col. McLemore did for this book which makes it an invaluable resource. Col. McLemore should be applauded for creating a wonderful training tool to help the martial artist start his studies of the Tomahawk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta be cool","review":"This isn't even out yet, but I still can't wait, man.

The directions appear to be a little more complex than they actually are. Pull out to the first click to set either alarm, time, local time, or calender. After you have moved the indicator to what you want to adjust, then pull out the rest of the way to actually adjust that item.

Don't buy if you are planning to burn recordings onto CDs. Also, apparently the headphone jack is designed to only work with one headphone instead of both. Kind of annoying. And the quality of the recordings in NOT very good at all. Perhaps due to comparison (Sony IC Recorder ICD-PX720 - MUCH better product for about the same price). True, this Olympus recorder is one of the only \\"cheaper\\" digital recorders I could find that works with Windows 7, but hopefully that will be resolved soon enough.

Oh, MMP will PLAY the file, but when you go to convert it to an MP3 or just burn the file directly to CD so you can play it in a CD player, it doesn't work. It says that it doesn't recognize the codec. Olympus was at a loss to explain the work around. What I ended up doing was purchasing a third (or fourth or even fifth, with as low tech as it turned out to be) party converter that was able to convert it without a problem. Why won't MMP convert? Because the Olympus .WAV file uses a proprietary codec--one that they will NOT send out. I was on the phone with them for over an hour trying to convince them that, no, it doesn't convert. The person I was on the phone with the longest had no clue about the proprietary codec.Anyway, if you want to use this product for your class notes, etc., it's a great product.

So as not to have her watching the television constantly, we got her this book for Christmas. The theme of the book is repeated on every page by a different VeggieTales character... God loves you!

My wife and I kept watching it thinking something great or interesting was about to happen only to be slapped with more boring, uninteresting scenes. This could have been a great movie about a drug dealer who gets caught and has to find out who set him up. Instead we get a rambling bore of a movie where the main character's big idea to make it through prison is to have his friend \\"make him ugly\\" by beating him in the face...Stay away for your own good, I've lost 2 hours of my life I'll never get back again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Came in with High Expectations.","review":"Maybe I came in with to high of expectations?

He has one last day to enjoy his freedom. Now, in real life the police would automatically take the man into custody and arrest him, but in Spike Lee's fantasy land, Norton's character gets one last day to do whatever he wants, whether that be to leave the country or to go on a murderous rampage.

Not to ruin it but the best scene of the entire movie, and that moved me to tears, is a key moment between Ed Norton and Barry Pepper towards the end. Barry Pepper does an absolutley amazing job in this movie. I think Ed Norton is a superb actor but I didn't think he was right for this role.

The basic premise was intriguing and there were interesting moments throughout. However, When Philip Seymour Hoffman and Edward Norton leaves you flat, you know there's a serious problem. The characters were oddly shallow, unbelievable, and unlikeable. Spike Lee peddles in stereotypes - ethnic, gender, and class - and no one cares about or becomes invested in a paper-thin stereotype.

The acting is excellent, especially the performance of Edward Norton, but there is little change in emotion; there is a brooding feeling throughout the film's two plus hours as the drug dealing Norton character worries that he will need to report to jail for a seven year term within 25 hours, and as he is wondering whether it was his girl friend who turned him in to the cops. There is little else to the plot, other than his school teacher friend's sexual attraction to his under-age student, a subplot that is not developed; like the main plot, it discloses his anguish very well, but little else. If the presentation of brooding and anguish is the film's goal, the film is very successful. Yet, one might also wonder whether this could have been presented in a shorter version and whether another subplot should have been added."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am very happy with the movie.","review":"I had never heard of the movie, but I like Edward Norton, so I bought it.

Nothing happens. You keep waiting for something interesting, but it never comes along. Besides which, it has this confusing conceit of a man who's been sentenced to jail, but then he gets some time on the outside to say goodbye to people and possibly escape if he wants. It may be that this does happen in the criminal justice system, but it flies so counter to what i'm used to (you get convicted, you go straight to jail) that it just made it hard to take in.

It's basically about the last 24 hrs in the life of drug dealer before he is sent to prison to serve his sentence. Norton together with a fine cast (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brian Cox, Barry Pepper and the luscious Rosario Dawson)plus a very good screenplay by David Benihoff (Troy) help to make this one of Spike's best films.

I have now had this product for over three years, and the below review still holds true. It's still in amazing shape and it is also still the most popular toy.I run a family daycare and bought this item last year. Hands down it is the MOST used toy in the place. It's fantastic for the kids to be able to build in another dimension besides table top. It's extended their imagination! Having the 'trays' right under the wall is perfect. When the kids want to build on a table-top, or the floor they know just where the duplos are! It's very sturdy and has withstood constant play for over a year and still looks brand new! I cannot recommend this enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Prepare Bible Messages","review":"We were very pleased that this earlier version using the King James Bible was still available. The book was in very good, usable condition, we received it within a few days of purchase. It is an excellent guide for those wishing to preach or for a better understanding of God's Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very impressive interpretation, albeit a little \\"willful\\"","review":"This complete edition of Rachmaninoff's (...v's?) piano concertos is certainly a good one. It is a very clear recording with excellent spatial acoustics. The piano sound appears comparatively tinny, but that may be a personal impression. The interpretation is really touching, in some aspects the best version I ever heard. Unfortunately, the soloist deviates from the score in one of the most beautiful passages of the 4th concerto (end of 2nd movement). So this recording is probably not the best choice for people who have internalized every note of this opus. Nonetheless, the edition is recommendable because it conveys the spirit of this music very impressively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun ride with the big voice","review":"This cd is a fun ride with the big voice of Omar Dykes from Omar & The Howlers. I have his first recording Big Leg Beat that featured horns and the swing sound back in 1980 and I was thrilled for him to revive his original sounds. Guest musicians Derek O'Brien and David \\"Fathead\\" Newman keep these tracks fresh and fun. I've been a fan of drummer George Rains since he was with Boz Skaggs on \\"Loan Me A Dime\\" and he's surely hasn't lost his pace on Omar's Swingland. I can't wait to see what Omar has instore for us next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Buyer Beware! This is not a genuine Epson cartridge. Very misleading description. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are so many layers in this tragic play!","review":"This is a very complex play although it seems simplistic at first. There were a lot of changes going on in society when Ibsen wrote this play in 1884 And not everyone was adapting to these changes. Some still tried to cling to the old way of doing things, and others were trying to force changes within their own sphere. (Is that so different than now?) Anyway, Ibsen portrays these varying degrees of acceptance with his characters in this play. And he does a masterful job of it. How can so much be depicted about the heartache and pathos of the human psyche within the limits of a five-act play? That is Ibsen/s genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, enjoyable read","review":"This is an entertaining book. I'm not one to read many detective novels, but this was definetly a good read that kept me interested, a real page turner yet a light read, it was enjoyable and brought me back to light/easy reading stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiddlers","review":"Ed mcBain will be missed. I started reading the 87th Precinct novels in the early 1970's. I have read all the 87th Precinct books including the short stories. No one did it better than Ed McBain. As far as Fiddlers is concerned it is about right in the middle. It is not his best and it is not his worst. It is the best one of his most recent novels. I guess we will get some re-prints etc.....But from what I've read over the Internet there will be no more new books. That is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soso","review":"This book was confusing to read and I nearly gave up twice. (I just had nothing better to read at the time.) There were too many characters including 3 pairs of pretty much interchangeable police detectives. I couldn't keep them straight; one pair would have been fine. These rather two-dimensional detectives were only slightly broadened by a series of one-sentence discussions of their personal problems. The author changed venues and characters every few pages making for a very disjointed read. This deliberate discontinuity did not serve to increase the suspense; it was just irksome. The book is titled \\"Fiddlers;\\" the first guy killed is a violinist; the nightclub, Ninotchka, has strolling violinists; the hooker, Reggie, describes \\"singing about fiddlers;\\" and, at the end, the killer accuses his victims of having \\"fiddled\\" with his life. Oh. Yeah, I get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Album","review":"This is a great album! Saturday Night is a highlight song. ALso, Burn Down the Mission is incredible.

Having said that: this REALLY IS the greatest live album ever recorded. And I've heard a lot of them.Time, place and audience come together on both of these discs. If you own even one Elton John album, it should be this one.

Recorded before the final studio album was cut by the only Elton John Band lineup that mattered (its first round, anyway) and Elton had no other causes than trying to make great records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blessed","review":"I consider this CD to be a blessing to anyone that listen to it.

I especially remember the raincoat (years before Colombo) and the inspector talking to his wife Mabel on the phone at the end of each show...'I'm coming home, Mabel'. The production was crude, but somehow more honest than today's efforts. Young people might buy these inexpensive episodes if they're at all curious as to what early TV was like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocky Fossil","review":"This CD of an ancient video is a fossil from the early days of primitive television in America. Production values were low. The series was originally shot live so all the scenes are genuinely sequential. Yet there is little evidence of the dramatic tension that supposedly accompanied live broadcasts of such \\"classic television\\" as Marty. Roscoe Karns as the eponymous Detective King obviously has a little trouble from time to time with his lines as written and instead paraphrases. The plots are as simple as you would expect give the restraints on numbers of characters and impossibility of exterior scenes. The series uses the even then hokey device of having King speak on the phone in every episode to his never-seen wife whose voice is nevertheless heard. There is novelty value here but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Service from Seller 'dvdlegacy'","review":"I am not able to review the product I purchased because I never received it from seller dvdlegacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Took Me Awhile To See This Movie","review":"Saw This Movie At My Local Video Store, But It Was Always Checked Out, So I Was Placed On A Waiting List, But When I Returned To Check It Out The Video Store Had Closed Down Over Night.

Then as I got into it, I thought there would be a book-within-a-book about Turner. But no. This is a novel about a contemporary journalist. Not so well done.

To a degree it is centered around paper but also reads as a contemporary novel about a London-based woman. In a real sense, some of the writing is annoying -- layered on adjectives, descriptions of character's outfits (mostly other women) -- but adjectives do not a novel make.

The first three books were all page turners. I couldn't put them down until I was finished. However, this book is sadly lacking the caliber the other books in the series possessed. The ending was predictable from the beginning, and the outcome was bittersweet.Some people believe that after Silver is for Secrets, the series should have been over. However, the author didn't really finish the series there. An ending to Stacey Brown's story was required. The attempt to close all the doors left open, though, was unenjoyable.

And they usually tell her about someone about to die. In the first book, Blue is for Nightmares, it was her friend. In Silver is for secrets she meets a boy named Jacob who she ends up dating, and Jacob ends up going missing. This is one switches between two different narrators. The first narrators, Stacy and Shell (Jacob). When Stacy and Shell meet, she recognizes him as Jacob. When Jacob was pushed off the cruise ship, he survived but lost his memory.

Now, this book has an unfortunate amount of predictability, and it's pretty clear who Shell is after the first few chapters, so I take a star off for that. However, the story line works out wonderfully with the introduction of Porsha, the daughter of the college president; Brick, a fellow witch stuck in the same place with Shell; and Janie, Stacey and Amber's new preppy, God-fearing roomate. The dynamics are awkward at first, with Stacey unable to cope with the loss of Jacob and the tension between our girls and Janie.

I think the book follows a random order with story lines and vocabulary, but the one thing in order is probably the difficulty of kanji and grammar. The book provides okay explanations for grammar points, but you'll probably need a teacher to understand it better. There was very little culture in it to learn. Maybe I missed something, but I learned basically no Japanese culture in my classes. The book is mostly set up so that by the time you finish it, you can be proficient in the lowest levels of the Japanese proficiency test. When I took a sample test of a few questions, there was vocab and grammar and kanji that I mostly knew. They seem random to me, but apparently this is what is common in Japanese I guess? I think the book is alright if you have a teacher to go with it, but by yourself, I'd look elsewhere. Though, just this year, a new edition finally came out since the 90s, so I wonder how much they've improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner level book","review":"This book is very helpful if you are just getting started in learning Japanese.

It also did not fully/ appropriately explain some grammar. The practice section is now more expansive in the 2nd edition with more communication and conversational tasks. The accompanying audio CD is now included with the new textbook instead of sold separately and it's all on a single disk this time.

You will notice yourself wanting to read the book nonstop, never getting bored with the same old plot. This novel is a who-done-it that keeps its readers guessing on who the enemy is. You will find yourself racing to finish the book because the suspense never ends. Mary Higgins Clark novels get a person motivated to read. Once you start, you can't stop until you've reached the conclsion. This book will have you asking so many questions. \\"How will it end?\\" \\"Who killed Leila?\\" \\"Will Elizabeth make it til the end of the novel or will her sister's murderer get her too?\\" No matter who you are, I think you will enjoy not only this novel, but any novels written by the talented \\"Queen of Suspense\\" Mary Higgins Clark. If you like drama, suspense, or mystery, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis Okay, Typical Mary Higgins Clark Script","review":"Weep No More My Lady follows the Clark formula for her stories. The suspense and guessing part is to find out who amongst the people surrounding the principal players is the killer. Clark was okay, but is now beginning to be a \\"read one, read all\\" type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I figured out who killed Leila somewhere around page 65. MHC can and has done better, like in Remember Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story Setting","review":"I haven't read many of Mary Higgins Clark's book yet, but plan to keep reading. I like the different story settings she uses. Her style of writing keeps you interested even when its not an 'exciting part'. It is realistic enough without overdoing it. I thought the ending was a little far-fetched when the main character, Elizabeth, sets out to bait the bad guy herself with nothing more than a confidence that she can out-swim someone. No one in their right mind would do that alone when they could so easily have someone watching. That was the only thing that disappointed me in this story. Overall it was well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I listened to the audio version and found it lacking. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that the characters seemed to reach resolution a bit too rapidly. Much of those resolutions left me wondering if the characters suddenly developed ESP...Overall, it was corny and none to realistic. ...Other MHC novels have offered more...this one just felt generic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful!","review":"Elizabeth Lange, a beautiful,up and coming young actress is invited to spend time at a spa for the rich and famous, by the owners of the spa who had been friends of her lately deceased sister, Leila, a famous star of stage and screen.Leila's lover, celebrity financier Ted Winters, has been accused of Leila's murder and is awaiting trial.Unbeknown to Elizabeth, Ted has also been invited to the spa, along with his aide and a lawyer who is helping to prepare him for the trial.It soon becomes clear that quite a few of the people at the spa had reason to hate Leila who had antagonised many on her way to the top.Elizabeth is to be the prosecutions chief witness as she heard Leila's voice on the phone,pleading with Ted not to hurt her.It soon becomes obvious that someone is determined to kill Elizabeth and the plot thickens! I found this to be a good,quick,exciting read and not too much of a brain strain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing approach to a world of dimensions.","review":"A honest insight into the world of modeling, when the rest of media is perpetuating the fantasy. If only more girls who entered modeling had the support Sara received! Like any industry, whether it be art , film, fashion or even business, the young need and have the right to be protected, guided and nurtured. A good starting point for anyone who wants to consider modeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Aspiring Model Should See This","review":"Having been in and around the modeling business for over 40 years, I was delighted to see this film. It really tells it like it is. Kudos to Sara Ziff and the people who helped her make this remarkable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"many swan heads","review":"Despite the deplorable trend of making young models look as unattractive as possible, this film's close up shots of the models show the resemblance of many of the models to the Avedon types used by Christian Dior in The Fifties. There is even a Celtic model who resembles Michelle Trachtenberg.I didn't find this documentary to be particularly entertaining but it was interesting that unsuccessful models can actually go into debt trying to climb the mountain.Also, according to Sena Cech, the casting couch is alive and well and awful so that explains why dog heads would get the coin whilst swans languish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duplicates the Website","review":"I really want to write a good review of this book. Unfortunately, I can't. This book is simply a reprint of the grooming articles from the publisher's website, sharpman.com. The only advantage I can see to getting the book is that you have all the articles in one place, with no need to boot up your computer. That's what saved it from getting only 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful playing of wonderful music","review":"This is a nicely varied program of three strongly contrasting works. The Poulenc is quite familiar, in his tuneful but sometimes bittersweet style -- though as often as I've heard it (both recorded & live) I have never heard such quick tempos combined with faultless execution. Remarkable playing by the oboist & bassoonist. Not surprising, perhaps, since the players are members of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The real find is the Martinu, for the unique combination of clarinet, violin, viola, cello, harp, & piano. It's typically lyrical, easy-listening music by this composer. The Penderecki is a bit more hard-edged -- quasi-tonal (in the sense of having no stable tonal centers to speak of) but melodic and quite listenable if you have an open mind. It's in P's familiar dark & gloomy vein, but will not send you looking for a pick-me-up the way some music by Mahler or Shostakovich will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom","review":"My toddler who loves animals frequently picks this book to read! We enjoy the DK series since they have great photos, easily read, easy to pack and take along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"It was some years ago that I bought this CD. I've waited all this time (since 2007) to be sure before commenting on it. Listening to it a fourth and final time now, in 2011, I'm quite sure that there is something profoundly 'off' about this recording. It might be partially a technical problem (there is a subtle but maddening kind of filtering effect, as if everything is heard through a screen of cotton batting) but mainly I think it is the performance itself that is just bloodless, as if by intelligent and well-meaning androids. How can this happen to such well-known and beloved pieces as the Mozart and Beethoven Piano-Wind Quintets?? And in Berlin of all places?! It's an astonishing kind of obscenity, quite beyond any rational explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daheim Does It Again","review":"Once again local author Mary Daheim writes a mystery novel that keeps the reader guessing until the end. The use of believable characters bring the book alive impossible to put down.Emma Lord is her usual intrepid self as she deals with not only the \\"usual\\" cast of characters, but solves the mystery of the death of the odious Hans over rare beef and adult beverages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"A fox terrier with a broken neck. A tortured donkey. A German Shepherd trained to kill. What was up with all this animal cruelty? Not only did it make me not like the book, but it soured me a bit on the whole series and on the author.This series has long been the better of her two, but it's starting to lose steam. Vida needs to be killed off already, because she's got to be one of the most annoying characters around. Get off the fence with Milo, Emma. Cut down on all the\\"colorful\\" characters because there's way too many and it's hard to keep track of them all.Definitely not a good effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough!","review":"I have always enjoyed this writer's 2 series, but the last few I have had to struggle to get through them. They have turned into tons of words that mean nothing, no plot, little said or done.It's sad that time was spent writing this book, as it seems all for nothing. Time to put both series to bed for the sake of the reading public."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good source of pretty pictures for your lecture presentation....","review":"I used Wolpert's text for an undergrad developmental course. Given that the test assumes previous coursework in genetics/biochemistry, the content of the book could've been more in depth, especially in the chapters on vertebrates. Sometimes extra detail makes the big picture easier to understand; this book leaves a little too much to mystery and results in a confused reader. The glossary and index leave much to be desired. On a more positive note, the illustrations and photographs are as good as you'll find in any textbook. However, I suggest Gilbert's text."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE TEXTBOOK!!!","review":"I used this book for my development class, and honestly, it was one of the WORST biology books I have ever used, if not the worst. The textbook is incredibly boring and it does not explain any topics well at all. If you have to use this book for a course, I suggest that you get some type of study guide that will help you in this subject because this book will not help you. If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. Horribly written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bolling CD","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite albums; but my LP was so old, it had skips and was warped. I was very pleased to find it on CD as I'd checked the area record stores (including Virgin Records; thought for sure they'd have it!) & could not find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Just like I remember it from my childhood days on vinyl. Wonderful playing! I highly recommend buying this! So good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Say Cheese and Die","review":"This book was very interesting. I enjoyed it a lot because it was very addicting. When the story develops, it gets very exciting. It is for younger readers, 5th grade and younger probably. I liked this book, but I felt it was too easy. It is the best Goosebumps book I've read by far. A girl vanished and magically reappeared out of nowhere. Greg takes a picture of his dads' brand new car and when the picture develops the car is shown totaled. If you read other Goosebumps books, you would like this book.Tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"> : - ()","review":"Ok, ok, so I am a bit old to be reading such books. . .But I thought it would be interesting to look back at some of the books I used to read back in the day. To my surprise, I found this book! Say Cheese and Die! is one of my favorite scary books of all time. Initially, I had read this book because I loved the picture! Still do. . .Anyways, It is about a boy named Greg who obtains a camera, though kind of an old camera, and takes pictures with it! (obviously!) But it appears the camera is broke. It doesn't show everybody in the picture! What's up with that? Greg soon unveils a haunting revelation which may put his own life in harms way! How can he convince others that this camera is more than just broken--it's EVIL!?This is a fun book to read and I would recommend it to all middle schoolers!

The original single is actually not on the album. While some of the remixes aren't too bad, most are like the Don't Cry for Me Argentina dance remix or the Titanic song techno style. Some songs just shouldn't be messed with like that. But the last remix is good, slower than the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Account","review":"This was an interesting look at a reporter from Ireland named Veronica Guerin. Before watching this movie, I had never heard about her so I'm not sure about the historical accuracy of the movie, but it was enjoyable none-the-less.This film focuses on her transition from a \\"human issues\\" reporter, to one who finds purpose and a mission in her work. When reporting on street kids who are hooked on drugs, she gets the idea to report (expose) those who are selling these kids the drugs. The movie unfolds this situation and wraps up by relaying the results of her work on Ireland and Irish law.This is a well-shot, well-acted movie; Cate Blanchett does a fantastic job (as always). I found the direction impacting and characters interesting. All in all a very interesting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veronica Guerin, Dublin's doomed journalist-heroine","review":"I have seen this movie a number of times and each time I am sincerely moved by it in many ways.Veronica Guerin was a reckless and relentless seeker of the criminals who got rich on the backs ofdrug dealing and all those youngsters who died from the drugging. She was brave and bold andbecause of her the law was changed so that all criminals' assets were frozen by a department calledthe CAB = Criminal Assets Bureau.Cate Blanchett is always brilliant and in this movie she is exceptionally so.The music can tear your heart out. It is so haunting, so lovely.This is a must see in so many ways and for me a must see many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and eye-opening","review":"I wanted to buy this movie because 1) I live in Mexico and the situation shown in \\"Veronica Guerin\\" is very much like what's going on today in my country with the drug wars and 2) Cate Blanchett is at her best. I don't want to give anything away. All you need to know is that this movie is not for the weak of heart, it's got some violent scenes, and the acting and story are superb. This actually happened and that makes it all the more poignant. Highly recommended for those interested in learning how the drug lords were taken down in Ireland and for those who are Cate Blanchett fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"She died doing what we all know we should","review":"This was a great movie. I believe every adult should see it; I have it in my home and recommend it to any adult wanting to borrow a movie. This woman tried to make the world a better place and she was murdered for it. I will never forget her name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"When I saw that Cate Blanchett and Colin Ferrel were co-starring in a movie chronicling the life of the Irish journalist/martyr Veronica Guerin, I was immediately excited. Excitement however quickly turned to disappointment.The story is flat. Even Blanchett couldn't save this script, which is saying a lot considering her talent. Ferrel is in the movie for a total of 45 seconds. There are many holes in the plot, making me think that the movie was originally an hour longer, and they took out random scenes in production. That's how jumpy and uncomfortable it felt to sit through this film.Blanchett is her usual good self, but this is a waste of her talent and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a modern martyr to the drug problem in Ireland","review":"Drugs and thugs plague modern Irish cities and endanger children.A crime fighting reporter goes after finding the big manhidden behind the scenes and when she finds him, he beats herup threatens her and then tries to buy her off.They make her life a hard place,yet she keeps at it.

A pleasing departure from stereotyped casting - setting is well done and character treatment is deeply explored! The characters in Veronica Guerin are complex and ring truer to life than one might expect. Veronica Guerin is nobly portrayed. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This was a movie about an Irish reporter who decides she wants to investigate the drug world after she sees young children in a local apartment building playing with dirty heroin needles. She sets out to get to the source of the problem, but as she gets closer and closer, her life and the lives of those around her become filled with danger. This film was based on a true story, so it was a great one to tell, however I did not feel sympathy for her. When the drug lords began to make death threats to her husband and children, instead of backing off, she pushed harder. I think that was selfish of her. Great movie, I just did not agree with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"Cate Blanchett does a fine job portraying the crusading Irish journalist. The seamy Irish drug underworld is convincing, and the ending is tragic. I would watch this movie a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For surgical trainees","review":"Good books on operative surgery are difficult to find. This book offers a much clearer understanding of operative general surgery. The detailed text is aided with helpful illustrations. It describes many of the pitfalls that surgeons encounter in day to day practice. The price may be off-putting but to the serious surgical trainee, they will see this book as an invaluable investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great content, poor workmanship","review":"Excellent content however I agree with the previous review that this book is not quite up to publishers standards. I bought from amazon not a third party but the binding is already falling apart (one week old) and the pages look like it was printed on computer paper not standard text book paper.

If you adore Verdi as I do, you should hear his original version of \\"Simon Boccanegra\\". Verdi's 1881 Version of this opera is a masterpiece, but it took a lot of careful revision of the 1857 version to get there. If I had never heard the 1881 version before hearing the 1857 version, I would have never believed such a transformation possible. From the ottocento world of cabalettas and cadenzas to the threshold of \\"Otello\\" is an amazing achievement. This recording features competent singing and good sound AND MOST IMPORTANTLY a full libretto of the 1857 version. Recommended to those interested in a full study of Verdi, not to casual opera lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute cloth rattle","review":"I bought this rattle primarily because I was looking for a cloth rattle instead of a plastic one.This rattle toy includes small soft tags, crinkles and \\"springy\\" antennas and feet.What I like the most is that it is machine washable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for my 6 month old","review":"My 6 month old can grab tags or cloth better so I decided to buy this for her to practice grabbing.

Probably nothing wrong with item except confusing description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew, horrrrrrible fabric.","review":"Apparently didn't read the description closely enough. 50% cotton, 50% POLYPROPYLENE, which is what cheap rugs are made of. Ugh. Figured no big deal, they go on the back of the bed, I'm not going to be sleeping on them, it doesn't matter. But alas, not only are they unpleasantly slick and petroleum-based-synthetic feeling, but after a week or two they start to PILL. BIG TIME. So now they feel gross *and* they look all manky. Booooo. Will order 100% cotton ones as soon as I can locate some in the correct size and pattern.Oh, also? They cheaped out on the insert/opening design on these -- there's no closure, the opening is all the way at one end, and the fabric at the opening overlaps like MAYBE half an inch. Which means your pillows are going to constantly try to come out, and there'll always be a big unattractive gap, so the side with the opening ALWAYS has to face down."},{"rating":"1","title":"bedsread color","review":"Pattern was as expected. texture is perfect .color was not a slate blue ,it was light blue.keeping it anyway,dont have time to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinzon Diamond Matelasse","review":"This Euro Sham is wonderful.

I have washed them a couple times and they have not faded. I only have 2 complaints, the first is that when I put the euro pillow inside that it gapes open in the back. I have it pinned shut right now, but I will be putting some velcro to keep them shut and to make it easy to get the pillows out when needed. My second complaint would be that the fringe around kind of flops down when they are propped up. I wish they were more stiff so that it would look more clean. I have huge pillows in them so it's not a problem of them being under stuffed. Otherwise I love the look and feel of them. The price was great too. They are a nice deep brown also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Chic","review":"I needed shams for two boudoir pillows. The ones I had didn't really go with the bedspread. I use them frequently to prop up this or that when I read in bed. And since I have a Kindle, that is often.I knew if I shopped for them here in Houston, I'd have to schlep to several stores and might well pay more than I wanted to. I Googled \\"Boudoir Pillow Shams\\" and was -- of course -- sent to Amazon. Should have just started there!

They're convenient, they keep well in a car, and they taste good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale taste and rugged texture is just unpleasant","review":"Bought these one day thinking I was getting a quick substitute for milk and cereal since I'm constantly on the run in the mornings and don't have time to have a proper breakfast. Was I wrong. These bars the warp the original taste of the cereal and it comes out extremely stale and nasty. Even the Cinnamon Toast Crunch which has a distinct sweet tasting flavor was just unpleasant to taste. The creamy \\"milk\\" portion of the bar also is unnecessary. The texture is also very rugged, sharp edged, and rough. You can accidentally cut the inside of you're mouth if not extra careful. Plain Rice Krispies treats or any Quaker Oats granola bar on the market are much better substitutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my taste at all.","review":"I thought this would be a good variety for the normal granola bar in the morning. They are way too sweet and what is with the fake milk strip through the center of the bar? I like all the cereals (as cereal) but these bars have a lot to be desired! :( Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought these were GROSS","review":"I have four kids ranging from 2-10 yrs old. Nobody wanted any of these bars. Only the ten-yr old would eat the cocoa ones occasionally. They were all pretty gross tasting. I'm not sure who would find these appealing. I tried to keep them in the car or with me at soccer games but even when they were hungry, they didnt want to eat them. These are junk food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance in the Deep South.","review":"This was my second experience with Faulkner, I read 'The Bear' in college some 25 years ago. 'The Bear' was written when Faulkner decided that he would no longer take it easy on the reader and stopped punctuating.Reading 'Light in August' is not quite as frustrating; more like driving over a mountain, everyime you hit a straightaway you see another switchback on the horizon.The story is not complicated but the characters are and Faulkner interweaves his passionate story by taking you as far back as three generations to make the reader understand from whom some characters evolved.The best and most important character is Joe Christmas, the abused mulatto with no sense of heritage whose atrocious act is central to the goings on.The passion with which Faulkner writes was simply unmatched by his contemporaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best available","review":"One of the best novels of certainly the best American writer in solid, reliable hardcover. I wish it was a critical edition, and that it is not, I consider the only disadvantage. The novel demands a great deal of attention, it forces reader to keep returning, and rewards with most beautiful, poetic language, and intellectual depth far beyond a style of any other writer. As always with Faulkner, it is also a lot of fun to read, and understanding of the whole work is an entertaining challenge. Therefore I advise on buying long-lasting hardcover rather than any f a l l a p a r t paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody to like in this one.","review":"Since I had never read Faulkner, I thought I'd give him a try.

This is traditional New Orleans Jazz, not Dixieland, by some of the few musicians that actually lived and played during the heyday of N. O. Jazz.Bunk is a controversial figure both personnally and musically, with some describing his jazz as too primative, but I believe that is what makes it great. The band backing up Bunk on many of the tracks is the George Lewis Band and they do a fine job. Bunk's driving trumpet and George's lyrical clarinet are the perfect compliment for each other.If you want a technically slick, musically smooth CD this isn't for you. However if you want to hear real N. O.

I admired the way the author attempted to highlight the sometimes unwarrented suspicion towards individual people based on thier ethnicity.Although a fictional plot, I enjoyed the way the author incorporated true Macedonian history within it. However, I think that the quotations presented before every chapter directed towards the ethnicity of modern Macedonians would have been more effective if Aleksandar Donski's work was not exclusively used.All in all, I found it to be a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, great baseball","review":"This book breaks new ground in sports fiction for kids by offering both a compelling coming-of-age story and a real appreciation for one child's love of baseball.

This is a sometimes emotional, always enjoyable, and ultimately satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, quick read!","review":"This book is great even if you aren't a big fan of baseball.

It's more of a \\"chicken soup...\\" type book than a book that can lead to improved poker play, that is, unless you're having trouble with the emotions of the game. It's not even an enjoyable read.

It main goal is to get you to understand the attitude you need to play the game. Even though the concept of Zen and poker are close to opposite, Phillips utilizes the the technique of keeping calm and not going on tilt. The book is full of general tips that are sometimes overlooked in the game.

As a poker player who dabbles in buddhism I found this approach fascinating, as well as very, very useful. This is book is clearly on my top 10 list of poker books. No advice on play, rather, it tells you how to keep from getting emotional over inevitable bad runs of cards. A must buy (and I hope all my opponants don't buy it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money","review":"If you want to become a great poker player or a zen master, don't expect that this book alone will do it for you. However, I believe the author is an experienced player who has great advice for dealing with losing streaks and being mentally prepared for a game. With an open mind you will benefit from this book. As with all books, they can't give you the experience and the discipline you need, but it probably will help point out leaks in your game you can correct over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Swindoll!","review":"Living Above the Level of Mediocrity is yet another fantastic title by Charles Swindoll.

Problems with the world's system.3. Be willing to minister to others out of the limelight.4. Soaring takes effort and requires eliminating negativity.5. Following Christ will cost us relationships, possessions, and personal goals/desires.6. Characteristics of people who positively impact others.7. Defining vision, determination, and dreaming.8.

A great read for young adults and even those seasoned adults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"It's understandable that most people concentrate on Gordon's Blue Note albums of the first half of the 60's, but the couple of perfectly fine albums he recorded in the mid-50's tend to get completely overlooked. That's a shame, because they represent an interesting interlude in his career, midway between the youthful rambunctiousness of his Savoy sides and the maturity of his Blue Notes. This album, for instance, alternates uptempo swingers with masterful ballads (thus the title). There's a straightforward quality to it that makes the Blue Note material seem to have a sour undertow in comparison. While that may be part of what gives the Blue Notes their complexity, like the proverbial fine wine, it's nice to occasionally have a shot of neat whiskey. The album Daddy Plays the Horn, from this same period, is equally good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything for the Church Soloist","review":"100+ pages were missing from this music book.

The work of Jack Schrader, the widely respected composer and arranger whose name appears as one of the authors, is visibly present in but a handful of the pieces, and even there his piano arrangements are not of the same caliber as those he has written for his choral anthems.Vocally, the arrangements on the whole lack soloistic touches. Few are through composed, there is an absence of interludes and bridges where the soloist might take a few breaths, no modulations, few alternative forms of the melody at the end of each work.Finally, the piano writing in the accompaniments is variable, at best. Some works have minimal accompaniment that follows the melody. Others, while sufficient, are unimaginative.

This book, of course, cites many different sources, and with those cites, they are clearly stated that these are the opinions and facts of the authors he is citing from. A good portion of the books I have read regarding raptors, the authors use pictures of wild birds where this book mostly uses pictures of captive birds; I was some what puzzled by this, but all the pictures are clearly marked.There are many tables and graphs in the book and where some are incomplete there is at least one where I questioned just how accurate the data actually was; I had to keep reminding myself that when I read this book, the opinions of the experts vary; I got the impression that the author was trying to give the reader the impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"More \\"dumbing down\\" of America","review":"The author asserts that EQ is the critical competency for success even in highly technical fields such as medicine and engineering. Yes individualism and ability are passe and what really matters is how well you can schmooze and get along with the team.

However, what I ended up getting is endless anecdotes.Goleman spends the entire book, listing anecdotes after anecdotes, explaining \\"why\\" emotional intelligence is important, but not \\"how\\" to become more emotionally intelligent.I do not need to know \\"why\\" EI is important; I bought the book, I know it is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potboiler followup to his original book on emotional intel","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. I read Goleman's original book on emotional intelligence and found it interesting. I purchased this book based on its title about working with emotional intelligence. I expected some guidance about how to work with people (employees) to improve aspects of their emotional intelligence. For example, how to help a person who is weak in self-confidence. This book, however, simply repeats the same thing over and over - company A instituted some training in emotional intelligence and it really helped them. Then, company B instituted some training ... Just like politics, helping people is 'local' or person-to-person. It appears that Goleman's answer to problems that people have is 'hire people who don't have those problems.' This book seems to be an attempt to profit from the success of his first book when he has nothing more to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on Anecdotes--But Short on Advice","review":"I began this book with great interest. With his excellent anecdotes, I quickly became fully convinced of the value of working with emotional intelligence. But instead of going on to make suggestions as to how a person could improve their own emotional inteligence, or how to help employees/managers in this area, he continued on and on with more anecdotes, clear until the end of the book. I didn't need any more convincing--I was already convinced by the first third of his book--I wanted him to give some advice about implementation, which he didn't give."},{"rating":"1","title":"more pablum for workplace freeloaders and diversity trainers","review":"Long live mindless, emotional, public and private bureaucracy!!!More biased, feel-good anti-individual propaganda.

However, I have seldom been able to look at the whole topic inside out.There are several items that I have learned after reading.1. EI can learn at any age2. EI is not favourable to any gender.3. People implicitly evaluate your EI to decide who is more suitable for a senior position.4.

The author's claim that emotional intelligence is more important than raw smarts for effectiveness at work (a point that many other reviewers griped about) rung very true as I considered the many people I've worked with and managed.Several other reviewers complained that the book does not offer any fresh or new ideas from his previous or other books. This may be true, but this book was my first reading on the topic of emotional intelligence. I found it pretty well done and quite thought provoking. If you're looking for a self-help type book that will show you how to gain emotional intelligence for your job, this book will probably disappoint you. I don't think that's the intent of the book.The amount of selling for his consulting company seemed harmless and minimal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time and money","review":"Absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence. An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders.

The word \\"Working\\" seems to be the operative, but I didn't see many examples of \\"how\\" to work, but \\"why\\" it is important to have emotional intelligence.If you are looking for answers on how to modify your behavior to enhance your relationships, or working better with people, then you might have to look elsewhere.In reading the book I felt like Mr. Goleman was trying to fill the pages rather than give concise content. This book would have been better at 1/4 the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was expecting I would get information on IMPROVING my EQ. However the book only tells how EQ is important in working place but never provide methods on HOW TO IMPROVE it.

Goleman's previous book was insightful and did not carry the obvious plugging of his EQ consulting service. The book offered no new ideas and only contributed to muddying the construct of emotional intelligence. Goleman is following (maybe leading) the group of individuals trying to cash in on the \`hot' idea of EQ in corporate America.

Psychological Bulletin, 124(2), 262-274.In fact, IQ is the best predictor of work performance (correlating .51 with work performance across various jobs). There is no, I repeat no, credible evidence, apart from Goleman's endless unsubstantiated anecdotes, backing Goleman's claims. He has never published anything in a credible academic journal, and it is absolutely amazing that so many people who are uniformed but well-intentioned, have followed his advice.

The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner. I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible. It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?

If you want to read about practical applications of emotional intelligence in the work place then this is what this book is about. I only gave it two stars because I think that the whole book should be summarised into 20-30 pages and just added as a chapter to the original work. Its important to read about the applications of emotional intelligence, but in this book you end up reading the same story over and over again with different companies and different people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sequel With No New Idea","review":"It looks like the author is trying to spread his gospel of EQ to the business world. His message is, to succeed in business, your organization needs to become an emotionally intelligent organization. It should be full of EQ staff. Or, to put it the other way around, if you want to succeed in an organization, you should be an EQ person. Then he goes at length to tell stories to support his proposition.Unlike Emotional Intelligence, this sequel is light in contents. The book is loaded with interviews and observations. There is almost no new idea for those who have read EQ.

Although it's age (1920s) gives it an oddly antiquated tone, Thompson has written a fair biography of his subjsect, neither demonizing nor cannonizing the Incorruptible (although his assesment is generally favorable). The best thing about this gigantic work, however, is that Thompson has room to quote... extensively. This is where you can find the entire text of his Declaration of Rights, big chunks or speeches, etc. I wouldn't recommend buying it, but it's definitely worth a look in the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item broken upon receipt","review":"Unfortunatly when I opened the box and attempted to use the new device it did not work.

For those about to rock","review":"In the late 1980s hard rock got a bad name for being all about parties and big hair... While a lot of it was true, there were some other bands as well. The band in hand is the perfect exemple for that. Long before all the hype about the music from Seattle, Mother Love Bone was paying tribute to the great hard rock of the 1970s. And the end result was total magic. Take Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Elton John, Queen, T Rex and Red Hot Chili Peppers, mix it all together and drink. Enjoy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING, HOW COULD ANYONE PUT THIS DOWN?!!","review":"I purchased this album on a whim while shopping at my local CD store and i can honestly say without hyperbole, it was the best $10.74 i will ever spend in my life. Andy Wood was a man who had a gift to share with the world, but forces beyond our control always seem to take the great ones when theres still music left to write. Secondly, get over these \\"grunge\\" comparisons, Love Bone sounds nothing like any of the bands of the time, not to put down the early 90's at all, which i believe was the musical high point in american rock n' roll. Support all bands from Seattle but please, enough with the \\"grunge\\" comparisons, grunge isn't even a real musical genre, its merely a blanket term for all the bands coming out of Seattle, even though none of them sound nothing alike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Albumn Shangrila","review":"Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.

A truly beautiful piec of art can make us look at our surroundings a little differently than we ever had before, it can make us interact with others in a manner we never have before, and we can eek out just a little bit more enjoyment from life because of it. As a young man, I picked up this album on a whim (I just liked their name). Little did I know how much I would be affected by this brilliant man's take on life.

The incredibly stupid actions of the military team members are an insult to the intelligence of all humans.I give the film one star for Cuba who did a respectable job of keeping a straight face while delivering such obviously flawed lines. There is nothing he could have possibly done to pull this film out of the hell-hole or bottomless pit that it resides in. I made the mistake of not knowing this was a straight to DVD release.

It's obvious that the script writers, actors and director have a psychological issue with how they've spent their lives in Hollywood boutiques and are overcompensating by creating toughness the easiest way they know how - let's talk tough. Besides the totally, totally unbelievable tough guy/woman acting was the single day rental fee for a helicopter and some industrial warehouse basement to provide the obligatory concrete passages and steam piping.

Nothing in my collection looks anywhere near this bad, and I have shows of all ages and types. Oh, and the extras. There aren't any. Double shame on Paramount.This just another case of Paramount figuring they can sell junk because the fan base is so loyal. The did something similar with the Star Trek series: good quality in that case, but no extras and exorbitant pricing (which they are only now starting to change).

I am a loyal fan of Mr. Duchovny. I own all his movies as well as the complete X-Files series. Throughout the entire movie, I kept waiting for something to happen. I figured out, at the very beginning, that it was a story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story which was very confusing. The grainy quality of the \\"real\\" story made it seem amateurish. I was disappointed that David Duchovny only had about four scenes. He made the most of his few scenes, however,even though they were at the very end. What I didn't expect was his character's death from auto-erotic asphixiation. If the point of the movie is that Hollywood celebrity-types lead boring, pointless, empty lives, it lived up to its expectations. The \\"f\\" word was used too many times. Whoever wrote the dialogue has a very limited vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, Boring, Rudderless","review":"Apparently the script, sound equipment and several cameras were lost on the way to the set of this dull film.I imagine the director telling his actors: \\"More mumbling--more mumbling!

A bunch of LA people with direct and tangenital ties to the entertainment business wander along for two hours--that's the story. Woopee.The one and only redeeming thing in this meandering piece of junk is the veterinarian who comes to check out David Hyde Pierce's sick dog and sticks around to eat hash brownies.

That is something that I don't say very often because I am the one that likes B movies. The only reason that I would have given this movie 2 stars would have been that David Duchovny was totally nude. Well, the scene was about 2 seconds long, blurry and shot at an angle that you knew that he had something between his legs, but you really couldn't see it well enough to say it was worth the movie price.

I believe that many will not like it b/c it does not feed them the same mindless pap that studios are offering this summer, i.e. Austin Powers, XXX, and Mr. Deeds. This film, thus, is not for everyone. What it has to say about reality is very important, and many will not like its postmodern aura b/c it so closely resembles our lives, and it is true. The film was insightful, funny, and moving to the point that it made me feel uncomfortable about my presuppositions, my philosophy, and the way I live my life.

The idea is to show how much you can accomplish on a shoestring, with the actors encouraged to improvise. Despite the emphasis on craft, the actors come across as playing themselves. David Duchovny is bored; Katherine Keener is beautiful but arrogant; Blair Underwood is just arrogant and so on.What this actually shows is how you can take some of the hottest actors in the world and make a self-absorbed and spectacularly dull movie. Woody Allen might have been able to breathe some life into this. Maybe.How dull? I rented Full Frontal along with Jackass. Hard to say which was more painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Interesting ideas regarding the movie's structure, some good acting, but ultimately - very VERY boring. The fact that the actors had to apply their make up themselves just doesnt make it worth seeing (unless you need some sleep).

Too bad, really, since the chuckles only started to occur after the proceedings had worn you absolutely down, and twenty minutes into the picture you were only JUST starting to get exasperated. Could be that this film works better on the small screen, which I found to be the case with Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\", another excruciating experience. Warning!

He's charming, sexy, handsome, but he wants to put Ebet under for sending him to jail.This shows a new side to Pierce. The character of Neil Skinner is very strong. He is determined to win back Sheila's affections. She never really did fall for Ebet. I think she just tells him that.I loved this one, but it could have been longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Ensemble Movie","review":"I want to say right off, shame on you, HBO, for not releasing this fine movie on DVD..And having said that- this movie is yet another reason that Pierce Brosnan is one of the coolest male actors around. He plays Neil Skinner-who gets a rag-tag bunch of friends to dish out one of the best doses of get-even that has been filmed. I highly recommend this over-looked jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brosnan's good, but movie doesn't make it around the track","review":"This movie is a poorly made farce, on a par with a bad \\"I Love Lucy\\" episode. Its only virtues are a fine performance by Pierce Brosnan, showing the \\"action\\" talent he later developed as Thomas Crowne and James Bond, and the Gypsy Kings' cover of \\"My Way\\".Chewing gum for the mind.Deserves zero stars, if it weren't for Brosnan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"this is a movie with extroadinary beauty. it simply is a movie that every movie \\"buff\\" must see. i think it is something that is not only catchy but at the same time mind blowing. it is a must buy and i promise you wont be disappointed. buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it again!","review":"With this disc, Blank and Jones have really staked their claim as the dominating force in the world of catchy, accessible trance. This CD begins with the favorite \\"Beyond Time\\", which most trance fans have heard in countless mixes. Next comes the infectious italo-flavored \\"Deejays Fans and Freaks\\", which should stick in your head for weeks like is has in mine. Now comes the title track, an uplifting trance stormer in the vein of \\"The Nightfly\\" (with the trademark female whisper announcing the title). After that the CD just keeps on cruising, with hit after hit. I've almost worn my copy out.Note: You _must_ check out the video for \\"Deejays Fans and Freaks\\" if you get a chance. A hilarious 80s throwback that goes perfectly with the fun flavor of the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Rugrats CD EVER!","review":"For me being a huge Rugrats fan, I don't know how to say it, but this wonderful music makes me whole. Mark M. did a great job blending his all-too familar Rugrats music with a full-fledged Orchestra. I would say its much better than the Original Soundrack released before the movie. I strongly encourage all Rugrats fans to buy this CD, it is so powerful in every way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understated","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. True it's not a classic war film but it stands out among the run-of-the-mill TV type of fare. The ending was curiously muted but it made the film raise itself a few notches. The weaponry was accurate (although I doubt the silencers used on both pistol and carbine were WW2 issue) and the uniforms tally with the photographs I have seen of USMC reconnaisance units. Definitely Hugh O'Brian's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!!!","review":"Lucky for me, I saw this movie on TV and did not waste my money on buying it. I my opinion, this is one of the worst WWII movies that I have ever seen. It would be a lot easier to list the good points of the movie however, there are none. Its a very bad \\"B\\" war movie; the acting is really bad, blood looks like red paint, soldiers make stupid moves & of course get killed, the Japanese use American tanks, very bad music that plays in the background, etc. Basically, it is a very cheap movie and it shows right from the beginning. I'm not sure what movie was worse; Ambush Bay or Anzio!!If you want to see good WWII movies, then watch: 12 o'clock High, Sink The Bismark, Objective Burma, They Were Expendable, Battleground, Wing And A Prayer, Battle of Britain, The Train, Run Silent Run Deep, Das Boat,The Great Escape, Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, Where Eagles Dare, The Longest Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambush Bay -- not art","review":"Ambush Bay is not art. It is not entertainment. It is not even interesting. Ambush Bay is without a doubt one of the worst WWII movies ever produced. The best part of this movie is Robert Mitchum's red cap, worn while he is in the Philippine jungle hiding from Japanese soldiers. Red cap.... Why not wear universal orange?I've seen the movie twice. Once with the sound on. It was awful. I watched it again, with the sound off. It was better this second time. It had the feel, without sound, of an ok comedy. With the sound it was pathetic.Don't both buying it. Spend your money on something more useful or entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading!","review":"This has been a great new series for me.

I never knew what I liked about it, but all I know is I've loved ever since I was 5 years old (I'm 12 now). The music is just wonderful. There's just no better way to say it. The Lion King 2 wasn't as good as the first one, but the music was absolutely amazing. There are some similarities between the songs, such as \\"Be Prepared\\" and \\"My Lullaby\\", \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\\" and \\"Love Will Find a Way\\", and \\"Circle of Life\\" and \\"He Lives in You\\". Overall, the music is amazing. I loved the movies, and I loved the music. Anyone who loved the movies will love this CD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of Ike & Tina","review":"I was unfamiliar with Ike and Tina before buying this album, other than hearing the live version of \\"Proud Mary\\". This is raw, blistering music. Mostly it's their late 60's, early 70's work. The whole collection works out to approx 160 mins (~40 mins/disc), so they might have fit the whole thing on 3 CDs, but it's still an excellent value for $... Although it's missing some of their hits, all of the songs are worth listening to, and I'm not sure where you can find a larger Ike & Tina collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Unbelievable","review":"This is real deal hard-core blues and rock and roll.

If you liked Cardcaptor Sakura and you're ready to graduate to something with highschool characters, this is the anime. Like Cardcaptor Sakura, wands and cards are used but not in the same ways. There's romance and perversion and lots of comedy and flying underwear... You'll have to see for yourself. I loved it very much! It's reccomended if you like other Mahou Shoujo anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned","review":"Lots of people like this series, but I can't personally call it better than \\"mildly amusing.\\" In fact, it's generally so \\"fan service\\" and insipid humor based that it's barely even watchable.

I wonder if most teenage boys really think like that. Somehow I feel a bit sorry for Takakura,...but anyway...I just can't understand it: what's with the aliens?! It seems that every other anime series has to have megalomaniac evil aliens trying to take over the world, and only a group of cutesy Japanese teenagers can save us! Needless to say, this series has abundant cliches.Also, I thought Sae's teddy bear was creepy, and I didn't understand the part where all these teddy bears dance in the forest. It was supposed to be cute, but it just confused me and creeped me out.

Here's a good example: Lawrence Olivier is cast as Mr. Creakle, and he's wonderful, he's OLIVIER, but he's on screen for maybe a total of two minutes, before the screenplay dashes madly on...The screenwriter, by the way, is totally out of his mind, framing the story in flashbacks...Oh, it's a shame. Ralph Richardson is perfect as Mr. Micawber, but there isn't TIME to develope any character, not even Micawber! Aunt Betsy, Mr. Dick? They come and go, as if they were simply walk-ons!

Im more of a fan of the DEEP tissue kneading type massages, so if this sounds like you, not sure if you'd like this product. also, the operator's (needs 2 person for this thing to work) hands can also get uncomfortable from the vibrations. i figured the only way to know was to try it out, im sad to say i had to return immediatley. oh well, will continue to look for something that will come close to human hands....*sigh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME MASSAGER!","review":"THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME MASSAGER FOR ANY ONE THAT HAS BACK ISSUES!

Although it was the variable speed model, the lowest speed was far too agressive. It actually caused our skin to itch. It was not relaxing to us at all. We went back to our Homedics unit as this was much more comforting, lighter, and more soothing. We returned it and because we purchased it from a third party, we had to pay a 10% restocking fee and shipping costs to and from our home. Not a good experience at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot dog massager","review":"Had a hard time tracking down this type of massager . We had one similar to it that lasted years. If you want an easy going unit , easy to handle , this ain't it . The thing is heavy ,takes both hands to control it , is not a flat pad so it takes some effort to guide it along. However , has a varible switch to cut down the power, on high it will rock. If you want a massager that will do the job this is the one you want .

After using the Jeanie massager for about a half hour before I went to bed. I did not feel any pain in my right leg or my right shoulder. I slept all night and was not woken either by the pain in my right leg or my right shoulder falling asleep. I would highly recommend your product to anyone that has muscle pain or pinched nerves.

Imagine how gender non-conforming children feel to have their likes ridiculed in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending does not ring true","review":"Yes, the two irrepressibly cute characters in this book do indeed share everything. In fact, in the end the boy and girl end up taking off their clothes and switching them with each other while in their kindergarten classroom. Having taught kindergarteners within the last five years, this ending rang completely false with me. This is NOT behavior typical of kindergarteners, but more that of toddlers and young preschoolers. The kindergarteners I taught would not be caught dead taking their clothes off at school! Munsch strikes out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Message!","review":"I read this book to my son for the first time today, and it will be the last. He is 4 years old and has shown me he is greatly affected by what I read to him in books. He has imitated words as well as actions from stories we have read together. Therefore, I'm careful as to what I expose him to at this young age. Maybe when he's older, he'll understand more about the world and know enough to realize when an author is writing in jest - but for now...I can just see him taking his clothes off in school because he wants to \\"share\\" them with another classmate!!!I can hear the call from the principal now, \\"Your son was stark naked in class today - trying to get Mary to try on his shirt - and thinking the whole thing was funny!\\"He's going to pick up enough actions that aren't appropriate on his own without me giving him more ideas through story time.I wouldn't recommend this book for a child age Kindergarten or younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"What agenda are we touting?","review":"I enjoy Robert Munsch's book \\"Love You Forever\\" so was excited to see that my daughter picked up this book. However, after she read it to me I was not so excited. I feel that this book is showing children that it is okay for boys to wear girl's clothes. That may be okay for some people, but in my house where we believe the Bible calls for a man to marry a woman, it is not okay with me. I was disappointed in this book. I feel that it has a veiled agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny book!","review":"My sons and I could not stop laughing while reading this book! Mr. Munsch has a humorous way of bringing up a frequently discussed topic at that age -- sharing.

I should have read it entirely before buying it. The sarcasm was lost on her (obviously), but I agree with the other reviewer who said that this book relies on gendered stereotypes and bad behavior. Boys and girls can wear whatever they want, and while it's obviously inappropriate for school-aged children to undress in class, that was not the issue the teacher in the book focused on. She focused on the boy wearing pink. It's also really confusing to younger readers who are being taught that they have to learn to share, which the 2- and 3-year-old set are trying to learn. There's nothing wrong with a kindergarten teacher telling her students they have to share classroom materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Share Everything","review":"This book is about two kids, a boy named Jeremiah and a girl named Amanda. It's their first day of kindergarten. At first they did't share anything. My favorite part is when Jeremiah tried what worked on his little brother. He screamed so loud that he could break a window. My other favorite part is when Amanda tried what worked on her older brother. She kicked over Jeremiah's tower. I think other kids my age and younger will like this book because it has great illustrations and funny events. It also has very easy words. Read to find out if they share at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"we share everything an ok book","review":"The book We Share everything was good book. My favorite part was when Jeremiah and Amanda were fighting for everything. The funniest part was when they where changing their shoes.

It provides a good fit for her with little tendency to roll back. Chin strap with a plastic clasp is a cinch to do and undo. It adjusted just right to keep everything in place. She says it is comfortable and has no complaints about any hot spots from ill-placed pads, and I see no red marks from pressure points after she wears it. No durability issues after a year of using this - no cracks, no heat degradation, no color fading and it even seems to have pretty good scratch resistance...all the color is intact with no obvious damage after a year.

However, I am a full-grown adult, not a child, so I advise you to be careful if buying this for younger kids or kids with smaller heads. I actually had to use the thicker comfort pads to get the right fit and I am not a small person (though my head is about 21 inches around and I'm not sure what average is). A helmet that's too big provides too much wiggle room and is pretty useless if you actually need it to protect your head, since it'll move and not protect your skull and could even cause further injury.Be sure to measure you or your child's head before buying!

It fits almost perfectly with no added pads, it didn't slip down to cover her face.Now I can let her ride her scooter without too much worry. On a side note, we also got a decorate yourself mirror as well, I have a feeling that the helmet might get some glitter and faux jewels applied when we do that :)Fits well for kids who don't fit in the typical \\"Toddler\\" \\"Child\\" or \\"5+\\" helmets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool look and great protection","review":"My daughter loves the cool look vs the dorky bike helmet and I love the full head protection.

Have not had time for a high speed run but have bombed a very small hill. Wheels seems a lot more stable then the S9's. I have not had any speed wobles yet or make my trucks(Indy 169s) go crazy like the S9's. A little disappointed in the speed of these wheels, my S9 seem faster. I am using Bones Red China Bearings.

As a child I heard my grandparents talk of the things covered in this book. I realise they were the lucky ones to have lived in such simple times. Men and woman were truely free and a man's word was his bond.

Funny is Lenny Live at Carnegie Hall, his albums and the \\"Thank You Masked Man\\" cartoon included on this DVD. If you are familiar with Bruce's work before seeing this you will likely be filled with little more than just sadness at the sight of what years of legal problems did to a funny man.It's a good historical document and if you want laughs, at least the cartoon is funny but you will find much better examples of Lenny Bruce the comic in all of his glory on his albums and the exhaustive box set \\"Let The Buyer Beware\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenny Bruce, rare video that up and coming acts would appreciate.","review":"There was so little film shot of Lenny's standup it's almost criminal, there are more recordings but still an insufficient body of work to represent his contributions to the field of improvisation, standup and just plain straight observation, perhaps true reality.\\"I'm not trying to be funny, this is how I see things\\" was Lenny's explanation.Society’s knee jerk reaction to anything it doesn't understand, and the jail time he received for speaking his mind to people that not only wanted to hear but paid to hear his thoughts.I was expelled from school when they found that I attended every performance I could get to, ahaa my Chicago of the 50's & 60'sThe Performance Film is of reasonably good quality for a \\"live filming / recording\\" in a nightclub, especially considering the rather crude emerging technologies of the day, and unfortunately this is about all there is of Lenny...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as expected","review":"I wanted vitamins for my 2 year old that he wouldn't think were candy like the gummis he had before.

A more balanced look into the causes of the Mutiny will be found in Richard Hough's Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian. This book is the basis of the Hopkins/ Gibson Movie. The other movies are based on the Nordoff/Hall writings. The second book of the trilogy seems to be an accurate description of the open boat journey which Bligh and the non-muntineers endured. This book seems based on Bligh's written account. The third book of the trilogy is loosely based on what happened to Flecther Christian and his fellow mutineers after they settled on Pitcairn Island. Little historical fact is actually known about the fate of the mutineers.Thus, this part of the trilogy is, almost out of neccesity, complete speculation.

The script is extraordinarily weak; try counting the cliches. The casting was poor. And only a few of the star-studded musical numbers are successful. Tony Martin, Dinah Shore, Lena Horne, and Frank Sinatra were all at their peak of their vocal powers, of course, and they do well. Judy Garland's numbers are acceptable, although you can tell that she was starting to come unglued. But beyond that, all is embarrassment. And nothing is believable. Indeed, this film should be a cult classic, shown at midnight with the audience throwing things at the screen during particularly awful melodramatic moments and dancing in the aisles during the June Allyson numbers.

Judy Garland's numbers are top notch, along with the rest of them. Unfortunately, this film must have slipped into public domain, and the company who picked up the rights to doing a DVD print are not sticklers for quality! Since Warner Brothers now has the MGM library, if the DVD doesn't say Warner Home Video on it, you may want to get the VHS version instead. :-) Hopefully, sometime in the future, Warner Brothers will get the rights back to do a DVD, and get it done in nice crystal clear mastering.

Imagine my astonishment when I found a used copy for 12.50!The disclaimer in the booklet said that the music was not recorded under perfect conditions, but it sounds great to my ears - it is some the most sophisticated and complex I've ever heard, and yet it is so listenable and likeable that I had a had a hard time pulling it off my CD player.

It's bad enough that they drive like they're leading a parade in the fast lane, but then they la-la along in the righthand lane when I'm trying to merge or ride my bumper when we're the only cars on the freeway, and then hoist up a finger in defiance when I cuss them out and bang on the dash like an irritated monkey.

This film deals with memory loss and does not jump around quite as much as others of its kind like Memento. The bad guys are believable and the driving scenes on the dark, winter roads coupled with some intense action at a bank are also thrilling.

You have to hand it to him, he has chosen his post-TV roles wisely, (it's clear he has a solid agent working for him).Jeff Daniels delivers one of his most interesting performances to date; the guy owns it whenever he's on screen here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Not To Be Missed!","review":"I got around to watching this movie & was floored with the performances.Joseph Gordon Levitt & Jeff Daniels are spectacular in this movie.

What made me want to read the book was watching The Last Don on TV and the next day I went to check out The Godfather from the library, and I couldn't put it down from the moment I came home. Now I'm reading The Last Don and loving it, because Marion Puzo is a born-authentic-storyteller and in Mafia stories NO ONE CAN COMPARE I don't think this book will get a bad review now or 20 years from now but if such a person exists then he is a FOOL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"I first read The Godfather in 1969, when it came out in hardcover, and I knew at that time that a classic was born. Today, I gave myself a 60th birthday present and finished my second reading of this book. After over 36 years, The Godfather remains a masterpiece of not only great crime fiction, but of modern literature. The Godfather introduced millions of readers (and later, moviegoers) to the first family of American crime, the Corleones, and their powerful legacy of tradition, blood and honor. The seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed and the allegiance to family are the themes that resonate throughout this excellent book, and continue to make The Godfather the definitive novel of the violent subculture that will remain etched in my consciousness forever. If you've never read the book, perhaps because you've seen the movie -- fuhgetaboutit! Do yourself a favor and read Mario Puzo's The Godfather. It is truly an American classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the Hype","review":"Absolutely excellent. As a big fan of the Godfather movies, I decided it was time to give the book a read, and I'm glad I did.

Both are truly great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mafiabook that I ever read!","review":"This book shows you the life of mafia from the side, which you never knew about, unless you are a member of it. A group called \\"mafia\\", without feelings and with own traditions and laws is not the only thing the story is about. It is a story about a family, with his own history and problems. And you can be for the short time a member of them.

And the book isn't bad, but it is not as dramatic, cerebral, or complex as the film.It is clear that in the film version Francis Ford Copolla and the stellar cast (Marlin Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall) improved upon almost every aspect of the book. They turned what is a decent paperback crime novel into high art, and I don't see how anyone can watch the film and not be disappointed by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LASGS (Global Studies Students)","review":"Spectacular! This book is the best that we have read. You will never be able to put this book down because of all the action packed adventures. Mario Puzzo brought us into the world of crime, adventure, romance, betrayal, vengeance, and culture. This book will show you the true meaning of crime. Although, the changing of scenery makes a real puzzling and unique book, some readers feel it confuses them from the story. To conclude, we believe this book is a masterpiece of this generation and generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse...","review":"\\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse...\\" just gotta love that line...classic Vito Coreleone. That is from the single greatest Italian-mafia novel ever: The Godfather. Written by Mario Puzo this novel has it all: sex, violence, the workings of a hierarchal (don't know if I spelt that correctly, forgive me)organized crime group. Puzo executes this story line flawlessly with plenty of wacks, assaults, and dead horse heads. Pick this up if you want a great action packed read w\\\\an exceptional story line. Don't pick this up if too much gore bothers you, or if illicit sex in a novel bothers you.\\"Keep your friends close but your enemies closer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Godfather Mario Puzo kindle edition - not available in NZ :(","review":"why are some books not available in the Pacific regions - These are more not available.No mention is made of the fact that we down here can't get the full collection of Kindle BooksI would be pleased to hear when they will be made available and at least to be warned about this fact!The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand,The Gatekeepers, a book about the US college admission process - not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mafia Saga","review":"Mario Puzo's The Godfather started America's fascination with the Mafia. Prior to the book, most people didn't know about this subculture. We knew about gangsters like Al Capone and the like, but not about the families. As we all know, The Godfather is about the Corleone family lead by the Don Vito Corleone. The book follows the path of The Godfather Saga movie which combines the two movies in a more chronological pattern. If you've seen the movies, you can see that they follow the book quite closely. Most of what happens in the movies unfolds in the book. The difference between the two is that the book fleshes out lesser characters like Luca Brassi and explains situations like how Michael gets back to America from Italy that due to time constraints, the movie can't into. If you loved the movies, then you'll love the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than the Movie","review":"As is usually true of books which have movies based upon them, The Godfather is better in print form, but this surprised me since I would rank The Godfather as one of the best movies ever. This book about the Corleone Family, really defines the mafia genre and has not been equalled in the 32 years since it was written. The character development is phenomenal, the story lines are very well woven together and conceived, and the ethical lessons contained within the text are sometimes complex, but fascinating. It shocks me how little Coppola had to alter the story or the characters to create his masterpiece and it will be apparent to all who read it, Mario Puzo's Godfather, is a classic in its own right. You will be disappointed when the story is over, because you are so caught up in the lives of the Corleones that you just want to follow them further. I really can not say enough about this book, but I would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-reading the Godfather","review":"Somehow, I find myself reading this book time and again--it's like an old friend. And as one reads it, one is amazed at Puzo's ability to create characters that are so real in such an atypical setting as a crime family. There is not a single character without his or her own reality--from Mama Corleone who silently watches her husband meet his destiny and still goes every morning to church so that he doesn't go \\"down there\\", to Michael, who slowly gets drawn into the family business, and a life very different from the one he had originally planned as a math professor, to Nino Valenti, who'd rather die an alchoholic than be a Hollywood star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Watch the Movie Again","review":"Since The Godfather is one of my favorite films, I decided to read the novel, following the tenet that the book is always better than the movie. Oh goodness, not true in this case. Mario Puzo writes like a amateur. Example: He's goes on and on for 5 or 6 pages about something (details aren't important) and then actually WRITES \\"To make a long story short...\\". I gasped. Note, if the novel's writing style was conversational throughout, this would be acceptable. Much to my dismay, it's not.I found Puzo to be a quite lazy writer; he just doesn't take the time to think about a better way of forming his words and telling the story. So, I say if you enjoy the film as much as I do, and yearn for more background story and character development, please please shy away from this horrible piece of pulp. Just watch the movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"brilliant film; awful novel","review":"How Francis Ford Coppola found the inspiration for his two masterpieces is beyond me. The Corleone saga became Shakespearean only in Coppola's hands. Puzo is a hack, like John Grisham or Anne Rice. Paramount sought to turn this book into a cheap exploitation film, a crucial fact to ponder when appreciating the novel's \\"greatness.\\" Name one other novel of Puzo's that is even faintly memorable; chances are you cannot. He owes his entire reputation and fortune to the (early) genius and ambition of Coppola."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest there will Ever Be","review":"HANDS DOWN,BAR NONE,WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST PIECE OF ANY FORM OF WRITING THAT ANY HUMAN HAS EVER CREATED.

The first sequel is the second greatest American movie after Citizen Kane. But the novel is [bad]. The sex and violence are the point, whereas in the films family and honor and corruption were just a few of the points. The novel is written amateurishly and comes off as just sleazy.

This was more than a little surprising since the Godfather is one of my favorite movies. This book is so bad it is hard to understand why Coppola decided to make the movie, although I am glad he did. The hackneyed prose and added attention to the Johnny Fontane character make for pure boredom. If you are contemplating reading this book, I suggest devoting your time to watching the movies instead.

It had a brilliant plot, well devolped, interesting characters, and, even though I saw the movie before reading the book and knew what would happen, still amazed and dazzled me with the pure power of the writing and the engrossing plot. One almost feels as if the Corleone family and the surrounding charcters were fact and the Godfather was history rather than fiction. An excellent and brilliant classic of a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best gangster book I've read so far","review":"Mario Puzo is my God. Bless him for he has written such an amazing book. I just got so engrossed in it. I didn't want it to end. Even though I knew what was going to happen (because of the movie) it was still much more interesting to read it. I thought Donnie Brasco was the best gangster novel, but this just blows it out of the water. Somebody whose never read a book in their life could easily enjoy this one. Very highly recommended to anyone whose interested in the life of an old fashioned gangster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"A truly great novel.

Absolutely compelling from start to finish, exquisitely researched and written. What a story! What characters! And even though I experienced the film and book in reverse chronology, they are perfect companions... I'm compelled to read more Puzo, yet worried I may be let down...this was so much fun! (if all that bloodshed and gore can be FUN) If you haven't read it, do so! If you have, do it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No one writes better than Mario","review":"Mario Puzo -IMO- was one of the best storytellers out there in the history of the printed word. His stories are concise but informative and his characters are well developed. Even the bit players in the supporting cast of this novel have a story that makes the reader care about them. I was particularly interested in the character development of Lucy Mancini -who- if you recall -in the film version- was a peripheral character that Sonny Corleone boffed on the side. The book supplied Lucy with a background and another boyfriend following Sonny's untimely demise as well a rather interesting peculiarity which I won't divulge here.There is also better insight into Johnny Fontane's character. Although well developed in the flick, the novel does a much better job of giving depth to Fontane's life & career.If you enjoyed the movie by the same name then read this book. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic!!!","review":"I read this thirty years ago and loved it. I picked it up again and started to read it, and could not put it down. It's a great story with amazing characters. It's funny, exciting and very poignant. The world of organized crime comes totally alive. I never reread books because there are so many potentially great books I've never read. My son passed on his copy of The Godfather to me, and I'm glad he did. My second time through, it was still one of my favorite reads of the year. An all-time favrite! It is certainly not dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of American Literature","review":"The Godfather is a phenominom. It is one of the highest grossing films of all time and won three oscars. The novel is where it all began.Mario Puzo was a well established writer by the time he wrote this book...with the critics. His first two books, The Dark Arena, in 1955, and The Fortunate Pilgrim, in 1965, both flops with the buying public but well received with critics when Puzo published his third novel, The Godfather in 1969, it was a hit and spent a record sixty some weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List.Puzo, after writing the first two books and not getting the success he wanted, turned to writing about mafia anecdotes he had heard while growing up in New York. The book was an instant success and came to the attention of the great film director Francis Ford Coppola who wanted to make a movie based on the book and the rest is history.After loving the movie so much, I would like nothing more than to reach bliss by reading the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece...","review":"I don't get why everyone likes the movie so much more. This book contains subplots that were vastly important, but that the movie lacked. Johnny Fontane's struggles were heart-wrenching. Santino's girlfriend, and the doctor were a perfect diversion. And the cop turn hit-man was a wonderful look into what must have happened to Luca Brasi. And this Godfather is not a thinly veiled thug like the one Marlon Brando played. He's a caring person, who sometimes has to have people killed for what he sees as the greater good."},{"rating":"2","title":"New fan for an old classic","review":"I found a copy in an old box of books in the garage.

At times, I found myself daydreaming or bogged down with the book's small details. But overall, I enjoyed the excellent character development.

It was an interesting, although sometimes arduous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Godfather","review":"I loved this book. I read because a friend said it was a good book. I also read it because, I didn't understand the movie. This book has a lot of detail in it. This a great book, for anyone. But I would have little children read this book, because there is sex and violence. It is about the Corleone flamily. They are a New York Mafia family. It is mostly about the head of this family, Don Vito Corleone. He is dies and his son, Micheal becomes the godfather. The reason they are called 'Godfather' is because they are godfather to different people in there family.

A populist novel which was site controversial in its time, this novel is now considered a masterpiece and rightfully so. The characters inhabit their archetypes so fully that they literally explode out of them, becoming the flesh and blood characters that echo in our shared cultural consciousness. The cautionary tale of Michael Corleone's fall from idealistic war vet to calculating crime boss is the story of the American Dream as it became the American Nightmare.And what economy of language! This expansive epic is brisk throughout, author stepping back to let the grandeur and the horror of his characters' lives play out. No wonder this novel continues to inspire and impress.

So let me bring up the drawbacks. 1) Real mafiosi are not this articulate or intellectual -- as the characters are -- nor do they have quite the sense of honor. 2) The book makes up in content and story what it lacks in style. It is not a deep vivid emotional tour of individuals, but alot of good stories efficiently told.

It is well-written, sustains a lively pace, and intertwines a gang of interesting characters.

It's terrible. The drums on every song sound like some 80's metal producer got a a hold of them. Giant cannon type reverbs on the drums that do not fit the southern rock or blues style. No screaming southern rock guitar signature licks. The songs are sub par at best in writing and and performance quality. Take a listen for your self at their official website and make your own judgement. This IMHO. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATB-Dedicated=Execellent","review":"I have always liked ATB anyways. This is nothing like Movin Melodies or Dreamsc. It has a new differnt sound moving from the high temo dance to the soft core trance. I thourghully loved this cd and would recomend it to anyone one likes the trance/dance scene. Just remeber its not like 9 pm til I come. It is smooth around the corners. Not so sharp. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION","review":"...I adore Roberta Carter's voice and I think it complements ATB's style. While this CD is not your usual trance from ATB it still produces some great tracks. I will agree that the album isn't fully realized. There is something missing, but it's headed in the right direction. There are some chilled out moments like \\"Get High\\" which are great. Then you also have some pounding trance. I am personally a sucker for Roberta Carter's voice so that is the real draw for me. I loved \\"Let U Go\\" on ATB's previous disc Two Worlds so I enjoy every track including Carter's voice. I really enjoyed this CD and I recommend that you give it a listen. Make up your own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"ATB returns with his new 2002 release that includes the hit single \\"Hold You\\". Other outstanding tracks on the disc are \\"Halcyon\\", \\"Hero\\", and \\"I Wanna Cry\\". This is a must-have techno album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lumpy Oatmeal","review":"As stated before, there's really nothing original or attention grabbing on this CD. It's kind of sad, because I'm a big fan of Andre's creations. Roberta's voice (Gal from Wild Strawberries) can be heard on every other track; she has a beautiful voice, but the lyrics don't do her justice. Let's just say, on \\"Hero,\\" it sounds like Roberta was nippin' in the sauce. If you want an ATB CD, go for Two Worlds- it flows a lot better, and the songs differ more than on Dedicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step towards maturity","review":"I had to step in after reading those mediocre reviews! I agree that a majority of the album is filler, but the collaborations with the Wild Strawberries are fantastic. ATB has always veered towards the cheesy side, yet, with the unique vocals of Roberta Carter Harrison on \\"Hold You,\\" \\"Let U Go,\\" \\"Hero\\" and \\"I Wanna Cry,\\" the songs are the most mature work ATB's produced, and best of all, the tracks would fill any dance floor. My favourite track with Roberta has to be the remake of Olive's \\"You're Not Alone.\\" Even though I'm a huge fan of Olive (Get their album \\"Trickle\\" everyone!), I have to say this one out does the original -- especially after the 3 minute mark when it just sizzles! Highly recommended, if only for the five tracks mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally ATB hits the mark!","review":"Believe or not I throughly enjoy Dedicated. I own both of ATB'solder albums (TWO Worlds and Moving Melodies) and I must say that the energy of Dedicated far surpasses both of those discs. Sure there is Let U Go from Two Worlds on here and many call that a \\"filler\\" but the song sounds completely different from the Two Worlds release. Halcyon is another great TUNE which just makes you want to jump on the dance floor.The album has its share of weak tune, I Can't Stand It comes to minds since it is so much more down tempo than the rest of the album.All in all a very above average release. If you enjoy techno/pop than this is the cd for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"If you love Red Garland's piano style, and are looking at this album because it was recorded late in his career, and thinking that it would be good to hear a more mature Red - forget it! Red is not bad, though not up to his old 1950's class of playing, but the tracks with altoist Leo Wright totally destroy this album. The liner notes say that Leo just happened to be passing by, and Red asked him to join them for the recording. It is a shame for us that Leo did not just keep on walking. He tries to emulate John Coltrane's playing, without having even a quarter of the talent Coltrane had in his little finger! Do yourself a favour and give this CD a miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for fencing students.","review":"This is a useful volume -- for anyone contemplating a stint as a teacher of fencing.

Well for a start there a lot more of Tom to dig and it depends entirely upon the genre of the Waits' album you're making the comparison with. Closing Time, Nighthawks at the Diner, Heart of Saturday Night are jazz albums entirely unlike Extremely Cool in anyway and therefore irrvevlant to comparison.

Boring blues cliches, boring old time rocknroll cliches, pretentious poetry cliches: it's all here. I finally sat down to listen to it on the 'phones last night to see if I'd missed something in the first dozen or so listenings. Nope--there's nothing there. There's some pretty sharp musicianship here, a nicely ripped off bebop riff but basically this is a wasteland of stuff dredged up from the ash heap of the fifties rock and blues standard text. I'm amazed at both the cynicism of the record companies selling this thing as a product of \\"Tom Waits' best friend\\" and my own stupidity for falling for it. I'm sure Picasso had a best friend too but we don't hear much about him.

I went through the floor of the living room and strung it across the ceiling of my basement, then out through a hole I drilled in the trim around one of the basement windows. I mounted the antenna on the back of the house, just about 3 feet off the ground. That side of the house faces West, but when I opened up the antenna the signal jumped to almost full.

I felt when reading this book that I'd stumbled upon a small gourmet cooking school for beginners rather than a book for saving money in the kitchen. I think the title is maybe a little bit misleading. Since most of Mary Hunt's books deal with living inexpensively, the idea of a \\"cheapskate in the kitchen\\" brings to my mind someone who's trying to keep their food budget down to $30 a week or something along those lines.

I have now burned 6 of the 50 as music CDs using my computer. The first three were given to a friend to play in her car -- none of the three would play. I burned the other three for myself. Although the CDs would play, some of the songs had a strange type of \\"interference\\" sound. It seemed to come up only on certain songs, and only in certain parts of the songs. Nonetheless, it is sufficiently distracting that neither I nor my kids want to listen to these CDs, which are all going to be thrown away. Although I should return the spindle (given that I'm batting 0 for 6), the hassle of packaging it and mailing it back isn't worth the time this will take, so I guess I'll just \\"eat\\" the $20. I wish I'd have listened to the reviewer who suggested buying Kodak. Although they are more expensive, I would've saved myself $20 and a lot of aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got it","review":"Simply that, I ordered it in November and now it's January and i still haven't received it.......I just got tired and went to best buy....ridiculous"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lightscribe ready","review":"This item comes up under a lightscribe CD search.

I've tried 5 of them. 2 failed during the burn. 2 won't play anywhere. 1 sort of plays, sometimes. What I mean by that is that there is constantly a fight to get a a player (tried 4 different ones) to recognize and play it. They were cheap, I'll give them that but they are absolutely useless. I've personally had a 80% failure rate. And to boot, they seem quite flimsy to me as well. Not sure how they'd hold up in the long run. Chances are I won't have that opportunity anyway. I simply cannot recommend these. Good for those who have had better luck. It happens though and I do generally like Verbatim products. I use their blank Blu-ray discs and those have been wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful--avoid at all costs!","review":"Just as the title says, my newest batch of Verbatim CD-R's were awful. It seems as if they switched manufacturers. I stocked up on these 100 disc spindles in 2010 and finally used them all up without one bad disc in the bunch! When I reordered them in 2012, I was dismayed to find that only 1 out of 10 actually worked--the other nine became useless coasters. How disappointing! Amazon was very helpful and sent me a replacement spindle, but that too was a big dud. They ended up refunding my money, which was great. I'm pleased with their customer service, but I'm very unhappy with Verbatim and their shoddy product. I really hate when a great product goes bad, and sadly, this is the case with Verbatim. I will not be buying any of their media again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Bulk!","review":"I burn a lot of data DVD's and CD's. I say go Bulk.

For a specific \\"audio burn project\\", after encountering a failure with the Verbatim CD-R, I tried again on a blank TDK CD-R, and the TDK worked perfectly. I've done this several times. This is not a fluke, the Verbatims fail more often than not (sometimes you get lucky - doesn't happen that often), but the TDKs never fail. To make matters worse, even if you get lucky and the Verbatim burns successfully, I get skipping when playing the burned audio CD on my stereo CD player - I have never had this happen before and I burn a ton of CDs. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of CD-R."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned them","review":"When I opened up the package I noticed that the discs seemed thicker than normal. My wife and I tried to burn music on 3 of them them on two laptops -- good quality Toshiba and Asus laptops -- and once the CDs were inserted into the drive the laptops vibrated and hummed loudly. One of the discs did not want to come out of the drive. I'm glad they didn't damage anything. We returned them to Amazon. All other discs we have operate smoothly in those same laptops."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality less than expected","review":"Some of these discs burn well, but the number that do not have issues with burning is far below what I expected. I recognize these are not \\"top-of-the-line\\" items, but I expected better than 50%. Out of the first 10 discs I burned, only 4 of them worked without skipping or some other issue. Some simply would not burn data. These are common issues, but the rate of failure is beyond what I would expect even in this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"great discs","review":"havent had one issue with any of the discs so far and have gone through almost half of them. they burn fast and arent flimsy or cheap. great value and would definetly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be my older CD players, but these are not great","review":"So I am not sure if it's the age of my players, both my cars are 2002 models, but these CD-R start skipping way sooner than the previous spindle I had (that was probably 5 years old). Some of the CDs skip parts of songs immediately after they are burnt. And those that don't start skipping after the most minute scratches. I have older style CD R that are scratched to hell and back, and work just fine. So again, either it's an issue with my players and the \\"newer\\" CD R, or they are pretty crappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD's!","review":"They work. No duds so far.

Of the 50 CD's on the spindle, I've used 37 and 10 have been defective, meaning unusable. Some wouldn't write at all and some would get half way through the writing process and then create errors that caused the write process to terminate. Upon inspection, some of the CD's had visible defects in the reflective surface. I've been burning CD's for many years now and have NEVER had this high a reject rate, or anything close to it. I visited Verbatim's web site to give them a piece of my mind and was displeased to discover they have no customer feedback tool on their site.

They work great with no problems so far using a slower burning process, which is recommended to ensure error free writes. If you're getting errors burning these disks, slow the write speed. This is a common problem that some people don't know about and blame the disk, instead of blaming the cheap drive they use or the software they are using to burn it with. I'm not gonna say they do or don't work great burning at 52x because I know from experience that that the faster you burn, the potential for errors increase, so I never burn at 52x. Besides, it's only 700MB, how quick do you need it done? Ten seconds?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I've used a little over a quarter of these so far to burn CD's, and easily 7 out of every 10 will not play in a Sony personal CD player, which I use the most, or an LG DVD/CD player.

I thought I was having a problem with the CD burner, so I tried to burn the disc in my desktop computer. Same results, it seems that almost all the discs in this spindle are defective. I found some of my old Verbatim CDs and they burned with no problem in both computers. I've gone past the return date for these, I don't know if Amazon will replace them or not.

The title announces her philosophical intentions. The themes of madness, love (both erotic and familial), and literature are ambitious. But Duncker wields all the subtlety of a freshman Women's Studies major or a self-conscious \\"artiste,\\" and the book is weighed down by festering obviousness. Heavy-handed dialogue meets heavy-handed symbolism meets predictably silly denouement.A.S. Byatt called HALLUCINATING FOUCAULT one of the best novels of the year. Cross her AND Patricia Duncker off of your lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll not be dissappointed....","review":"After a difficult beginning (it is difficult to suspend disbelief as far as a woman author writing as a man goes - probably my limited imagination)....but you soon forget this minor irritation as you are swept up in the story - don't approach this as anything else than a good tale....there are philosophical undertones, but they are mere dabs on the canvas rather than fully drawn out (and the book is all the better for it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Academic Novel for Romantic Post-Structuralists","review":"I sat down to read _Hallucinating Foucault_ one sleepy evening and became to engrossed I could not stop reading until I finished a couple energizing hours later. Duncker makes my brain work. She brilliantly brings forth the human side of late twentieth century post-structural philosophy and post-modern literature, binding the reader into a love triangle that's both solid and ethereal. What does the reader bring to the text? What sort of relationship does the reader have with the writer? What happens if the reader really does go to seek the author--who isn't dead after all--and blends his intellectual dream with \\"reality\\"? As a doctoral student, my favorite thing about this book is that the plot has the best possible happy ending--the protag. finishes his diss. and gets a job!! This is better than Byatt's _Possession_ and up there with Winterson's _The Passion_ for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little disturbing","review":"This is one of the most intriguing books I have ever read. It explores the underrated relationship between reader and writer by setting up a story in which a PhD student makes a journey to investigate fictional French novelist, Paul Michel, who is institutionalized for insanity. The relationship they have is a little strange, but it makes the book a little more thought-provoking.This book does not owe its success to an action-packed plot but to the deep complexities and philosophies it explores. At times, the passion that the main character has for Michel is slightly disturbing, but it only strengthens and furthers theme. I thought this book was fascinating and profound without being difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I ordered!","review":"The only \\"issue\\" I had was that it took FOREVER for the item to arrive!

This is not true, they just could not find their true soun until this cd. Opposite Of December was mainly hardcore, Tear From The Red was moreso emo sounding, and You Comew Before You incorporates both sounds and comes out with a sound that is very pleasing to the ear. Starting off the album you really get the vibe that they finally know what they're doing. The riffs are well placed and sound good, and the breaks for melodies seem to come at just the right time. Jeff also has changed his vocal style from the first two albums. He went from a more screamish vocal to a guttural roar of sorts. Their sound is much finely tuned due to the better production of the cd as well. However, some people aren't ready to admit to the true form of poioson the well, not solely hardcore nor soley emocore, just throw aside terms and it's good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief","review":"This album takes PTW on their natural progression towards greatness.

Unlike bands like Cave In it seems like PTW are staying true to the fans that gave them so much support in their early years. You Come Before You doesn't flow as well as 'Tears From the Red', but you can't improve on such an Album.

That was my opinion until this album- they will never be the great band that Opposite of December and Distance Only Makes the Heart Grow Fonder were promising them to be. In the same way that Tear From the Red was different from their debut, this takes it to an all new extreme. When I heard this new album, I got really disappointed. It is much softer, and it doesn't have the singer's traditional piercing scream.

The vocals are innovative in that Jeff will start a scream and fade into passionate clean vocals or vise-versa. Jeff's vocals really set YCBY apart from any other band - I can't say enough about how talented he is.The guitar work, while not amazing, is good. I wouldn't have it any other way for the cd though - the music flows perfectly throughout the cd. The drums on this cd, as with any other PTW cd, are great as well.\\"The Realist\\" is the best song on the cd; it is simply amazing. \\"Pleasant Bullet\\" is also another one of the cd's highlights.Check this cd out; you won't be disappointed.I just got destroyed in Runescape because I was writing this review, but if 10 people buy this cd because of it, my being owned won't be in vain."},{"rating":"2","title":"hardcore rules","review":"Well this is what i have to say: Being a poison the well fan my- self and buying the album myself i truly enjoyed it with a passion.

Honestly, I only listened to the cd about five more times after that date. Two weeks ago I saw them in concert, and from a previous review somebody said they were promoting this album. They only played four songs from it, and the crowd was definitely not interested, so I dont know how in anyway they would call that promoting. They also played four songs from OOD and two from TFTR. This album should not be talked about when the conversation is about Poison the Well, all it does is kill their reputation. The biggest disappointment from this album to me, besides the whole thing, was the lyric change.

The subject matter is not funny. I find it interesting when someone does comedy that most people think is not funny they call it dark humor. This is not dark humor, it is just a dark, sad movie. This is about watching someone who has some serious mental issues continue down a very dark road. Near the end of the movie you find out what is the cause for the major mental issues and it is not a funny / humorous cause in any way shape or form.At the end of the movie, there are no answers and no resolution. You may say that is fine because that is how life can be. This is the sad truth, which is why I go to movies so I can escape the cruel world for a couple of hours.

Just another of these self-indulgent looks at someone who is still pining for the glory days of high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Adult","review":"Jason Reitman's got quite the streak going. After Thank You for Smoking in 2005, Reitman proved he wasn't a one-hit wonder by earning Academy love for his next two films, Juno and Up in the Air. In his latest effort, Young Adult, Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, a selfish, self-absorbed former prom queen-turned-writer who returns to her hometown in hopes of winning back her happily married high school sweetheart, instead reconnecting with a former classmate she barely remembers. Working from a script by Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody, Young Adult drummed up a little bit of early awards buzz, but ultimately got no love. Some have speculated that audiences didn't quite know how to respond to the film's bittersweet themes, and Mavis is such an unlikable character that it may have turned off others. At the end of the day, Theron's performance is outstanding and that the story is both funny and powerful enough in its examination of prolonged adolescence to warrant a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha...who...why??","review":"This is not a \\"comedy.\\" Anyone using that word should a.) examine the definition of comedy - dark or otherwise or b.) get some counseling. Very little amusing in this pretentious chracter study. The acting is fine, but no one is realy likeable or given much depth. WAY too much is spoken and not enough is shown. Cody and Reitman are critic darlings, but this film is just wholly flat and leaves you wanting something - anything - more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"My boyfriend and I purchased this movie thinking it would be cute or funny, at least good since Charlize Theron is in it. I wish I would have known this was a dark comedy, if you could call it a comedy. Don't waste your time on it as the plot is slow and the ending leaves you dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"i kept watching it because i thought/hoped that there would be something learned by the shallow, narcissistic former prom queen who never grew up. nope. glad it was at least free with prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Comedy","review":"This is hardly a comedy. This was a big waste of time. There was no resolve at the end that made up for how awful Charlize Theron's character was. I would recommend watching anything but this. It was thoroughly depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"This movie was by far one of the most uncomfortable watches I have ever had to endure. To label it as a comedy (even a dark one) is a sick joke. Charlize does a phenomenal job at portraying a train wreck of a writer who has not mentally or emotionally progressed from her prom queen days in her po-dunk town. Unfortunately this train wreck is one I consistently found myself redirecting my view or making excuses to exit the room because of the sheer level of discomfort her encounters evoked. To keep this brief and to the point: just watch a different movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"Charlize....wanted to like it. Seemed from trailer to have a decent enough plot line to develop but then I watched the movie and it was close to a big fat nothing. Even Charlize in full dress was not enough to save this. Perhaps written for women?? I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but pretty close","review":"One thing you can say about Charlize Theron- she doesn't mind doing ugly. This movie is just depression in cinematic format. I kept waiting for... something. It never happened. I could have turned off the movie 20 minutes in and not have missed much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Don't waste your time on this movie. The main character is awful and uses everyone else in the movie. Sometimes a character starts out that way and grows, matures, or changes through out the movie. This selfish character is just as detestable at the end as the beginning. A very slow and long movie that has no good point or value to it. The main character is a \\"young adult\\" author but I think a kid could have written a better plot! It was depressing, slow, and in general a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me entertained","review":"I read some of the other reviews which are mostly bad. I know people want a movie that ends on a happy note or makes them feel good. But there's something to be said for enjoying a good story even when the characters are unlikeable. Unlikeable people need their stories told too.Mavis is a depressed writer who makes a trip home when she finds out her ex-boyfriend and his wife just had a baby. I enjoyed watching how far her character would go in her depravity. This is not a love story or a feel-good story but I appreciated it for what it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can live at home","review":"Surprisingly unspectacular for a Mission: Impossible film. I'd feel kind of cheated if I paid the evening IMAX price. The sequence in the tall building is impressive, but is only a short part of the film. The climax fight in the pigeonhole parking garage was done better fifty six years ago in a film that most of the people who saw it are now dead, called 5 Against the House. The plot seems like a mishmash of Thunderball andThe Spy Who Loved Me (James Bond Novels). The high praise this film received from critics makes me wonder ifCars 2is actually good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another impressive performance by Charlize Theron","review":"Due to the fact that there was a limited screening of \\"Young Adult\\" in the theaters, I wasn't able to watch this movie locally. So, like most people, I had to wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray/DVD. Charlize Theron plays an ghostwriter of a once-popular teenage book series who attempts to rekindle an old flame from high school. I don't want to spoil the plot for those of you who are planning to purchase this movie so I won't go much further, but rest assured that Charlize Theron absolutely nails her role and her performance is reason enough to purchase this movie (I being a big fan of her's). I enjoyed watching her performance in this movie and that alone is reason enough to buy and watch this movie. I'm sure the Academy will be calling her once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"This movie was better than i thought it would be. i thought that it was kinda funny. i was surprised to see patton oswalt in this movie. i thought he was pretty good. i still like him from king of queens. charlize theron was excellent playing a stalker ex girlfriend that was pretty funny. i think this movie has a little truth into it. about ex's stalking there ex's. but all in all this movie was pretty good. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Practically 2 hours of my life is gone.

Take this as you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This movie was majorly depressing. Not in the sense I felt something for the characters, they were all equally awful. This was depressing because someone was given millions of dollars to produce this steaming pile of poop.I may be too harsh on the poop population.The only saving grace is that my computer went into hibernation mode near the end, which was probably the highlight of the entire flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow the majority of the reviews.","review":"I wish I had paid attention to all the negative reviews for this movie.

Which was about 1.98 too much. The movie has no real plot, no real conclusion, and no real good acting. It was a disaster on about every single level.The movie centers around Charlize Theron, a depressed, dysfunctional, slightly whacked writer who leaves her apartment in Minneapolis to go back to her small town and win back an old flame, who is now married with a wife and newborn baby.... In theory, this movie could have worked, been filled with lots of witty, funny commentary, etc..... But somewhere it went horribly, horribly wrong. It barely touched comedy, the plot was too thin to really qualify as drama.... This movie belongs in its own category of \\" Hot mess\\".I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This was terrible.

We spent $4.99 to rent the HD version, and the way I figure it, Amazon owes me about $4 back. On the plus side, this is a movie that has fine performances (not great) and...I like the Mini Cooper she drives.Okay, that's about all the positive I can generate. The movie is a study of Theron's character, but it's a two dimensional, unsympathetic character who has no arc. She's unlikable throughout and only comes to discover she's shallow and pathetic, without leading to any resolution. My wife and I kept waiting for this movie to get good, until the credits started rolling and we realized we were out of luck. I expect Ivan Reitmann is usually an excellent director for lighter fare, but this is a dark movie that ends up being irredeemable. Please, don't waste your time.

As one reviewer wrote, I kept waiting for the movie to pick-up, to get better, but it just left you hanging with this empty feeling of 'is that all there is'? The movie never takes the approach that she is going to get better mentally, emotionally, or that she even understands her own short comings. I had anticipated (or hoped for)some humor, but there turned out to be none. Don't waste you money buying or renting this one!

I was surprised that I literally hated every character - except for the old high school friend that was beaten because people thought that he was gay in high school - I only disliked him. The man that she was in love with could easily see through her ploys, but didn't stand up to her or dismiss her, his wife was a wuss who just let her ruin the naming day even though her intent and drunkenness was obvious, and the main character was beyond self-absorbed and right down mean.

He keeps them in his work truck for when he is stuck on a job site and gets hungry. I keep them in my purse and my daughter keeps one in her school bag.

In the process I decided to put in a new way to hang my ties and belts which had previously been installed on hanging devices which took away room for clothes. With the Closet Maid Tie and Belt Rack, I simply saved space at the end of one of the clothes racks near a wall and installed the Tie and Belt Rack on the wall, two adjacent to each other. Since it's from the same manufacturer, it matches the style and color and provides me with lots of space for both ties and racks.

This book is especially important for it provides a framework for tricking out the seen but unnoticed behaviors of everyday life. The book's profoundity is not in what stands out in human intercourse, but rather what does not. The mundane world of social interaction is revealed in what most readers will find to be commonsensically true. In the same way that a physicist can tell us why a baseball flies over the fence (a fairly mundane evernt) in terms of mass, velocity, and drag coefficients, Goffman tells us why the ordinary is able to sustain itself as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"We got two somehow and are stuck with them...","review":"since the return policy is such a hassle.

Great playing and compositional sophistication, and some truely amazing rhthym section stuff going on...There are moments like on Tumble Home, where Stern's too-cool-for-school melodies play in tandem with a sax, and it is just a killer blend...Haven't heard anything that cool in a long time, and every track is a keeper to boot.

I can't really pick any favorites, although I will say that Richie's solo in \\"Dry County\\" is some of the best work he's ever done and will really make you wonder why he doesn't get more credit. He really is amazing, as is the rest of the band. They had some of the best songs that ever hit radio and unlike so many other bands that started around the time that they did, these guys lasted and survived the ever-changing face of the rock world.

This one really didn't do much for me. An interesting cast of characters in a storyline that really didn't go anywhere. The fact that there wasn't a whole lot of sex was refreshing for a title of this genre. The big caper, a character (the boss of our cast of characters who work in a department store) who collects Dolly Parton dolls and doesn't want anyone to know about her passion, has her dolls held for ransom by her employees.

The only words I can muster to describe them are \\"shocklingly horrible.\\" Dolores' voice sounded extremely thin and even slightly off-key. She must really be going through the reverb processor on their albums, is all I can figure.Check out the Sundays instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to make one thing perfectly clear","review":"Despite your album title not everybody was trying to imitate 10,000 Maniacs in 1993, and so therefore the title doesn't apply to you. If you wanted to just say you were recording an album then that's fine, but don't say you are doing this because everyone else is SO THERE!!!!!! Now that my venting over the title is over now onto serious business: \\"Linger\\" is my first introduction of the Cranberries, and let's just say that it was as bad as getting a manly handshake from a woman. The melody is despicable, and the lyrics are too, and it was one of the bad memories of the first months in FL. That's where I was first introduced to this, so I feel that if everyone was rocketing to the moon in their underpants would you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love the Cranberries","review":"Perfection. I have never heard anyone sing like Dolores can. Noel, Mike and Fergal are pure genius with their instruments. The track 'Pretty' literally gave me goose bumps the first time I heard it.

I love you Cranberries..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dreams\\" is sublime; I can't get it out of my head.","review":"Delores O'Riordon has a very beautiful voice! \\"Dreams\\" is well worth the cost of the album alone, though her attempts to do a sort of inexplicable pain-induced yodel a couple of times might put off some listeners unfamiliar with her penchant for yodeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"You know that a CD is really good when you can listen to it and not have to skip a song. I really love the Cranberries; this was their second CD that I bought. As of now, I have four of their CDs. On this CD, I especially love the songs \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Sunday.\\" This is a wonderful CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance","review":"You know, after listening to this album several times, I can't help thinking \\"just another Irish band.\\"DREAMS is a wonderful song, I could listen to it all day long. Linger is a solid piece, too. Beyond those two songs, everything else is wishy-washy, not memorable, not remarkable, bland.I rate this CD two stars purely on the strength of Dreams, with maybe a nod to Linger. If any of the other 10 songs had something to offer . . ..But they don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immitating a fellow Irish","review":"Cranberries' style of music is leaning towards alternative music heavily coated with pop genre. But Dolores' style of singing is a desperate attempt to immitate fellow Irish artist Sinead O'Connor who was even more popular 10 years before Cranberries hit the airwaves. I have heard their Unplugged version of Linger and Zombie where Dolores was badly struggling to hit the right note. It's sad to hear artists who can't sing well their own song just like Janie Lane of Warrant during his last gig with the band.For me this band is a one hit wonder who can record albums after spending 200hrs recording each song and requires a dozen of sound engineers to make her voice sound better. In fairness, songs from this album that were played in radion stations are the only songs where you get your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"One great song, a whole lot of filler","review":"The Cranberries' debut has one song that's so excellent, it makes you want to forgive the rest of the CD for being so boring.That song is \\"Dreams\\", and is the best argument for buying this CD until a greatest-hits package comes along. A perfect blend of melody and music, the song is intimately beautiful and shows exactly what vocalist Delores O'Riordan can do when she puts her mind to it.Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The rest of this CD, sad to say, is bargain-basement Enya. O'Riordan's \\"Ahh-ahhs\\" on \\"I Still Do\\" sound like yawns, and many of the other tracks that aim for emotion end up dangerously close to self-parody.\\"Linger\\", for instance, is about emotional turmoil, but O'Riordan sings it like there's something she'd rather be doing.Some may find comfort in the sameness of approach here, but all others should tread carefully. Paying full price for a one-song CD does not a bargain make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cranberries album","review":"The Cranberries were one of the first bands I was ever interested in. \\"To The Faithful Departed\\" was the first CD I ever bought. So in many ways, this is almost nostalgic that I'm reviewing this.Bottom line: It's the best work the band ever did. This was before they tried lukewarm hard rock a la \\"Zombie\\" or \\"Salvation\\", before the lyrics tried to be meaningful and wound up trite, before the vocals attempted assertive and became annoying. Here, all the band tried to do was write some moody, mellow alternative pop. They succeeded.Not the best album ever made, to be sure, but it does work. If you want a souvenir of early-90s alternative pop, this will do nicely. It also lets me relive my early excursions into the world of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many splendid songs from early in their career","review":"This contains a number of superb tunes and as a whole is very good.

Dolores O'Riordan doesn't have quite the power and intensity of Sinnead O'Connor's banshee wail, but she brings her truth to most of the songs hear. The reason I enjoy this album, though, is that \\"Linger\\" was playing when I realized that my relationship with a certain special someone was over. \\"Linger\\" is currently making the pop play-lists on L.A. radio, and my heart breaks every time I hear it. Any album that can evoke a memory with that intensity just HAS to have something going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a collector's item, but not all that great.","review":"I'm a big mega man fan.

The new archie comics series is also pretty good so far.This company, dreamwave, made 4 issues and went out of business. I think there was good reason for that. There's virtually no conflict for mega man in these comics. enemies are taken out in 3 panels! He one shots almost everyone! most of the content revolves around \\"rocky\\" going to school. yeah, mega man goes to school and has a romantic interest at school.Aside from the story being a bit weak, the art isn't all that great either.

They get mad propes for putting this album together in such a professional manner especially with the adversity they have had. Ms. jesse makes an apperarence on the cd and Ghetto Baby , KqiserSoze, Young Mason and Suede really represent Tacoma. The songs are about real life in the ghetto and the struggles to get out and to uplift each other through music. This album is socaially conscious so you don't have to worry about that fast cash, bling-bling can't relate to music. This album was made for the streets. Jonathan Currington did a great job with the music. In fact, one of the beats sounds similiar to some of Dre's stufff on Chronic 2000( but there stuff has been out way before his). You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really an instruction book","review":"There are very few pages in this book devoted to learning how to actually play the bouzouki and even those pages are very simplistic. The book mostly contains short biographies of bouzouki players and some tunes with chords written in standard musical notation rather than tab. Although the Amazon description refers to a CD and the book continually refers to a cassette, neither come with the book and there is no information that I can find in the book telling how to obtain the recording. There was really nothing in the book about the Irish bouzouki that I hadn't already found on the web during some quick searches making the price of the book way out of proportion to what I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revictimization","review":"I have only read portions of this book... and what I've read of it exemplifies a punitive and callous approach to working with trauma survivors. Making an analogy to Frankenstein for a trauma survivor experiencing intimacy/relational difficulties serves to revictimize trauma survivors. Also, I think this book is quite reductionistic... and frankly serves to categorize trauma survivors' diverse relational transactions as \\"trauma reactions.\\" This unfortunately can be fuel for partners who read this book to label any and all of a trauma survivor's thoughts, opinions, and feelings (especially if slightly intense) to be \\"trauma reactions.\\" Then, the partner can in essence blame the abuse-surviving parter for relationship difficulties which may have absolutely nothing to do with the trauma. This book can be quite damaging in its simplicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought this book","review":"This book misses the mark. I am a survivor of trauma with years of recovery behind me. This book takes a tough love approach, constantly reminding the reader of his/her limitations and can't say enough about how those limitations may never be healed to his/her desire. The correlation of survivors to Frankenstein's monster is a pity. I get the analogy, but couldn't the author come up with something other than the truely heinous?

After reading several reviews, I was expecting some bluesy grit and funk from one of my favorite musicians, Cesar Rosas. There's only a couple of tunes that live up to those expectations--\\"You've Got To Lose\\" and \\"Tough To Handle\\". The best stuff here are the two polkas with Flaco Jimenez, \\"Angelito\\" and \\"Adios Mi Vida\\".

I've seen the commercial for it of course but never paid too much attention to that one, I actually laughed at it beforeSo I decided to buy it and hope for the best. The first haircut I was nervous, but it did a marvelous job. You have to learn which adaptor works for what part of the hair and what length it cuts at, but I got my haircut for less time than I would have driven to a salon and sat to wait.I've since used it one more time, and still did a good job. This time I had to supplement with finishing touches with a scissor and razor (for the fuzz that grows in the back of the neck and the extra length on sideburns and ear).Keep in mind I'm a guy with average to long medium curly hair.

I actually have to run this through my hair *sideways* (that is, making a narrow path, rather than a wide path), with the leading edge lifted slightly off my head. The hair needs to be clean and dry (contrary to the instruction manual). So I can't use the taper attachments, but otherwise it works well, though it takes me a while since I'm cutting narrower swaths.I really like not having to go out and wait at a salon - I think this will lead to my hair looking better on average.From the manual: \\"Although the FLOWBEE won't work on Afro-style hair, it will work on thick or somewhat curly hair.

It is a noisy cut though, with the machine and vacuum both making a decent amount of noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!!!","review":"Was a little leary at first to even order the Flowbee, but figured what the heck. I am a licensed cosmetologist & cut everyone's hair, even my own. I wanted to go back to a layered hair style but had a terrible time layering the back of my hair. The Flowbee seemed like a great product to use on myself & even my family. Clean up is a cinch, all the hair goes right into the vacumme, no more sweeping or tracking the hair around the house. I might even teach my 10 year old daughter to cut my hair. I would highly recommend this product. A stong vacumme is the key for a successful hair cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time Flowbee user","review":"I have used the flowbee system since just after college, (graduated in 1978).

Next thing you know I got \\"sold\\" on the Robocut. It was supposed to be a better product, and for less money to boot. The piece of junk arrived brand new with a piece of plastic that had chipped off via shipping. The haircuts took a whole lot longer and gave my final haircut, a feathered look.

So, since I'm a little too old to hassle mom for a haircut I decided to splurge on this system, and it works great. You have to read the instructions carefully to figure it out (simple instructions), but once you get the lengtheners set (actually, stacked) correctly and you bounce this thing through your hair with your vacuum, it truly does give a perfect cut. The lengtheners that I mentioned are clear plastic, so you can see this thing cutting your hair in a perfectly straight line. Just a note, as stated in the instructions you have to \\"bounce\\" it through your hair when cutting, you can't just run it through.

The clear spacers are flimsy and cheap. The machine lacks branding or labels. I contacted the company and did not receive a response. This is a company which has obviously made a good return on their one invention and one would think they would have at least after so many years reached out to some of the great minds of the hair cutting industry and asked for their input as how to best use their invention in a true functional manual with current styles.

She would look around at nothing (Cue cards - my guess) and could said maybe 15 things that whole movie. That is awesome that a main charatures can only say about 15 things.

Because of this, he decides to try try for the title and beat out lead clerk Vince.This movie started out funny, but I soon found myself annoyed by Zack Bradley's character. I felt his motivation for wanting to win, and his change from slacker to star employee unconvincing. Zack changes to impress a girl, not because he wants to be star clerk or has truly changed.

Dane Cook is the reckless box-boy who decides to take the title away from 17time winner Vince, played with smarmy abandon by Dax Shepherd. The reason: the arrival of buxom Jessica Simpson who is surprisingly effective in her role; she even makes fun of her sexy status by showing Cook how big her ears are!Needless to say, anything goes in the competition and as Cook starts making headway on Shepherd, all hell breaks loose.The movie is engagingly charming and is to be commended for its limited use of profanity or overuse of sexual innuendo. Cook carries the movie nicely and it's a pleasant surprise all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff Of \\"Waiting\\" Without The Comedy","review":"\\"Employee Of The Month\\" is a direct ripoff of the movie \\"Waiting.\\" The only difference is \\"Waiting\\" is actually funny. This movie is about a slacker working at a store that supposed to be like Costco who meets a girl and wants to become Employee Of The Month to impress her. The movie has lots of little one liners that are supposed to be funny, you know their supposed to be funny yet they don't even bring a smirk to your face because they are so used, tired and old.

Newton's biographical study of Freud is unique in examining the great psychologist's life from an adult developmental viewpoint. The key achievement of this book is a finely detailed study of how Freud's adult development -- his dreams of accomplishment, his relationships, and career decisions -- interlock with Freud's creative achievement in creating the foundations of psychoanalysis in the midst of a mid-life crisis. Newton argues that the tasks of the mid-life crisis were peculiarly interrelated with Freud's creative achievement. Incidentally, this finely researched and written book demolishes Jeffrey Masson's notorious thesis that Freud abandoned his theory of infantile seduction due to cowardice, with Newton relying heavily upon Freud's written correspondence with his friend, Fliess. An exciting book that reads at times like a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Food Storage Bin","review":"Unlike the description states, this product has no food storage bin.

The stones themselves are pale purple, not as bright as the photo, but I found I liked them better in person; they're more delicate and subtle.

Not a lot of larger nuts period - mostly sunflower and safflower seed - some pepitos and other nuts scattered in but really a lot of just the filler seed in there.

I had really enjoyed them for the price so I figured another set of cheap ones would work. I stumbled upon these and figured they were a good choice after reading the reviews. The major pro is the price, point blank. Easy to set up, and they were dirt cheap.However, if I were to do it all again, I would have dropped another few bucks. The major flaw is the low frequencies. It doesn't hit them and have the power to make them sound good. My old speakers had a tone nob which would have really helped these speakers. In addition, they feel really cheap. They don't seem like they will hold up in the long run, but time will tell on that one.Overall, you might do well to drop a few more bucks if you want listen to any music with any amount of bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Isa","review":"Instead of Mr. Tellinger letting the evidence speak for itself, he speaks for the evidence. Which grossly invalidates his theories. His findings are speculative at the most. Also, his sarcasm lends an unfortunate diservice to his efforts.

I am sad to say it is merely a work of conjecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slave Species of the gods","review":"This book is long-winded, and very boring at times. It's more opinion than fact, more fantasy and wishful thinking than reality. The author has more assumptions about life on earth than truth. His writing is speculative, poorly presented and not convincing at all. I was very disappointed in his translations of the Bible, which were mediocre. He claims to know exactly what God is thinking and what man was thinking thousands of years ago, so there's a sure sign that this author is a fiction writer. He doesn't understand that human nature is not a text book reference. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slave species of God","review":"I eagerly awaited this title... and usually I like books that give historical facts as back up.

Please check out Michael Tellinger's biography yourself. He has information about himself and his book available on www.slavespecies.com. Be aware that Mr. Tellinger has been a professional entertainer and not a scholar for the last 25 years. This is not to say that he is not asking interesting questions, he is.

He has put into words what I have been thinking about for a long time! Since I was small I looked at the stars and wondered WHO was out there, not What! Tellinger certainly puts a convincing amount of info out for you to think about. Yes, he gets bogged down a couple of times and yes, he's obviously not too happy about G.W., but if you can overlook the times he gets a bit off track,(I call it \\"filler\\") it's a fascinating book. More and more evidence from other sources is beginning to support this theory of our creation. Suppressed, of course, by our Imperial Federal Government, BUT just imagine world chaos that would ensue if all this were proven true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"I have read all of the Sitchin books and was hoping for a similar but individual take on the subject. However it seems that most of the author's information comes from Sitchin anyway. I'm glad I read it but can't really recommend it unless you are a Sitchin fan and have run out of Annunaki books to read. And the Bush bashing is totally out of place. Tellinger compares President Bush to Hitler and Stalin who murdered 6 million and 18 million people respectively. No one is a fan of war but comparing someone who is trying to make world a safer place to those who committed genocide is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A music fan from Heiloo, The Netherlands","review":"Great music.

Recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works incredibly well","review":"I'm completely happy with these lawn claws. I didn't expect them to work as well as they actually do. I hold them not by the straps but just grasp the end of the claws and scoop up large mounds of leaves at a time.

Totally worth the investment and I will recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful time saver","review":"I rake and bag a lot of leaves each fall, and for the past two years these scoops have made that job faster. I can fill a trash barrel with about 8 scoops and fly through a pile of leaves. When I run out of barrels I fill those paper leaf bags. That's generally more of a pain than the barrels as the opening is smaller and the paper is prone to fold. It's still a more delicate operation with these scoops, but they are sized to fit in the bag opening, and once I have one scoop of leaves in the bag it stays open and the following scoops are pretty quick and easy.For both barrels and bags this is a big time saver. I recently bought a 2nd pair for this season (big raking weekend coming up) to assist my wife and kids if/when they help the effort. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving a lot of time!","review":"I'm a property manager, so I'm looking for a way to save time, energy and money.

They thought they could pull off being a glam band. Believe me, they don't have the looks for it. This ain't even rock anymore. This is just pure commercial pop/rock. This is pathetic.

Samantha's life in turn-of-the-last-century New York presents in my view the series' most well-rounded picture into society at that time, with its incorporation of orphans and the working class in among its economically-privileged main characters. The writing here was the best of any American Girl novel and the dialogue seemed knitted to its era and not anachronistically modernized in the slightest. Yes, I know the improbable ending is the fabric of fairy tales but it still makes for a happy conclusion to a nice visit back a hundred years ago in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Recently my husband and I heard some Perry Como music on the radio.

On this Concord Jazz recording, McDuff's Hammond organ sets the groove for experienced sidemen such as George Benson on guitar, Red Holloway on tenor sax, and Grady Tate on drums, but there are also contributions from younger musicians such as Mark Whitfield on guitar. On one of the cuts, \\"After Hours,\\" McDuff switches to piano, but most of the cuts are organ quartet/quintet-type arrangements. There may not be a lot of new musical ground broken here, but the music still sounds fresh and eminently enjoyable. If you like B-3 grooves, you'll like this CD, which is very nicely done, including informative liner notes on the session.

Now, after having read this truly remarkable story of their rocky marriage, I realize that a lot of their problems were caused by Abraham Lincoln's moodiness and hypochondria. Mary longed for a more glamorous life which would have placed them in \\"high society.\\" Her husband desired no such station in life and this novel does well in exposing their faults and virtues, as individuals and as a couple, and as the title implies, shows that both worked hard constantly to make their marriage successful. It is a great story of love, devotion, misery, grief, and its historical setting is the turbulent years leading up to, and including the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a History Buff","review":"This book provides insight into the tender moments Abraham Lincoln had with his wife Mary.

Her work is presented in a manner disrespectful to her very source of information and/or inspiration for her writings.Although I do feel that this book has value, I believe that value is minimal. I suggest looking elsewhere.If you want a good read about a Native American woman, I highly recommend \\"Lakota Woman\\" by Mary Brave Bird/Mary Crow Dog.

Everyone involved in the production should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My Money Back!!!","review":"This movie was dreadful!

I just about turned the darn thing off, then I just thought that 'okay, this is suposevly Laugh Out Loud funny, so I'll just watch it and see...\\" I was completely wrong. I have seen better acting in a 'Chucky' movie than this. I love Queen Lateafa, I thin she's great. I love Betty White, I think she is one of the best 'golden girls' out there. She is normally so funny. This movie left me so dry, except for a chuckle here and there. So, this movie is oneof the worst movies ever made, and a waste of talent. This was awful! NOT FOR KIDS AT ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, unfunny movie; bad transfer to dvd","review":"I didn't see this film in the theater. I'm very happy about that because this film is very unfunny for a comedy. The plot is beyond cliched. I didn't laugh once in the first half hour so I went to the last scene and -- surprise -- the film ended as I would have predicted.I mention that I didn't see this in a theater because I don't know whether the film's credits intentionally look bad (and looked that way in the theater) or whether the transfer to dvd was at fault. The words looked quite blurred at times; some names looked worse than others. Even the rest of the film (what I was willing to watch of it) seemed to suffer from a slightly jagged look.Highly UNrecommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downer of Movie","review":"I've tried really hard to enjoy this movie. But the constant racial jokes really bothered me. It would be one thing if it was done in good taste for example Undercover Brother. But mostly in this movie it was mean-spirited. My only delight in this movie was Steve Martin and occasionally Queen Latifah who was outstanding in Brown Sugar and Chicago was likable but not lovable in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"campy but feelgood little movie","review":"OK, it's totally contrived and campy, but if you like Steve Martin and Queen Latifah you'll probably agree that it deserves two and maybe even 3 stars.

But it does have its funny moments. In fact - a couple of scenes live up to the hype. But as for the entire film, it seems to be lacking something. Latifah is the best part of the movie, of course, but even she can't bring it up to what it was promised to be. Don't get me wrong - the movie is good - just not as good as we were lead to believe. I will say that Eugene Levy adds a nice touch to the movie, and his lines are memerable. For whatever reason - Latifah's fashion seems to stand out more than the movie itself. She sports some rather stunning outfits in the film. You will have some degree of fun with this one, though - even if it isn't the level of fun the critics promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, as I love Queen Latifah and Steve Martin. Sad to say, this film was really bad. Latifah had a few shining moments (she simply radiates charisma), as did Eugene Levy, but most of the film was sullied by blatant racism. I was actually rather shocked at the racist \\"jokes,\\" which were anything but funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential...","review":"Maybe 3 if you're feeling generous. It was way too nice and formulaic. Eugene Levy is funny as a goofy white guy who lusts after Queen Latifah. Latifah is good. Steve Martin is especially funny in the scene where he dresses like a gangsta rapper and goes to a club in Compton and talks like Snoop. However, If you've ever seen any \\"fish out of water\\" comedies, you will realize that the writers just worked the premise to death and really came up pretty short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the punch line?","review":"The anticipation for this movie to end was unbearable! This is by far the worst movie I've seen this year. You're lead to believe that this movie is filled with a laugh a minute. Basically it's rude and isn't funny. Maybe a scene or two but I really expected more. Eugene Levy was the best character in the film. If you don't expect too much - this is the movie to get.

What a horrible film. The whole concept of mixing a \\"whitey-tighty\\" lawyer Steve Martin with a ghetto-fabulous hipster Queen Latifah does not succeed on the mere situation created. The comedy part of this is completely watered down and force-fed. It's almost as if a \\"Politically Correct Action Committee\\" reviewed the script before the movie was released. If the writers wanted to truly make this funny, it should have been more \\"in-your-face,\\" believable, and more raw.

This is not ordinarily a film I'd watch: It's got way too much noisy rap, too much overt sex, rotten language and far too much glamorization of criminals and hoodlums, but I found it laugh-out-loud funny in places. The actors, all of them including the kids, are exceptionally good. Visually, the slapstick is far above average. QL is a beautiful, fine actress who steals everything she's in, this film being no exception. If for no other reason than to watch her steal this film, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good...","review":"What a bad, tasteless movie! When is it funny that Steve Martin's character has to sneak Queen Latifah into his house due to the fact that she is Black and that his neighbors don't approve! This movie tries to be funny but just reinforces negative stereotypes for Black and White people. Was there one positive Black character in this movie? Queen Latifah's characters' answer to all problems in this movie was to use violence...how cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if you're a rascist","review":"I agree with the reviewer who saise that this movie is cryptic rascism. In other words \\"aren't blacks all uneducated thug-types(blah blah blah) but by golly-gosh in the end they're real nice people! This movie exploits blacks for laughs. I felt sick to my stomache throughout the entire movie. We can only imagine how this movie affects young black girls looking for positive role models.

We should all hang our heads in shame that this movie did so well at the box-office!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minstrel Daze Revisited!","review":"I didn't like this film obviously but I'll just explain why. There seems to be a crop of films recently being released that not only blatantly play to stereotypes of African Americans being inherent ghettoed out criminals but Anglo Americans as uptight, inherent racist. In both instances it doesn't make for very good comedy, instead it makes for the same sort of fare that's already been done with better results with Eddie Murphy and Ricard Pryor and even Steve Martin (the Jerk). I don't quite understand the appeal of this film, I saw it and I thought it was terrible, but then again see the movie yourself and decide if you've wasted your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh","review":"Cute movie, I guess, but not the greatest.

Handle it the Queen Latifah way- beat her up! It works especially well if the white woman is half your size and wearing only her underwear.

It doesn't seem fair to accuse such totally clueless people of racism- it's kind of like yelling at an infant because it pooped in its diaper.The one redeeming thing about this mess is Eugene Levy, and you can see him in some movies that are actually good: Waiting for Guffman, A Mighty Wind, Best in Show or the SCTV DVDs supposedly coming out in spring 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMEDY AT ITS BEST!","review":"Queen Latifah almost steals this film from Steve Martin, Eugene Levy (Best in Show & A Mighty Wind) and Betty White ( Golden Girls). Queen Latifah is wrongly accused of a crime. Steve Martin is the reluctant lawyer she chooses to help prove her innocence. And so the fun begins. Be prepared to laugh so hard you will cry as they poke fun at sterotypes, repair \\"Steve's\\" broken marriage, solve his children's problems, challenge a stuffy law firm and \\"mellow out\\" a prim multi-millionaire client. It's all done in rollicking good humor. This is a fun film. Queen Latifah is one talented lady. Joan Plowright is superb. Look for the scene where Joan, an uninvited guest, sings at the family dinner table and wants everyone to join in the next chorus. Steve and the children cringe and Queen Latifah exacts her revenge. Clever writing, fast-paced acting. These are \\"pros\\" making us laugh. What the world needs now is more laughter and fun of this genre, and a lot less violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing down the house","review":"This movie came in a timely fashion and was in excellent shape upon arrival, I would highly recommend the company that sent this to me for future purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"awesome way before time great job thanks,, always great service odering from Amazon,, love this movie it is so funny and it's great that it is on blu-ray now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing Down The House (Full Screen Edition)","review":"Peter Sanderson is a divorced, straight-laced, uptight attorney who still loves his ex-wife and can't figure out what he did wrong to make her leave him.

However, when she comes to his house for their first face-to-face, she isn't refined, isn't Ivy League, and isn't even a lawyer. Instead, it's Charlene, a prison escapee who's proclaiming her innocence and wants Peter to help her clear her name. But Peter wants nothing to do with her, prompting the loud and shocking Charlene to turn Peter's perfectly ordered life upside down, jeopardizing his effort to get back with his wife and woo a billion dollar client. Bringing Down the House is a very funny movie and you will have a good time seeing it, an absolute hoot, with the cast stealing the show with marvellous chemistry, and giving three of best comedic turns you're likely to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not more...","review":"Steve Martin plays Peter Sanderson, an uptight lawyer, who has recently met his dream woman online who known to him as Lawyer Girl.

However, when Lawyer Girl rings on his door he is startled as it is an African-American woman that has recently escaped from prison. She insists that she has been wrongly punished as she is innocent, but Peter attempts to avoid the whole ordeal as he faces his own prejudice. Bring Down the House is an honest attempt in making a comedy about bigotry and racism in our present society, but fails in delivering the punch line.

Q.L. proves her Oscar nom in \\"Chicago\\" was not a fluke.

This script had worn out its welcome more than a dozen years before Wheeler and Woolsey made a hit in Rio Rita.

Whatever, the result left much to be desired.

It creates a world where life seems \\"as normal\\" but behind the scenes is a group called the Cabal that are full of sorcerors and mythical creatures. It also includes planar travel and ancient Gods. This book also provides a recounting of history starting from Ancient Eygpt, with what \\"really\\" happened and to what extent the Cabal was involved.

This book is overwhelmingly positive; in fact, the author seems somewhat infatuated with the subject, and this is the only reason I do not give the book 5 stars. For instance, Coker does not dwell on how Biggie exaggerated the poverty and depravation of his childhood to a great degree. But overall it is a great book that gives a solid feel of the life and times of the King of N-Y, although it is a bit of a puff piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to word","review":"The book came in the stated condition with minor marks and such.

But what really blew me away was later discovering the lp with headphones. As far as tone goes, especially on the title track, and the outro guitar solo on TOO ROLLING STONED, he stands alone. Nobody else out there quite sounds like Robin. There may be faster, better schooled players out there, but this is all about the vibe, tone and groove. The live extras are a nice addition to the expanded cd. I also recommend his BACK IT UP cd released in 1983. It is sadly overlooked, and was the last release to feature longtime member James Dewar on vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another rediscovered classic","review":"Thanks goodness for Kazaa where I had the chance to rediscover this suberb album. Classic blues/rock where Robin Trower on guitar shows his stuff. The slow moody blues title track is the best. Other greats are the rocking 'too rolling stoned' and 'lady love'. Trower has been considered as too simliar to Hendrix but this album shows a progression from that style. The sultry vocals of bass player James Dewar are also a highlight. The only fault with the album is the live tracks, while interesting, are unnecessary given the impact of the original tracks. The record companies would be foolish to take Kazaa of the air, I have 10 albums queued up to be bought from music that I have had the chance to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge of Wonder","review":"If you don't onw this album--buy it now!! There is more here than just blistering (masterful) bluesrock guitar. There is exceptional songwriting--this is not the kind of guitar album that leaves you saying,\\"yea, yea, just get to the solo!\\" These are songs you savor from beginning to end! James Dewar's smokey, soulful vocals were evey bit as important as Robins guitar playing.

Trower a very fine guitarist, manages to harness the 'Hendrix' sound and style quite effectively.However i don't know what the fuss is about really?? The 'next' Hendrix stuff was also done by Ernie Isley, Eddie Hazel and Stevie Ray Vaughan to name a few. At least they forged their own story from that information.Yes Trower writes nice songs and James Dewar is a good vocalist, but to me, this is not a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain cool!","review":"The combination of Robin's guitar playing (and amazing tone) and the voice of James Dewar is magical.

As a young, stumbling guitarist in the 70's I wore out my record player (yes, record player) on 33and 1/3 trying to emulate this guy. Now twenty years later and I still can't pull it out like Robin did on this album. A must buy for the ultimate blues-rock collection. He was compared to Hendrix and never quite got the recognition or fame he deserved. His and Hendrix's styles were similar but very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortally Tasty and Beautiful!","review":"I have to confess that I was never all that much of a fan of Robin Trower. This is the one record I have by him and I bought the LP after hearing the irresistible \\"Day of the Eagle\\" on the radio back in the day. Then I bought the CD when it came out.This work is easily the highlight of Robin's career for me. Every texture, every lick and every thump of the late, great Jimmy Dewar's bass is perfectly placed for optimum emotional, melodic and harmonic effect and Dewar's vocals are soulful beyond belief. Aside from \\"Day of the Eagle,\\" which just destroys, the title track is bloody epic and one could almost lose oneself in the sonic landscape of it.And \\"Lady Love\\" is just so cool and funky it cannot be denied.A masterpiece that will live on long after I am gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product great service","review":"The product, price, and service was all positive.

Better off reading a book on Gacy if you're looking for facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I agree with the other reveiwers that they should have shown Gacy as \\"Pogo The Clown\\" more. This movie was creepy knowning that this guy truly existed, but they should have gone more into his back story and possibly why he was so messed up. Obvious he had big issues about his feelings towards men, but things are much deeper then that.He kills about three or four people in this movie, but you never see him in the act. That would made it even better for the fans who want to watch the movie for gore and horror. If you are looking for that stay away. Not much blood in this film.Mark Hutton did a great job as Gacy, but the script kept him down from possibly making a big impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gacy is a rollercoaster ride into..wait, this movie sucks","review":"Yes, this would be a good movie if it wasnt directed by the writer and yes, Mark Holton is a bad choice for the lead role. Holton doesnt have a very good movie record (Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Leprechaun come into mind). This movie is a boring mess. Adam Baldwin (Tv's Firefly, Tv's Angel) is totally wasted as Gacy's father. Script sucks beyond belief and the acting is a flippin' pile. Though, Charlie Weber (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), who played the kid who was living with Gacy, did try the best he could but it was washed off by other supportees. The second by second shots of clown faces doesnt help it at all. This was dead in the water when it hit the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close to the Facts","review":"This movie follows the true story of John Wayne Gacy closely, but if you are as critical as I am you will notice many inconsistencies.

I can guess after raping some boys he felt he had to protect himself and kill them but why only a relative few. No real thought or scene was followed through, it just went black and when to another thought. The research for this film must have be a glancing review of one newspaper article. Video was a real disappointment. I learned he was fat, likely rich but got killed for not paying someone a minor debt. Their weeks wages? He had 2000 male contacts and they found 29 in his cellar, and I believe there were 4 floaters in a water way in his area so he likely did them. So only 33 of the 2000 were killed, WHY???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"This is another of those tepid, silly \\"serial killer\\" movies that was obviously churned out to make a quick buck, and nothing more.

In this movie he was like a bumbling idiot who everybody hated. People around him think he's weird but never challenge him. The story moved slow and jumped over alot of important details of his life thar made him a monster. I know it had no budget, but I've seen better movies of the week!it's just under 90 mins. Save your money, it will end up on late night tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't say something nice, say nothing at all..","review":"Mark Holton who you may remember as the bike thief Francis in \\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\\" plays the title character of the famous serial killer John Wayne Gacy. While he has the look and the flamboyance, he simply doesn't cut the mustard as an actor with the skills to play Gacy. His performance isn't at the top of the list indicating the worse things about this movie. Let's continue with the script issues. I'm wondering if they even had one. The pace of the film is sluggish at best. The director resorts to the whole bugs and maggots thing to creep out the viewer. It fails to do so. The editing is unintentionally sketchy and just unprofessionally done. But why is that a surprise, everything about the movie is unintentional. Who makes a bad movie on purpose? Avoid even on a slow night. I recommend the more recent \\"Monster\\" with Charlize Theron instead. It deals with what provokes a serial killer and the performance by Theron is unbeatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are we???","review":"I know the John Wayne Gacy story, I live in Chicago, how could I not???But where are we in this movie? The scenes follow no order and give the audience no clue as to where we are in his life at any given point in the movie. Not only that, but most of the scenes seem to \\"cut off\\" too early as if they were edited for TV to fill a time-slot. The whole thing is one big confusing mess.That being said, the portrayal of Gacy by Mark Houlton was really good. He looks like him physically and pulls off friendly, yet scary appearance very well. He makes this movie worth watching. THe one thing that the writers/directors did well in this was to not get psychological. They simply portray what was actually done, without trying to explain WHY Gacy killed people. He was a serial killer, nobody knows what he was thinking... THe movie succeeded in staying very objective.Worth watching on a rainy day.P.S. NOt really much discussed about POGO the clown, even though it's on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, sordid and not-very-bright","review":"I think I've seen DAHMER, BUNDY and now GACY and I believe they were all made by the same production company. I know this without looking at any credits because all three movies were dull and lame, thoughtless and ultimately pointless.It was as if the producers said, \\"We are going to make a series of films about America's most horrific serial killers, despite the fact that we have limited resources and an astonishing lack of understanding about good and evil. We will bring nothing to these stories.\\"I could have at least understood the slimiest stereotype of a Hollywood bottom-dwelling producer making a grotesque exploitation picture of any of these maniacs, but why take the high road (meaning, \\"dull and ponderous\\") if you have ZERO insight into these crimes?Court TV has more riveting recreations.

I attached it to my XD40 and began trying to sight it in with the tiny allen wrench that's included. Within the first couple of adjustments, one of the adjustment screws broken and fell into the laser housing, which forced the laser to be stuck pointing at at 45 degree angle.

I had to return the first one because the adjustment screw stripped out the first time I turned it. The replacement came quick, though. Having four adjustment screws was somewhat difficult to deal with, because the four adjustment points do not seem to be lined up correctly. I mounted this on my ruger 10/22 and sighted it in for 50 yards. So far, after about 100 rounds, it has kept it zero. At 50 yards, at dusk, the light is roughly about 5 inches in diameter, but that suits my kill zone just fine. I shot solid 2\\" groups with it without looking through my scope at all, just holding the weapon and squeezing the trigger when the light was where I wanted it.

Not for a real gun.","review":"After installing this laser and trying it out at the range a few of things became evident immediately. 1) Every other shot the switch will flip itself off from the inertia of the recoil. 2) Unless the battery cap/power switch is screwed in with a healthy dose of loctite, you can expect the thing to come unscrewed from the laser every third to fourth shot. 3) The dot will not stay zeroed. The shock from the recoil has the thing in a slightly different position after every 2nd shot if not after every single shot. I installed it well, making sure all the mounting surfaces were oil free and put loctite on everything, but this laser just is not made to handle the shock from recoil when attached to a real pistol."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS Laser","review":"I wish I could rate it zero!

The first thing I notice out of the box was the cheap construction. The on/off switch was made of cheap plastic. The rest was aluminum, I'm pretty sure it wasn't aircraft grade...

After having not too much luck with thePressure Switch for Red LasersI bought for this laser sight, I eventually gave up and reattached the original switch. I attached it to my WASR 10/63 and tried to sight it in using the allen wrench that came with it, only to find out that even the tiniest adjustment sent the red dot flying across the target. I shifted the little adjustment screws back and forth for about a half hour until I eventually gave up and threw this piece of crap directly into the garbage. This sight was a colossal waste of time.

Unfortunately, this unit is not only difficult to sight in but it doesn't hold sight location for pistols with ANY recoil. The really tiny hex screw adjustment system is very difficult to use - with non-intuitive interaction between different screws. Once sighted in and the screws tightened down, a single shot from a Walther PK380 - a medium-caliber pistol with an exceptionally light recoil - knocked the sight off-center. Also note that this is not a tiny sight - it barely fit on the Walther, which is a medium-sized pistol (3.6 in barrel). Would probably work great for an Air pistol/rifle or even 22 LR pistol/rifle. Not so for anything more powerful, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke before actual zeroing!","review":"OK, i consider myself fairly reasonable, but to be nice, i think this is the worst purchase i have made on amazon in the past four years. To start off, i did not even get a chance to zero this laser as before i had an opportunity it broke. The screws are next to impossible to zero any weapon with, poorly made, and made for as a pen laser. I would not recommend this for any shooter, not even an air softer. The only thing i can say is it makes my sig p250 look mean! other than that, no reliable functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"50/50","review":"Initially everything was great. I mounted the laser on my Sig Mosquito easily without effecting the slide (there have been issues with tactical mounts causing the slide to bind). Attempting to sight in the laser was excruciatingly annoying. It never actually zeroed, there just wasn't enough adjustment for it to actually work. Later I notice that the laser has a very hard time staying lit, it's clearly not shock resistant. At least I got a decent dog toy for my black lab. She loves it.

I couldn't figure how to adjust the dot to be perfectly aligned with the iron sights on my airsoft gun. It took me like 5-6 hours alone just to try and figure out how to line it up, but not even close to perfectly.

I got it very fast, with all the parts, which is the only reason i gave this thing 1 star. As the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. I took it to the range, sighted it in, and within three rounds had to readjust, then, 3 more round, rinse and repeat for over an hour. So i decided to give it a break, sight it in and then go home, the next week i went back to the range per the usual, and put it on to see if it had improved while it sat in my bag (because gnomes tend to fix things at night). But, low and behold, it was off set by a large difference, and so I just gave it the old tin burial. I wouldn't recommend this to my enemy.However, and its a fairly loose however, if you felt like putting this thing on one of your plastic pellet game guns, it might works as long as you never removed it, and that's a HUGE might. If so, good luck with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Well, what did I expect for the price? What a horrific little piece of junk. Difficult to sight in and won't hold zero without Loctite on the adjustment hex screws, that is, if you don't strip them out like 90% of the buyers seem to have done with this little gem of Chinese engineering.It may be suitable for toy guns, like Airsoft, but not for real weapons.Save your money folks and buy a real laser, like a Viridian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I spent two days trying to sight it in but whenever I managed to get the laser spot in the accurate position, after a few hours it had moved again and I had to do the adjustments all over again. So basically it was useless from the very start.After two days of making adjustments, the screws that I had to fasten and loosen every time again to adjust the position of the laser beam, broke off and made this thing even more useless.Of course you get the quality you pay for. But at the end of the day, the couple of bucks that I tried to save buying this cheap product does in no way justify the amount of frustration that I experienced with this flimsy product.I am very frustrated by this product and advise strongly against buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For $20, Pretty damn terrific...","review":"Mounted on a Hi-point carbine with little difficulty. Took it to the range and hit bullseyes without touching the adjustments! My only criticism is the light is hard to see beyond a certain point and almost impossible to see at the 25 yard distance I normally shoot for pistols. What can you expect on a $20? red laser, as any red laser would work about as well in broad daylight. As this was purchased for nighttime home defense, I think this little laser would work just dandy. One thing I would recommend though is the add on pressure switch as it makes using the laser much easier (you wouldn't want to fumble with the little switch in the back in a tense social situation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NcStar Red Laser Sight/Weaver Mount Review","review":"I ordered this sight for my Glock 19 knowing full well it was cheaper and likely to have some issues, but I decided to give it a shot.

Also no double stick tape or remote switch you have to worry about positioning, no wire to snag. I think it will also be less prone to accidental on/off switching while being carried or stored.I've got a lot of experience with lasers and there is very little off-axis light 'noise.' This means the maximum of the laser energy is devoted to the dot and not 'scatter.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"only good as a training aid","review":"Bought for the cheap price to practice my trigger squeeze by dry firing and watching the gun movement. Fit great on my Sig 229 and decided to try some live fire with it. Switch is fairly easy to activate though it is small and cheap feeling. Aligning it with little set screws was a little time consuming but not imposssible. Worked great for 5 shots with the 40 cal but them it died. If you bang it and wait it would come back on but each shot from that point would casue it to go out. Might be good with a .22 but it can't take the recoil of a large caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"I just recieved this in the mail after only 3 days. I was unsure if this would fit my SW40VE with the rail adapter that I had to purchase so lasers/flashlights would fit, which gave it a picannty rail not a weaver. I have to say I was very impressed with the fact that it does fit and is very tight, since it only says it will fit a weaver style rail. I have fired it many times now and it holds up very well. I would recommend this to anyone with a sigma style pistol that does want to spend a lot but wants a good laser, just make sure you buy the rail adapter first or this will not fit. Great product and great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah.................No. Not for an actual firearm.","review":"Keep in mind I'm writing this review from the standpoint of a firearm user and not an air-soft/paintball user. This laser would probably be excellent for an air-soft gun given the nonexistent recoil. However, I mounted this laser to my Generation 4 Glock 17 pistol and it malfunctioned very quickly. The lens came out of place due to weapon recoil and nothing could be done to get it back into proper working condition. At $15, it wasn't much of a loss, but it is still disappointing considering I was looking for a cheap laser that would do its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS laser","review":"Rail mount works great, adjustments for laser work alright, however... the laser's on/off switch doesn't function correctly. Even in the on position the laser will randomly go off and you have to tap it for it to come back on. Now after about a week of use I'm luck if the laser stays on 5% of the time. The rest of the time it keeps shutting it's self off because the switch is so janky. It's not as if I can tape it down or something, it simply ceases functioning. Now I can't even use it. I might as well throw it in the trash. What a crappy laser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad service, bad product.","review":"Took a week to arrive with expedited shipping...don't pay for that!

It amounts to false advertising if there's no mention made on the packaging and I think THAT should be confronted anytime it ever occurs.If they can't issue the show with the music (which is INTEGRAL to the show in setting the scenes in many cases), it would be better to not do it.

It certainly wasn't the lame acting and writing, which is much more evident without the original music that must have given the show some extra life and meaning. What a disappointment.

The transfer is horrible, looks just like it did years ago on a CRT television. Is it possible that they transferred the show to DVD directly from the VHS? They also did a horrible job of editing. The commercial breaks are poorly done, cutting the shot too soon or sometimes not soon enough. Also, there is some language editing done.

But the Bar-Kays retooled their band after this and into the 1970s, pursued a contemporary funk sound.This collection contains a good slice of material and is composed of groove oriented Southern 1970s funk. This music is pretty stripped, with all the fantastic pops and grooves of the eras best funk.If you like Stax or know the great Soul Finger album, erase this from mind. Other than name, you would never know this as the same band--two completely different eras, two completely different strains of funk.

This is a series book for middle readers. The writing level is not as sophisticated (read: challenging and smooth) as I've seen in other books for this target audience. Let's hope the target reader is more savvy than what the plot offers and doesn't buy into some of the mean-spirited activities the girls are engaged in. The story perpetuates some of what is wrong in how we treat each other. Reiterating poor behavior and bad choices for teens who are absorbing what they read is never good. The story isn't written well enough for them to draw out (what we expect) is a positive life lesson. If you can read this with your pre-teen, there's an opportunity to talk about how people treat each other; how it feels/what it would feel like to be the odd person out; how it feels when someone plays tricks on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"something happened...","review":"Ok, two years ago this series was a WHOLE COMIC BOOK, instead of a chapter book with a few pages of comic.

The artwork is so good, I can see myself as a charecter in this series. The charecters kinda bug me too. Cornelia is a stupid brat, Will is so cheesy (if we just BELIVE in the heart of candracar, we can save the world!! pshh. Please.), and Taranee...dont get me started. She is a disgrace to all Aries.

It was also written in a format destined for younger children instead of teenagers. I am bitterly disapionted since alot of my friends wanted to read it.

In all that time I've never given up on the band (even during the Unmasked & Crazy Nights eras, I even loved The Elder). To be honest I didn't think it was possible for Kiss to make a bad live CD but I was wrong. Don't get me wrong... the song selection is great, the band is great but Alive III is far to over produced. It just sounds fake, like the band played to an empty hall and dubbed in the audience. It sounds so obvious during Paul's abbreviated between song chatter & as previous reviewers said during certain songs. I am totally shoked that something bearing Eddie Kramer's name should be so poorly produced (Who knows maybe it's the \\"and Kiss\\" part of the production team that was the problem).

The next book about Smurfs by this author does have far more pictures of Smurf figurines, but the identifications under the pictures are confusing and hard to read.

You can hear it in the delicate and romantic build of \\"The Gift,\\" which is still probably the pinnacle of their career. They're adept at rocking the dancefloor (as with or the dub-inflected \\"Dancehall Tornado\\") and bringing in harmonies to complement the beats (as with the semi-tropical \\"Domination\\" or the mysterious \\"Questions Never Answered\\"). Sure, sometimes they go for straight up club tracks like \\"Sequoia\\" or \\"Drive By,\\" but even those carry a carefully considered sense of craft.

Hey, the kid is in every scene; it's his movie. John Ritter doesn't appear much or do much (although he does it competently). But Aaron Stanford is the star and deserves more credit than Ritter."},{"rating":"1","title":"been done better before","review":"I like the Idea of the film&it's cool from that perspective but the acting&direction of the film never fully get to the point of where it should.it takes on more than it can muster.a waste of John Ritter's Talent in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"TADPOLE IS NO IGBY","review":"TADPOLE is a nick-name for 15 year-old Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford), who pines incessantly for his stepmother (Sigourny Weaver).Over Thanksgiving break, Oscar comes to Manhatten, drinks heavily, and ends up in bed with his stepmom's best friend Diane (a scene stealing Bebe Neuwirth). Oscar takes up a lot of the remaining film trying to convince Diane not to tell his stepmom.Tadpole's main problem is Aaron Stanford, who not only looks too old to be a high school sophomore but plays Oscar as very gay while still trying to be a ladies' man. Gender confusion might be a worthy subject for a black comedy, but that's not the issue here.Too bad Tadpole didn't run into Igby, another pretentious spoiled but charmingly demented teen in Manhatten on school break. He could learn a few things. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lusciously Delicate Coming of Age Film...","review":"Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) arrives in New York City by train as he has a short vacation from Chauncey Academy where he attends high school. Oscar is to celebrate Thanksgiving with his father Stanley (John Ritter) and stepmother Eve (Sigourney Weaver), but it is about to be a peculiar experience for Oscar since he has fallen deeply in love with his stepmother. The love that Oscar has for Eve causes friction between him and his dad who attempts to make it an enjoyable break for his son. By a coincidence Oscar ends up in bed with Eve's best friend Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), which causes some additional awkwardness for Oscar as he spends his break in New York. Tadpole is an excellent drama about coming of age and the youthful discovery of love that can sometimes be misunderstood. The story unfolds with remarkable ease as it displays the misfortunes and tragedies that can be connected with love, leaving the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Attempt at Feminism","review":"This book is a simple way to portray the differences between male and female stereotypes in our society. In general, it does an ok job at that, but it can sometimes come off as abrasive when the girls insult the boys and the boys insult the girls.Also, the book gets the terms \\"gender\\" and \\"sex\\" VERY confused. Gender is what you are on the inside (born a boy, feel like a girl inside) and sex is what you are physically.This book was a cute, quick read for younger kids who aren't very bright-- it's message was pretty obvious and the style wasn't great.Love the psychedelic desgins tho!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Homemade!","review":"Bisquick is the best baking mix on the market, and provides a good start for pancakes and crepes. I like the 7.5 ounce units because you don't end up with extra batter. This size is perfect for our family of 3.Depending on what kind of consistency you prefer, you can add more or less milk, and another egg to the mix if you like. I like my pancakes more crepe-like but my daughter likes hers to be fluffier. With this mix, I can make hers first, with a heavier batter, and then add more milk to the leftover mix and make my crepes!We actually don't use this mix for biscuits, but just for pancakes and crepes, as we aren't really biscuit eaters.Amazons price is, of course, just right for this product. I feel good just knowing I have a case in my pantry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever Biscuit Mix!","review":"My husband never cared much for my homemade biscuits. I didn't make them often enough to really get it right like my mother and grandmother used to do. Then I tried the Betty Crocker Bisquick Mix and WOW what a difference it made.

My husband is now a very happy man when I make his favorite sausage gravy & biscuits breakfast."},{"rating":"2","title":"great way to cook","review":"The fryer works great - temperature settings, controls, speed of heating. Magnetic power attachment a nice touch. Capacity is kind of low, but for the price, it's a good deal. The removable frying pot is great for clean up. Outer plastic really does stay cool. The old stainless fryers could burn you on contact. The oil does tend to splatter beyond the inner bowl onto the heating element, so odor is a small problem. Other than that, great value. Nothing like home made french fries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"First time cooking tasted like hell...but I think the unit was \\"too new\\" and had to burn off the unit first. After that, I made Fish, chicken, french fries and all turned out nice and crisp without being soggy with oil.the only thing that I don't like is that the cord is too short.Some people mentioned removing some screw for the thermostat, but I couldn't figure it out...seems to work fine without that modification to me.....unit is hotter to touch, so \\"cool daddy\\" is a misnomer...be careful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fryer","review":"I only gave it 4 stars because it is so big and takes up so much space on my counter.

A tale of passion no doubt, a string of sexual encounters, a pursuit of various women, and a psychic or two thrown into the story to tell the main character about his past life. Huge disappointment. Very badly written and poorly edited. There are better books that discuss karma and the soul.

So, who really knows? 'Taro Rota' isn't as bad as I was expecting - as one old school Atomic Rooster fan told me this was a sheer waste of time. Although I do not understand why all three of this CD's tracks are of the same title - possibly a typo? You sure this wasn't reissued on the Cleopatra label? Private joke, there. As for the tunes - #1 \\"Taro Rota\\" (22:30) is best described as low-key progressive, #2 \\"Taro Rota\\" (3:21) is a reworking of the Rooster's \\"Tomorrow Night\\" and #3 \\"Taro Rota\\" (22:29) is quite similar to track number one. This little-known 1976 Vincent Crane recording got it's name from Crane's widow - Jeanie - while dabbling in Tarot cards. Okay! Pretty much aimed toward the absolute completists and die-hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"~The Greatest BRC Album~","review":"\\"It Won't Be the Last\\" is my favorite of all of Billy Ray Cyrus's albums.

The book is descriptively well written, but is also full of inaccuracies caused by the authors lack of knowlege of local languages and of modern Papua New Guinea. The people he descibes may well be highly isolated but as with most of PNG, their names are included in the common role. Had he given imself more time he could have obatined proper maps which reveal the location of the village and the fictitious volcano he descibes. He could also have learnt Pidgin properly which would have been useful in getting himeself out of the situation that arose. What the author doesn't know is that after his departure from Wanakepa those villagers were forced to pay huge compensation for what happened. They would like the author to bare some of the cost. I'm sure this could be arranged through MAF whoom he can contact through the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Glitter's Gone to Seed, So Who Will Save Us Now?","review":"Yet another of my purchases on a whim. This neo-psychedelic shoegazing band puts out a sonically beautiful noise that is at times early Floyd, white album Beatles, and even early 90's shoegazers like Ride and My Bloody Valentine. One should check out this limited version, as it contains extra songs, the full twenty-minute version of the title song (with a Revolution 9-like ending), and a hauntingly beautiful rendition of Best Wishes (a single of theirs from a few years ago). Other strong songs include the singles Aire & Calder, Stay Young (this review's title comes from it), Same Band, and Floodlit World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine historical performances","review":"These spirited performances are from 1954 and are monaural, with some pseudo-stereo in the \\"Four Seasons\\"; they are not period instrument performances. Scherchen was an excellent, if occasionally eccentric, conductor who somewhat dominates the proceedings, sometimes overwhelming violinist Olevsky, although he is often quite expressive, given the chance. The harpsichord is often prominent. A nice set, but not really competitive with more recent and historically informed performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"yogo video","review":"Unfortunately I thought that I was ordering a dvd and could not use the video so gave it away to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose, redundant, shallow. Is this really and an American Classic?","review":"Seriously folks, this book is way too long considering the content. Was Dreiser getting paid by the word? I have never not finished a book but about half way thru book two I would have put it down except I was on a long flight and I had to read something besides the silly flight magazines. With the poor, two dimensional development of personages this book cant hold a candle to Dostoevsky or Trollope. We have much better American authors so why is this an American classic?To be sure, I am no english professor and this is the first and hopefully last book review I will ever write but as a working class reader I can say this was a tough slog to read with no reward. Life is too short for books like this one.Take my advice... Look elsewhere for a good book. Save yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About time","review":"This was a landmark series. I remember it being part of the CBS Monday night line-up after Newhart and Kate & Allie. Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly dominated the Emmy Awards for the entire run of the series - no other dramatic actress on TV during the 1980s could come close. The most vivid episode I recall was from season 2, I believe as Sidney Clute was still alive, called \\"Heat.\\" Mary Beth is held hostage during the summer in a boxcar. Tyne was - no IS incredible! I can't say enough about this series or the two actresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of its generation","review":"One of the best cop shows of its generation; and simultaneously one of the best buddy shows. Gless and Daley are simply wonderful together and the police adventures they live through are of a higher caliber (so to speak) than most of the others of the late 70s and early 80s. It's a crime, though, that the entire series isn't out on DVD yet. P.S. I just read that someone is bringing out the complete series this year. Great news, hope it's affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best team before Benson & Stabler on L&O: SVU","review":"I recently discovered Cagney and Lacey on the internet so I am probably one of the youngest fans(I'm 27). This was a groundbreaking cop show! Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly were amazing as Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey, respectively. One was tough, the other sympathetic and caring. C&L put the grid on the map for the women's movement and showed real women can do a job just as good as a male cops can while maintaining a professional and personal life. I hope to see the other seasons released on DVD soon but until then I will be catching up on this wonderful show online on hulu.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU!!!","review":"\\"Cagney & Lacey\\" is my all-time favorite show. I haven't seen it in years, and I've sorely missed it. Now, I have it on DVD, and it's just as good as I remember it being. It's such a great drama with strong female leads who could be tough, but also vulernable. It's also a testament to the value of close friendship. The acting could not be better!

But watching them again is like seeing old friends, and I marvel at the talent of Ms. Gless and Ms. Daly. Watching season one just gives you a little taste and makes you long for more episodes, even though you know the outcome of what is coming. As the series advanced, the writing got better and better, along with character development. Barney Rosenzweig really knew what he was doing and there will never again be another Cagney and Lacey.

It takes forever to actually make a water fall work and is very frustrating.You have the ability to build rides through terrain now but this to is virtually impossible to accomplish. And often the rides won't function. I receive constant pop-ups saying the ride stations are not long enough for the ride cars, even though you can see the cars sitting in the station. Terrain is a major problem as que lines no longer line up with the ground, forcing you to spend alot of time trying to adjust the surrounding land to the proper height.This expansion pack, if anything, is very frustrating, much more so than the original problems with RT3.In the first 2 version of this game it was very easy to build through mountains and underground, those days are long gone here. Unless you have hours to spend mastering this new stuff, you may want to think twice before you add this pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great game","review":"The Soaked expansion adds loads of new features to RCT3, including the ability to add water parks, waterfalls, lazer and water shows.

That took some work too-not just any work more like TONS of work. I was exiting for the first few hours but then I wished I hadn't installed it.

The first 4 songs however are fantastic and include two of Giant's top songs, Proclamation and So Sincere. Aspirations is my personal favorite from this album, as it features lovely electric keyboard work from Kerry Minnear. You may find this album irritating at times though as it is over the top with changing time signatures, its up beat - its off beat, its turning around on itself....Not as much acoustic work as the other Giant albums from this period and the keyboards really seem to dominate more so than on In A Glass House, for example, where the guitar, violin and recorders play a bigger role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still bad 30 years later","review":"I was there dude!

No melody, no hooks, the vocals are painfully awful and there is no instrumental virtuosity to make up for it.I think the band members (or their mothers) wrote the glowing reviews here.

Unfortunately, the piano player isn't quite up to speed on this date, playing a little behind the beat and struggling a bit on his solos. Most people probably won't even notice, however, as the guitarist more than makes up for this slight deficiency with his distinctive sound and deft playing. KR excels especially on the last track, \\"Conception,\\" which is worth the price of the disk all on its own.All in all, a date which is sure to please straight-ahead jazz lovers and, perhaps, may influence cross-over audiences to delve further into the rich, century-old tradition of jazz music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I saw K.R. live a few years ago with Ben Street and it sounded great....very fun jazz...like Marc Johnson or Bill Frisell.

He regales us with drugs & booze jokes, like a standup leftover from the early 1960s Brat Pack era. He tries too hard to be funny. His \\"jokes\\" are old and obvious.And there's much phony posturing, for he pulls his punches lest he TRULY offend his PC employers at Rolling Stone.He opposes \\"Democratic big government\\" because, he says, he likes to speed while driving drunk and fondling big-breasted women.

One of PJ's finest albums, it includes uncompromising visions and scorching imagery. Some of the songs can be found in better format on 4-TRACK DEMOS while other tracks are exclusive to this disc. Essential listening material best appreciated alongside 4-TRACK DEMOS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked","review":"PJ's second full-length album finds her tapping a harder and darker muse. Her guitar work on this album ranges from subtle and quiet to loud and abrasive. As for her vocals, they are sinister and playful, in a very wicked way. And that's just in the title track. In any case, this is probably PJ's roughest album (produced by Steve Albini), and least accessible. I'd reccommend this to fans of Dry. If you're a fan of her later albums (namely, Is This Desire? and To Bring You My Love), you might want to give this one wide berth, as it's definitely more straight-ahead rock and raw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired","review":"I picked this album up seemingly by accident--I was travelling in the south of Ireland and one of my hostesses lent me a \\"blank\\" tape onto the first side of which I recorded Doolittle. Several weeks later, I fell asleep on a bus and the recorder switched to the other side, revealing the hidden album--I was kicked out of sleep by Rid of Me's powerful chorus, and, needless to say, the remaining months of my travels were perforated by PJ Harvey's delicious howl.That was over ten years ago now, and I still listen to this album regularly (read: at least twice a month.) Throughout her career, PJ Harvey has consistently impressed me, each album unconsciously adventurous & profound, yet strangely familiar. I highly recommend her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not.......","review":"Ok. I will admit that the first time that I came into contact with Harvey's music was with Is This Desire. I was blown away and thought that it was brilliant. Obviously I had to try her older work, so I got Rid Of Me. What a disappointment! I know that other reviewers have commented that they enjoy the sound on this CD, but I think it is terrible. It is overwhelmimgly repetitive, not even vaguely aesthetically noisy and impossible for me to listen to.......and believe me...I have tried a few times to get into it....with absolutely no success. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it is PJ and maybe this paved the way for a work of pure genius...ie...Is This Desire. Well, time now for me to rid myself of this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated.","review":"PJ Harvey is for the most part bland -- just more overhyped Anglo posturing. Consistently fooling critics on that side of the Atlantic is no accomplishment, but somehow Harvey's got the Yanks' attention too. Props to her for that, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This is easily the most overrated of P.J. Harvey's records and is perhaps one of the most overrated alternative records released in the 1990s. The production and song-writing is as shoddy as it gets. With the exception of the misplaced experiment with violins, \\"Man-Sized Sextet\\" (which was better executed on later records), and the melodic, \\"Missed\\" (reminescent of her debut release, 'Dry'), the simple punk/riff which works on some of the tracks (\\"Rid of Me\\", \\"Yuri-G\\", and Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\") becomes tiresome after a short time.NOTE: Whether you agree with my assessment of this record or not, people who really seem to like this record also seem to like her new record (\\"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\\") but not 1995's \\"To Bring You My Love\\" or 1998's \\"Is This Desire\\", both of which represent far-better productions by Flood. Depending on where you are on the P.J. Harvey fan spectrum, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best.","review":"I adore PJ Harvey. She is a genius,an original, and in a league all her own but Rid Of Me (her second album) left me disappointed. I love all her other albums especially Dry and Stories from the city, stories from the sea but Rid Of Me is not catchy. I don't mind indie albums but this one has no production quality, too under-produced and I can bearly hear her amazing voice and cool lyrics. I only like two songs which are the title-track and Missed. Skip this album, not much to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Harvey","review":"One of her angrier, more energetic albums. It has a lot of emotional resonance that is familiar to her work. However it is unlike 'Stories from the Sea' which is more melo/alternative rock.

Every song is a work of art including the obsessive \\"Rid Of Me\\", the male dominance of \\"50 Foot Queenie\\" and \\"Man Size\\" to the comeuppance of \\"Dry.\\" My only frustration is with Steve Albini's production style which always seems the same with his quiet then loud approach. Sometimes it feels like he is squelching some of the power that the songs contain. Still, PJ always manages to never let you down with her rawness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blistering, but....","review":"It's difficult to put into words what a dissonant, blistering, emotional masterpiece this is, for PJ Harvey's \\"Rid of Me\\" is easily one of the top 10 albums of the 90s. Few artists can combine raw, gritty post-punk and blues with rapid-fire time signature changes and atonal dynamics like this rage-filled slide-guitar artiste from Yeovil. However, Steve Albini's production \\"values\\" leave much to be desired, for he mixed back, distorted, and subdued much of her voice (most other reviewers will agree.)So here's a suggestion, Polly Jean. Round up the musicians who helped create this masterpiece, find a producer who will bring out and accentuate--not hide--your edgy, yet wide-ranging vocal stylistics, and re-record this album note-for-note. Hard to believe, but \\"Rid of Me\\" can be improved, and I would be among the first in line to purchase the new version; perhaps you could call it \\"Rid of Albini.\\" Just a thought, of course...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubby Approved","review":"My husband LOVES the Slap-Ya-Mama seasonings!

This author was GIVEN three memorable characters caught up in one of the great dramas of all time with backgrounds in London, Paris, New York -- and the best he could do was this? Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"as time goes by","review":"Overall, I found this book a great read. The one major problem ihave is in the movie, it is Victor who says he had to meet with Berger, but in the novel Ilsa tells Rick she was the underground agent that was to meet with Berger. Other than that, this story very well could be filmed as the long awaited sequel to Casablanca."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Time Goes By","review":"Casablanca has always been my favorite movie. As Time Goes By is a perfect ending to the story. For years I have wanted someone to write a follow-up to the original, and it has now been done. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the \\"Howard the Duck\\" of fiction","review":"You must NOT remember this. One can only imagine what prompted a sequel to \\"Casablanca\\" where Louis Rennault and Victor Lazlo are killed off, Richard Blaine is cast as a Jewish mobster on the run, but he and Ilsa still end up MARRIED and returning to Casablanca. The author unfortunately misses the whole point and tenor of the classic motion picture. The only greater disappointment is that a major publishing sanctioned this book. What next, Marie Osmond as Ilsa in the TV movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An amature effort, to say the least.","review":"I found it very disappointing, being a fan of the film. The story was more appropriate for a pulp magazine or comic book, full of cliche's and generally lightweight. Dialogue is corny, the character development shallow. don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like any other sequel, only more so.","review":"Like most people who buy this book, I am a huge fan of the movie, \\"Casablanca\\". I purchased, \\"As Time Goes By\\" to it to bring back the emotions of the movie. As I began reading the book I almost stopped myself many times thinking I was cheating my cherished Casablanca memories. The story or my love for the original movie kept me reading. Mr. Walsh did a good job of creating an interesting past for Rick, however his future was pretty hooky. Some of the characters headed into unbelievable areas. Victor Laslo turned very dark and jeopardizes Ilsa's life for his obsession. Mr. Walsh cheapens his tale with tongue in cheek references to Humphrey Bogart's career and cause of death. All that said it was not really a bad book. I hope it is not made into a movie so that I will not be tempted to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, although not necessary.","review":"I never really thought of too many questions regarding \\"Casablanca\\". That it is one of the greatest movies ever made everybody knows. But I have always watched it as a whole, never wondering that much about everybody's lives. Of course we are all curious about Rick's past, but it's part of the movie. Now, though, after reading this novel, it becomes somewhat clearer, and it's easier to understand some character's actions. If you're not from some cult religion that regards \\"Casablanca\\" as a sacred, than you will enjoy this book, and get to finf out all those tidbits we were all somewhat interested for so long"},{"rating":"1","title":"A constant torture!!","review":"One star is a far too good rating for this terrible piece of writing.

All the original characters from CASABLANCA came alive for me...what a wonderful idea to write a sequel from the days of that foggy good-bye be- tween Ilsa and Rick! Michael is definitely in touch with his feminine and masculine sides as the book for me, was truly balanced; I love mysteries but I also love when they are solved and Mr. Walsh has done this for me. Thank you!!! Carole Hemingway"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to tell the truth","review":"This is not \\"Casablanca\\".That's pretty obvious. I am going to be completely honest here: this is a fun novel that is clearly a labour of love by the author. However, it's more to do with action than the bitter romance of the original movie.This is not a sacreligious text in any way to the movie: it's a fun continuation that is worthy of a read. So long as you don't go into it expecting a perfect novelisation of \\"Casablanca\\" you'll enjoy reading this - it's well written, lively and the sly winks to Bogart's character in the movie and Bogart's career are used well to flesh out the story and develop the characters.Walsh has taken a brave step - he was bound to get into trouble for writing a sequel to \\"Casablanca\\". I would agree that a few too many loose ends are tied up in this novel, but on the whole Walsh's grasp of the ambigious past (and future) work well without making Rick an open-book character."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"I loved the movie and thought a sequel could at the very least be a fun read. This however is one of the worst books I've seen in a lifetime of reading. It reads as if it were written in a day or two and never edited. Cliches run amok. Ilsa declares \\"He makes me feel like a woman!\\" (As opposed to a gerbil?) Painful mixed metaphors, anachronisms, and just dumb writing abound. Rick is described as enjoying having a wad of cash from which he peeled off 20's \\"as if they were candy.\\" Huh? Renault is described as a \\"dapper little Frenchman\\" about forty times. The immigrant gangster Solly Horowitz suddenly declares \\"I like the cut of his jib\\"! Awful, awful, awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an abject failure","review":"This book is blessed with an interesting storyline and uses historical references quite well to tie itself into World War Two. There's one basic problem, however. Its success hinges upon Rick following Ilsa through Portugal to London, which in my estimetion devalues his self-sacrifice at the end of the movie Casablanca. The ending of the movie is valueless, in my opinion, without Rick having to knowingly give up Ilsa in favor of the greater cause, but herein he's simply separated from her for a little while. Worth skipping if you want to keep the mystique of the movie alive in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and fun...","review":"Having seen Casablanca at least two dozen times, As Time Goes By was, for me, fun & nostalgic, giving some of my all-time favorite characters both a past & a future. These may not have been the pasts I would have thought, nor the futures that I would have planned, however, I believe that Michael Walsh put his heart into this effort, keeping to & picking up on the details of the movie dialogue & innuendo, & obviously enjoying himself in the process! This book added dimension to each of the characters -- the sides we witnessed in the film were only in Casablanca, after all, & only over the course of a couple of days. Keeping in mind that this is a light, \\"fun\\" read, & not something to find subliminal meanings in will only add to your enjoyment. At the same time, this was no small undertaking on the part of the author -- & whenever I want a book to \\"keep on going\\" as I near the end, I always applaud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible sequel","review":"I know that writing is difficult, and I look for the good things in a book. But I really thought that this one completely failed to capture the magic of Casablanca. The characters, the settings; you could have put different names in the story, and it wouldn't remind you of \\"Casablanca\\" at all. I think that Time-Warner wanted to make a buck on the renewed interest in Casablanca and put this out. You'd get a better \\"Bogart\\" story by reading Dashiell Hammett's \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" or Raymond Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"It was brave of Walsh to try and write a sequel,but it really isn't very good.What made Casablanca such a good movie(in my opinion)was that Rick gave up Ilsa for the greater cause and the way Victor loved Ilsa so much,but in this sequel Rick was simply separated from her for a while and the bittersweet romance is gone;also,Victor was willing to let Ilsa die,and has become much more jealous of Ilsa and Rick's love then he was in the movie. I would recommend NOT reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murderer! Murderer! Imagination Killer!","review":"I echo the comments made by Kevin Nenstiel and would like to add that in direct contradiction to the end of the movie which left much to the imagination, the end of the book sews up every single loose thread ad nauseum. I resent the fact that Ilsa is hinted to have slept with Rick after she knew Victor was alive. Victor is reduced to a simpering vengeful coward who is taken in by the British, and Renault's political conversion is demoralized."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, ill conceived effort. It is not worth the reading.","review":"I had hoped this would be a worthy sequel to the story of Rick, Ilsa, Victor and Louie. Instead this novel is boring, implausable, and dull. I truly hope no one thinks this has potential to be a motion picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, unconvincing development of characters.","review":"This is a bad book. The characters you know from Casablanca transform radically - for unknown reasons, and extremely unconvincingly - into someone else. Rick takes sides and becomes involved in a lunatic plot, with Laszlo becoming his co-conspirator and SHE the super-spy, infiltrating the enemy. Please. On top of it, it is very poorly written, some dialogues actually hurt. No good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't go by fast enough!","review":"I was sadly disappointed by this book. First of all, the Kindle edition had numerous misspellings, format errors, typos and stretches of missing text. That alone made the book difficult to enjoy. At a cost of $12.99 the book ought to be edited correctly, at least. Where to start with the novel? The plot was weak and featured characters and dialogue copied verbatim from the movie and sprinkled throughout. The \\"back story\\" read like it was written on the back of a paper bag in about 15 minutes. There were a few historical errors as well, but hey, who wants to nit-pick? Put a DNR (Do Not Read) on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but not amamzing","review":"I think this book didi a good job of capturing the spirit of the movie, but fell a little short in the execution.

I was in some New age groups in my 20s and found them interesting but too intense and unpractical for me.I also related well to the main character's search for meaning and his work with midnight basketball leagues - I helped with some of the latter and still coach youth basketball.Finally, I think Gary Cole and Lolita Davidovich are underrated actors who deserve to be seen more widely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great suspense writer","review":"So far, this is tho only book I have read by Tom Piccirilli, but it is more than enough to make me want to read more.

I have to agree with the other couple of people who gave this book 1-2 stars. I just could NOT get into it!For the first quarter of the book, the story line was hard to follow and b/c you aren't really told what is going on. By the time you piece together exactly what the plot is, you realize that you really don't, and never did, care. This is because the characters are undeveloped and emotionlessly unnatural.

The second time I read it I got about 150 pages in, I had an idea of what was going on now but I still couldn'd get passed the depression and dark atmosphere that Picccirilli created. Im giving this book 4 stars because I think thats exactly what Piccirilli was intending. A very dark, atmospheric and depressing read.

Some have been marginally helpful, some have been amusing, some have been frustrating. Not one, however, has told me--clearly and convincingly--HOW to write. That changed when I picked up Caroline Joy Adams' \\"The Power to Write.\\" This book is solid gold, a glittering gem. Ms. Adams begins by building the reader's self-confidence, which she calls Key 1 (\\"Know That You Have the Power to Write\\"). She then explains and illustrates--with six additional keys and writing samples--the steps to producing quality, high-energy, inspired writing.I treasure this book. I think it's the best of its genre on the market. And it comes with a bonus--Ms. Adams' elegant calligraphy.

I am giving it two stars for a couple of ideas I gleaned from this slim book but I'm SO glad I didn't pay full price! I think it would have benefited from story examples by other, better writers. The author used only her own stories and ... she's not a good writer. Long, convoluted rambling sentences - more than once I had to start reading the piece again to try and figure out what the heck she was trying to say. When she said in \\"March Morning\\" that the police would not look for her missing baby for 24 or 48 hours or some such nonsense, she lost me completely. Obviously she's been sniffing too much ink. When a child or baby is involved, ANY law enforcement agency in this country would immediately start a search.

However, since I last heard Gene, they changed their style - tried to get away from all the Smiths comparisons - Yikes!!, If this is what you get?? I will tell you that Gene is a brilliant band and would love to see them in concert - Hopefully they would not play too many songs from this album.

Depending on the song you choose from Akvarium, you may say \\"hey, they sound a bit like...\\" any of twenty different bands... but they ultimately sound only like Akvarium. This collection touches upon the folk-rock Akvarium (\\"hey, they sound like Dylan & the Dead\\"), the new wave side of Akvarium (\\"hey, they sound like the Police... but they're singing about Eno\\"), the rock anthem side of Akvarium (\\"hey, rock on, Dude!\\") and a bit of the weird, Brecht-rock side of Akvarium (\\"hey... what the hell is that?!?\\").

A welcome riposte to what was then the pompous Orzabal - probably his defense mechanism of a lack of his former brilliance as a songsmith).Come on guys, like most great bands they had their 3 brilliant first albums (this 4th not being one of them), and it's time to let go.Nothing they ever did individually or together after Seeds could touch their first 3.Even the initially catching Break It Down Again exposes big holes in the songwriting after repeated listens - unlike anything in their first 3 this sounds just dated.Tears For Fears, like the Beatles, is gone. Get over it. Every few years dust off The Hurting, Big Chair and Seeds, and prepared to be amazed like yore. And that's more than enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Recording","review":"This album is absolutely stunning.

They're not shadows of their former glory, they are better than they have ever been - more sophisticated, more passionate, more technically capable. I love Tears for Fears. They are a fantastic band. I can't get enough of them, and that's coming from a stern and ruthless music critic. Led by Roland Orzabal, probably the finest popular musicians on the planet. Some of the critics hate them.

I only thought I was a fan until I started checking out the backlog of what I had missed. And Elemental is the pinnacle. The layered beauty of the sounds, is only surpassed by the amazing power and suppleness of his voice.(Check out 'Cold'. How does one get so many sounds out of the 2 syllable word guru?)

The opening track, 'Elemental', itself gives a promising start to this new album. This track is not without it's charm - but the superb 'Cold' makes up for that. It's combination of Lennonesque guitar riffs makes it incredibely appealing to all listeners. This stands alone as one of the best tracks on the album, alongside 'Dog's A Best Friend's Dog', 'Fish Out Of Water' and 'Goodnight Song' (played so wrong!). Tears For Fears had proved they had lost nothing. This album was to serve merely as a light taster before their masterpiece - 'Raoul And The Kings Of Spain' - was released, to wide acclaim. Overall, 'Elemental' is a classic album. Unfortunately, it does not live up to the standards of 'Seeds Of Love'. But, still, an improvement on 'Songs From The Big Chair', possibly Tears For Fears' worst album next to 'The Hurting'. Classic Stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"listen visually","review":"(true story) I worked at a bike shop where we listened to this record nearly everyday for an entire summer. we each got to pick a cd to play and Jack's pick was frequently Elemental by Tears for Fears.

This led him to begin learning and studying about the Jewish religion that he had been born into. Through this return he found a deeper and renewed meaning to his life.This work is the sequel and continuation of his first autobiographical work 'Ragman's Son'. It is not as event-filled but makes up for this with its sincere reflectiveness. Douglas is a person of many talents, one of the great screen actors of America, and a person of great courage and determination.He provides in this work a vivid example of how new meaning in life can be found by 'return' to the religious tradition in which one has been born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading but not up to Rag Man in substance.","review":"My family is from Amersterdam (author's home town) and my mother from Vitebsk (author's mother's home), so I have a special interest in anything that Kirk writes.

Let's face it: COM is an UGLY architecture (mostly because of its C language and RPC heritage). The authors of this book know this fully well and don't try to hide the fact. Instead, their approach is to learn to live with the shortcomings of COM by providing the conceptual underpinnings necessary to bend COM to your will. Recommended for developers who need to understand DCOM to the greatest depth, but who would like to read something a little more interesting than the documentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books Available","review":"The book lists all COM buzzwords on it back cover. Unfortunately not one is covered well. The book is - simply put - poorly written. The Roger Sessions book had the same problems but it at least was some fun reading.

The 2D computer animation was amazing. It had such a strange and interesting appearance compared to either traditional 2D or \\"Toy Story\\" type 3D and was the perfect medium for bringing an originally illustrated story to life. Unlike the picky people here who resent Drew Barrymore voicing Olive I didn't know who pretty much any of the actors were when I first saw this movie and enjoyed their work an awful lot. Yes it got a little rough at times in that you don't expect to see reindeer roughing anyone up in a standard Christmas story but I felt it was not objectionable. And yes Olive has a really tough time getting past all the difficult and cynical people she comes across, but guess what people? That's just like life! Olive perseveres and with the help of her trusted friend succeeds. A sweet Christmas story and a good lesson all wrapped up into one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite in our family","review":"This movie is quite cute for kids and adults alike.

The movie is nothing like the book. Other than Olive and the fact that she hears something on the radio and sets off to save Christmas, there's little similarity to the original book.On it's own, the movie was OK.

I bought this video for my three-year-old because he loves the book--which is sweet and innocent (Olive ACTUALLY does think she must be a reindeer) AND sooo beautifully drawn, but the movie is filled with mean people and animals who are anti-christmas, shysters or simply selfish. The entire way through the movie Olive is working her way against miserable characters. I had a difficult time watching this and finally turned it off after Olive got to the North Pole--the reindeer beating up on Olive in the bar was just too much. This isn't funny for a three-year-old innocent, it's just mean.

In fact, my kids don't watch any TV at all and earn 1 movie night a week. They were very confused by all the violence and anger in the Olive movie. \\"Why did the postman take Olive and the penguin?

Matt Groening needs to stick to adult fare. All three of my children (ages range from 7 to 15) hated it. It was boring, the music was absolutely horrendous, and the characters (with the exception of Olive and a few others) were obnoxious and morally reprehensible. Yet these deviants were presented as \\"good-hearted.\\" I can't believe Michael Stipe lent his voice to the lyrically challenged Schnitzel. What was he thinking? How anyone could compare this tripe to films such as \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is completely beyond me. Please, bring back Charlie Brown, Frosty, Rudolph, and Jimmy Stewart.

That is fine for them, but this book deserves a more open minded look. It is an unusual topic and as such is certainly not for everyone. But Reunions is well balanced between science and the mystical, and Moody's generous and well thought out suggestions for reproducing the experiences he reports offer hope for those who are interested in what can be a healing if not mind-expanding experience.

With Reunions, Moody presents his technique for using scrying by mirrors to encounter deceased loved ones. He does a good job of describing the technique, even providing a do-it-yourself guide. But he leaves the reader hanging on, wondering if he thinks the technique is valid or not. Sort of takes the wind out of the sails of the narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Further exploration into life after death.","review":"After reading Life After Life and Reflections on Life After Life I was sure there must be more to our spiritual existence.

I don't even know where to begin with what went wrong. They did not capture the dark,gritty essence of the comic book! The movie was almost laughable! I have not seen the director's cut yet,but I really don't think they can fix this one with some added scenes.

The DVD gives you the option to play this with the movie or see it separatly my advise is to play it with the movie every time you put it on. And they add a little side story with Frank and a war buddy that puts the peces together on the matter of who gave him up to John Saint.

I was that disapointed that Amazon have refunded my purchase price. It is now going to be pot luck when titles are purchased as to whether you get your dollars worth.

The scene that gets him started on his quest was more than a little much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good action movie to watch with the guys...","review":"Although this movie is not a 'masterpiece' it is still fun to watch with some friends. There are some great one liners (very cheesy, actually so cheesy they make you laugh)...and theres plenty of action. For those of you who arent familar with the punisher...he is an FBI agent named Frank Castle whose entire family was murdered by the Saints' family. They thought they killed him but as always...they didnt, and suprise suprise...hes a little pissed. The movie kept me and my friends entertained and we all thought the ending was cool when all the pieces fall in place to the punisher's plan. This is just the first of the trilogy, the next one is hopefully going to be realeased in the fall of 2005.

I've been a Punisher fan for years and they really hit the bullseye(not intended for Daredevil)with this film, a great cast, great story (so they changed it quite a bit. so what?)and most important, location for filming, Tampa Bay. You can't fit every super hero in New York City, I mean you got Spider-Man,X-Men, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, etc, you keep that up you might as well put the Statue of Liberty in spandex and a cape. There should have been a Stan Lee appearance in the movie but that's cool, because there will be a second \\"Punisher\\" movie. Thomas Jane brought a whole lot a flavor to the title character as well as my idol John Travolta as Howard Saint. This movie lived up to the Marvel brand and I'm hoping for a 2 DVD set in October.

After all, any movie called The Punisher, well, one would expect to see PUNISHMENT.

In my opinion, Frank Castle isn't even really \\"The Punisher\\" until the last few minutes of the movie (though the action is spread throughout).Think of this movie as more of a prequel than an actual \\"PUNISHER\\" film...the story that tells why and how Frank changed from a loving husband/father into a barely human Terminator.It's not the film I thought I was getting...but it was the right way to do the story, and a solid film to boot.

The Punisher (2004) is slow, boring and has little to do with the comic book it's based on. Thomas Jane is terrible, and has to mutter corny lines like \\"Do you get paid by the murder or do you get a group rate?\\" Which makes no sense in the context of the scene. John Travolta is way over the top this time, more so than in \\"Battlefield Earth\\". Jonathan Hensleigh a screenwriter-cum-director doesn't know whether he's directing camp or a serous drama and has a result the movie veers from one to the other in a jerky fashion. The fight scene are long, lame and boring. Rebecca Romin-Stamos is wasted. And the ending where Travolta's fate is sealed is so ridiculous that many people in the theater laughed out loud.I'm not sure what the DVD has on it for features, but it would pretty much have to come with a free copy of \\"Hellboy\\" for me to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Service recieved in 3 days!!","review":"I recieved my order very quick, 3 days from placing it, , I'm very impressed with the speed at which I got my product.

Kudos to the director for a brilliantly executed scene.Overall the characters were terrific. Thomas Jane caught the essense of Frank Castle perfectly. John Travolta plays his patentented psycho bad guy role. Will Patton is always appreciated and it even had Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in an unusual but well thought out role.

It is another one of them movies about revenge, and you'll be able to tell the whole story line pretty much when John Castle's (The Punisher) kid and wife gets killed. The action scenes in this movie kick so much ass.

He made me feel sympathetic to his character,and I was very satisfied with his performance. Travolta was good, although some of the dialogue did make me groan.

I don't read the comics but the movie is clearly stand-alone. The character had real development the action was great but not over done. I liked the way the bad guys were actually able to shoot. Something that is pretty uncommon in the action movies. The bag guys were eccentric but not overboard. The assassin that sang Frank that song before trying to kill him. That was just cool! I really didn't think I would like this movie after seeing the preview and remembering the one from 89. I was so wrong. This movie just rocks and so does the sound track.

A whole sub-plot on who snitched on Frank's real identity when he was undercover is introduced, and while it's not a bad sub-plot, it seems to bring the movie to a screeching halt several times.

This is, in my opinion, the best Punisher. Needs a sequel with Thomas Jane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The real story was much better...","review":"All of this movie rewriting wasn't necessary. The details of the comic book Punisher were more than sufficient. Okay, I can put my love of the comic aside and view this as a separate entity--Aside from bastardizing the great story, the action and acting were lackluster overall, and in some spots, just plain bad. I won't even bother with the details.Maybe what the Punisher needs is an indie remake by some real fans, this high budget shine and corny dialogue isn't working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"First, let me say that I've always been a huge fan of Marvel Comics in general and The Punisher in particular. Now, on to the bad news. This movie was one of the worst pieces of trash I've ever seen. There was absolutely nothing good about this film. The acting; terrible. The writing; terrible. The special effects; I've seen far, far better lately. Even the soundtrack music was lame and boring. If you're 14 years old and you've only seen a dozen or so movies in your life, you might actually enjoy this. Otherwise, you'll be wishing you had your $4 Blockbuster rental money back, just like I am. If I had paid to see this in a theater as I originally planned, I would be kicking myself right now.

I am not familiar with the Punisher comic books, so I can't compare it to the movie.

So it starts off with Frank Castle's last day with the FBI agent & a guy guy is accidentally shot & killed it turns out to be John Travolta's character's son so he want the man dealt with but Travolta's characters wife puts a hit on all of them. While on Family reunion Frank & his wife & kid are there EVERYONE is a target & the men think they killed Frank Castle but he's still alive he returns to Tampa for Revenge & basically to end The Mob lead by John Travolta's character. There are a few flaws I though the Thomas Jane's fight with Kevin Nash was cheesy. I wish it could've been set in New York but I can understand why. I have the Blu Ray version & the longer version the longer version adds 17 minutes that do help a little with the plot. It does Tease a sequel but thanks to LGF, Lexi Alexader & Ray Stevenson they had to go & f**k it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing if not entirley unexpected","review":"This film is not bad. When comic books are adapted to the movies this will always be a case of hit and miss. Thomas Jane is not one of those misses, he gives an edgy, linear performance, but has not conveyed the tragedy of the Punisher. The woeful screenplay does not help his cause much.I question why this film is not set in New York, most probably to avoid comparison to Spider-Man and Daredevil. This avoidance only highlights the weakness in the story. The lack of any credible antagonist e.g. the Kingpin weakens the film even more.It must be remembered that the two writers, Jonathan Hensleigh and Michael France, were responsible for writing screen plays for \\"The Saint\\", and \\"The Hulk\\" respectively. This bodes no good omen.If you want to see a good adaption of a vigilante from Marvel Comics, watch \\"Daredevil\\". If your desire is that of gunplay of the exceptional quality watch John Woo's \\"The Killer\\". I very much doubt the makers of this film did either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Although Thomas Jane does not really physically fit the description of the Punisher, well atleast until the last 20 minutes of the movie, he played the Role well, not as good as Dolph Lundgren's played the role of the punisher just a little bit better. But Marvel Company had a hand in this movie unlike the previous Punisher movie which is why this movie was almost 100% accurate.

Not enough action and killing like the comic book character. The actor's hairline was all wrong, the punisher didn't have a hairline that high c'mon. I would have given this movie 3 stars if it wasn't for that hitman. The hitman who played the guitar was the best thing about this film and it makes me so sad that they wasted such a great character on a film like this. This Guitar playing hitman should have been used in Natural Born Killers, chasing Micky and Mallory or in From Dusk Til Dawn chasing George Clooney and his crazy Brother Q. Tarantino. He did not belong in this film. What a waste of a great character. I would love to see the producers of The Punisher make another movie about the Guitar Playing Hitman. I would pay real money to see that. Some may dissagree so in fairness it is worth renting, but not owning.

Even if he gets shot he just flinches alittle and keeps shooting. THATS ALL!!! I figured that since It was a rated R film it would get all cool and bloody like blade.

I traded in my Extended Cut version to apply a store credit toward this version. What a mistake! Not only is the quality of this blu-ray transfer no different than the standard version, but's more grainy with tons of digital noise. The menu system is underdeveloped (this was one of the first blu-ray releases) and confusing. There are no special features. I didn't notice one single hi-def image in the entire movie, and most of the background was soft, muddy and unclear. I almost thought this was defective until I read a few other reviews. Stay away from this one. Shame on Lions Gate for even calling this a blu-ray transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like a Time Out","review":"The Punisher comes very close to being camp with silly humor following ridiculous violence. There are moments of actual tension but they are rare and overwhelmed by unconvincing acting, made for TV direction, a laughable score and a bizarre desire to work in references to westerns. In the last few minutes the movie seems to try to overcompensate for all the past silliness but it just collapses under the weight of cliches.If you have a thing for movies that include wacky housemates or you just want to see Thomas Jane standing around in dramatic poses this movie is for you. If you want to see a movie about a man devastated by grief and fueled by murderous rage try Punisher: War Zone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guilty Pleasure!!!","review":"If your looking for a movie about revenge that's not your typical steven segal film, than the punisher is worth a shot. As a fan of the punisher max series, I admit that the first time I watched this I thought Thomas Janes was good but that the movie itself was underwhelming. It wasn't until I watched the extended cut that I grew to like it and realize that for a low budget film, it's not bad especially compared to marvels other films like daredevil,elektra,hulk, and the 1989 film. I admit that this film has goofs, could've been darker, should've been closer to the comic(how he lost his family for example), and that it had potential to be an overall better film but like I've said, it's not the best comic book film but definitely not the worst. I recommended you take a shot because there's plenty of bullets to go around as long as you don't take it so seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOVIE ISN'T VERY GOOD, BUT THE BLUE RAY... IS EVEN WORST","review":"That's my second Lionsgate Blue Ray purchase, after T-2; and i was hoping that being a much more recent film, the picture quality would improve more than the highly dissapointing grainy print of the James Cameron's film, but this doesn't happen. I don't know what kind of masters this studio is using, but i don't think you coul call this high definition. If you want to know how to treat a movie in high definition, i recommend you to consult how Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox are doing it. Because for me, this two studios are the two only ones that are bringing high definition into the next level. Even the Sony titles don't look so good as the Touchstone editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Punisher","review":"Federal agent Frank Castle's (Jane) last mission before retirement goes wrong, and the son of local mob boss Howard Saint (Travolta) is killed. Saint is not above revenge, and on the advice of his wife, targets Castle's entire family. The massacre at a family reunion leaves everyone dead, or at least presumed dead. The sole survivor, of course, is Castle, who embarks on a quest to deliver punishment to Saint and his lackeys. Yet another movie that is based on a comic book, The Punisher manages to be depressing and horrifying in parts, and humorous in others. The lighter moments make the heavier ones easier to take and provide some relief. Thomas Jane, a relatively new face in movies, does an excellent job as a man bent on revenge...make that punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"I came in watching this film with good expectations and 2hours worth of decent action. This film was terribly dreadful. The cast is poor, the script is poor, and the story is so inevitable from start to end. This film is degrading for John Travolta (a respected) actor. This film is certainly the worst he has been in (maybe he wanted some extra cash). The Punisher himself is unconvincing, and the only thing believable about him is his muscles. This film was a waste of money, and most defintly does not match upto any of the other marvel charecters such as spiderman, or superman.

It is more in the genre of \\"Ideas in Weaving\\" by Ann Sutton and Diane Sheehan (Interweave Press, 1989, out of print.) The weavers represented here use materials, dye techniques and weaving patterns to extraordinary advantage. The book will, I hope, inspire readers to expand their weaving skills and explore the use of silk and rayon, overtwisted yarns, forgotten weave structures and the glories of plain weave.As for me, I've just purchased a supply of rayon ribbon, the silks have been sitting on a shelf since 1995 and the loom is empty.

The second half of Kaye's work traces the political and social influences of Paine and his \\"paineite\\" disciples from the latter half of the 19th century to the present time. Featured prominently are the many activists in women's suffrage, black abolition, labor reform, land reform,and civil rights who have invoked Paine's ideology of democratic reform. From \\"Red\\" Emma Goldman to \\"Far Right\\" Ronald Reagan, Americans have invoked Paine's name and claimed his legacy.

Harvey Kaye, the author, is a scholarly writer and can be trusted to share accurate and insightful information.

The book, however, takes a turn for the worse when it launches (for half the book!) into a very oversimplified argument that \\"liberals\\" (of all times, shapes, and persuasions) are the true decendents of Paine's ideology and that conservatives (over and over derided as \\"the powers that be\\" \\"capitalist elites\\" etc.) can never truly draw from Paine's legacy. Quite the contrary, Kaye admits that Paine's libertarian tendencies and his disdain for government, contradicting his own argument.

Wouldn't recommend it to an objective student of history looking for a good intro to Paine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Topic, Average Writing","review":"Thomas Paine was a luminary, and one of the (if not the) most forward-thinking of his era. I am sure there is a definitive biography out there, waiting to be written, that will give us the true depth of this man.Unfortunately, this is not it.

While it is amusing to see the lovely paper work in the pop up book, it is not worth the \\"excuse\\" of reading it. Get your hands on the Katherine Woods version every time. Especially when reading this to children. Why ruin something perfect already?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time Fav","review":"I read the Little Prince when I was in school. Over the years this book has grown over me. I love every page of this book. It has a strong message for everyone. Many of us sleep walk through life, some sleep walk all the time. We don't realize how precious our little life is on this little planet.The essence of this book for me lie in these lines spoken by the fox to the Little Prince:\\"What is essential is invisible to the eye,\\"the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.\\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\"\\"It is the time I have wasted for my rose-\\"said the little prince so he would be sure to remember.\\"Men have forgotten this truth,\\" said the fox. \\"But you must not forget it.You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.You are responsible for your rose...\\"\\"I am responsible for my rose,\\"the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"We did NOT need a new translation.....","review":"The pop-ups are wonderful but I sincerely dislike the new translation.

It was wonderful to anticipate what would pop up when I turned the page and there they were -- the unforgettable words, albeit in English, and lessons about life and caring and loving. This version is also a terrific introduction of the story for young readers who will not yet understand the depth of expression meant by the author, but will perhaps, enjoy getting lost in the fantasy of a \\"little prince\\" from another planet. In short, I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Searching - find it here!","review":"This book was required reading for a Philosophy course. You might think why would they read children's books in college? But The Little Prince is a spiritual epiphany disguised as a kid's story.

I completely agree with all of the current reviews. This is a book to treasure forever. I read the original french version in high school, and while no translation can ever exactly convey the sentiments of the original language, I think that this is going to be seen as the definitive English version for some time to come. As others have said, the popup version really brings the story to life. It's almost two inches thick and it's a real quality item. I also ordered two copies - one for myself and another as a gift. This is the type of book that is not going to stay in print forever, so I recommend that you get your copy while supplies last.

Fortunately I read through it first. OUCH! It reads NOTHING like the original; the beauty and simplicity of the reading has been replaced by something that seems written for a first grade reader.

All I can say is that The Little Prince is an incredible story, not just for children but for adults as well. I have read this book many times throughout my life, and each time I find some new significance or truth in it. My mother handed her copy down to me, and I know that I will hand it down to my child.

It's wonderful. Makes me realised how much I have become an \\"adult\\" and not being able to see things like a child. Don't get me wrong - I am not saying we shouldn't grow up.

But for all the inuendoes hidden in a book disguised as a simple children's book, it just didn't interest me. I just found it bland and odd. It is a very short book, but even my patience was wearing thin in class. We had to read a chapter, then the teacher would discuss it in depth and its hidden messages. I just didn't care.

Even though it says it is for younger kids I absolutly love the book to death. There are a few things to know about the author before you read this book. The author is the character telling the story in the book. He was in real life a polit and he crashes in the sahara desert in the book where he meets the little prince. Its a great story for all ages young or elderly! But the best part is that a year later (in his real life) on a mission in the sahara desert (he was a polit for the navy/milatary) he couldn't fly because of injuries from former crashes. But he begged so he flew over the Sahara desert and was never seen again. So did he crash on purpose to follow the book or did it just happen by quensidence?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration to many adults","review":"I had heard that that this book was not really for children though they sell it in the childrens section of selections...

Howard has reduced the text to its lowest common denominator which the publisher calls \\"streamlined\\" and \\"new and improved\\". I call it impoverished and completely devoid of charm. I can't imagine what the publishers were thinking when they chose to replace the classic translation which beguiled us all during its 57 years in print and am reminded of Coca Cola's \\"New Coke\\" fiasco...an error which was quickly remedied. The ONLY positive comment I can make is that the color illustrations in the paperback edition are an improvement on the black & white illustrations of its paperback predecessor.The only good news is that you can still obtain used copies of the Woods translation at Amazon or your local used book shop.

The translator obviously missed the key points that make this book the treasure it is. The \\"Matters of Consequence\\" phrase is changed throughout the story, completely destroying one of the main themes. Also, more complicated words have been replaced with simple words. Instead of elephants being very cumbersome they now take up a lot of space. Ack! Again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TRANSLATION! It is for silly grown ups who have forgotten what it is to be a child. Big words are okay, they help children learn. If we continue to over-simplify things, not only will we be robbing our children of a stronger education, we will have created a new form of literature that is boring for all.

The analogies within the story give insights into human nature and the universe around us."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Prince - New Translation","review":"I have used the old translation for years as a teacher, father and grandfather for kids who need to understand developing growing values. It was a choice piece of work with language that flowed and was easily understood.

One of the worst quality books I've ever seen. As you can see in the \\"click to look inside,\\" which I regrettably did not do before purchasing, the front and back covers are gigantic blow-ups of low-quality JPEGs. There is no copyright page. The ink is cheap; the whole thing looks, smells and feels cheap. It's an unprofessional rendering of a book that looks like a cheap Chinese knock-off.There is no information in the book itself on who could have produced this obscenity. That's no surprise; I'd be embarrassed to have published this, too. I will be returning it forthwith. I'm incredulous that this seems to be the only paperback version of The Little Prince on Amazon.

Shame on Amazon for selling this reprint that doesn't even look remotely like it was published by a publisher with rights to the book. It looks like someone printed it out of a regular printer, put it together, and put it up on here to make a quick buck. There are no words for the injustice this copy does to the original book. The resolution of the graphics are horrible (just like someone took it from the Internet), it comes off as a shady reprint of the original, the cover itself is pixelated. This in no way even looks like a legal copy of the classic Little Prince books. Shame on Amazon for selling this poor imitation of a wonderful classic.

Haley Joel Osment gives voice to the Little Prince, while Marina Orsini, Adam Frost, Richard Allen, Dave Walsh, Ara Y.

How could the publisher eliminate the wonderful poetic language? I read The Little Prince as a child ( which by the way wasn't so long ago) and I loved the language. Antoine De Saint-Exupery's work is all about painting pictures through language. This watered down mess is no better than an edition of Cliff Notes. I actually apologize to Cliff Notes.

This premise is that there is a little prince who comes to Earth and meets adults. He finds most adults to be too interested in the day-to-day world that they live in. He wants to go home to his planet and care for his flower ... so he uses a snake to get there. Sound strange?

I wondered why I had to read this. I was to old for this! I told myself. However, you don't get the true meaning of the book until you reflect on it. Almost every page has a deeper meaning than first meets the eye. The lessons tought in this book will change your outlook on life, and make you think about life in a different way. I am glad I read this book and would definitly recomend it to everyone, young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of so few...","review":"This book was known by every child in my country. I was delighted to discover that some people in the US know about it too -- I wish there were much more of them, and this is why I came searching for it in order to give a few copies to the people I care about. I briefly read the reviews (I don't need a review for myself, I feel this book) and many were talking about either entertainment or fiction. I'd like to make a statement that this book is none of the two, but something that just can't be classified, like a true masterpiece can't. This book is something that stands way out from any other children's products that I've seen and that money can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book is good for people of all ages. When read as a childrens story, it can be a fun and interesting story about a prince who goes and visits other planets. However, when you read it and recognize the books allegorical qualities it becomes a much deeper read...The author tries to show us that you should try to be happy when going through life. It doesn't matter what we do with our lives, its how we've lived. It also doesn't hurt to try recapturing your lost childhood innocence once in a while. And finally, that the world would be a much better place if grownups would just have more imagination, and be less serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoddy impersonation of a book","review":"This book appears to have been printed the day after I ordered it, according to a note on the last page of the text block (says it was \\"Made in the USA/Lexington, KY/January 14, 2011\\"). The illustrations are of horrible quality: they look like they've been through a photocopier 2 or 3 times - and the illustrations are an integral part of this book. details are lost in the poor print quality. the text does not say what translation of this story it is using. I question the legitimacy of this publisher -- \\"BN Publishing,\\" whose tagline on the back of this book reads \\"Improving People's Lifes.\\" If you cannot present your own slogan in proper English you should not be in the publishing industry.

The use of contractions and clipped emotions robs the story of the warmth and eloquence found in Woods' narrative. For anyone wanting to fall in love with The Little Prince, take the time . . . spend the money . . . and get the real thing---The Little Prince, translated by Katherine Woods. Only a grown-up would appreciate Richard Howard's \\"fresh new\\" translation, and if one has sunk to that level, then reading the story is a waste of time anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for life","review":"I have read and reread The Little Prince over the last twenty years, since I was a child, and it still has the ability to make me smile, make me cry, lift my spirits through the tears.

It's SOOOOOO good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part fable, part philosophy and pure fun!!","review":"A satire on adulthood, this book is like a cosmic 'Gulliver's Travels'. Some have tried to dismiss it as merely a bedtime story for adults, but to do so is to miss its profound message. This message resonates at the deepest levels of the human experience --- be a kid again! See the world through unjaded eyes.... With kernals of wisdom like: \\"What is essential is invisible\\", it touches the very soul of the reader. Antoine de Saint-Exupery has become something of a literary saint due to the enduring popularity of this work. The fact that he mysteriously disappeared in a small plane he was piloting almost 60 years ago only adds to his mystique. Whatever your literary leanings, this book should be required reading for EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Not Received","review":"This was a gift, but it was never received by the recipient.

Basically the story is about a pilet who gets stranded in the desert and meets the little prince. TLP then tells him his life story starting on his own planet and then going on his trip to earth. Durring the book there are several refferences to drugs and stuff like that. It scares me that four year olds like this book. They are basiclly reading a book on how drugs are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be thankful this book is short","review":"I read this book (as an adult) since I heard it being so often mentioned alonside The Alchemist. The Little Prince is no where near in the same class as The Alchemist and I was sorely disappointed.

Very structurally unsound. I see what all the hullabaloo is about, I can understand the symbolism, but I find it a very useless vehicle for points that had been easily made by other sources.

Toward the middle ofthe book The Little Prince decides to leave his planet and go enjoy an adventure at all the other planets in the galaxy where he meets different type of people. His last planet is Earth where he sees many things he has never seen before such as different types of people and different animals such as animals with helpful information. He gets back to his planet at day break and all his friends are happy to see him, and at night he listens to the bells and looks at the stars and hangs out with his friends.

This new translation by Richard Howard doesn't come close. Look for the original translation in used book stores or veiw it online. Some things should never be redone. This redo is the literary equivalent of the Michael Bolton version of Percy Sledge's \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\".

This translation has eliminated most of the poetry of language that made Katherine Wood translation of Saint-Exupery's book a classic in the first place. This includes a translator's note that sounds exceedingly pompous once you have read this new translation. I would not stock this book in my library, give it as a gift, or even donate it. What a disappointment!In contrast, the Katherine Woods translation of this book is one of the finest books to ever come my way. In beautiful, spare poetry, she relays Saint-Exupery's lessons about life, teaching us that \\"what is essential is invisible to the eyes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific translation","review":"Why in the world did the publisher accept this horrific and unnecessary new translation.

Most adults seem to make the mistake of believing that growing up and growing old must by neccessity go hand in hand.

Other than that the hoodie was poorly preshrunk where the zipper doesn't align right and you have to fight with it to zip it up. And after normal wear, one week later a two inch rip has appeared on the inner seam of the right arm, a result from all of the lose strings that had to be cut away as the stitching in various places was coming undone when it was first opened. This shirt is warm I will admit and though it was very badly preshrunk, it was not faded. I like the oversized hood and simply wish the shirt was taken care of better on the factory's side. Their methods for prewashing do a number on the shirt and the seams could have been better sewn. At this price its a bad buy, this shirt is something you'd find in the $5 bargain bin in a department store and shouldn't be going for the $20 they're asking for it before the shipping and handling even."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Warm and comfortable.

And that was not the least because people seeing the film for the first time truly believed that they were seeing a peek of what the actually 2001 really would be. It was but a year before Apollo 11, but the future of a great age of space exploration seemed to stretch on forever. The only exasperation I remember having back then was the thought it would be over thirty years before I might too visit the Moon. Seeing the movie in the actual 2001 is an exercise in sadness.

I saw this film in Cinerama fourteen times, as a teenager; it still holds me captured as much today, dispite the dissapointing drawbacks and limitations of the standard television screen. This film is absolutly alive when presented on a screen that emerges the viewer within it. I feel sorry for the generations who have not had the opportunity to experiance it, as such.

Profound and cerebral, the film may feel slow and ponderous to those accustomed to \\"Star Wars\\", and its vision of the near-future betrays its 1968 origins.

I watched a couple of the extras on the \\"bonus features\\" disk, and they were fascinating. If you're looking to replace your VHS copy, or you want to see what all the hubbub was, then you want this movie.

If you do see the movie expect to get really bored or really friendly with fast foward. Also, how can a movie be deep when nothing happens?A note to those who think I just didn't get it: Your absolutely right, I don't.

Thereafter came the DVD and I was overjoyed at it's clarity.Now in 2008, after 30 years, I am seeing this movie for the 4th time- once every decade.

I sat through the whole thing and there was no real value to it. There was not enough dialogue and the movie was way too long. It was a boring watch.

The dialogue is scarce; the action, nonexistent. It is full of interminable sequences of ships drifting through space which do zilch to advance the story and could have been dramatically shortened without hurting the movie.The plot, if you can call it a plot, is difficult to follow and bears little resemblance to Arthur C.

The book shows just how much we have evolved from the beging of time. From the first ape-man to the world today. It also shows just how litte we know about artificial intelligence and that there may even be existing life on other planets such as,Saturn, that have been in existance billions of years before us humans. Maybe we have been in denial, or even just to dumb to realize the clues.Now it's time to explor the unknown. David Bowman and his two crewmates Frank Poole,and a state of the art robot with high intellectual knowlege are on a mission to Saturn to find out more about a virus that can potentualy spred.

Lousy DVD :(","review":"This has to be my favorite movie - ever. The story of the evolution of man via alien influence and the realization of that fact, plus the killer computer, makes this a unique piece of art. My favorite part is when HAL 9000 fails to let Bowman back into the Discovery - its such a Control-Alt-Delete scene.Sadly, this is the worst DVD transfer I've ever encountered, its muddy, has artifacts popping up all over it, and is completely unwatchable. I'm surprised the studio would allow such a great film to be ruined like this, I suppose its some angry executive's ignorance or perhaps malice to gradually weed critical favorites such as this, in favor of garbage like Wing Commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, LOUSY print","review":"Imagine my annoyance to realize that the power of DVD, composite video, and all that, has been employed to capture a rather worn, scratchy, and in some places broken print of the film. Utterly bootleg quality. For example, seconds after the famous bone-to-spacecraft segue, there is an obvious white crack in the celluloid! There are other obvious scratches and video artifacts, the overall picture quality is poor, and the sound is muddy! They couldn't find a better print or clean up the one they had? I've seen VHS copies that are better and my vinyl soundtrack album has more depth! Five stars for the film, zero stars for the reproduction effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING SHORT OF MIND-BLOWING!!!","review":"When I first saw this as a kid, I didn't quite get it, but watching it now, I understand. This is one of the greatest films ever made. You will not be disappointed. Admittedly, it is a bit hard to follow, but that's the point, you are supposed to think for yourself; that's what makes it so great, Kubrick acknowledges, you get from the film what you what from it. If YOU choose to just stare at the screen, of course you are going to hate it. But if you understand the meanings, man's quest for knowledge and his evolution, then you will understand. No one can truly describe this film to you. Rent it, with a clear head, and I can almost guarantee, you will want to buy it.(oh yeah, and another thing, special effect/graphics should always take backseat to a good plot/storyline. They did in this movie.) Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regarding the Commentary","review":"Just a quick review of the commentary here -- Gary Lockwood's is absolutely terrible. He brings nothing insightful to the film. Most of the time he is either simply describing exactly what is happening on the screen as you're watching it, or rambling on about what a rebel he was back in the day. Keir Dullea on the other hand, gives us more insight on how certain scenes were filmed and the thought processes behind them. Unfortunately, Keir talks a LOT less than Gary. I would estimate that Lockwood is talking for 80% of the film.*Trying to avoid spoilers here*Another thing I didn't like was how they had Dullea and Lockwood talk about the scenes in the beginning of the movie that didn't involve them. I felt that they should have brought in the actors who portrayed those roles in order to give us more insight into those scenes.Other than that, the film is extraordinary. Just watch it with the commentary off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as exciting as anticipated!","review":"Although I love this movie and already owned it on DVD, I wanted to buy it again in Special Edition form. The packaging is great, the score CD is great, the booklet is great, the mini-senitype is great, BUT the special features are... nill! If you own 2001 on dvd already, buy this SE version ONLY if you care about packaging and what-not. I love everything about this DVD, however the menu screen is the EXACT same as the original release. Plus, this version only contains ONE theatrical trailer. No interview, no television spots or anything. The ONLY other plus about this DVD is that if you own the Sony DVP-860 DVD player, it loads with a 2001 Icon and title in the Disc-Explorer Menu. Don't get me wrong, the DVD is good... just not as good as it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD - Poor Quality!!","review":"After having seen some excellent quality DVDs I have to say that 2001 has been done a great injustice.

The aliens who left it are accelerating the growth of human intelligence.* The spacecraft shown in the beginning after the bone-throwing scene are orbiting nuclear weapons.* The monolith on the moon is a beacon, alerting the aliens to the fact that man has achieved space travel and is ready for the next step.* The floating monolith at Jupiter is a stargate, which transports Bowman to a place the aliens have prepared where he can live out his lifespan before embarking on his subsequent job as Earth's guardian (the starchild).

This is my feelings of this film. When watching many different movies it's important that you pay close attention to what you HEAR instead of what you SEE. The dialogue is the most important thing in the movie. Think of the films of Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee. If you miss certain parts of the dialogue you'll be lost for the whole rest of the story. But that's not the case with this masterpiece by Kubrick. There is I believe only 40 minutes of dialogue. So basically your just looking at your screen and watching something you'll never forget. The screenplay done here by Kubrick and Clarke is amazing. This will turn our to be a one of a kind movie you will never forget.Which is all due to the astonishing images projected on screen. Kubrick really out did himself and set a very high standard for others to try and reach.

Slow moving, pointless, & nearly impossible to watch. There were parts, where I thought it was going to get better, maybe there'd be some excitement..but even the \\"dramatic\\" parts moved at the pace of a sloth. I think the dialogue in this movie consisted of less than half, maybe even a quarter of the movie..if that! Otherwise, you heard nothing. You were in space. There was no sound.

However, I would not recommend this movie to anyone...unless you are looking for a sleep aid..this might help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lou","review":"Here's the deal with this movie. The reason why it has great reviews is because the majority of people that are reviewing it now were around 12-14 years old when it was first debut (1968.) It must have been a stimulating experience back in 1968, with no other movie of its kind paralleling the beautiful special effects. Now 32 years later, they still watch the movie to re-capture the experience they had when they first saw it. Those who never had the experience when it first came out and watch it now will most likely not enjoy it. The space scenes are spectacular, but they have been done some many times since then that it gets old. There is no plot, climax or suspense. It's a slow paced, visual/musical film with no action.

Even now- especially for the 60s- this film is spectacular in its visuals, and proves to us the overuse of CGI is not the only way to make people gaze in awe. The music is also tone-setting, eerie at times. But that's about it. The rest of the film is pretty much a borefest of epic proportions that tries to depict as many \\"scientific\\" possibilities about the future of space travel (that were supposed to come into fruition by '99) as possible while throwing in an alien first-contact story to make things interesting.At least the concept of the monolith was vaguely interesting, although sequel novels took the great idea and made even it fairly boring.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the editing","review":"THIS IS ABOUT THE REGULAR DVD, NOT THE BLU-RAY VERSION. The scene of the space clipper arriving at the space station, with the Blue Danube Waltz on the soundtrack, is my favorite scene ever in a scifi movie. I was very disappointed to see that on this DVD that scene is cut short. I'm not sure exactly how much is missing, maybe the last minute or so. That was enough to significantly degrade the whole viewing experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-dulling waste of time!","review":"For the sake of your brain, don't waste your time on this piece of nonsensical trash. It makes no sense, and it moves at a pace that dead people would find slow. I don't understand the praise it has received, nor can I fathom those who hail it as even a \\"good\\" movie. I have seen most of Kubrick's films, and I have been pleased with most of them. This one, however, has less cognitive stimulation than talking to a brick wall. If you absolutely, positively, must see it, then by all means attempt to indulge. After you waste two hours trying to decipher its blatant message of sheer stupor and idiocy, you can thank me. On Kubrick's deathbed, his last words were reportedly, \\"My heavens, did I really make that lab monkey training film into a movie?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"a lot of critics like to say that 2001 a space odyssesy is a good film b/c they feel that this staterment will validate thier position as real critics and b/c the top critics in the game list this as thier favourite movie.for example, the renowned film critic roger ebert puts this film as one of his greatest film. this film receives the highest rating possible from the leonard maltin filmbooks. but the truth is that this film is not good. it is boring, it has no plot whatsoever and all this film is is kubrick showing off and telling everyone how good technically he is.i love kubrick films, but i hated this. there is a scene in this film that shows an astronaut running around in the spaceship at . this scene is cool at first as it shows him running upside down in the spinning spaceship at zero gravity. but when kubrick decides to show this paticuler scene for about 15 minutes with no words, it gets boring. if you want some shut-eye, then this movie is for you. otherwise avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've found a cure for insomnia...","review":"I cannot understand why people rave about this movie!

The first movie she put on was 2001. I'm not sure if you know this or not, but when you come out of surgury, at least for me, you feel so out of it that you'd like to fall asleap, but you can't. Due to the slow nature of this film, I was in agony. It's the slowest movie I've ever seen. It takes 10 min. for a space shuttle to dock. I'm not sure why everyone likes it, but I think it sucks. I'd rather have my wisdom teeth taken out again than watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star film, 1 star DVD transfer","review":"This great movie deserves a lot better than it got from MGM. The opening sequence is really badly done with grain visible all over the place. The mission sequence is better, with the exception of the constant flecks and sometimes gashes that appear on the frames. The film is being released for 2001. Supposedly it is also being cleaned up. Lets hope so. I find this disc hard to watch for what it could easily have been if Turner/MGM had spent a little money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE DVD Transfer","review":"I am a real fan of this movie. That is one reason that I am so disappointed in the truly awful transfer that was made to DVD. The space scenes are muddy, with the whites, greys and blacks all blending together. There is significant banding on all of the contrasty scenes. The sound-track is scratchy.Part of the problem is that they placed the entire (long) film on one side of the DVD, so I am sure that there is too much compression for some of the material. But even there, it is obvious that the quality control was just plain poor. Warner should be ashamed of this performance.Compare this with some of the truly great DVD transfers to see what you are missing. My Fair Lady, for example, is a 70 mm film that was transferred with skill and care, and it is just glorious. 2001 defines the other end of the spectrum! Believe it or not, the VHS version looks better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"2001 is a brilliant movie, and deserves far more respect than it has been given with this awful DVD version.The image quality is dreadful; the star fields ripple with artefacts, and the whole thing looks like it was hastily transferred from a VHS tape.If you already own this on video tape, don't bother buying it on DVD, and hope for a better release in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely One of the Best Films of All Time!","review":"You cannot match Stanley Kubrick's style in this masterpiece! His complete genius in filmaking that leaves a lasting impression is apparent in every aspect of this film. His artfulness in using classical music for the soundtrack,and then using great composers such as Strauss, and Ligeti made the movie take precedence over all other sci-fi films of it's time. The cinematography is spectacular, and the sets elaborate! Yet they do not overpower the story being portrayed. The film is mysteriuos from the start, and questions are posed from the get go. And they never stop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest science fiction movie of all time!","review":"\\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" is a fantastic tale of space exploration and contact with a far, far superior civilization. It is a hybrid of the almost religious belief in science by Arthur C. Clarke, and the cinematic skill of Stanley Kubrick. It is scrupulously factual for its time, and far ahead of its time in storyline. Its special effects set a new bar, earning the film an Oscar, and not to be excelled until George Lucas' Star Wars in 1977.No science fiction movie has yet matched \\"2001\\" for its story and vision. Although the special effects are a little dated and limited the almost unlimited imagination of Clarke and Kubrick, this movie still has no peer. This movie is pure, genuine science fiction, without the fantasy of Lucas, Tolkien, and Lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!!","review":"2001 is a classic film that is truly amazing at it's best!!Stanley Kubrick knows how to make a great and interesting film that is also colorful, yet it still steers right onto the path of realism and fantasy.I recently purchased 2001 on Blu Ray and I will say that the picture quality is amazing and the colors are even better than ever!!It's truly a classic that deserves to be watched again and again!!5 stars for blu ray quality!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning clarity for such an old film.","review":"Who would think this film was over 40 years old.

I can understand how some people would like this movie since they have grown up with people hailing the movie as a classic but really, come on, the movie is very poor. To beging with none of the concepts are original, evolution and space travel were alredy ideas, all this movie is is putting it into visual form, and in a very poor manner. It is a very empty movie, i feel that if people want good science-fiction watch starwars, if you want to learn about evolution, read darwins book, and if you are into space travel, well.. there is a alot of better documentations on space travel out there. The problem i raise about this movie is that in all three catagories it can be beat out! So why watch this movie which does a poor job of explaining all three!

After reading complaints about poor transfer from 70mm to DVD (ghosts, fuzzy images, etc), I was sceptical... so I rented \\"2001\\" and put it to the test on my PC. After just 10-minutes of watching, I was ready to buy my own copy! (Perhaps DVD on a conventional TV produces less than desirable effects.) As a \\"2001\\" junkie, I am very impressed with DVD on my PC, and its ability to faithfully present this classic sci-fi. If you loved \\"2001,\\" you will NOT be disappointed.

Unfortunately, MGM's recent release of the DVD version of this film serves only to make one long for another actual theatrical experience (in Cinerama?), rather than the visually distorted and audibly unsatisfying rendering of the disc.

Just as he did with \\"The Shining\\", director Stanley Kubrick tests the audiences' patience here with agonizingly slow pacing, little to no story or character development, and dull visual details. The one interesting thing in this movie is the HAL 9000 computer. He is one of the great screen villians of all time, and the AFI honored him as such recently.

I constantly ask \\"Why?\\" throughout it.Why do we only have one small space station? Why are the only people who can go to it a trained few? Why has noone ever left earth's orbit? Why have we not touched the moon for over 25 years? Why are there only small video cameras on less than 1% of PCs, and everyone else stuck with voice telephones? Why is our \\"state-or-the-art Artificial Intelligence\\" a few phrases repeated over and over again, with true thinking and learning out of the question? Why has so little happened since 1968?I do not completely understand the answers to any of these, but I cannot put the questions out of my mind.

Yes, the special effects were amazing- especially for the time it was made. But oh my gosh!! The whole movie moves soooo slowly!! I thought I was going to go crazy! Luckily I had the ability to fast-forward. I really pity those who sat through the whole thing in a theater. I really thought I was going to go out of my mind.I suppose it's because in 2007, we're so accustomed to a lot of fast-paced and action-packed movies. So we find it very difficult to appreciate slow-paced movies. It requires a great deal of patience. I don't have that kind of patience. In my opinion, this movie is a complete waste of time.

Does astronaut go back to Earth? NO! he finds a big black monoloth thing and goes through a half an hour color scene. Then he is old. Then he is older, then he's older, then he's a baby.

But guide us to what? Servitude like animals in a zoo or a higher plane of evolution?

It touches on many different topics including the origin of life, artificial intelligence and space exploration. There is not really any action in the movie. The closest thing to that is when Dave was trying to get back into the ship after HAL locked him out. It is very much a movie that required you to think more than anything else. The idea that a computer goes bad and attacks humans is one that would appear later in movies like The Terminator, but what made this version of that story work was how HAL interacted with the other characters. The movie looks about as good as it possibly can on Blu Ray. Given how old it is, it will not look as good as newer movies do. It does have some, but not a ton of extras. If you are a fan of the movie, and do not own the DVD release this is worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very memorable","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out. I was 6. I was confused. But I remember it very well.I remember how excited I was that the world was going to change that much- space flight! video phones! artificial gravity! a talking computer! whew. Of course, it hasn't all happened that way, but it's a very nice, credible view of the future based on the past as seen from the vantage point of 1968.The silence of space had a very deep impact on me. I'm a lover of silence so I thought I would be very comfortable with it. The monolith was appropriately mystifying.Oddly, I've seen this movie exactly once. I'm looking forward to actually seeing it in the year it attempted to portray.

There is no great plot for people to think about and the mysterious monolith is just something Kubrick put in to confuse you. This is nothing like the masterful Clockwork Orange.

When I first started watching the movie (which I rented) I thought someone had taped over the movie with a National Geographic special with that long BORING monkey scene. The rest of the film is incoherent and the special effects are atrocious. Although the HAL scenes are somewhat interesting, this is only a small part of an otherwise awful film. No one I've talked to so far (at least 7 people) have any idea what the point of this movie is.

Nothing was explained, and there was basically no plot at all. Plus, it has one of the most ironic things I have ever seen in a movie. The part where the computer goes crazy, by far the most interesting segment, has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film! I have no idea what the filmakers were thinking when they came up with this idea. I like movies that make you think, but I don't like having to carefully analyze every single scene to get even a vague idea of what I have just seen.

So many emotions ran through me in this movie, at times I was frightened, other times intense...wow. This film was incredible. Kubrick made this film a masterpiece. Today we see all these stupid sci fi \\"thrillers\\" with the cheesiest dialogue one might ever possibly hear; but this! Kubrick held back on dialogue probably to allow the viewer to take everything in, all the sights and sounds, and emotions.

Video compression artifacts abound, and the disc is a literal museum of DVD technology problems. Exposure errors litter the transfer, along with strange grids and patterns in high-contrast scenes, color smears, and false color modeling of objects (see the monolith in orbit around Jupiter). Save your money on this fancily-packaged product and buy an old-fashioned Criterion laserdisc if you want to see this movie as Kubrick intended (he personally approved the Criterion laserdisc transfer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"New DVD release MUCH higher quality than first one...","review":"If you have a widescreen home theater setup, then like me, you were probably very disappointed with the original DVD version of 2001 which wasn't anamorphic and had muffled sound.This new version looks a THOUSAND times better, and the sound is incredible, especially considering that the movie is 32 years old now.I only give it 4 stars because it doesn't have the Arthur C Clarke interview of the original DVD, nor any other materials.Now if they could just redo 2010, which looks like crap on a widescreen setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turner Wastes DVD Technology","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this film on DVD. However, in spite of having a good TV (Sony) and S cable connections, I was very disappointed with the quality of the DVD. I would agree with other reviewers remarking on the graininess of the video as well as other artifacts. Also, why have an essentially blank screen at the beginning and in the middle? Unlike a theatrical presentation, viewers at home can pause the film at any point in the film. Further, the \\"interview\\" with Mr. Clarke is really just a film of the studio press conference at the film's premiere.

This is the only film I've ever seen where the machine is more interesting than any of the human characters. It is a visual treat to watch from beginning to end, but the film doesn't make any sense. Certain scenes are so boring you might as well watch a real-life space launch. It could be more informative and rewarding than watching certain parts of this movie. People have tried to debate the meaning behind behind this borefest. They don't realize that Kubrick made the ending confusing on purpose so people could go around trying to analyze it. They don't realize that Kubrick wanted a lot people seeing this movie. There is no deep meaning behind it. Kubrick just wanted to make extra bucks from people renting, buying, and seeing his movie in the theatres."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Landmark Sci-Fi Movie of our Century","review":"Arthur C.

I think some of you adults think that since I am a kid I dont know classic films. Well I do and this is diffenetly not one. Skip this film please. Dont watch this film. There is only one good thing about it. The visuals. They are spectacular. Way better than the CGI crap we see know in movies like Episode III. Oh yeah one more good thing, one word. HAL.

Which I happen to love dearly. But just not in this movie.The good parts are too few and too spread out amongst that which I don't like about the movie. Hanging around and waiting for some cool videography and maybe dialogue is grueling.I love KubrickI don't enjoy this movie.It would be fun to do an ambient music dub over edited portions of the space shots...that I would buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art is our monolith to worship at","review":"In tackling macroscopic themes of human existence absent any emotional connection or characters, this movie dares the viewer to justify its grandious exploration by lavishing it with time, attention, and ultimately justification.Will you see it the way he sees it? Will you see it the way they see it?This piece is like the monolith which is its own main character: massive, darkly opaque, inscrutable, and inexplicably linked to some promised higher intelligence which never materializes. It calls upon the religious aspect of art appreciation, since it speaks to us of human things but doesnt address us in our own human terms.A lil' patina of intellectualism is the best thing this film has going for it, besides the one HAL scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie - lousy mastering job","review":"This disc is not worth owning because of the poor image digitalization.

The story however, could have had more excitement instead of Kubrick choosing to highlite the visual artistry to be the basis by which the brilliance of this film should be judged. I enjoyed the methodically detailed sequences to which each piece of technology was shown. Obviously great thought were put into every scene however, I felt this movie lacked a sense of drama and thrilling suspense. Even though this movie is more then two in a half hours long, its apparent that a lot of that time went to the slow paced space sequences instead of a broad plot.Regardless of what I said, I recognize this movie to be revolutionary for its visual effects which Kubric subtley used to articulate the story and it will be classic for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't determine whether this movie was about aliens, cave-monkeys, space travel, or some guy loooking perpetually surprised","review":"I fell asleep 4 times.

Man, I remember between glued to the set when I first watched 2001, and I was 10 years old! I'm also amazed at how many people clamor for a neat and tidy hollywood ending. I think one of the legacy of 2001 is its sobriety: not everything is answered or should be; gorgeous camera angles and the brilliant stroke of making space so utterly silent. Instead of filling the screen with lasers and music and nonsensical violence, Kubrick lets our minds travel and our brains work. I recommend the novel, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing detail!","review":"\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" has been among my favorite films since it was released.

On Blu-Ray disc, viewed on a 40\\" Samsung LCD HD television (1080p, of course), I can see everything Stanley Kubrick envisioned for this movie, and the details are stunning. For younger viewers who have grown up with the staggering developments in Special FX (ever since the early days of George Lucas' \\"Industrial Light & Magic\\"), the \\"effects\\" will seem somewhat primitive. To me, this is the second-best viewing ever of this seminal film.

Pros: the CONCEPT of man vs machine. Cons: Everything else. The first half of the movie I watched a bunch of apes (dawn of men) jump around and scream at each other. The 2nd half was watching toy spaceships / people slooooooooowly scroll across the screen. I actually started to watch the movie in 1.5x speed because of that crap. It was the most boring movie I have ever seen. This movie could have been literally 15 minutes long and could have got across the same points.

This movie goes on for three hours and there are almost 10 lines of dialogue! Then, it just ends; the big mystery throughout the movie is totally unanswered and there is no closure.I think that people praise Kubrick because they believe that there is some 'deep' hidden message, but they are too afraid that they didn't 'get it.' So as to not look stupid, we just say, \\"Oh, that was so wonderful!\\" If I could I would sue him for so malicioulsy stealing three precious hours of my life. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!! UGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!By the way I gave it one star because you cannot choose 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing Kubrick is Dead","review":"This film is a waste of poor film stock. The little plot that exists is petty, historically inaccurate and painstaking to follow. You can fast forward through 60% of the film and get the message. As for being photographic and having great special effects, I really don't see what you are referencing - 60 minutes of space shuttle scenes? If you want a photographic film see Pi or Vagabond - covering up a lack of plot with claims of filmic excellence is not possible with 2001. Anyone that sits through this film convinced it was worthwhile is probably making a shoddy attempt to be considered part of the \\"elite inteligentsia.\\" Give me a break - my goldfish is more interesting than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring movie EVER!","review":"I rented the VHS for this movie because it looked like a cool sci-fi action flick from the poster. Boy, was I wrong! This movie was such a SNORE! The first thirty minutes were just animals howling, what gives? There wasn't any action either, and all the special effects looked horrible and outdated. It would have been better with aliens, gunfighting, a love interest and gore. No one wants to watch a spaceship go slowly across the screen for five minutes, how boring and pretentious can this film be? Check out \\"I, Robot\\", \\"Transformers\\", \\"Battlefield Earth\\", or the new Terminator movie for how sci-fi should really be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Movie","review":"2001: A Space Odyssey is the worst movie that I have ever seen.

The UNCENSORED version has a scene in which we are viewing a man's head through a window. He is gnawing on his knuckles. There is a metal plaque on the wall behind him -- silver letters through a black background, like the ones you used to see on appliances. Initially, it is out of focus.

I just watched the two versions side by side and I saw trivial differences that fall within the variations you'd get changing TVs from one viewing to another. The commentary track is absolutely trite: self-admiring thespians who can't get out of the way, or voice an uncliched idea about film or metaphysics to save their life. The 2nd disc is OK, but most of it comes off as the mediocre thoughs of a lot of mediocre hangers-on who didn't get the profundity of the movie then, and only want to talk about technical conceits they're associated with.

I also come up with a different take every time. I read the film as a comment on the problems of the creation process this time. I doubt Kubrick and Clarke looked at it like that, but they made the film in such a way that you could read that into it. It does make you think, which is one of the things great art does. I have read some comments that this isn't a good transfer. That is definitely not the case. It looked great on my TV and every professional review I've read also stated it was a great transfer.

The biggest chance in this movie is to have Kubrick and Clarke together and the result is naturally amazing. Quite a masterpiece for collectors.PS. If you'll buy this film just because it is a sci-fiction DON'T buy it. This is not the action film with aliens you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a widescreen version","review":"I love this move! I love it! And I was thrilled to death to see it on DVD. And MAN was I disappointed. It looks like a digitized version of a standard videotape. It still has all the artifacts of video such as contrast lines and color that is not up to the snuff of DVD. DVD can handle a much better much clearer picture than this seemingly quickly done version of this beautiful film. While the DVD does look better than videotape only by comparison, it just does not look good enough to warrant a purchase in my opinion. I cannot imagine this DVD being the DVD I watch the movie on in 5 or 10 years. Someone is going to have to come out with a remastered widescreen anamorphic version with better compression, I'm hoping before the beginning of the new year. Have patience. This is not the DVD the film should be viewed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book. Moving and inspirational.","review":"Deeply moving stories about couples that have lived through the good and the naturally difficult times that all marriages go through. My wife and I bonded over the book as we read the stories out loud before we went to bed at night. The book alternately made us laugh and cry. I would recommend this book to anyone, but in particular to newly weds. It should be required reading for any couple getting married today. A great wedding or anniversary gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed because the product was said to be sold like new and it didn't say it had an inscription. The product has an inscription which then I couldn't give it as a gift. Other than that the book was in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE: Traditional Values Undermined","review":"The cover of Living Happily Ever After exudes traditional family values; however, the inclusion of homosexual couples clearly demonstrates dual intentions of the author. By not giving an indication of the books homosexual content, the author is certain to offend many unsuspecting readers. Statistically the homosexual couples are disproportionately represented. While many heterosexual couples stay together 30 years or longer, the homosexual world has been proven grotesquely promiscuous, especially among homosexual men. The book portrays long-lasting homosexual relationships as if they are the norm when nothing could be further from the truth. BUYER BEWARE, you definitely cannot judge this book by its cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"oh, f. did i thank you for your death?\\"","review":"i'm an enormous fan of mr. cohen, but my first reading of this book left me cold. i picked it up many years later, and was rewarded considerably. l. cohen's talent knows no bounds, and it's always good to pick up some interesting history while you're reading for pleasure. i have visited Montreal twice as pilgrimage, and walked the campus of McGill university just to say that i may have tread the same steps as my favorite writer/poet.the book is definitely experimental, and i found myself with a highlighter the second go-round. and so it's not for everyone. but if you put in the effort, you reap the sad, sordid, lovely benefits that will stay with you long after the admittedly puzzling ending. recommended for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music","review":"This book is a really long song.

I don't know but it was a beautiful ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love This Guy, but He Really Should Stick to Music","review":"I bought this book out of reverence for the man who wrote Bird on a Wire and so much other incredible, passionate music. It is a valiant attempt in the style of Jack Keroauc or Don DiLillo, but without the command of the genre or the ability to conjure and sustain images and moods of a truly accomplished fiction writer. I would suggest you buy a copy of Dharma Bums and listen to Cohen on the stereo while you read...and Leonard, I love you man, but I love you much better when you are singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!!","review":"I had to read this book for a university course onCanadian novels, so I couldn't throw it away or burn it as I would have liked to do. It is without a doubt the most painful and difficult book I've ever had to read. It is without question Cohen is a master at what he does--not just anyone could leave such a lasting distate in my mouth more than six years after I read the book! However, the subject matter, the style, the imagery, and especially the various kinds of loveless sex...everything seems to feel terribly sick and twisted, and the overall impression the book leaves is one of profound and lasting oppression."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gateway to Dreams and Nightmares....","review":"I have seen images in this book I will never, ever forget. This book takes you places you never knew a mind could take you. Some words of Warning, If you are looking for the style Cohen uses while writing his songs, you will not find it here in this book. What you will find is the nightmarish journey of one woman into sainthood, and three people pushing sanity to it's limit. I have to say this is one of the best novels I have ever read. You have to give it at least 50 pages before you start figuring out what's going on. But once the book takes off there's no going back your in for a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave exploration","review":"The language in Beautiful Losers may not be as prolifically dirty as it might first appear and once again we bow our heads to James Joyce but only for a second as we attempt to mould something else that we hope will survive.Difficult to describe why Beautiful Losers is an essential read because it's difficult to analyse poetic prose. Cohen bravely wrote of love, relationships and sex without apparent blushes and restrictions so come and take a peek, open your flowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst book I have ever read!","review":"This book could not have been worse. Not if a concerted effort had been made to make this some kind of intellectual exercise in jibberish. I have never wasted more time absorbing the absolute random thoughts of an author than on this book. There are pages of just random words, one with no more connection to the next.For these other fools raving about this book must either be misguided patriotism or vain attempts at psuedo-intellectualism. If you are reading this review - please save yourself the $10 bucks and read something else.I read dozens of books every year and have been doing so for 20+ years and I can never remember reading a worse book. The sheer futility of reading this book was similar to the feelings you experience right after you realize you have been ripped off.Worst ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good shape","review":"The book was rated as very good condition, but it was yellow and soiled and not very good in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"2000 4Runner","review":"Bought this to replace OEM radiator on 2000 4Runner. Arrived in timely manner an in perfect condition with no damages to cooling fins. Initially had problems aligning the mounting holes but resolved this by taking off side brackets on radiator and mounting them first to match up with mounting holes on vehicle. Then I just slid the core portion back in and bolt it to properly space the radiator. Be careful taking bolts off the mounting bracket because they can easily strip the plastic retainers that suppose to keep the nut in place. If that happens, then you'll have a bolt that keeps spinning along with the nut and you'll never get it off. The drain plug is a little on the cheap side. DO NOT over tighten it or you'll never get it off without breaking it. I might check to see if the original plug will fit and replace it with that. Its been almost a month since the install and everything appears to be fine so far.

By JMM","review":"This book is a vivid description of the \\"events\\" at Tian An Men Square that fateful spring in 1989. This novel is about a seventeen year old boy named Alex who travels with his cameraman father to China, and witnesses the Tian An Men Square massacre.In this book the author pays good attention to the facts while weaving a story around them. He used a journal format; from the point of view of the protagonist, Alex. William Bell (the author) paints a vivid picture of the horrendous tragedy in Beijing, and brings a realistic quality to his fiction. The characters develop well during the story, but the secondary characters are very one-dimensional.The author brings a real and personal quality that to many of us is simply a far-off event that happened to a bunch of people we don't know. Although it is realistic, it is not a historian's account. Overall, it is a good, compelling, and vividly detailed novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden City, quick must-read for all highschool students!","review":"Overall, William S. Bell does a good job putting a human face on the tragedies that took place in Tiananmen Square. He is refreshingly accurate with regard to factual information. The diary format is easy to read yet leaves the book open to interpretation and discussion. The story of the fictional characters Alex, Ted, Lao Xu, Eddie and Xin hua was created as a way to explain what happened to all sides involved in this tragic event. Bell combines a mixture of powerful emotions and dynamic characters to create a true must read for all highschool students. If highschoolers get anything out of this book at all, it will be that there are people out there who will stand up for what they believe in and that violence shouldn't be used as the answer to every problem our world faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK!","review":"I had to read this book for an English class. I heard from theolder students that it was a bore. I was expecting it to be one ofthose books that you can fall asleep to. They were VERY wrong. I loved the book. I couldn't stop reading it. It has a great view in on how the event was and what happened. It is also full of action and suspence. I could not get enough of this book. GO OUT AND READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why this book was terrible","review":"I think this book was quite terrible because Alex was a complete loser. A total geek committed to building little plastic men and painting them up in all the right colours. This is not someone any highschool reader wants to know about. Secondly, all those chinese people could speak english, realistic, maybe. But how could Alex pick up all that chinese? 2 days of school? ya right! this was terribly developed and the author often strayed from diary form and went back. Ineffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very special album","review":"It is the second album of this great american band. Classical songs like \\"Murder in my Heart for the Judge\\", \\"Naked If I Want\\", \\"Miller's Blues\\" and the very special \\"Just Like Gene Autry; A Foxtrot\\", with in the original LP is on 78 rpm. Special album to special listeners"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with every listen","review":"Another excellent CD by John and his current band. Pick it up and enjoy listening to some real professional musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid effort","review":"What we have here is another solid effort by the great bluesman and his great band. Billy Whittington shines here, John Lee Hooker adds guitar to two cuts. Mayall fans, and fans of contemporary blues should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayall Never Slows Down","review":"The muse has been kind to John Mayall. He's been writing and playing quality music now for more than 40 years and he just never seems to be drained of creative juices. Padlock On the Blues is yet another fine effort from the godfather of white blues. This is a much bluesier CD overall than its predecessor Blues For the Lost Days. From the opening bars of the tour de force \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\" to the final notes of \\"White Line Fever\\", this album really grooves. Backing Mayall are a select group of veteran musicians with special guest John Lee Hooker. A minor criticism is that the title cut is very similar to the song \\"Blues for the Lost Days\\" and \\"Ain't No Surrender\\" is a musical clone of A Sense of Place's \\"Send Me Down To Vicksburg\\". However, Mayall still plays harp, piano, and guitar as well as ever and at nearly 70 years old he never slows down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayall is in need for a wake up call","review":"Blues can be very boring like in this case. Don't get me wrong, I like blues and in fact I think John Mayall's \\"Wake up call\\" is more or less a masterpiece in this genre. But on this album, \\"Padlock on the blues\\", Mayall is making things too easy for himself - it's just the same song over and over again and I'm getting so bored. I tend to think that even Mayall got bored since this one clearly lack enthusiasm.The music on \\"Padlock on the blues\\" isn't much better than the average \\"hobby-bluesband\\" you and your co-workers might have formed. A must better buy is Gary Moore's \\"Still got the blues\\", or if you lean towards the more heavy side of the blues - Pat Travers' \\"Blues tracks\\" and Rick Derringer's \\"Elctra blues\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwing out the garbage.","review":"Some reviewers have been disappointed with this book, but I must say that all you need is this book, a little time, some open space, and a tomahawk. While I prefer Coldsteel's Norse hawk, and Bad Axe, I have found that the lessons learned in this book, have given me the ability to throw a tomahawk in remarkably little time.In the past, many people have advised me on some truly terrible advice. But, this book has helped me actually throw a tomahawk, and it is filled with interesting adecdotes too. It is everything that I could want from a book on the subject, but I must admit I would be interested in a DVD on the subject as well. If digital photography and video were around when this book was first written, that product would be an exceptional find. But, it is a book that I am reviewing, and I must say that it is well worth the money, and well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This is a very fast paced, well crafted novel.

The characters are not deeply developed but this didn't really bother me, since the book was more intent on creating a mood of gloom and strangeness. The ending didn't answer all questions, so I'm hoping for a sequel. I would recommend this to people who liked Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast novels and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Likewise, if you liked this, you might want to try those authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"old testament in a nutshell","review":"read this book 15 years ago. i could not put this book down, read it twice. in my opinion, a bible beginner could get away with not reading the lengthy old testament and trust this well written book for honest synopsys. pages are filled with interesting sidebar stuff (artifacts, art and culture of the time period in question, etc.). title of book is marketing ploy to get purchase but the book is a heck of a read. one minor glitch is the new testament section of the book sucks (my opinion), it is obvious that a different set of writers/editors were used for new testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I thought I would get all 5 but only the one dark one came in the mail...

The photos in this book are breathtaking and realistic and they cover every aspect of the movie. Some of the best shots of the film are included in this work. The articles on the actors are thorough and not only give some history and filmography on them, but also offer a very personal view into their lives. Being on the set during filming myself I can see that The Official Companion offers a view into the business of film-making, and that coupled with the historical aspect of The Patriot will truly make this book a pleasure for everyone!
