The characters were humorous and the story fast- paced from the very first page.I gave the book 4 stars, instead of five, because a few things annoyed me:The hero is quick to judge the heroine falsely over something that obviously was not her fault. For that, he banishes her from his life for a while. Luckily, it doesn't take too much of the story to reunite them.Second, the characters were very typical. He's a powerful warrior who has had hordes of women. She is a sharp- tongued virgin.

The Oxford World Classics edition, which is supposedly under review, does not have a hardback edition; it exists in paperback only, and is translated by James McGowan in verse form, with French and English on facing pages and does not have formatting problems. There is an introduciton by Jonathan Culler. One review supposedly of this edition in fact describes a prose translation of the Flowers of Evil by Keith Waldrop (published by WEsleyan University Press), a very different book. The translation by McIntyre is another edition altogether.

Each poem has it's own air to it--vivid, gothic, and in search of the flowers of evil or the beauty in \\"evil.\\" In the past, I've never been too much of a fan of the stereotypical rhyme scheme type poetry but Baudelaire takes it to another level with his strange symbolist scenery and the emotions he puts me, the reader, through.A must read; my current favorite of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the translations are good, they floor you","review":"It's such a pleasure to pick these up again and be reminded of just how cool of a writer Baudelaire was. He manages to move between ruminations on lonliness, decay, and death, and these really great, decedent, in-your-face satires of everything in Paris that pisses him off/makes him fall madly in love. I don't know much French, but the Mathews edition seems kind of uneven to me, probably because it was done by so many different people. Sometimes they just hit this perfect stride and the poems will leave you floored, other times it seems like some of the translators just don't have the energy to render stuff this lively into English without it getting a bit clunky.

Ultimately, that the political left is 'owned' by the communists/fellow travellers of his past is the underexamined assumption that underpins too much of his analysis. While many of his insights are spot on, they exist in a disjointed series of isolated critiques that he and his editors attempt to link together into a (illusionary) unified whole. While it's not clear how much of this book is mere self-therapy for its author,it does manage to provide warm fuzzies for ideologues on the right, a cathartic punching-bag for stridents on the left, but precious little for the masses who have to live in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The well that never runs dry","review":"For the umpteenth time, Horowitz explains his transformation from an egomaniacal left-wing statist into an egomaniacal right-wing statist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Reading","review":"This book is not easy reading but it helps one to understand the true motivation of the leftists who are trying to turn the greatest country in the world into a socialist disaster.

The landlord of an apartment building is harrassed by tenants who start fires in the building by smoking and vandalism. The arson activity is justified by the dwellers of the building as retaliation for the condition of the buiding. None of the tenants has bothered to complain to the landlord or file a complaint with the city until after one of the residents sets fire to the building. The picture quality was just passable and the sound had background problems on the vhs copy from Vci.

Even if you have read a lot of Shakespeare's plays, this one is difficult and demands much effort to follow. But, if you can push yourself into reading this, it is well worth the time. Shakespeare himself performed the role of Berowne. While this is a comedy, the humour relies on irony as opposed to funny events. Also, unlike his other comedies, this one does not end in utter happieness. The interaction of the characters, as well as the situation comedy (especially in 4.3) is quite memorable.

In fact, I'm the type of cook who enjoys \\"reading\\" cookbooks, and this one is no exception because Gladys sprinkles her warm comments and anecdotes about where or when or how she served the recipes throughout the book. The recipes themselves are perhaps a bit \\"dated\\" relative to how we eat today, i.e. I think our food culture has changed with the times so that we generally enjoy stronger and more exotic flavors than are represented in this book.

Both of those songs are on this disk, with a mix of his other songs, old and new, cobbled together from two live concerts. The sound of the disk is simple and spare--one man and his guitar--and eminently listenable. The audiences he has, moreover, are the kind to make lesser artists green with envy, as they sing along, and even take over at times, with full throat and beautiful melody. The simplicity, honesty, and depth of feeling in these songs is enough to bring tears to the eyes of listeners by themselves; the reception the audience brings to them pushes this album over the top into the front rank with the best live albums folk music has enjoyed through the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album for coma sufferers!","review":"I have been acquainted with Dougie's music for some years.

While he did a good job of telling the reader how to buy a surplus carbine: little was done on where to get parts and service. Much like owning a 1919 Ford your going to need parts some day. M-1 Carbines are fast reaching 50 years old and not every 25 yr. gunsmith can work on them.

He owns his own auto repair shop and they get used almost daily, so it may not seem like 9 months is a long time, but when you consider the heavy workout they get it is. They are good quality blades that he has never had a problem with. They are generally less expensive then other brands as well.

Wrong words (wondered instead of wandered, etc.), mis-spellings, and many,many,many misplaced and overused commas all detract from the reading. The premise is interesting -- although having one ship (albeit the WeeVee) take out four Japanese carriers, two battleships and other varied craft does seem a bit much. Artistic license, perhaps, but wouldn't it have been great to have this ship in the \\"real\\" war...... And the \\"sub-plot\\" of the four girls on board was ridiculous. Sorry, I guess it got my back up to see such an incredibly poor job of editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Treatment of Calvinism","review":"In this work, Spencer seeks to introduce his readers to Calvinism with a brief introduction into the popular \\"Five Points of Calvinism\\" (or TULIP). While the book gives a brief introduction into each point, Spencer is limited in his \\"proof\\" texting or biblical exegesis of Calvinistic verses. Further, Spencer often glosses over key Arminian arguments and verses and never really dives into the history of Arminian thought and theology.However, the book is good for those interested in a short reading of Calvinism. My sister used this book in her Bible studies at their Presbyterian church and found it to be easy to read, understand, and enjoyed the lively debates that insued from the book.For a better treatment of Calvinism's Five Points see THE FIVE POINTS OF CALVINISM by David N. Steele. For an excellent work on Arminism see Robert Picirilli's GRACE, FAITH, FREE WILL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elementary but helpful","review":"As a student of theology, I must agree with many of the comments above. This book really doesn't represent either side entirely, sometimes distorts and decontextualizes scripture, and tends to pick on Arminian theology inappropriately. But what do you want for ten bucks and eighty pages? If you're looking for serious academic theology then read Berkhof or Erickson. This is a good summary book to get people started in thinking through the differences between Calvinist and Arminian theological standpoints. It is written in colloquial English for the average student, and does reasonable justice to the viewpoint.

The Financial and Managerial Accounting titles were excellent. I have also used them to supplement my MBA texts in Operations Management and Financial Management. Overall, the series is lucid and easy to follow. I was expecting this title to follow suit.Unfortunately, it did not.The exposition is shoddy at best. Though I could solve the problems as they were given, I found myself struggling to understand economics.

I love him as the serious, morally righteous attorney, the dashing naval captain, you name it. So, really, I should have known that he could pull off a comedic role as well. No one, I don't think, could have known how well he'd pull it off.From his first hilarious hangover to the last \\"cross-eyed\\" fight scene, Peck is enchanting. He's completely believable in his role as a sports writer caught up in a new world of dresses and strange choreographers intruding on his poker night. And perhaps it's because he's not known as a comedic actor that he's all the more funny.Designing Woman seems to be a little known film, but I'm certainly glad I found it because it kept me laughing, which brought others into the room to watch it with me. Now I just wish that Peck had made more movies like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"\\"Designing Woman\\" is a delightful movie with Lauren Bacall and Gregory Peck.

This odd-couple comedy is skewered by its smirking view of sex roles, whereby the mink-clad heroine will go faint at a boxing match (is this Lauren Bacall?), and her macho mate will question the masculinity of a Broadway choreographer. And I'm afraid we can't share in the delight the film takes in making sport of a punch-drunk, washed-up boxer. (Now we know punch-drunk means brain-damaged). Notable only for the saucy performance of Dolores Gray, and an alley fight scene where the incredibly fey (but agile) Jack Cole knocks out an entire screen full of hoods.

Second, the ink does not dry well. Basically, the ink never dried. If you wiped the tattoo, the ink would smudge even after 5 minutes of dry time. This would not be so bad if the instructions did not say that the ink should not get on any clothing as it will not wash out.

These two albums have been re-released as a single CD, and give a nice picture of Alf at his peak. The perky, chugga-chugga arrangements and slushy string sections may get irritating after a while, but taken in small doses, this is pretty classy stuff. Like his idol, Dick Farney, Alf was still a bit of a Sinatra-esque crooner, but he also had a handle on the soulful downbeat that links him to the jazz-tinged hipness of his times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the REAL THING","review":"Server Supply is selling a Intel quad card as an NC340T PCI-X 1000T gigabit server adapter.

When my friends have sucked Michael Jackson's books dry, and still want more, want to know how to understand the beer they are drinking, this is the book I recommend.

This book contains detailed guides to many of the more interesting ghosts towns around Colorado. It also tells a little bit about the history of the towns, which is certainly a bonus. My one complaint is that it was not quite as thorough as it could have been. There were some areas of Colorado with fascinating histories that were left out. But, all in all, this is a good book for anyone interested Colorado and its amazing history. If you like this book, I would also recommend a new gem of a book I found entitled Colorado: Yesterday & Today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Nice For Armchair Visitors","review":"For people thinking they might seek out these \\"ghost towns\\" be warned. The definition of \\"ghost town\\" for the purpose of this book seems to be a town that was once larger than it currently is that has an abandoned building or two somewhere near it. The examples from the book that I've gone to see are pretty much ghost-free small mountain towns filled with more than a few current non-ghost residents. The book makes things appear desolate, and exotic but, for what I've experience so far, it's painting a pretty romantic picture of nothing too exotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyngarde is all class.","review":"Cracking one liners.

A past participle is a word that looks like a verb, but never functions as a verb. It is a verbal. It functions as an adjective. Call it what it is. A participle is an adjective.

The films capture aspects of animal behavior which have never before been seen on film (polar bears hunting beluga whales; orcas playing soccer with a baby seal, baitball feeding with marlin, dolphins and a sei whale; orca pods attacking a baby gray whale, and so on). And they capture this behavior with extremely moving beauty.Unlike many nature documentaries, there are no talking heads, only background narration. You get a non-stop flow of images creatively matched to orginal music. But for those who do enjoy the talking heads, each film has great bonus tracks with interviews of the camerafolk, producers, scientists, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Documentary","review":"A superior and enjoyable documentary exposing people to the animals that live in the Earth's vast oceans.As far as the technical aspects of the DVD, the imagery is superb with its widescreen anamorphic format and very sharp picture. However, it falls short of some items you would think standard in a documentary, such as multi-lingual or caption capabilites.If I had to gripe about one thing, it would be the fact that the BBC and WB didn't take full advantage of the DVD format and provide a full 5.1 audio mix. Though the 2.0 mix was adequate for delivering the narration, one would have to think about the endless possibilities a 5.1 mix would have provided.All in all, if you love nature, particularly the mysteries of the oceans around us, this is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG BEAR WITH SOFT SHOES!","review":"I AM A FENCE CONTRACTOR IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

Here, the action truly begins to come forth in an incredibly imaginative plot full of twists, dimensional characters, and good ol' swashbuckling fun (the latter being pretty much the best thing about the ship; how many authors can take such strange and serious ideas and still keep up classic pirate aura?)Hobb balances multiple character perspectives--which carries the worry of slighting the characters.

There are some interesting concepts in the backdrop, but the overall story and characters failed to hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling but sloppy plot with, once again, no ending!","review":"Magic Ship, Liveship Traders, Bk 1, was a fun read, until you reached the ending and were left hanging for over a year. Then Mad Ship, Bk 2, comes out. The plot does not tie into book 1, as promised. Also, the story is a good read, but again the ending leaves you hanging. These books will best be read when all 3 (including the future promised book 3) are in one book so you don't get left waiting yet another year. This book is a poor way to spend $25."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will Book 3 be out?","review":"I really like this series. I like the characters and the way they are developing (There may be hope for Malta yet!). I like the flavor of tragedy that permeates this story without destroying all hope. I find it to be refreshing and original, which can be difficult even in the world of Fantasy. I find myself hoping that things work out well for Althea and her family, intrigued about Amber's origens, and wondering what will happen to Brashen beofre it all ends. And then, there are the ships..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Hobb is the best -- bar none -- in the fantasy genre","review":"I have loved all of Robin Hobb's earlier works (Farseer trilogy and Ship of Magic) and very much enjoyed quite a number of her books when she was writing as Megan Lindholm (Reindeer people, Harpy's Flight) but she's just getting better and better! I zoomed through Mad Ship in a couple of days and my wife was at me to hurry up and finish so she could read it.In a genre that is so cluttered with stereotypical plots and characters, Hobb's work shines as truly original material. Her characters have flaws and change over the course of the story and I found myself empathizing much more strongly with them than with the typical superhero that slashes his way to a *yawn* predictable save-the-world conclusion.There's plenty of spoilers in these reviews so I won't add to it but I really can't wait until Ship of Destiny comes out. Keep up the good work Ms. Hobb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best author out there","review":"Robin Hobb, aka Megan Lindholm, is one of the best current writers. Her Farseer Saga was amazing, and The Liveship Traders follows that path. An extremely addicting author, i have read all her books several times. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every one of her books is a delight!","review":"I await the second book with baited breath. The first in the Liveship Traders trilogy was wonderfully detailed and had an entralling story. I definately recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, history, romance...Her attention to detail and her deep characters make me want to read her books again and again! Her Farseer Trilogy was just as good. Look into those also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be made into a movie!!","review":"If there was ever a book to base a movie on about the good doctor's life, this would be it! It would be great!

There are also Bio's on all the band members, a Bonus video of Drops of Jupiter and footage of the band around San Francisco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Train DVD","review":"I was hesitant to order this video after reading the ratings that most people gave it. However, being the Train fan that I am and the price of it, I thought, I'm getting it and WOW was it ever worth it and then some! The audio is incredible and the picture not one bit grainy. It's just like being at a concert but you get to watch it from the comfort of your home. I HIGHLY recommend buying this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DVD!!!","review":"I recently saw train in concert and they are by far the best live band i have ever seen. this DVD doesnt do them justice, but it comes close. the added features are great as is the concert itself. you will not be disappointed with the DVD at all. the camera work is great and the audio is awesome. just buy it and enjoy and great live performance!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality fabric","review":"These pants are constructed from poor quality twill fabric. Save your money and get pants in 65/35 ripstop -- it will be more durable and far more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny but so so","review":"This book should not be taken too seriously. It is laugh out loud funny at times, but mostly it seems pretty depressing. Not so much at the author's portrayal of the seniors, but at his lack of ability to successfully get the elderly to talk about meaningful things. He claims that they do not offer him any great wisdom of life, but whenever he does find himself in moments of seriousness, such as when he finally finds out how his roommate's spouse passed away, he is too uncomfortable to pursue them further. Alas, the lack of depth he finds in seniors is not a reflection of those whom he meets, but of himself. But then again, what would you expect from a comedy writer who must constantly attempt to discover the absurd? It is a shame that Mr. Rothman did not have the courage to set aside his silliness at times; it would have given this work a whole new dimension."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ho hum tale of the Jewish after life","review":"OK, I really meant to read 2008's Leisureville, but this was the only book in the library on retirement communities. I'm over 50, so I usually only read a book if it's free.I wanted to scope out my options for the next decade. But even though Early Bird is non-fiction, it suffers from a dearth of information. It's really a bunch of essays about Rodney Rothman and how he is affected by the mostly Jewish mostly New York seniors around him, who treat him like a 28-year-old visiting son or grandson.Even though well-written, his humor wore quickly. I know a book isn't worth reading when I'm just scanning the pages, trying to find something non-gratuitous to read. I found it 2/3 of the way in, with the chapter \\"Basherte\\", where he left campus to date women his own age. It was still gratuitous, but at least that chapter was really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh . . . . .","review":"By the time I had read about 5 pages, I thought to myself, \\"Hmmmm, he's got a straight guy David Sedaris vibe to him.\\" Well into his adventures in retirementworld, the Sedaris vibe proves to be a good thing. His take on the golden years is hilarious, honest, and not condescending. He has genuine affection for some of these folks, genuine disdain for some, and he's even envious and physically attracted to others. That's how REAL life goes -- it can be cruel, interesting, boring, hilarious, and delicious (or bland if you're at a cheap buffet eating scrod). I'm now loaning my copy of the book to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"seniors beware","review":"I'm a senior and unfortunately found nothing funny about this bizarre and unpleasant contrivance. Unfortunately, because I spent good money on it, thinking that a former writer for David Letterman would at least give me a few laughs. Well, there are some, but they're all at the expense of us seniors. You know, how we've got sagging skin, love early bird specials, forget things--all the tired and offensive cliches. Har, har har. Unless you want to endure a 28-year-old sitcom writer's snarky observations about the failing minds and bodies of the elderly, avoid this one. I suggest these books as alternatives: Be An Outrageous Older Woman; 100 Things I'm Not Going To Do Now That I'm Over 50; How Not To Become A Little Old Lady. I'm sure that amazon carries them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Early Bird is a funny, light read. I think we can all admit we've entertained the thought of retiring early (i.e. in our 30s!) & Rothman follows it through with some hilarious, laugh out loud moments. Early Bird puts an interesting perspective on how we live both our pre- & post-retirement days."},{"rating":"2","title":"early retirement in Florida","review":"This book had me laughing out loud. It's the story of a 28 year old former writer for the Letterman Show, who decides to quit show business and move into a retirement home in Florida.Rothman, we soon learn, ends up being the youngest resident in this rather cliquish community, where trying to meet \\"new\\" friends, becomes a real ordeal.This book is a must-read and like the author Rothman says, It's defintely not like \\"Tuesday's with Morrie.\\" Most of the retirees are cranky, childish men and women in their 70's who making living in a retirement home, a very political enivornment that is prone to gossip and innuendo. I read this book in one day. Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Memoir","review":"I didn't really like this book. It didn't live up to my expectations. It has a quote from Jon Stewart on the cover, and seemed like a good concept, but wasn't that funny. The book doesn't have a good throughline. I imagine Rothman had all this material and it sort of resolved itself into various topics. However he ends one chapter abruptly and begins the next with no bridge between. He has a very dry style, but it comes off as lack of interest rather than wit. There's no sense that he actually cares about trying to get in with the old ladies by the pool, or how terrible his roommates cats are. It seems like he felt like he should write this book, so he did. But he didn't actually learn anything, I don't think. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't finish","review":"I didn't finish this memoir..I thought the idea behind the book was odd and it is just not worth my time and effort to read anymore of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, fast read","review":"I picked up this book Friday night, began reading it on Sunday night and finished it by Tuesday afternoon. Rodney Rothman does a great job of capturing the humor of his experience living in a Florida retirement community. The characters he writes about come alive on the pages and I often found myself laughing out loud at the obsurdity of it all. I found the first two chapters a bit akward, but by chapter 3, Rodney hits his stride and doesn't turn back. Surprisingly, this crazy recount of retirement living at 28 is hilarious, heart-warming and poignant all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Bird: great light reading!!","review":"This was a great light read. I really enjoyed the humor and anecdotes of life as a twenty-something struggling to find some inspiration and direction. The author is the son of a family friend, and really hit the nail on the head with his description of south florida's retirement villages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Contender for For Memoir of the Year","review":"As a male around the age of the author, I found this book to be a holiday treat, and found myself vicariously living the \\"easy\\" life through the humorous and witty prose encompassed in each chapter. Interesting enough, the author often paints how the life of a retiree can be equally difficult as that of a man entering the competitive business world. Full of villians, cliques and quarrels, Early Bird will have people second guessing taking the route of a retirement center in their geriatric years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea gone bad","review":"Surprisingly unfunny, this awkwardly written book takes a concept that's rich on paper but quickly--very quickly--goes nowhere in Rothman's unskilled hands. That's due in large part to his flat, disinterested prose, and, in even larger part, to his curious lack of sympathy or empathy for his neighbors who he seems to see as punchlines rather than people. Like Rothman, one never forgets at any point that he's conducting an experiment for the sole purpose of turning it into a book; he never rises above that objective or attempts to understand his subjects, or himself, any better. What could have been a funny, insightful, instructive read instead stands as a flat and unfunny series of observations.On the other hand, it's still a great idea for a book--or a movie--just not one written by Rodney Rothman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living a Dream... or Reading One Man's Nightmare","review":"I read a review for this book about a year ago. One of those, if I ever see it, I'll get it. Well, I never saw it and out of sight, out of mind.After some discussions with a friend feeling not unlike the author, I remembered this book and bought 2 copies. I read, thought it was pretty good and have been passing it on and loaning it out ever since.I think it kinda speaks to people the author's age and around. I myself am in my mid-20s and have a hard time grasping the concept of \\"40 more years and I can retire.\\"Reading this book made me laugh and made me realize that maybe I dont have it quite as bad as I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like, \\"early disappointment\\"","review":"the only good thing about my experience from reading this book is that I didn't pay to read it. i borrowed it from a friend. this book is terrible. it goes nowhere and it is not terribly funny or insightful. this guy benefits from somehow being associated with Sedaris and Klosterman. which is a complete stretch. i agree that it is an interesting premise. however, this would have been a solid article in a magazine rather than an actual book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is sad.","review":"The \\"Old\\" people in the book seem to avoid Rothman's cloying attempts to make himself feel better by being around those he considerers weak and irrelevant.But the statement of this book is powerful, albeit wholeheartedly unintentional.Mainly that the youth of this country are pathetic, lazy, and selfish and yet want so much back form the world.The author needs to visit Africa for a time being and see if he could muster trying to survive over there.He wouldn't last a week.He has the sense of humor of 16 year old. Oh, I forgot he writes for network (or did) TV. A perfect fit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to retire, not quite, but now I know...","review":"Great book! I laughed my butt off, especially with an 80 year old father in Florida who calls me 5 times a day. Sensitive and humorous recant of a young man who 'retires' with the elderly. I can't wait for the TV show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to Sedaris","review":"This vapid account of life in early retirement reads more like someone's notes for a book than a finished piece itself. I didn't find his attempts at humor offensive, vulgar or objectionable ... just lame. Very much of the Letterman ilk. The people in his story aren't the figures of memoir, he does a poor job writing about an experience. Instead, it's like you're listening to the wise guy in middle school who makes fun of everybody else. He's just talking smack about his friends. Something everyone enjoys doing, but that doesn't mean others want to read about it.It's boring, under-developed and unbelievably unfunny. Rothman's vain self-comparisons to David Sedaris are grossly inappropriate. He doesn't have an iota of Sedaris' talent for story-telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable light read","review":"I really enjoyed this book and found myself relating to a lot of what he wrote about. Florida is my favorite state and when I stay there (usually twice a year) I stay with an older friend who lives in one of these retirement communities and I HAVE met the pool ladies! I have felt how he felt many times with trying to fit in when you stick out like a sore thumb! I found myself rolling more than once. Yes he does talk about being Jewish quite a bit but hey! he IS Jewish..so what? Doesn't take away from the tone of the book or what he was trying to prove to himself. This is a good light read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for older folks","review":"I didn't find a lot of humor in this book.

Go figure. Anyway, don't pay him any mind. This is a wonderful film and besides Nolte and Winger's performances the \\"supporting\\" (in a way, they steal the show) performances by Emmett Walsh and Frank McRae are brilliant (and hilarious). This is a comedy/drama/romance that works in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likable Steinbeck Adaptation","review":"If memory serves, \\"Cannery Row\\" had a troubled history making it to the screen. Raquel Welch was fired from the film and subsequently sued the studio. A myriad of production and release delays ensued. When it finally made it to theatres it was met with tepid critical and commercial reaction. Viewing it some twenty-five years on my response is that this is a nice film. My only real criticism is that it drags on occasion but sails by on good vibes. The film is populated with affable eccentrics that tug at your heart portayed by terrific character actors like M. Emmett Walsh, Audra Lindley, and Frank McCrae. The central romance between Nick Nolte's Doc and Debra Winger's Suzy is palpable and emits definite electricity. \\"Cannery Row\\" is a sleeper well worth pursuing."},{"rating":"2","title":"alternative view","review":"Screw the movie...the sound track is great...my kind of Jazz. well, I liked the movie, but I went out trying to find the sound track.

I won't buy another movie from AMAZON because of this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Release Cannery Row on DVD","review":"Back in September of 1999 I wrote a review praising this movie as one of my favourites. As one might note on reading the reviews here, most people who watched Cannery Row and bothered to write a review agreed.In the past five years, tens of thousands of truly horrendous films have been transferred to DVD, even films that most people found completely unwatchable: The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962), It's Pat: The Movie (1995), Baby Geniuses (1999), and the entire Police Academy series. In fact, *most* of the films found on The 100 Worst Films of the 20th Century list are now available on DVD.To anyone actually awake at MGM Home Entertainment: please release this film on DVD. My VHS deck died many years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Editorial Review","review":"Tom Keogh's Editorial Review of this delightful movie does it a huge injustice, and if you take his word for it, does you one as well. That isn't to say the movie is for everyone. But if, for example, you, like me, are a fan of Northern Exposure, you'll feel right at home with these quirky, loveable, soulful characters. This is Steinbeck light, Steinbeck with a wink. It's part nostalgic remembrance of northern California before its gentrification, part romance, part surreal comedy. This is NOT the dark and brooding Grapes of Wrath, John Ford's masterpiece. It's less a meal than an appetizer that leaves you wanting more. Nick Nolte and Debra Winger are young and wonderful, but the whole cast is superb.Much in the same vein is Ward's screenplay for the Milagro Beanfield War (directed by Robert Redford), in case you're interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid to make Doc a pitcher in hiding!","review":"I was really excited to see this movie when I found out that it existed. I love both Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday and spent considerable time and effort into tracking this down. I was not a fan. Doc has no beard, he is much more callous than he was in the book, they turned him into an ex pitcher who hit the seer in the head with a bad pitch and is now in hiding. Also Hazel is borderline developmentally disabled in this film. Maybe see this if you have not read then books but then go and read the books and be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick and cheap is not always better.","review":"I found John Huston's narration to be the most irritating part ofthis adaptation, ruining with words what would have been a great ending to show instead. Too many changes were made from Steinbeck's novels that seemed to milk down some of his most important themes. My favorite character, Lee Chong, the Chinese grocer, never was included in the movie and Richard Dreyfuss would have made a better Doc Ricketts than Nick Nolte. All in all, a convenience store version of what needed a top drawer sensitive Tiffany's effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannery Row","review":"Nothing like the book but still a very good portrayal of John Steinbeck's Cannery Row.

The Milwaukee has a plain rubber disk. I don't know if H&L is an option or not.I use this for final buff-out of high gloss lacquer furniture finishes and it works great.A nice feature is that the back has a \\"stand\\" of sorts, so you can lay the tool down securely without contaminating the bonnet. Also nice is the twist-lock cord that helps prevent breaking the conductors at the point where it leaves the tool.

No, only the subacute form is temporary, but they left out the word \\"subacute\\" -- otherwise it would be chronic, Hashimoto's disease.Another problem with the book is that the pages come out easily, with only slight pressure.But most of these NCLEX books do contain a lot of factual errors. I feel like they should hire me as an editor; the so-called editors for most of these books must be whiskey drinkers.It's a decent book, compared to the others. Not the best, but in the mid-range.

Without much explanation, the switch module packed up inbetween cuts of the threaded rod (i.e. it was not in use when it gave out, rather coming up to speed and suddenly it stopped working). Got the usual run around at the repair shop - called Milwaukee and they agreed to cover cost of parts... if I payed the labor... which I agreed to do as I have been without the unit for 30 days now. I would not recommend this unit again - the motor it great, lots of power but you have to wonder why pay the extra dollars if components like the switch are going to give out with moderate use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Operator","review":"I've had occasion to use jigsaws from different manufacturers and so far this one from Milwaukee stands out above the others. The low vibration is an important feature(I have carpal tunnel problems in my wrists)and the ease of changing blades means less downtime in the midst of a large job. I'd like the tool more if I could use universal blades as well, and a toolless shoe adjustment would be a desirable feature. This is a strong, well-built tool that should stand up to hard use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't See The Line","review":"Purchased approximately 6 months ago and have had opportunity to use on several occasions. Smooth running tool and orbital feature nice, but... too difficult to see the blade while cutting.

You can't win."},{"rating":"1","title":"HDMI Port stopped working....","review":"I got a new Directv service with H20 receiver. Just after completing 3 months warranty period, HDMI port stopped working. There was no VIDEO/AUDIO through HDMI port. Called Directv support and they said it's a known issue and they would replace it with a refurbished one. But the twist was I had to extend my contract for another two years to get the faulty receiver replaced. Which sounded ridiculous. I decided to use Component Cables for viewing 1080i instead of HDMI. I regret for switching from Comcast to Directv.I don't want to get stuck with Directv due to faulty receivers. Eventually I may have to pay early termination fee if my Component port also stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT !!!!","review":"Same thing happened to me. I was replacing an old d10 with the h20-600.

Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Directv is a cadre of thieves","review":"DO NOT USE DIRECTV...i was a customer for years & always bought my own equipment at full retail.

After shelling out $300 to DirecTV for the HD DVR, they didn't install the second line so the DVR function never worked properly. Then suddenly my HD signals died. First guy said the signal was bad and the dish needed to be recalibrated. Another appointment for recalibration and the guy said \\"signal is fine, what you need is a new BBC converter\\". New BBC converter shows up and still no HD. In frustration I cancelled, and am now slapped in the face with the $250 cancellation fee.If you go with DirecTV, I recommend lots of lube."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Never Underestimate LYTE thee MC, I Am a Rapper Who is Here to Make Things The Way They're Meant To BE\\" PRICELESS","review":"Lyte in my opinion is truly the ultimate female emcee in history.

My favorites are track 9 \\"Bad boys de Marseille\\" (Part 2), about a beloved local football team and track 15 \\"Raggasonic Crew\\" by Raggasonic. \\"Le Flow\\" should be in every world music listeners collection whether serious or novice. This CD is a prime example of how an immigrant culture stamped it's identity on the host country's music scene and revitalized French music by saving it from itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase as companion for the book..","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this movie. It was so loosely based on the book that you could barley see the story. I was hoping for a companion DVD to the book for my children's Sunday school class. The DVD stayed away from the true message of the book and had talking animals and other characters that took away from the message in the book. When Lucy asked why the stripes were red she was told because somethings are special and it was a symbol.. A symbol of what.. is not said. I do not recommend the DVD if you want this to go along with the book. The children watched it an said it was ok, but they all agreed the book was much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Legend of the Candy Cane","review":"I would recommend renting this DVD before buying it. I was totally disappointed with it. This could have been a good christmas story to be watched for generations to come but the produces gave only a brief mention of the candy cane symbolism.

Once again it makes Christians out to be unintelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"I needed this movie to better reflect the book...it condensed the 'candy cane' part of the story and drug out the extra story lines....

I finally turned it off, and just told the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"For [most] all of your concrete drilling needs...","review":"I bought this drill because I needed to secure a few walls to the concrete floor of a basement. Okay, so it was overkill, but I'm not much on renting. Did the job, no problem. That was expected. I then used it to \\"cut\\" a large chunk out of the foundation so I could add a door to the outside from the basement. The foundation is 12\\" poured aggregrate, and here in Mass. (next to NH, the Granite State), the aggregate contains quite a bit of granite. Anyway, 150 or so holes later (1/2 holes, all the way through the 12\\" aggregate), the chunk is out and the door is in. In short, I don't believe a mickey-mouse drill would have drilled 1 of those holes, much less all of them.Took quite a while (several evenings), mainly because bits don't do well when they hit granite. Nonetheless, the drill worked (and still does work) great. No problems recommending this one highly. Heavy duty? Without a doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latest McAfee upgrade is a disaster","review":"At beginning of August I installed the latest upgrade of McAfee VirusScan...it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it also installed Site Advisor uninvited, which is just a nuisance and doesn't provide any information you could not work out with a bit of commonsense. Worse problem is that my email (Outlook) has slowed down and some outgoing emails seem to get in a logjam and fail to send. I've turned off some of the 'features' of the program to try and overcome this but it still causes problems. McAfee's chat room style help service is a joke...you can wait on there for hours and not get an answer, and emails to their help service take several days to get an answer, which is often useless. Phone calls to them have always been a waste of time and usually finish up with them saying the only thing they can think of is to reinstall. Well, duh, I already tried that!

However, an update around the middle of 2006 completely fouled up my computer. I took advice from their technical helpline, but this did not cure the problem. I finally resorted to a complete uninstall and replacement with another company. I am not a computer expert, and found it very disconcerting to have my computer disrupted in this manner by a company which is claiming to safeguard my on-line interests.

The song \\"Preciosa,\\" I think was my favorite. It will make you want to go to Puerto Rico. \\"My Baby You\\" was kind of embarrassing. He said he would never do the song in concert again, which is a shame because it's a very good song. Man, this guy can really sing.

The kennel appeared well made and as advertised took only a few minutes to set up. The first time I put him in I pulled the zippers down equally leaving them at the bottom of the zippered door. When I came back I was greeted by my dog at the door. He must have pushed on the webbing of the door hard enough to seperate the zippers and then pushed his way through. The next time out, I clipped the two zippers together so they could not seperate. When he greeted me at the door the next time I knew this was not going to work. Basically he either chewed or pawed a hole in the mesh screening and worked on it until the hole wasbig enough to go through...

I LOVE the Midwest camper because the zippers are SO strong, they have NEVER been stuck, I have long hair dogs and the fur never bothers the zippers (I wish I can say the same about the noz-to-noz zippers). The thing I don't like about the Midwest Camper is that it's very hard to wash out the inside and to drip dry. It does not have bottom suports so you can't just hose off the inside and stand it up to dry. My dogs get very muddy after swimming and having to wash out the camper was too much trouble.

Since then I have used the Sawzall for several other small projects around the house and it has performed flawlessly.I did purchase the Milwaukee 11-piece blade set but haven't opened it as the two included blades are still sharp and still effortlessly slice through everything that gets in front of them.Maybe this saw was overkill for my small home improvement projects but the ease of cutting and lack of kickback and vibration are worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atop saw with extra features.","review":"This saw, besides having all the latest features (orbital, replaceable cord lock, keyless blade change, etc) this kit ALSO includes the Milwaukee Job Saw.

I got this one the same time I replaced my long lost Suicidal Tendencies CD, and I find this CD actually eclipses ST's monster attack. As always, the focus is highly political, feminism centered, and steeped in the indignation Hanna feels towards the oppresion she see's around her.But in a musique electronic type of way. Which is why it's a little rarer still.Definatly not one too miss, but I would add that as a guy, you've really got to assume a thick skin, as much of the anger in this CD seems directed towards various stereotypical males in general.

It was as if amidst their obsession with making their powerful statements about \\"society\\" \\"art\\" and \\"stuff,\\" they lost sight of the artistic process. This album was grossly unsuccessful because it focused too heavily on the end statement rather than the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Le Tigre record you must own","review":"No, it may not be as musically diverse or refined as the band's debut. But it is very fun, politically-charged, and addictive. Most of the songs roll along to a mid-tempo beat, and most of the album deals with issues that might be more close to the heart of feminists and politically active folk than the average listener. But the lyrics about apathy and discouragement within activist communities is done well, and the music is highly dancable. Kathleen Hanna also passes the mic to her bandmates more on this one. They dabble in funk, rock'n'roll and random noise montages - but it's mostly just enjoyable dance music with great lyrical themes. I know I only gave it four stars (would give it 4 and a half if possible) - it's just not peeerfect, but it is great. Not quite as pop-savvy or accessable as the first Le Tigre album, but it might just spend more time in your cd player for it's more subtle musical nature and excellent lyrics. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"While the video and audio quality is very good, understand this is not a DVD but a DVD-R. Most DVD players can play DVD-R.

They wonder at Dianne Wiest forgetting to thank Woody Allen when she won her first Oscar for \\"Hannah and Her Sisters\\" remarking that Wiest was a frequent star of Allen's movies--but \\"Hannah\\" was her first movie with Allen.

With expedited shipping, it arrived at 5:00PM Christmas Eve just as promised. One good feature is the sliding locking feature that locks the speedlight to the camera shoe. I had a Nikon speedlight before I went digital SLR and you always had to turn the dial on the Nikon speedlight,and sometimes you did it too tightly. The Canon speedlight eliminates that. The flash worked right out of the box and my digital Christmas pictures turned out great.

This speedlight is a must if you spent $1,500 for a Canon 40E digital SLR."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this","review":"i have the canon rebel xsi which i also love. the quality of my photos has improved tenfold since i have always hated the harshness of a built in flash. i had taken pictures at two separate events without this flash and how i wish i could go back and re-do it with the flash. everything comes out FAR more professional but without the excess bulk. i love that it has a built in diffuser, just for ease, though i also have the one that goes on like a cap, though i rarely need to use them because being able to bounce the light up and slightly backwards does a great job.i'm still experimenting with the different things i can do with bouncing the light and can't wait to do another event with the benefits of this flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted","review":"I previously used a 420 Speedlite and was quite satisfied with that. However, I felt it was time to update and figured I would spend the extra money and go for the 580EX II Speedlite. I never imagined the difference would be so significant. The quality of the photos, the speed in being able to reshoot immediately is well worth the extra money. This is easily a five star item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flash","review":"There are plenty of reviews that go into detail about the flash itself so I though I'd simply describe my experience with this flash compared to the 430EX since I own both.If you are thinking about buying a 430EX instead, consider this: The 580EX II power on and cycling times are significantly shorter. The difference is night and day and I think worth the cost difference for this reason alone. It's also quite nice to not have 90 degree counterclockwise head rotation limit of the 430, something I always found quite annoying. Practically everything about it is better and immediately noticeable - the build quality, weather sealing, lock mechanism, flash power and even the metering seems better. The only real down side is the extra size and weight, which is also immediately noticeable. Personally, I think the $100 price difference is meaningless considering the benefits but I do use my flashes a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flash","review":"The comparison to the built in flash is non-existent. The cycle times are wonderful, no more waiting for the flash to recharge to take quick pictures. The brightness and control is outstanding. This also solves the problem of long lenses and wide angle lenses interfering with the built in flash (the flash is too low and the lens blocks the light which appears as a dark semi-circle in your pictures)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing to happen to me","review":"The only bad thing I can say about this flash is that it doesn't work well without fully charged batteries (preferebaly NiMH 2300 mAh). If you use old batteries it will take literally minutes for the flash to cycle.This is the best flash for the money. I use my camera mostly for taking photos indoors, and as most of you will know that the built in flash on cameras produces harsh shadows and red eye. Using this Speedlite (I use it on a Canon T2i) you can direct the light straight up or bounce it off a wall which allows for beautifully lighted subjects (ie my kids and pets ).If you are on the fence about this because of the price, as I was, just trust that once you put it on your camera and take that first shot you will instantly forget about the how much you spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will not regret buying this","review":"I own both 430 exII and now th 580 exII ; They are both awsome units.I used 430 EX II as a slave and 580 as master on my T1i with canon 18-135MM lens.I used TV mode and white balance set to flash.The units performed wonderfull.

Used the Slave flash to bounce off the ceiling which lit up the hall.If you have 60D or hihger models that allows the camera to control the flash; i think settingup two flashes is the way to capture any event.I would recoment that you purchase the 580 EXII if you are going to learn to take any indoor pics and want to learn flash photography.Once you have the more expensive unit; you can pick up the 430 later.BTW, I used recharageble batteries to take about 500 pics on single charge.So the battery life is great on the 580 also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flash but, One Complaint","review":"Had this flash for about 3 weeks and have used it a few times photographing dodge ball, and auto shows/racing. I have very little to complain about. Its somewhat heavy to carry all day, and if you are an average or beginner photographer you will want to read the instruction booklet about 5 times. My major complaint is a bruise on the screen that appeared for absolutely no reason... it doesn't effect the use or performance of the unit but, it's just a kind of downer that this $500 flash has damage when its carefully carried in a lowepro bag and its carrying case. Is this a build quality issue? Also its a necessity to buy the diffusers in the above offered bundle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Works great with my Canon Rebel T2i.

However, I can say it is what you could expect from Canon. High quality, superb build, lots of options and long battery life. (I use the 2500 rechargeable batteries, and they seem to last quite a while).There's quite a few manual features, along with ETTL settings, so it's good for novice strobists like me who can use it nearly right out of box and grow into it over time.I'm using this with my Canon 40d.Also received this item in only one working day and took advantage of the Canon rebate program, so it was relatively cheap AND fast. Thanks Amazon!=======UPDATE ==========================Been using these for over a year now and since then, I have purchased a second one. I mainly use them on manual mode so I can't speak about the ETTL, but they're amazing. Planning on a third one as soon as another good rebate pops up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon 580 EX II","review":"I am extremely happy with this product.

It's easy to figure out for the most part, and has many options. Unfortunately, because the way XSi is built, it cannot be used as a slave flash without the proper hot shoe trigger/flash mount. This is a fault on the XSi side, not the flash side. I believe the only automatic wireless slave setup for this flash currently is the Canon 7D. Just a heads up. Otherwise, great flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy and fast recycle time","review":"I just put in bateries, connected it to my 50D, turned it on and began shooting. It was great!

So I started by getting her a wide angle lens. She loved the lens, but the built-in flash couldn't be used with it because of the hood. So I researched a flash for her. The Speedlite 430ex is a great flash. It pivots easily, allowing the flash to bounce off of a lite-colored surface so that the whole picture is illuminated instead of just bleaching out the target. So far, we've had no problems with the flash. We are new to this, so we haven't had time to play with all of the features though. We have only owned the flash for about 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Flash Accessory","review":"I love my new flash. After losing my Canon Speedlight 430EX I had to buy another one. this time the 430EX II was what I chose. I was at the Cadillac Ranch in Texas yesterday morning at sunrise and too some shots of the cars and of the cloud formations in the sky. This flash lit up a great range of the farm field in front of me and made for some beautiful shots with the fill flash effect. Other than that it is effortless to get good lighting of people and indoors. this is a big improvement over the 430 EX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the 550EX","review":"As a professional photographer, getting high quality images is a MUST for me.

With minimal use, mine failed in less than a year. At first it occasionally misfired, giving blank black pictures. Cleaning the contacts and sliding it on and off the camera seemed to help at first. Now it is just plain dead. I've missed numerous photo opportunities forever.Search the web and you'll find many forums devoted to the various ways this flash can die.Most disappointing is the short warranty. Canon gave me a repair estimate of $180. I paid $450 for the flash unit 10 months ago. This is not right.Other info: The flash was used exclusively on a Canon Eos 7D camera. Used for approximately 1,000 flash photos. With a total cost of $630 for the 580EX II, that comes to $.63 per flash actuation. Not exactly a fun way to enjoy my photography hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"On your Canon DSLR, the built-in flash provides light, the Speedlite 430EX II provides illumination.

I've changed the batteries three times in an hour and the flash still isn't doing it's job. It just doesn't even go off! If there is enough light in the room, the flash won't work and I just get a grainy in-motion picture. Even my built-in-camera flash does a better job! I feel like I wasted my money, unless I'm doing something wrong? I'm still learning the technical aspects of photography, but I attached the flash, locked in in place, and turned the switch on.

What a difference in indoor photo quality! No red eye, ever. It produces much more natural colors, and no ugly shadows when bouncing the flash off the ceiling thanks to the swivel (portrait or landscape, or anywhere in between), as opposed to the built in flash. Additionally, the camera battery does not get drained. My old Powershot G3 (which I've had since 2002 or 2003) can now even produce great indoor shots. If only I would have known earlier what a difference this would make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Great flash. Works very well with Canon cameras. I just wish it would turn 180* both ways. I also wish there was a wireless option compared to the line of sight setup. Still a great flash and very controlable.I just suggest hopping on ebay and picking some cheep off camera wireless setups, so you can control 1 if not more flashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"This unit is pretty much as advertised and reviewed, eg on the-digital-picture. A couple of annoying things:o The swivel joint on the flash head stops at 180 degrees facing rearward, when turned in either direction. When bouncing and moving from angle to angle, eg. following a randomly-moving subject, it'd be nice to be able to twist though 360 degrees so that one wouldn't have to think about where it's currently positioned - just rather where one wants it to be. I don't know that any manufacturer's flashes swivel that way, and it's one reason why people use awkward flash brackets.o No battery level indicator. There's no way to gauge how much battery life is left, so one has to keep an eye on the pilot LED, or swap out the battery set proactively before it stops working. This too seems to be a ubiquitous omission across manufacturers, and incomprehensible on a top-of-the-line unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"big help during the family portrait","review":"My family decided a few years ago that being a photography student meant I should be taking the family portrait. After last year's photo coming out far too dark I knew I needed to invest in an external flash, so that's what I did this year. It helped so much. The picture was taken in our living room which has no overhead lighting and a few table lamps. The flash helped add some much needed light. This years photo was not nearly as dark as last years. Another huge plus is the ability to tilt the flash to bounce off ceilings/walls which meant the flash wasn't directly in people's eyes and I spent less time using the red eye tool during processing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon flash","review":"Great flash.

It charges quietly (I can't hear it) The only thing I have to do is bump up the exposure compensation to 1 or so and my pictures are great. This is because the pictures tend to be a little dark on my Rebel XTi. But with the setting change, the pictures are perfect. It was all that I hoped it would be and more. But you do PAY for it. I did get mine from Adorama Camera$349.00 + $12.95 shipping. I was worried because it was so cheap. It came on time, and packed like it was nitro, all in original Canon USA boxes and literature. All 100% what they said it was going to be. I give Adorama Camera and Canon my seal of approval."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon 580 EX II","review":"This flash replaced my old 550EX. It is smaller and a bit more powerful. The camera mount and the battery compartment design are a great improvement from the 550EX.

I love the control I have with this flash and after you use it a couple of times, all the settings become second nature.

The build quality, as expected, is excellent. The flash has a guide number of 58 meter, which theoretically will give the right exposure on a gray card 14.5 m away (about 48 feet)on a moonless night at f4 ISO 100. The extra flash power is useful for bounce, reflected, softened, and otherwise modified flash. The eTTL gets the right exposure even when bouncing flash, although you may want to set flash exposure comp (FEC) in some cases. FEC is done by a button and a dial (with clicks you can feel), so you can do it in the dark.The weight of the flash makes me wonder if shooting in portrait mode would put undue stress on the flash base or the hotshoe. I have gotten a stroboframe flip bracket and the Canon flash cable (expensive!) to shoot in portrait mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro flash","review":"I like this flash.

I'm not a pro by any means, but this thing has helped my photography get to that next lelvel.This thing is pretty simple to operate and fast. A few times using the high-speed-continuous setting on my Canon 7D, this thing kept up. I also picked up a diffuser to mount on it as well. This, along with the swiveling head makes it good for indoor shots. I can soften the light and bounce it to fill in the shadows.I found it handy to always have an extra 4 AA Batteries handy.

The flash itself is very quickly reloaded which is the most important fact for me. You will not miss a good picture because your flash is not ready. Hassle free use in E-TTL or manual mode, transfer of color data between flash and cam are great and make taking great pictures easy.

Never thought of buying it but when I finally decided, I did not regret it. I love the flash because, it is easy to use and very good on battery. Please do not buy any junk flash and waste your money. I recommend canon speedite 430ex II flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome flash unit!","review":"This item is worth every penny spent on it! I had an old flash unit since my early days of photography, back when there was no digital units. The ease of this unit makes taking flash photography pictures a breeze. I don't know how I ever managed to live so long without one now that I have one. The infrared system that allows you to use the flash with another flash or triggering unit with the same setup. To be able to trigger the flash from a distance makes it a cut above the rest! Would recommend this item to anyone wanting to step up their flash photography skills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Speedlite 430EX II","review":"Obviously, goes well with the EOS cameras. I've only had it for less than a week, so I'm still learning how to use the large number of features. These features provide a lot of flexibility, especially when coupled with all of the different camera modes. Recycle time and battery consumption also seem to be good, again given the short amount of time I've been using it (but a lot of test shots). I've gotten good results with flash coverage as far as 30' (which may not be its limit, but it's as much as I've used so far). The low light focus assist is a great benefit in speeding up the camera's focus under those conditions. It's not a small unit, but not unwieldy, either. The rotate/bounce really helps to soften the sometimes harsh flash light. This seems to be a great addition to my EOS camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flash!!","review":"this flash brings a new world for your photography. Great quality and structure.

I was not aware how much difference adding a flash would make. Totally satisfied with this purchase. Can't wait to add lenses to my inventory to take better pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do love this flash but....","review":"It is powerful, well built and floats. Yeah you read that right. The first time I used it outside for some portraiture my assistant knocked the light stand over and the flash ended up in the river. I was able to save it after some work and still use it a year later. One thing I don't like are the cryptic custom functions. One of the first times I used it I was shooting off camera at a wedding and the flash use to power down. I didn't have a manual with me so I could change the programming and ending up breaking out the old Vivitar flash to get me by. These days I carry a copy of the custom functions page in my camera bag.All the best!,Brian Carey[…]"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Canon Flash!","review":"People, just get the flash!

I was taking pictures at a kids event for a child ID activity my wife was running, and did not want to have the long recharge time of the built in flash on my D20. The speed of this flash was great, and I never had to pause between the 2 or 3 shots I would take per kid. Also tried it out around the house in our normal gloomy NW winter weather and it was unbelievable the difference that this made on interior pictures. Have not had time to fiddle with all the extra menus, just put in the batteries, snapped it on (attach and release mechanism took a few minutes to figure out) and started shooting. Hard to ever shoot interior pictures again without this flash or for flash fill. Amazon shipped very quickly as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Have only had it for a few months.

Get the Canon for TTL; works great when moving around. But get the Yongnuo as a cheap alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it a lot","review":"I am new to flash photography but I am thankful to this flash, it proved to be very useful producing tons of usable pictures from amateur's hands at an indoor wedding. The batteries lasted longer than 1000 frames already and still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compared to my old 580 EX: (Worth Upgrading!)","review":"1. Faster recycle than 580 ex2. The new clamp (instead of the screw) is better, faster, sturdier.3. The flash is slightly more powerful.4. The old tricky battery door is replaced with a good one.This is worth the upgrade for sure. If you have a new generation camera (5dii, 50d, etc.) it is even more of a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best option for the price.","review":"This is a very versatile flash. I have used it both in the studio and as fill light outdoors. My favorite feature is the White balance compensation. It can destablise white balance in respective frames during continuous shooting. The only ( very small )issue I have with the flash is the weight but weight is just one of those things you deal with when using an external flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"good little flash, nothing impressive","review":"well, it does what it needs to do, but it is a bit slow some times on the refresh rate. but its worth for the money, and i dont like that it's minimum power it's only 1/64"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as promised.","review":"Worked like I expected, arrived as promised.

It works well for the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flash!","review":"I bought this flash because I have a new grandson and wanted to be able to take better flash shots of him. I have not been dissappointed. I use it on my Cannon Rebel XSI. It takes about 10 seconds to attach. In the auto mode you just turn it on and shoot. Flash angles are adjustable from level to 90 degrees up, left or right. I prefer to use bounce flash because I get more natural colors without red eye. I give it 2 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I spent more then 10 bucks for this","review":"Perhaps at the time this was considered a great movie. Me being a bondage fan was looking forward to this film with high enthusiasm. What I found was just far too low in terms of quality. I'm not looking for James Cameron quality but I was expecting this film to stress on the fantasy as opposed to straight-out sex in every scenario.To keep it short.Pros: some decent looking women and has bondage.Cons: the women may be decent looking but don't meet what you'd expect, poor execution, you should stick to watching Baywatch."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"To forgive is fine?\\"","review":"Incredibly underrated due to the cheap-looking production, but really has aged very well and extremely humorous. Another Robert Holmes superlative takes a look at the tax system. Although, not filled with many double-plays(a Robert Holmes signature in his serials), there is still lots of fun to be had. i find that this one seems to get lost in the shuffle due to Season 15 not being a real fan favorite.

Apologies to John Lennon and B.C. The album I had wanted to refer to is titled 'Peace in Our Time'.This is really the start of the second half of Big Country's album recording career.

Anyway, this long player is an extra special good deal for the extra tracks that are on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but still amazing","review":"I rated this video four stars instead of five because, while I have nothing personal against Linda Francis, in my view her approach to spiritual development (meditative and partner-based exercises) is tired, ineffective in the long term, and detracts from Zukav's message. There is a deafening chord of truth that resounds from Zukav that simply does not eminate from Francis.The bottom line is, a basic intellectual and emotional understanding of Zukav's philosophy renders these kinds of meditative exercises unnecessary. I would have much preferred seeing Zukav going in depth, one-on-one with the participants of this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart of the soul","review":"I was very disappointed with this item.

Their is also more eclecticism in the songs, ranging from the popular AOR hit title cut Life Beyond LA (Which also introduces new member Keyboardist David Cutler Lewis), to the jazzy cut Apothecary with Joe Sample of the Crusaders on piano. Other highlights include the Power pop cut IF Heaven Could Find Me and the Blue Eyed Soul ballad How Much I Feel(With strings aranged by Jimmie Haskell, he also did the strings on If You Leave Me Now by Chicago)and the funk/calypso of the David Pack penned Dancin' By Myself. Probably the most memorable cut on this album is the sarcastic folk tune Angola. All in All this is album is definitely worth more than one turn in the cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambrosia rise to popularity with this one","review":"While recording this album,Ambrosia member David Pack suffered loss of hearing in one ear.

Now they have Van Halen,the Doobie Brothers and Fleetwood Mac for fellow residents. The fall of 1978,when this album was released saw the its first hit HOW MUCH I FEEL,written by Pack about a girlfriend who broke his heart. The title track was written by Pack and Joe Puerta. Puerta's personally penned tunes include ART BEWARE and READY FOR CAMARILLO(a California town). There are a couple of jazz pieces. DANCING BY MYSELF by Pack and APOTHECARY,a lounge-type jazz piece. Drummer Burleigh Drummond composed IF HEAVEN COULD FIND ME although Puerta takes the lead. Puerta also took the lead on ANGOLA and HEART TO HEART.

The most glaring omission is Elmore's recording of Anna Lee. They chopped the first 12 bars off at least one other tune and also interspersed mediocre tracks by Sam Meyers and other artists on which Elmore is nowhere to be heard. This period of Elmore's work has some real gems which luckily are available elsewhere. I recommend looking for a used copy of the Capricorn Box Set King of the Slide Guitar.

She infuses the limp dialogue with brio and charm; she is alternately fiery and vulnerable, and she steals every scene. Jackson beat out Ellen Burstyn for the Oscar, apparently because the academy was too freaked out by THE EXORCIST to seriously consider it as a contender.

I got to the point where I started ingoring the recommendations and just hunted for facts to help me form my own conclusions.performance stuff -- its to weak and not discussed as much as it should be. I think you need to really go into performance issues when you talk about high availability because poor performance makes a system less available.I guess the final word is that this is a decent book that you might want to get if SQL SERVER high availability is something you need to know about.

I've heard a few tracks mixed by him and I own a copy of his Riddim Warfare album, but this album is the last straw.As eclectic as he his, he may be too eclectic as he tries to mix from genres too diverse. Though I appreciate the fact that he doesn't go for the trendy anthem-type dancefloor hits and experiments with more rare tracks, the result is, I think, unmelodic and uninspiring torture. I think that it's not so much his talent mixing as it is his taste in track selection that makes this album so awful. Riddim Warfare is much better in my opinion.My advice is - don't waste your money. There are plenty of other albums out there that are more deserving of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"mix?","review":"Spooky starts out this album strong with tracks that while varied, beg to be amplified. It's a great collection of tracks, but my main difficulty with this album is that's all it is: a collection of tracks. The term \\"mixed\\" can only be applied loosely to this album at best, as the songs rarely segue from one to the next and many transitions are bluntly abrupt. There isn't really any turntablism on this album either. This being said, I can't figure out what Spooky did other than pick the tracks, and even that falls apart towards the end of the album. Hover dub is 3 minutes of a vacuum sounds. Putting sonic youth in this mix is like trying to put the round peg in the square hole.

If that function is important to you, you should look elsewhere. I do, however, consider this a fine watch, comparable to the Rolex Daytona at a fraction of the price. It's not a large watch (approx. 38 mm),but it is just large enough to stick out from under a shirtsleeve for you to show off!. I knew it wasn't a real chrono going in, but I bought it anyway.

The face looked very classy with a rather large face (this seems to be the style of late). For the price of the watch it appears to be a well made and looks like a much more expensive piece.

Sad to say that if the best part of a product is the packaging. The watch was not heavy. The band felt cheap and thin. The buttons on the side were locked and would not press in. The main button to pull out to adjust the time was frozen in place. For the price, I suppose I got what I paid for. While I was trying to figure out the buttons, one came unscrewed and fell out. I could not get it to go back in place either. This has to be the cheapest watch I've ever encountered. I've seen fake watches on the street that operated and felt better than this one.

However the next day, the pin escaped my wrist band again(into oblivion this time)! Still, I had a few spares and it has not happened again so far. However, I would have really liked it if the pin just stayed tightly where it was supposed to stay.And people, the thing that I did not know about it beforehand; which would have influenced my decision to buy it is: Its not automatic, runs on a battery!

I have always enjoyed a heavy watch and this fits the bill. It feels just like the ones I'm used to. It feels like you have a quality piece on your wrist. I set my watch my my cell phone and I kid you not when I say it has not lost a minute in 11 months. The chronographs are crap though. But I don't like the idea of having to unscrew the buttons anyway.But for a watch under 100.00 this is perfect.

Try that, see if you like it. I loved Ride This Train, but wasn't as impressed by America, and sort of regretted paying retail for it. Like most of the Cash concept albums, its well under thirty minutes total, and each of the songs are slight two-minute affairs, the rest being made up by the between-song narration. In Ride This Train, the narration is backed by the sound of a train, which works quite well. On America, Cash just narrates in silence, and it doesn't work as well. I think Ride This Train has better songs, too. Preview 'Loading Coal,' opening track of Ride This Train, with its crisp production and assured vocal, and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cash fans and Patriots","review":"This recording is for Cash fans and Patriots, hard for me to see a difference.

Unfortunately, the execution of the concept falls short. The sex scenes have most of the \\"steam\\" edited out of them, leaving what amounts to an extended striptease but not much else.

I mean, yes, the women are beautiful, but the film itself is a dud. I'd like to say this is a good R rated movie, but I can't; while the sex scenes aren't much beyond an R movie, the storyline sucks. Don't get me wrong, I think this movie has a lot of potential; an alien fungus that takes the form of women, (I'm glad they didn't have it attack men, because I don't want to see that) but that's where the good idea stops.

The cover does not say whether it's R-rated or unrated, but it must have been heavily edited to take out all the good parts.

Why would Amazon or MTI studio even want to sell this version thru internet is beyond me since it only hurts the sale & marketing of the unrated version. In any case, I'm glad I only paid $9.99 for it, but plan to ship it back to Amazon & ask for replacement in the unrated version.

Where on earth has that unique wu-tang style of production gone, because it clearly is not evedent on this album. The Thing that seems to be missing most is the HUNGER they used to have to want to do their best and be the best in the game. May-be I should take my misplaced loyaly to the Wu, Mobb Deep, Nas, and other well established RAP artists and invest it in other up-and-comming artists who show no such contempt for their fans and perhaps show a bit more hunger in the the quality of their music"},{"rating":"2","title":"ya'll just keep fallin a little bit short.........","review":"first off i'd like to say this is a good album better than that garbage the W but definetely not up to par wit the classic 36 chambers s**t.... what you get with this album is a lot of quality songs all wit nice flow and most wit tight beats... i especially like \\"ya'll been warned\\"wit meth spittin really hot at the beginin' and \\"rules\\" is simplistic but still catchy.... on the opposite of that \\"radioactive\\" is straight up garbage that is the most annoying beat i don't know what rza was thinkin with that crappy song, also flava flav on \\"soul power\\" is really annyoing and ruins that song... so if wu tossed out the few garbage songs and put in some half way decent ones in there place and ODB got out of jail and put some of his craziness on the album, this album would be a definet 5 out of 5......"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clan Is Wooo!!!","review":"Wu Tang have become a part of our life and once again they hit the news with \\"Iron Flag\\" a tight album with beats which only the Wu Tang Clan own their secret making and without knowing how and why we just love them.It's a mystikal thing goin' on between wu tang and their fan.And the clan make more and more adicts everyday.So If you seek for an experience beyond the understanding dare listen to Iron Flag Come On !!! Get It"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wu Tang Clan back with another set of ill digital beats","review":"Wu Tang Clans last album [the w] did not have a large commercial sale, in my opinion do to the lack of quality. I was expecting another straight hip-hop album but from the first track [in the hood] I was straight amazed by the scratching and total digital style of Iron Flag. RZA's influence as a producer on this album shows in the amount of vocals he does on the album, and the clean crisp digital sound Bobby Digital [RZA] is known for. Overall this is a AMAZING album. Many different sounds from track one through twelve. An awesome dozen of digital hip-hop songs finely produced and engineered to a perfect new Wu Tang sound, proving without a doubt that Wu Tang is one of the illest groups. The lack of O.D.B. [old dirty bastard] really doesn't effect the album, it still has a definite Wu Tang Clan sound. Overall a must have for any true Wu fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"This CD Is a step in the right direction for the Wu, it sounds much like their first with a little modern twist to it. All the songs and beats are top-notch, the songs that stand out are; \\"Rules\\" \\"Uzi\\" \\"Ya'll Been Warned\\" \\"Iron Flag\\" and \\"Dashing.\\"There are a few minor things I found to be wrong in the album, a few of the beats sound too awkward, the beats in \\"Chrome Wheels\\" and \\"Soul Power\\" sound like something out of Saturday Night Fever, but the lyrics are good so I didn't pay too much attention to it. All in all I would say that it is a must-buy for any rap fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 STARS- Good Album with weak areas","review":"Wu-Tang left me a little disappointed on this album because it wasn't as good as some of their other material and on top of that it was too short.

Iron Flag does not have the feel of old school WU but still is a great album. The beats and lyrics are there but it feels like a random collection of songs, the story is not there. Nevertheless Wu-Tang still has the ability to create thought provoking and blood pumping songs i.e. Babies and Rules. The WU record most all of it in New York which made it more of a significant LP for the team of Shaolin. All in all Iron Flag is an assortment of songs which will make your heads bump!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic Piece Baby!!!","review":"Yo, this is another classic with great production and things seeming like it use to be like the \\"36 Chamber\\".

The lyrics were ok nothing like their first couple of cds. Wu tang is not the same ever since odb got locked up. It seems that they cared more about their solo albums then they did about there group album and thats sad because I would love to see wu tang blow up again. Their beats [were bad] on this album and I'm saying that because I know what their capable of, coming up with the dopest beats around. People are trying to say it's a good album and there giving it 5 stars because they are wu tang fans but if that album were to be relesed on a different name every body would be dissing it.

But hey, groups evolve into different styles over time dont they?? The lyrics are arent as good as they are on the 3 previous albums. But they dont fail. They are still better than all the other lyrics that all them other artists put out there. Ones that are popular.There is some not good tracks here. But only like 2 or 3. The rest are bangers.

There are some really good examples of RZA's production on this, with him displaying a swing towards the funky, souly edge of the genre. I agree with other reviewers about Flavor Flav being annoying, and i don't like the tendancy for U-God to growl hooks. I was also a bit concerned that some of the lyrics were a little - over-materialistic (especially some of Rae's verses) but they are compensated for by some great work by GZa and Masta Killah. I did wonder where Cappadonna was and the album does miss ODB. I loved almost every track and it is definitely the best album to come from the Wu-Fam (along with 'Fear Love and WAr' for a good while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiving My Iron Flag........","review":"I'm a true Wu-head. I've managed to collect all of Wu-tang's CDs, solo adventures including U-God's wack sh!t. Iron Flag reaches out and pulls you into a hipnotic Wu-state of mind until the last track ends. I was highly pleased by the out come of this CD. Being that radio in ATL didn't play any singles before it's release, so this was a complete blind purchase for me. But I'm a Wu-head, I don't need to hear a track when the Wu gets together. You just grab it!Other than the stale ryhmes U-God continues to spitt, The Wu Gambinos step up to the plate bashing flamable homeruns with every verse. The 4th quarter of the year is mostly reserved for the \\"big dogs\\" to release thier music on the market. This one fits in the top 10 of all releases in the 4th quarter.

The beats and rhymes are off the hook. You can tell that the Wu is sick of being underrated. Rza also experimented by allowing other producers to shine. Mathematics dropped an amazing beat it in \\"Rules.\\" \\"Uzi\\" and \\"Ya'll been warned\\" are instant hits. \\"Iron Flag\\" is a Wu-banger right up there with \\"Triumph\\" and \\"Protect ya neck.\\" Trust me, the Wu went all out for this album. 12 tracks of pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didnt like it at first...","review":"..didn't like this album at first but I've been listening to it all the way through a few times over the last few days.

Some of the lyrics aren't as good as some other Wu-Tang stuff but the whole thing is pretty tight.Most of the members shine throughout the album actually, especially GZA, Inspectah Deck, Method Man and U-God.Beats aren't typical Wu-Tang stuff but they're banging, some of them may have to grow on you though. I hated Chrome Wheels, Radioactive and Soul Power at first for example.

RZA production is tight as always and beats are bangin. WU has not fallen off, its only because people are stuck on the stage they were on in the past and refuse to see how much they have grown as individuals and as a group.

What is he doing in his life that is so much more important than recreating that Wu Tang sound!! If this is the WuTang of now, I abandon all future efforts by them.

The beats are driven by the bass lines, and the overall production of each track is great. There are very interesting and excellent drum rythms, which can best be described as tribal or worldly (mostly African). There is also a Jamaican dub stlye influence which mixes perfectly with the nature of the album. The overdubbing of electronic ambient sounds adds to the rich production landscape. I really love the combination of tribal and traditional type rythms with modern electronic effects and sounds. The crossing of these two forms is terrific and produces a unique sound. By taking the best elements from various forms of music this album doesn't let down. 5 Stars.Another Bill Laswell album that crosses the genres of electronica and tribal sounds perfectly is Tabla Beat Science: Tala Matrix. Check it out, especially if you like Radioaxiom: A Dub Tranmission."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense release by Laswell...","review":"Laswell is probably one of the most interesting producers out there and this release shows it. Some people think that a lot of his stuff is boring which I could understand. I wouldn't recommend buying everything he ever put out because usually half the CD has merit. But there's a lot of experimentation here and (as usual) a perfect blend of mixing cross cultural music with modern landscapes.

Also, the most annoying part of this fax machine are the junk faxes, which you probably have guessed it, use more toner! It has a setting for junk faxes, but it has only caught 1 or 2 of the hundred or so that I have received. Plus there's now way of deleting faxes from its memory. If it has junk faxes stored in its memory there's no way of cancelling them, it's going to print them out no matter if you want them or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"We have used this for 10 years and are looking for a new one to replace it!","review":"This has been the best FAX machine we have ever had. We have a bi-coastal law practice and fax to each office regularly as well as to many doctors, other attorneys and insurance companies. Our FAX in California is used multiple times a day, sometimes for sending or receiving 50 pages or more. The quick fax feature is very useful so that staff can load the machine and walk away and do something else while it is actually faxing. Our East Coast model is used a bit less frequently but still several times per day and is still humming along. We have had very little trouble with the machine but the rollers are starting to work slower and a few little parts have been falling out so it's time to get a new one. We are looking for the same model as we have been very happy with this one. I highly recommend it. We get the suggested number of pages out of each cartridge and drum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just refuses to send faxes - won't accept the paper, hangs up, etc.","review":"We barely use this fax - not many of our customers use the technology anymore. But, when a customer does send a fax, we usually have no problem receiving it. The big problem starts when we have to send a fax. The machine just refuses to do it. It won't accept the paper. Or, it connects, then hangs up without actually taking the paper. To get it to work, you have to be prepared to dial over and over again and coax the thing to take one sheet of paper at a time. I dread it. And, I'm sure our customers tire of their phone ringing over and over again just to have our fax hang up or, at best, send one page, then hang up.I would NEVER recommend this fax machine to anyone. I would throw it out, but its a tough pill to swallow to spend $200 on a fax and then really never get more than $10 of use out of it. The cheaper fax this piece of junk replaced did a much better job.Every time I use this thing, I die a little inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service is terrible at Panasonic and the product is unreliable!!!","review":"Had to change the drum about after 2 years of moderate use. I changed the drum (almost $100) in October 2006 due to streaking. Late February 2007, only after 4 months of use, it started streaking again! Contacted the CS at Panasonic and it was a complete waste of time; left message with the supervisor, never returned my calls. The Panasonic customer service policy is frustrate you and hope you will go away! Well, I won't go away. The freaking defective drum costs more than half of the machine!I will write to someone higher up and let the person know just exactly how I was treated by their CS. I own lots of audio, video equipment and do you think I would consider Panasonic product in the future, not a chance! Do you think I would buy any Panasonic product in the future, not a chance!

The world setting is great, the characters are likeable, and the dialogue puts many games' attempts to shame. The downside is the easiness associated with SM's horribly unrefined, generic battle system. Luckily, battles can be pre-empted on the field so it's not hard to completely phase them out while still maintaining a harder (comparitively) difficulty. The dialogue alone is worth the purchase to me -- it's obvious Craveyard really worked hard on it -- and it's replayable, although there's a lacking of sidequests and other things that would keep one coming back for more. A fun Doom-like minigame called \\"Gadget Madness\\" can be played also, and it's held up quite well. Given how cheap it can be found, blind-buying may not be such a bad thing...although renting is preferred to those who want slambang excitement every ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I would never recommend this game to anyone.

To begin with there is the shooting of a key drug distributor by a rival, and the chase to find the missing weapon and proof of the perpetrator's guilt. Then there is a murderer who receives permission to attend his mother's funeral and escapes from his keepers.Both these situations occupy Resnick amid fears of an escalating drug war between various factions: find and recapture the escapee, and keep a lid on the volatile situation in the streets. Resnick smoothly pursues both goals while enjoying his love of music and trying to make sense of his own love life.Tenth in the series, the novel is simply told and written with polish. The story moves fluidly and the suspense builds to an explosive climax. The characters are portrayed in a realistic manner, and while the two elements of the story are unrelated, the author meshes them believably. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre treatment","review":"The bottom line with respect to this book is that there is simply little that is particularly new or remarkable here. On the contrary, this author's treatment of the subject matter is far more muddled and meandering that other contemporary treatments of \\"ancient\\" wisdom applied to contemporary leadership/workplace issues.There is a great deal that needs improvement in this book. The subject matter has been hashed over a lot recently, but good treatments would still be of interest. There's a lot of loose talk about \\"scientific evidence this ... \\" and \\"science is now showing that ... \\" etc. with no attempts to provide references or corroborating information. The author's writing style is such that he tends to careen from one thing to another in a way that I found simply annoying.In short, in my opinion this is not one of the better books in this area by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Exceptional","review":"This is one of the most remarkable books on leadership and management I've found. The author takes principles from ancient religions and more recent heroes like Gandhi and Mother Theresa and presents them in the context of developing leadership characteristics through conscious awareness. Chatterjee correctly realizes that true leadership springs naturally from the leader's self-mastery, and eloquently lays out the paths that must be followed. This is a book to be read and re-read in small bites and then contemplated in silence. An achievement of the first order, and deserving of much attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"The book is best summarized as mysticism and a butchery of philosophical, scientific, and business thought.

Certainly not written in the usual way a novel is written.

Perhaps it would be helpful for foreigners to make such a note before reading this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Susan","review":"Enjoyed the book very much.

The language style is like Austen's other works, but the actual story is a bit different. A majority of the book is written in the form of correspondence between the various characters, so the reader figures out the story as the characters do. It didn't have the same humor that Pride and Prejudice and her other bigger works contain, but it's still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An irreverant look at hallowed ground","review":"If you know anything about the civil war you know that the battle of Gettysburg was not only a pivotal battle of the civil war but that it was also the largest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere and considered to be among the most decisive battles in history. With that in mind, I would expect that any tour of the battlefield would be approached with respect and reverence. But you find nothing of the sort in this DVD. This DVD treats the battlefield tour like a tour of a cracker factory. It is a silly, irreverent treatment of hallowed ground.

Second: the price. Viz wants $25 for 3 episodes when you can buy 24 episodes in the orgianl Japanese dialouge with subtitles for $30. Third: due to bad voice acting and scripts the character's personalities have changed.

This Album covers a vast array of topics from Nas's personal life to September 11th to his beef with not only Jay-Z, but also Cormega, Nature, and Mobb Deep. Being that this is Nas's fifth effort, I would rank it #3 right behind Illmatic and It Was Written (both classics). The hottest joint on here is the instant classic \\"One Mic\\". \\"Ether\\" kills Jay-Z's weak stab on the Blueprint, and the hook on \\"2nd Chilhood\\" reminds the listener of \\"Nas is Like\\". The only shortcoming on this album, besides a weak effort by Nas on the second verse of \\"The Flyest\\" which AZ blazes on, is what Nas left off of it - the full length, Source \\"Hip-Hop Quotable\\" version of \\"Stillmatic\\", and the blazing remix \\"Take It In Blood 2001\\" .. otherwise, the Legend is back .. show the King to his thrown"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in 2001? Thats rare...","review":"One word....classic NAS. Sure he has some club tracks on the album but thats necessary if he wants to stay competitive with the currect Hip Hop market. Lyrcically no rapper alive (and maybe not alive) can get with NAs. This album proves that. Tracks like Rewind and One Mic showcase Nas abundant creativity. I am a big Jay-Z fan and I think the Blueprint was a very good album (no classic), but Stillmatic runs circles around Blueprint! I love this album! I was getting so tired of the same old garbage raps. Bling Bling this and bling bling that..Nas brought it back to true Hip Hop on this album. Best album of 2001 easily. I definately recommend you cop this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I only have one question?","review":"Where is the track silent murder. I remember when this first came out I got the tape of it.

This to me is nas best album beat, lyrics at the time it was hated on for not being illmatic but still this joint is one of my favorite rap albums period!!!!!!

After being written off by everyone (Jay-Z, critics, fans, etc) except me, my favorite MC Nas HAD to come back with an album to blow the public away, and he did that with this album, and he did it in spades. Here's the review:Album Highlights: The entire album, EXCEPT the song Braveheart Party with the UNTALENTED Bravehearts. Feel free to skip this track.Production: Thumbs Up. He hooks back up with the Large Professor and Premier for this album.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up, always.Originality: Thumbs UpThe Last Word: Basically speaking, this is a masterpiece. up there with the likes of Illmatic. Nas made this album at his absolute best. My favorite MC showed that a scathing dis by Jay-Z DID NOT kill his career. It only made him STRONGER. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Don't sleep on this one.

I rank this as his second best behind Illmatic, and right before the classic The Lost Tapes.He used a lot of time into this and you can see the result quality. This also might be one of the best rap records that realeased in the year 2001. (a very wack year for the hip-hop world if you ask me). The album includes classic after classic. My favorites has to be One Mic, Ether, Rewind, Rule, The Flyest and Every Ghetto. I also love Destroy & Rebuild which sadly disses many QB rappers, the reason why I sad sadly is because I would like to see the QB rappers together and rep each other and support each other. I love Mobb Deep, AZ, Cormega and Nature. This is absolutely classic from beginning to end and is a must for every hip-hop fan.

Even though he flipped that scrip on us with tracks like \\" You Owe Me\\" and Ochie Wally\\", you had to know that Nas was still thorough when he spit \\"Black Girl Lost\\", \\"If I Ruled The World\\", \\"Big Things\\", and \\"Project Window\\". I mean we can never get another Illmatic, and thats that. But guess what we still got the same Nas that can rip anything that he spits on, believe that.

A word of advice to nas hook up with alchemist, pete rock, dj spinna and j.rawls. The one thing that has got better is nas's lyric's, he is not speaking about players and pimps so much but rapping about his own life and beefs with other people in the industry and how he has made mistakes, sorry but stillmatic is a mistake time to throw in the towel nas."},{"rating":"1","title":"not illmatic","review":"Crap. I can't believe the MC that brought us illmatic could make something like this. The way Nas contradicts himself from song to song would make the WWF writers proud.Seriously, this album is not worth the money. If you want deep lyrical content cop Mr. Lif or Company Flow or Cannibal Ox, or Arsonists. This is just more of the same crap that the big record labels feed off as being intellectual and pseudo-underground.

There are a few standout tracks on Stillmatic. While I love Jay-Z, I'll admit, Nas murdered him on Ether. I hope Jay-Z has a fitting response on The Blueprint II. Destroy and Rebuild is a great story-song, and the beat is sick. One Mic is really original... I love how he starts mellow and then gets more intense as the verses go on.

Ether is just average, Nas had some nice lines about Jay-Z but the Rockafella line about dying from AIDS was just embarassing as it was far from the truth. Jay-Z checked Nas's career in ONE VERSE on 'Takeover' and I'm more of a Nas fan than Jay-Z! Rewind is hot, dope concept and Nas pulled it off very well, as did he for One Mic, which gets best song award from this album.

That is why I recommend Holes as a terrific read."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is....","review":"This book by Avi is about the worst book i have read in my entire life. not only is is completely pointless and unimaginative, but it is a discrace to literature. there is NO moral, NO plot, but hey, its a kids book, so not a whole lot is expected anyway. but even though kids books are given a waver on how stupid they can be, this book abuses the privilage.have a nice day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, Hessians aren't so bad after all . . .","review":"An important part of every American kid's education: Read a little about the War of Independence. You know, minutemen, Bunker Hill, George Washington, grit at Valley Forge, British surrenders at Saratoga Springs and Yorktown.But, don't expect to find it here. This is not about the courage of Americans who faced British, Hessians, Iroquis and loyalists. In this story, only one American is clearly devoted to victory against the British empire and its hirelings, and he's vicious. Other Americans? Kinda cowardly. And the Hessians? Not bad guys, really.A much better story for kids to learn about Hessians in the War of Independence:Woods Runnerby Gary Paulsen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fighting Ground by Avi (Erick from the Bronx)","review":"The Fighting Ground by Avi is a good book but not for me. Well there was a boy named Jonathan and he was a 13-year old boy living in the 1770s. His dream is to be a soldier and fight in a war. Almost all of the men in his family are in war or went to war. ONe day he heard the tavern bell calling the men to fight. So Jonathan went without his father's permission and joined the army to fight in a war. Jonathan does not know what he is getting into, or does he?The book The Fighting Ground by Avi is a good book but not for me. You ask \\"why?\\" Well, it's because it is a war book and it does not have a lot of action.The chapter I like the most was when they kill all the Hessians in a pile. It was almost all the action they had in the book.I recommend this book to kids from 10-13 years old. Kids that like stories where kids like Jonathan get into trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Novel I've Ever Read!","review":"To make this review short, I hated this book! I'm presently in sixth grade, and my fourth grade reading teacher made me read this book. I found it terrible. I do not like war nor historical fiction books. I prefer to read funny books.

I do not recommend this book unless you are a real fan of historical or war fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Too Friendly Hessians","review":"This short book goes through a day of war with a young kid. It's a fairly good story but it needed to say \\"this is the Revolutionary War.\\" Young kids wouldn't necessarily understand that from the dates of the book.The first half has a lot of good detail, such as the heaviness of the gun that Jonathan, the 13 year old boy, is carrying, and how hard it is to load it. The second half is unrealistic. Jonathan is a prisoner to the Hessians. Later they all fall asleep and Jonathan escapes back to the Americans. For half of the book he is fighting for the Americans, for the other half he is doing good deeds for the other side. I feel that this book does not show what would happen in a real war."},{"rating":"2","title":"13 year old Jonathan leaves his home to fight the Hessians","review":"This book was great!

There isn't enough product for a doll house fireplace, let alone a real home fireplace. What really hurts is the 8 dollars shipping which is non refundable! This is a two postage stamp item.I am a big Amazon fan but this is the worst shopping experience I have had.

The customer support seems to be a joke, or maybe another way to get your money.Incidentally be aware that if you subscribe to McAfee and your subscription runs out. It is not that the software stops updating. It will stop running. And if you do not have an active internet connection (one way of avoiding internet hassels for a moment) when it trys to check with the \\"mother ship\\" to see if your account is active, it will fail (obviously) and shut off.

I only bought it because I'd recently had to format my hard drive and the virus software that came with my computer no longer worked (it turns out you can only reload that code once) and I was completely without protection. A virus threat well known in the country was said to go off that night, so my run to Wal-Mart had no luck in finding Norton, the one software I'd grown to like (for the most part). So, I tried McAfee. I was immeadiately unhappy with it upon using it for the first time because it advertises other McAfee products from its own pop-up windows. Also, if it takes a direct hit from a virus, it does usually catch it, but immeadiately turns off for some oddball reason. Every time I get a hit, I have to open the \\"Security Center\\" panel and re-enable the virus protection. The only good part about it is that it does keep itself updated as long as you keep the subscription paid for.

When I told the technicians what I had already tried, they did nto appear to listen and told me to do the same things over and over. I am giving up. I will NEVER buy another Mcafee product again and will advise everyone I know of my experience. I spent hours and hours on trying to download this program. It spent three days on it-- days I will never get back. And my partner and I darn near divorced one another as the result of the frustration.

After reinstallation of VirusScan 10.0, it will not allow our IE 6.0 browser or Outlook mail programs to run- the programs start but the moment you click on a link or attempt to open an email, the programs quit. Nor will VirusScan update itself without crashing. McAfee's tech help pointed us to a manual uninstall program they have available on their website on the presumption that portions of the program were remaining after Windows uninstall and were causing conflicts. This did not help. We are now looking for a more reliable antivirus program."},{"rating":"1","title":"ViruScam","review":"The software itself deserves probably 2 or 3 stars but it gets one star off for scam-like handling rebates.

I upgraded the bundled OEM version with 10.0 and so far I did not had any virus attack.

It has blocked many online virus attacks nicely when I browse through websites.But looks like it wont block the ads.

Of the four KK albums I have (Octagon, Dooom, Sex Style, and this), Black Elvis is by far the worst. Not just in comparison to the fantastic work that Keith has done before, but by almost any objective standard. His flows are ok, but the pale in comparison to what he has done on the other fine albums I have mentioned. Additionally, the lyrics on this piece are strangely tame. Unlike the other albums, there are few lyrics you will ever repeat to yourself and marvel at their genius. Furthermore, Keith's tendency to have repetetive chorouses becomes completely unbearable on this album. I swear that half of the CD is taken up by him repeating the same nonsensical phrases over and over again. Get any one of the other albums I mentioned, but please stay away from this one.

They will fix it, yes, but I have to pay to have the watch shipped to their headquarters. I also have to enclose a check for $28 for \\"return shipping fees\\". This seems like a very expensive battery fix. The problem is, if you take the watch somewhere local to have the battery changed, the second another party than Invicta removes the battery cover, the warranty is voided.

Mr. Voth has obviously taken criticisms of the first book to heart as character development, writing style, and the plot are all much improved.The plot twists, while sometimes foreseeable, contain just enough unpredictability to keep you wondering.Technical detail is superb, a feature usually sadly lacking in books of this genre. The characters start to come alive as we see more details into their motivation, flaws, and humanity. Sub-plots make their appearance, and start to intricately weave through and divert the main plot line.I look forward to the third book of this series.

I bought the unit brought it home and opened the box. Now the pump area is surrounded by a plastic cover secured by Torx bolts (just to make it harder to take the cover off.) I pulled off the cover and there is some no name cheapo aluminum pump with \\"Made in Taiwan\\" stamped on it. I did not appreciate the bait and switch and wrote Dewalt a letter telling them so. Still haven't decided if I'll return the unit or keep it and hope for the best.

I have only made it to Savannah so far, but found this book very sparse on information. There was only a very small section on Savannah which contained one lone page of restaurant listings. There was also only a small piece on Bonaventure Cemetary (two paragraphs), and the book did not include any maps or directions to get you to the cemetary and it is quite off the beaten track!

It surveys the standard topics in Law and Econ., e.g., Property, Torts and Crime. There are, however, a few too many topical sections whose relevance to the text is questionable. While some may enjoy random inclusions that do not have much to do with Law and Econ., I found them tedious. For example, sections on the death penalty and gun control are uninformative and are included, I feel, for completeness' sake.

This is quite an omission in terms of design.When assembling, there is a great deal of excess cord which needs to be carefully pushed down into the tube to give enough room to screw the poles onto each other and the base. What results is a lot of bunched up, twisted cords that have given me a few months, at best, of service.One lamp actually blew a bulb simply turning it on. The others smoked and sparked while in use. It's obvious that the wiring is not very high-quality, and there's absolutely no excuse for that even at a low price.While it has neat safety features such as tilt-protection (the unit will automatically shut off if tilted), and an incredibly bright 300w bulb - I strongly recommended looking elsewhere for a floor lamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice lamp.

There are no directions included but the packaging is good. I was impressed when I took it out of the box. Basically the outer ring you fill with air, that took me a minute. And there is a bigger valve closer to the center that you have to squeeze to open up a slit that is on the bottom side, I didnt catch it with my own eye had to come on here and read a review. That took me about 5 minutes to fill with water. Before you seal it just lay it flat on your counter squeezing the valve and pushing the air towards that direction. After that have fun!

He seemed to enjoy the fish floating around and was completely captivated with the little sun on the outside edge. AND - after pushing up several times he rolled over for the first time ever!! We had decided when we put him on the mat to start filming him and now I am so glad we did as we caught it all on video (flip camera also a great investment!).

And by that time, you've lost your wide angle effect you were going for in the first place. Spend the extra $$ and go to an actual camera store to get a wide angle lens.

Burning Down the House is by far the best of the series. Raphael's writing has gotten better with each new book, and his heroes have grown more human. As an escaped academic, I enjoyed the scenes of Byzantine intrigue among the faculty of the EAR department, and I appreciated Nick's ambivalence in dealing with his colleagues from his relatively powerless position. Raphael has a good grasp of university life and politics, and his wit is sharp and to the point. That he leaves loose ends at the finish whets our appetite for the next adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't measure up","review":"I was left unfulfilled after finishing this book; even worse because I forced myself because I'd spent my good money. I believe that I have a sense of humor and a sense of satire but the book's attempts on those levels fell short by my analysis. I've never read anything else by this author, so I won't make any further generalizations about his talents other to say that I wish him better success the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is more","review":"A measure of the success of a satire is understatement. Burning Down the House fails, therefore, because it tries too hard to be a satire. The style almost shouts, \\"Look,I'm being satiric!\\" No better example is how Lev Raphael portrays EAR (the academic department in which Nick Hoffman labors for tenure)as a circus of misfits---all except Nick, of course. Readers are willing to accept that any organization has members with foibles, but to paint everyone with the same unflattering brush is lazy characterization. The story wasn't strong on plot, with threats that start out weak and stay that way; so stronger characterization could have served an importance counter-balance. The same thing holds for the inane dialog, but that was to be expected. Characters cut from the same cloth tend to sound the same, squandering the opportunity to use dialog as a means to delineate characters. Lev's satire was just sad and tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO ONE'S PERFECT, BUT...","review":"SOMEWHERE, THIS AUTHOR ACCEPTED THE ADVICE THAT IN ORDER FOR A PROTAGONIST TO BE ROUNDED HE/SHE MUST HAVE FLAWS.

It's a once-promising mystery series. Lev Raphael has taken Nick Hoffman and made him the victim of empty plotting and silly situations.

Like Nick and Stefan in the kitchen, Lev has added the extra ingredients to his characters that make them more real to the reader.His most recent addition to the Nick Hoffman series, burning Down the House, is a definite variation on the normal mystery theme. It takes the reader through the twist and turns of \\"the mystery\\" at hand, as well as Nick's on-going inner dilemma with an attraction for a certain other professor. And, unlike most series mysteries, rather than the tale ending with the catching of the killer, a much larger, more encompassing story begins to unfold. Apparently our boy Nick is in for more than just a tidy murder in his next adventure..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of a feather?","review":"I read Little Miss Evil and dismissed it as a failed experiment by the author. I assumed that he would realized his failure and scurry back to the true elements that make a mystery. Unfortunately, with Burning Down the House, that's not the case. Is Lev Raphael trying to invent a new category? If so, he should stop promoting such works as mysteries. We know what to call something that quacks,waddles,and swims, but what Raphael is offering is something else. Maybe a dodo bird, and they are extinct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbed","review":"I wanted to be more generous in my evaluation but the simple truth is that I hated this book. I read the first Nick Hoffman mystery and figured that Burning Down the House was another mystery. I read a lot of books about gay sluthes and consider myself knowledgeable in this sub-genre. Therefore, I'll give the author some advice. First, give Nick something sinister to solve. I could not get involved with the plot when the main threat seemed to be prank calls to an Amazon of a woman who was more man than Nick. Second, stop with the silly product endorsements. Throughout the book, there were repeated references to a particular brand of wine, etc., when it had nothing to do with the plot. Last, cut Nick's ambiguity about which side of the fence he resides sexually. He's a gay slueth, so let him be a gay slueth. Hopefully, the author will serve up something more worthy next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either way","review":"I WAS PEEVED WITH THIS BOOK.

BEFORE WRITING THIS REVIEW I WAITED SO THAT MY ANGER COULD SUBSIDE. I EVEN WENT ONE BETTER BY JUDGING THE BOOK AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MYSTERY. IT DIDN'T HELP. THIS BOOK FAILS IN ANY GENRE YOU STICK IT IN BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING GOING ON, PERFORMED BY CUT-OUT CHARACTERS, WHO SPEAK RAMBLINGLY. IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF BEING GIVEN AN ASSIGNMENT OF A ONE-PAGE COMPOSITION THEN TRYING TO HOODWINK THE TEACHER WITH EXTRA LARGE PRINTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts to say it","review":"I first became aware of Lev Raphael when he was an essayist, writing about his agonies over being a gay Jew. It pains me to say that he has not made a successful transition to novelist. The themes of his essays (e.g. sexual ambiguities and jealous (?) bashing of women) are not only carried over in Burning Down the House, but explored in the same preaching style. I understand that every novelist injects certain biographical elements, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of weaving a good tale. Raphael should take up his causes in essays and spare us the polemics in his novels. Burning Down the House had no substance as a novel. The plot was without suspense because there was nothing at risk (my motto: show me the corpse). And if Raphael thought that this void could be filled by the reader's fretting over whether Nick Hoffman would \\"convert\\" and bed down with a tough-as-nails female, he miscalulated in my regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Betsy a rest","review":"I've read all four books in this series and there has been a steady decline. The problem is that the premise is only good for one use, after which, it defies credulity. Are we really supposed to believe that one University---make that one Department---is the setting for so much publicized mayhem? Such a University would have to give free tuition and board because no straight-thinking parent would let a child attend. Raphael stubbornly confines each book to the University, ignoring that every successful amateur sluth has operated within a variety of settings. With Burning Down the House, Raphael can't even think of a decent murder (at least in the preceding book, he sloppily threw in a murder at the end). He gives us instead 200+ pages of banal dialog and musings on middle-age crisis about sexual identity. My strong advice to Raphael is to stop trying to milk a cow that's long gone dry. It's udder nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"I enjoyed all the other Nick and Stefan but this was big let down and a waist of money.

This is the kind of jazz a professor would like. He/she could instruct us all for hours on the musical effects.

His jokes are short and witty and make me absolutely crack up. We have watched this dvd several times and I laugh at the same parts each and every time. Tosh's delivery is phenomenal.I like to think that his comedy is for the intellectually savy. Most of his jokes start out hitting a large % of the audience and as he goes on less of the audience is following him until there is a small % of people that are still cracking up! Some of his jokes are intellectually hilarious while others are the run of the mill ethnocentric based humor.I recommend this full length dvd to anyone who saw clips of Tosh on comedy central or other stand up spotlights on the artist- Worth the buck!

But it's this stand up special that really got me interested in his work. It's obvious that he is a talented comic mind. He brings jokes full circle time and time again and his style is fairly original. Like Dennis Miller, he is apt to go over a lot heads with his subject manner and his educated style.

The Sunrays bio, which is included with the box set, is very informative on the subject of Murray Wilson, his troubles with the Beach Boys and his attempt to prove his value as the Sunray's leader.

I think Havoc came through on the beats (though not as tight as the old days) and murders Prodigy lyrically. Havoc should think more of himself lyrically because Prodigy has totally lost it. I'm an MC and after listening to the first 3 tracks I could tell he was finished. I could write better lyrics than that the the first month I started rappin, and you can't even hear him. I'm gettin so tired of artists being on one extreme or another. Either their only talkin about the ice and crap, or like Prodigy every verse is talkin about the different ways he's gonna kill you.

The songs that standout are definitely Get Away, The Learning (Burn), Get At Me, Nothing Like Home, Crawlin, and So Long. My best song on the album is Live Foul, which is a mindblowing track produced by Scott Storch, probably one of my best Mobb cuts ever. The rest is not bad, just pretty average. But with this album they once again prove they are one of the best rap acts on the market today. However I am still waiting for them to reach the level of The Infamous again. They keep getting bigger and bigger with every album, I hope they never quit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are U Still Shook?","review":"Yeah Yeah. Yo Dunn. This new mobb joint is somewhat smoother.

Of course they have changed a little since 'The Infamous' but they stay grimey and hardcore. P's rhymes are gritty as always, and Havoc has progressed lyrically and mentally with this album. The beats, as always, are bangin. Songs like 'Pray For Me', 'The Learning (Burn)', 'Crawlin' and 'Get At Me' are classic Mobb.

All of the info in this book - or any baby food book - is available for free if you look for it. Try [...] to start.What I do like about this book, though, is the first half gives lots of good information about getting your baby started on food - frozen vs. fresh, organic vs. non organic etc. I enjoyed all the info and even told my husband he should read it. The recipes are really just clean, peel, cut, steam and puree whatever food you want. Each recipe does tell you what you can add (lemon juice, cinnamon, etc.) for a variation and what other foods to mix it with. The book also tells you what vitamins are in each food and at what age certain things can be introduced.Making baby food is not rocket science.

I can't even say anything good about it... nothing. Half the time the music doesn't even line up with what is going on on stage. And Ben Watkins needs to get a little more energy going. Try going to a Moby concert and you will know what I am talking about. It is a shame because every one of Juno Reactor's albums is great and then they release this total garbage.

Seem to be very good quality though I haven't had a chance to wear them much yet.If I ordered them again, I'd be tempted to go shorter, but I think it's easier to hem them to the correct length than it would be to go shorter and find they are too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"coarse","review":"Within 3 washings the pants became coarse and began to irritate my skin.

I found the poems in \\"Satan Says\\" to be not only startling and brutally honest, but beautifully crafted as well. Her work reminded me greatly of Marie Howe, another female poet writing on (among other things) the body's oft-ignored sensuality even in the face of an abusive world (or family). Her poems seem to fuse the simple craftsmanship and observational talents of haiku with the frankness of Anne Sexton, giving us a treatise as much related to the body, childbirth, sexuality, dying, and aggression as to metaphysics.

While I do notremember much else of the controversial work, the first poem seemedto set the tone for the entire volume with its violent theme of war(the Civil War) and exploiting Whitman's alleged homosexuality witha bit of sexual innuendo. Themes of sex and violence permeate thiswork and, as the title suggests, casts a satanic spell over the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's got to be kidding","review":"Guess he needs the money.

Take Time To Know Her is one of his best albums. Each soulful song brings with it the skill and mastery of a living icon of soul. Feed The Flame should be an anthem for anyone who has ever been truely in love. Cover Me is simple but perfect. I have had this Album and worn it out. Finally, after years of thinking it was out of print, I find it again. My wife of 33 years knew each word to Feed The Flame only because I sang it daily for 33 years. She now hears The Man himself each day. If you have no other album by Percy, make it this one.

All food and drinks heated in the oven are heated well and fast.Gave it 4 stars because the number keypad is covered by the door. There are only 4 buttons outside: popcorn, 1 Minute Plus, Stop/Clear and Start. So to set any timing or food cooking you have to: 1- put the food in the microwave. 2- with the door open set your cooking time and preferences. 3- close the door, 4- press start.This is uncommon way for setting a microwave and it disrupts the typical way of 1- put food in, 2-close door, 3- set cook time, 4- press start.

The 1200 Watt Microwave Oven is powerful/quick and doesn't take up as much space as many other ovens with the same wattage. It works well. It was shipped very promptly and received in good condition. Nice features. The only thing I might choose differently next time I need to purchase a microwave would be to have all features/settings on the exterior panel rather than hidden by the outer door. But, I suspect I'll be used to it by then. Very nice product. Very satisfied. Would recommend to anyone who wants a microwave that can do it all if you want it to -- or just boil a cup of water for tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"LED Started to go after 5 months","review":"I had no complaints about this machine for the first four months (would have been 4 or 5 stars) but I will now have to return it - which is a massive hassle given its size. The LED readout has burned out on two of the vertical bars. It's actual two sequential bars in two columns for a total of 4 sections of the LED that are unreadable. You'd think that might be minor until you realize how often you look at the microwave to tell the time or see how much time remains with your cooking.

But allow a little artistic licence (and that is spelled right, by the way).Bought these blades for a cordless saw so I could cut through tree roots while they were still in soil.Work well but obviously lifetime is somewhat limited in that environment.The Milwaukee 18v reciprocating saw I use them with is v. good too.

My experience is that they simply don't cut. Thought maybe the first one was a factory defect, but worked through all of them and found that NONE of the blades in this pack cut. Tried them in my battery-powered recip, and in the 110 volt recip -- they don't cut. The cheap blades that I got at Big Lots cut a LOT faster and more cleanly.

The father is grumpy, stubborn and self-centred, the mother/step-mother is unbelievably acquiescent to his paranoid demands and the surly teen-age daughter is ... well, a surly teen-ager. Only the timid little boy in the family struck me as sympathtic.So immediately I don't feel overly concerned about the fate of the leads. Add to that a clumsy script, cheap looking effects and a plot you've seen many times before, and there's not much to recommend this one.I wonder if some of the the positive reviews for this are coming from fans of the currently popular television show \\"True Blood\\" which features the talented Stephen Moyer.

An abundance of critical overacting along with a \\"monster\\" made up of a horses head with glued on wings of some sort for \\"special effects\\" made me cringe to the very bitter end (not soon enough). The lead dude suffering from \\"rabies\\" should be ashamed of himself to be associated to such a bad grade c movie. The women on this film never quit screaming & overacting in a vain effort to attempt to make this terrible movie worth while watching. At the end when you see the entire family writhing around in spit, blood and various parts of greenery was nausheating to say the very least.

I suspect that back when Billy and Liza used to play the small bars in Telluride, these two were local favorites however I find the songs on this outing to lack any of the catchiness or hook-laden jams of previous SCI efforts.

The ability to cut steel without all the problems of an abrasive cutoff saw, at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, my unit arrived with multiple flaws. The band saw mounts to the pivot arm at a single point with a single bolt, which is normally the front \\"T\\" handle. The pivot arm appears to have been improperly cast or machined, so that the setup geometry as specified in the manual was impossible to obtain. I considered shims to effect a \\"kluge,\\" but then there remains the second major flaw. The single bolt attachment to the upper case of the saw is not rigid enough. The result is that a small lateral pressure on the saw handle deflects the blade as much as 1/8 inch. Granted, better than hand held, but not acceptable to me. A nice concept, flawed in execution.

Powers is at heart more craftsman than contemporary novelist, which is doubtless why he only published two novels. Wheat That Springeth Green is unlike anything else I've ever read. It's that rare novel that achieves perfection.Joe Hackett, for all his faults, is one of the most fully-realized and sympathetic characters in contemporary fiction. As he matures, so does the book: from his hilariously overblown pretensions at the seminary, to his ennui and malaise as a pastor, to his subtly glorious final redemption.In the final analysis, the book is not so much satire as fable about goodness. Despite being about the life of priests, the book is more a moral fable than a simply Catholic one: it's about how to do good in a world where it all seems futile. Joe Hackett is a cynic, but he's also at heart an idealist and optimist. So is J.F. Powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Great soundtrack!

I've only seen them live once, but I have all their albums and have attempted to see them a number of times. Moxy is an incredibly tight band, and my overwhelming reaction to this album is that it's overproduced to the point where some very good playing is lost in a muddle of production that brings on listener fatigue too quickly. It's hard to care about intelligent lyrics and great songs when they're produced beyond listenability, and that's what happens for me in this album. The songs are solid compositions (and more) and have MF's traditional intelligence, but I cannot recommend the album because the great performances are ruined by the recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the trip to Canada","review":"Being unable to wait for it to be released in America, I went all the way to Ontario to pick up Wood! Okay, so I was already in the neighborhood, but Wood would (no pun intended) have been enough to validate the trip. It's not as good overall as either of their other 2 full releases, but it has some of my favorite songs by Fruvous, like Nuits de Reve, It's Too Cold, and Horseshoes. This album is a lot more rock-and-rolly and a lot more serious than the other 2, and it sadly has no a capella songs. It isn't totally serious, though, and the humorous songs create a really good mixture. Unlike the other albums, though, this one may necessitate the use of a track skip; not every song is great, but the great ones are enough to make this my 3rd favorite album of the past 5 years (behind Bargainville and YWGTTM).

I was wrong. The version that I received, 3 days before Christmas, is in fact the older edition. It is not the amazing gift that I had imagined, in fact, this Amazing Spiderman collection isn't really amazing at all.

Perhaps the blame could be shifted to the editing if there were critical scenes left out that would have made the film's transistions and plausibility smoother. I doubt it. Poor writing for a black comedy with able actors makes for a poor movie that very few actors can pull out of a pit of mediocrity.Sarah Jessica Parker does an excellent job at portraying herself, and Harry Connick Jr. seems a bit confused onscreen at times, I think wondering like myself why he ever let his agent talk him into this role.Harry Connick Jr. lovers: go see Hope Floats or Copy Cat and save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slower than watching my mom write a check at the market","review":"Man, this was one slow movie.

This is one of the best. Robin Williams brings his talent to a well written script that will have you laughing through the whole movie. Okay, so a film about a family going on vacation and everything going wrong is not the most originalplot for a comedy. However, this film does bring some originality to the events we've all come to expect from a vacation comedy. Once things begin to go wrong for this family, the laughs keep coming. From a sewage shower to racoons to obnoxious fellow campers, this is a fast moving, must see family comedy. It is family friendly, but can also be enjoyed by teenagers and adults. If you have ever been camping, then you know all the things that can go wrong, and if you haven't,see this movie to see some of the things that can go wrong, as well as the things that can go right, while laughing your head off."},{"rating":"2","title":"RV rules the roads!","review":"Bob Munro(Robin Williams) takes his family cross-country in a rented RV.

Jojo is the main character I hate she's an arrogant selfish whiny little brat especially when she says after she discovers the rv infront of their house, OMG IT'S YOUR HUSBAND! (yeah no respect). Yes I know it's just a movie for our entertainment and people are going to correct me but still it wasn't funny to me and I think this movie just promotes teenage brats of today, in other words they make 15 year old girls look bad as always.Overall I hate this movie but robin williams is a great actor and I love pretty much all of his movies except this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"I liked the first five minutes, Him with that big RV with the words RENT ME on the side.

He rents an RV and the fun begins . The cast is good and likeable. Jeff Daniels is pretty funny as a fellow RV traveler with his family. All I can say is If you got a good sense of humor this film will make you laugh at times. Some spots more than others but it was never boring. In the end , it was a 4 star ride .

It will never win any awards for artistic merit, best acting or musical soundtrack. As far as family vacation movies go, Vacation with Chevy Chase was, by far, a better package. RV doesn't break any new ground in comedy or story-telling. It doesn't even really showcase Robin Williams like other movies have.However, if you are in the mood for some light-hearted mindlessness, RV will provide 99 minutes of that. The better character in this movie, in my opinion, was Jeff Daniels' Travis Gornicke. The story goes that the actors had to be trained in how to drive RVs - with the exception of Daniels. Apparently, he has his own RV and spends a fair amount of time in it.This movie has a cartoonish quality to it. The characters have a cartoonish quality to them, somewhat overplayed. So lower your expectations, and you may actually get a bit of a kick out of RV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good movie !!","review":"This was a cute movie and at times downright funny !!Great cast, Robin Williams and Jeff Daniels worked well together.The family will surly get a kick out of this RV travel movie that makes good natured fun out of camping and the RV lifestyle...."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will laugh til it hurts","review":"This film is laugh-out-loud funny.

The one big difference in the two movies is Robin Williams is a less funnier Chevy Chase.Every lame worse case senerio you can think of happens in this movie. Everything is very predictible and most of it falls pretty flat. There are a few laughs but they are few and far between. There are alot of sappy family moments too. Most of those moments don't payoff either.Robin is way over the top as he usually is. I think he should stick to his more dramatic roles. I'd recommend renting One Hour Photo to offset seeing this movie. I still think his best work was his first. You can't go wrong with The World According to Garp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call AAA !!! Broken down RV!","review":"Robin Williams has sunk to an all time low with this. It's funny humor if you are under the age of 12. Otherwise, it's ridiculous infantile humor. Plenty of funny flicks like Mel Brooks and Naked Gun that have bathroom humor but can do it in a way where the masses can all laugh and enjoy.

Dex's solos are sick and his searching statements on the title track are reason enough to possess \\"One Flight Up\\", which to my mind is Gordon's finest and most underrated album.

Next comes the mean-spirited, high-browed Passenger Engine who is male, followed by the overly-important, too-busy-to-help Freight Train who is also male. Next comes the too-old, too-tired Rusty Old Engine who is male. Finally, the \\"little engine that could\\" arrives on the scene and she is female.The message my son comes away with is that he should seek women for help because men are too important or too busy to help and elderly can't help.

Subtle negative messages, such as violence in the Three Little Pigs and gender typing in this book, should be discouraged. We, as consumers, can assist in this by buying other books. In this case, there is no author whose feelings will be hurt - it's just a publishing company that is trying to milk this story for all it's worth.

For the new fan, this version includes a reproduction of the original LP artwork and poster. There is also a section from a Who discography that should be interest to all Who fans. (Yes, there are mistakes in it, so be careful.)Although the music hasn't aged as well as earlier Who efforts (for good reason: no Keith Moon and lots of Townshend ennui), there is always something worthwhile to hear in any collection of Townshend songs. That said, the real reason for getting this particular release is to complete one's set of Japanese re-issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard equipment for your CD Player","review":"Although a critical disappointment: \\"Face Dances\\" remains one of the greatest \\"Who\\" albums in their oeuvre. Kenney Jones takes over on drums. Townshend later was quoted as saying the spirit of The Who died when Keith Moon was buried...this is possibly one of the reasons for its failure since Townshend's heart was not in it.

You take it from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"First post-Moon album","review":"This of course was the first studio album by the group following the tragic, but yet unsurprising death of drummer Keith Moon. I was remarkably pleased how well the group forged on without the bombastic batterie of Keith Moon. However, in stark contrast, Kenny Jones' more subdued and more coherent style opened doors for the other band members, especially John Entwistle, to show their own talent for solos. But nonetheless Keith's enigmatic, sometimes heretic drumming style is missed, not because of any lack of talent by Kenny, just because Keith was such an original...no other drummer can come close to his unpredictable-yet \\"fit so right style\\", except maybe E.L.P.'s Carl Palmer or Bill Bruford of the Yes/King Crimson fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST","review":"As I'm an Astley collector I have a different perspective on the Who.The CD WHO'S SERIOUS-The Symphonic Who was masterminded by Jon Astley,the Official Who Archivist,and no less than 6 Astleys were involved.The remaster with the extra tracks is the one I bought and it was so I could get the song Pete's sister in law Virginia inspired,namely \\"Its in ya (Virginia)\\"The song came about when Virginia was asked to play on the \\"...Chinese Eyes\\" album and was not sure whether she could do it as she was not much of a rock fan.

I finally bought a copy on CD for completion sake and gave it a whole listen. While it is better than I remembered, it is still a pretty mediocre affair. I agree with the reviewer who said that the Scoop version of Don't Le go the Coat led to a new appreciation of this song. However, I prefer the Scoop version of that and You Better You Bet. Another Tricky Day is pretty good and Daily Records is an OK example of the kind of songwriting Pete was doing at this point (compare to Guitar and Pen on Who are You). I will be happy to never hear Cache Cache or How Can You Do It Alone again, however.Finally, a correction to the review by Glenn Wall: John Entwistle, not Pete, wrote Success Story from Who By Numbers. Still a great song."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely their worst studio album","review":"There are 2 good songs on this album - \\"you better you bet\\" and \\"dont let go the coat\\". \\"Quiet One\\" is also OK.

Thankfully with CD players I can program in the above 3 songs and not have to listen to all the poor stuff on the rest of the album.Anyone who says that this is a good Who album obviously doesnt get the real Who music that was made, the sixties stuff, Who sell out, whos next etc. With this album it is clear that Townshend is saving his best material for his solo albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Very bad.","review":"C'mon, people. This is awful. It's the freaking Who, for God's sake, without Keith Moon.

But the only reason to buy this album is to help complete your WHO collection. The only really good song is \\"You Better You Bet\\". So unless you are a hardcore WHO fan (like myself) and need to complete your collection, buy something from their earlier days. I recommend \\"Who's Next\\" if you want their best...then go from there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best, But So What?","review":"There are some great songs on here. I really love the version of \\"Somebody Saved Me\\". I think it's alot better than Pete's solo effort on that particular song. This album is really underrated. I think it's because people were hoping for the \\"Next Who's Next\\". This album is not one of The Who's masterpieces, but I think it is one of their vital albums and I think it is a very important piece of their history. Roger's voice was never any better. His roaring voice really comes through on songs like Another Tricky Day, Cache Cache, Did You Steal My Money, and You Better You Bet. Don't Let Go The Coat is a beautiful song that I love listening to. Along with Roger's great voice, the backing vocals were outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been _much_ better","review":"The four new songs on the soundtrack to the film _Quadrophenia_ foreshadowed what this album would sound like--light and poppish and nothing to do with the ambitious thunder of old. \\"You Better, You Bet\\" is charming, and \\"Another Tricky Day\\" sounds like it could have fitted in on _Odds and Sods_, alongside \\"Long Live Rock\\". The rest of it is just forgettable. It isn't Kenny Jones' fault; Pete's heart just wasn't in it anymore. Though maybe it would have been wiser to hire drummers on a song-by-song basis, like the Stones have done to replace Bill Wyman. Townshend should have foisted a _Scoop_ album on Atco to fulfill his contract with them, and saved _Empty Glass_ to combine with the best bits of _Faces Dances_. Definitely not the place for the new Who fan to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish.","review":"The Who should have packed it in with the death of Keith Moon as their following recordings were, well-to be blunt, awful. There are two listenable tunes here You Better You Bet(good) and Another Tricky Day(very good). The rest of 'em are garbage. It seems that Townshend was using most of his good ideas on his solo efforts of the time with little left for the Who. Stick with Who's Next, Quadrophenia, and Who By Numbers. Avoid the post-moon output like the plague...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"There is no point in buying any Who albums from the 80's.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There ain't no gems in here!","review":"Well, uhm, it happens to be true. Pete Townshend wrote some powerful, beautiful stuff for THE WHO BY NUMBERS. I wonder if anyone really understands how moving and how deep that numbers like \\"Imagine a Man\\" and \\"They're All in Love\\" really are? Well anyway, Pete goofed here big time, as did the rest of the band without Keith Moon as their drummer. Sad situation that was. There once was a band called the Who... So although they messed this up big time, there are of couple of funny (yet still pathetic) songs like \\"Cache Cache\\" and \\"How can you Do it Alone?\\" that justify its puny existence. It is sad and quite poignant that the Who had to break down like this, but check out their back catalogue for great material and you'll find that in reality they could have easily stood up to any of the world's greatest bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downward Spiral","review":"With 64 reviews already registered there's not much more to add but to chime in that although devoted Who fans will consume just about anything the band does, this is a Who album you can readily ignore unless you have the rest of their catalog.

I eventually sent my copy to the used bins."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Japanese import version","review":"I ordered this and returned it twice in the past two months - it is not the Japanese version is the miniature album sleeve, but the same MCA version that can be found in any store, and it DOES still have the glitches and skips in It's In You. The have not been corrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"At the time (1981), the Who could have delivered a good hard rock album, but missed the opportunity to show that they were still a force to be reckoned with in the studio. The songs were from Townshend's last good songwriting period (i.e. - \\"Empty Glass\\"), but the arrangements were too light [i.e. - weak]. They seem more appropriate for an early 80's Genesis album rather than a Who album.I remember being glad they were still touring and making music in the early 80s, but looking back now, I wish they had called it quits after Moon died. \\"Who Are You\\" and \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" would have been respectable final statements for the band. At least better than this album and the one after it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad record","review":"Who'd have thought that the death of Keith Moon would result in the death of that sacred institution called \\"A great Who album\\"? Obviously there are other reasons for the conspicuous absence of quality control on post-Moon albums but Moon's high energy drumming is sorely missed nonetheless. Pete, God love him, regressed significantly in the lyric department as is evidenced by the stupidity of \\"Did You Take My Money\\" and \\"Cache Cache\\". One gets the feeling Pete just doesnt care and that the songs he did contribute to the album (with the exception of \\"You Better You Bet\\", \\"Another Tricky Day\\" and \\"Don't Let Go The Coat\\") were rescued from the wastebasket. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New 'Oo","review":"There was a sense of sacrilege amongst many fans when this came out, but Face Dances should be viewed as the work of a different band than the Keith Moon line up. The sound, the feel and the focus were a surprise to many at the time, possibly including the band themselves. This was a band that could have aged well, but unfortunately slipped off the bus into a nostalgia trip. The remastered CD sounds different, not better, and weakens the bottom end from the original vinyl recording.

Worth the time, certainly."},{"rating":"2","title":"as usual, Boyd delivers a terrific story","review":"'Restless' contains two narrative threads, one modern (mid-1970s) and the other circa 1940, that are interlaced as alternate chapters. In the modern segment we had a young mother trying to sort out her life, and is coping with an increasingly odd-acting mother who announces that she is not who she thinks is; in fact she is a Russian-born WW II spy. In the pre-WW II thread we see how this woman became a spy and what sort of spying she actually did. Both narrative threads blend together beautifully; the book is immensely readable. It all comes together with a satisfying conclusion.PS - I admit William Boyd is one of my favorite authors, and 'Restless' is on par with the best of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restless","review":"Excellent book, it keeps you going throughout. It was nice how the author went back and forth from the past to the present changing from daughter to mother. The ending was unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"Over the last twenty years, William Boyd has, for me, been among the most consistent writers of narrative fiction. There have been books that will stand the test of time (New Confessions) and ones that already seem dated (Stars and Bars), but Restless finds him in good form. Boyd, as flexible as ever, turns his attention to the spy genre. We are presented with a double narrative, mother and daughter. The plot is hampered by a slightly overwrought literary device, the mother doling out her diaries at intervals, conveniently allowing the author to flip back and forth in time. Still, Boyd remains a wonderful writer. His characters are incisive, full blooded and captivating, even the ones we're not supposed to like. Boyd, like McEwan, manages the perfect blend of literature and thriller and Restless reads very quickly. That alone is a reason to buy it, but add in the Paris of 1939, spymasters and double dealings and Boyd is on to another winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"How little we know about anyone","review":"Main characters in this book are a single mother with a young son and her relationship with her mother. The daughter fears that her mother is going senile but the mother begins to write the story of her life and hands chapters to the daughter to read.

It took me over a week to get that far, so little did I want to pick it up, in contrast to books usually taking me two or three days to complete.Although the language is uncomplicated I found the characters confusing and boring and really didn't care about any of them.

The daughter's story had no purpose except as an avenue to tell her mother's story, so, needles to say, the characters in her life were irrelevant, annoying, pointless. The mother's story was somewhat predictable, not too surprising. I felt like I was constantly reading about changing buses or walking routes to avoid being followed or Eva and Romers love trysts. It would have been interesting to find out more about Romer, how he came into his normal, upperclass life after killing everyone else and the war was over. After all the killing he did, for him to kill himself in the end was too simple a way to end the book, a let down.

I bought realMyst to see the advanced graphics added to it..ie: Day,Night,Rain,Sun,and special effects. The game is really choppy. I even advanced my system, but it didnt help. I believe you shouldnt have to go any kind of frustration when playing a game and this one had a lot of choppiness and delayed reactions even after I upgraded my system. Too frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"realMYST","review":"Even if you've played the origonal MYST, I strongly recommend the updated version realMYST. You can pan around in this version for a better view of your surroundings. For the visual effects alone, it is worth it. If you haven't played any of the MYST games before, you're really in for a treat. The main attration to the MYST games for me is the total lack of blood and gore: you don't kill and chop off body parts to win the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"realMyst","review":"Not as good as the other two, but definitely worth playing. The Rime age is AMAZING. It makes the whole thing worth playing. The Selenetic Age is another of my favorites. I was also a little disappointed because almost nothing happens at the end, but, thank goodness, there's a sequel. VERY nice graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protector of Magic","review":"This was the most incredible game I have ever played!! Adventure, Emotion, Beauty, Strategy, and a little bit of Horror. The scenery was enchanting, breathtaking. Playing it made you feel like a REAL hero (I sometimes even caught myself nodding and verbally responding to things that were said or done in the game). I recommend this game to anyone, because in this game, you are not only saving the world and the imagination, you are also saving the world of imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"Like everone else I bought RealMyst because I was intrigued with the possibility of fluid 360 degree motion. I have an Athlon600 with 128 meg ram, an aureal vortex sound card, and a Viper II 32meg AGP video card.After speaking with Mattel Inc, it turns out that RealMYST is not compatible with the Viper II video card due to it's Savage chipset. I also need to figure out a way to return an opened game back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Myst or Real Boring?","review":"Captivating the audience with graphics is about all this game is worth. Waste your time figuring out trite puzzles that are about as challenging as learning to count to 10. It gets two stars for graphics. If your looking for eye candy and to throw away 30 dollars, Real Myst is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complaint instead of review","review":"I have Myst and Riven on both Playstation and Mac. I ordered realMYST thinking that it was also for the Mac. Well, I was wrong. It is only for PC's. Myst was the one game that started it all for me on my computer. I have purchased more GAMES through Dreamcatcher and am sitting on pins and needles waiting for Myst Exile. I am heartbroken that I cannot get realMyst for my Mac and I am sure that others are too. Why were we left out? I know that I would enjoy this new version, but I guess I'll never know how great it really may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its pretty, Big Deal...","review":"Yes, the graphics are very good but the game is akin to an interactive painting. And so what about the graphics? Whoopee, most games have good graphics nowadays too but GOOD games have some meat to them. RealMyst does not; it's a very bland game for people who don't like real gaming experiences.After fifty minutes of looking at the pretty pictures, I was bored to tears and began the uninstall procedure. Phooey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if it doesn't run on your machine","review":"I loved Myst and Riven. I was ready to love realMYST but it won't run on my brand new Pentium III system since I don't have the right accelerator card. I talked with Mattel (the real publishers) and they say that it won't run on MOST systems since it requires a high end processor AND a specific graphics.MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT GRAPHICS CARD or it's useless.Sigh, now I have to find a way to return an opened software package..."},{"rating":"2","title":"64mb ram, I don't think so-","review":"This is the most beautiful game- I feel as though i am there, on the island! This game would have recv'd 5 stars from me, however, my 'slow' PIII 550mhz processor, and 64mb ram can barely handle it. I guess its time for a mb ram upgrade, like to 550mb.Absolutely stellar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how MYST was meant to be!","review":"The original MYST started it all. Then came Riven and MYST III: Exile. After completing all three, my curiousity turned to Real MYST. Now why would anyone want to play an updated version of the original? Updated is an understatement. Cyan has once again amazed me. The 360 degree of sight and movement(you don't even get all that with Exile)make it worth playing again. The addition of environtmental features i.e. changes from day to night and weather, make it even more enjoyable to experience again. Oh! Did I forget to mention the addition of the new Rime Age ending? This is the way MYST was meant to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the review above.","review":"This game is great. The review above doesn't do it any justice whatsoever. If you are thinking of not buying it because of this, don't. Buy it, it is a great game. The visuals make the puzzles more fun, and while the difficulty of moving a mouse is a problem, we all already know the story. We have it for the visuals. There is no excuse for Myst fans not to have this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"No English subtitles","review":"I made the mistake of ordering this dvd assuming it contained English sub-titles, but I am woefully disappointed because I don't speak or understand Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but a little impractical.","review":"This cover is well made and launders well, but with a baby who tends to relieve himself while being changed, I was constantly washing them. Changing pads are made with a wipe-clean surface, which is a lot easier than washing the covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Terrific Introduction","review":"If you want to just try out this genre for a while before investing time and $$ on more recordings, this is a great first collection of songs. I have dozens of Brazilian CDs, but this is still one of my most-played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brazil here I come!!!","review":"I looooove all the Putamayo compilations, I think they have great pros who are able to put together cool, smooth sounds of artists that sometimes are forgotten in time, or never made it to mass-distribution. This one is no different and makes me want to jump on the first plane down to Rio de Janeiro!!I own several CDs of their large collection, but I'm always looking for more. I think these CDs also make a great gift for just about anyone who enjoys to have friends over, these make great chill-out background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Exotic Beats Rhythms and Harmony","review":"I was and am a Bossa Nova Neophyte. In May of this year my friend took me to D.C. for my Birthday...in Adams Morgan we ended up in a little club called Bossa Nova....loved the music not to mention the mojitos....I came to this site to find him a little thank you gift and after reading the reviews I chose this CD! I popped it on my iPod and we both love it! I surly cannot give a critique as knowledgable as so many others, however my favorites are Deusa Do Amor, Corres, Preto Cor Preta and Eu E O meu Amor....I cannot see how anyone could be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album of the year","review":"Honestly, before I bought this CD, I didn't even know anything about bossa nova or Veloso. I bought this CD at Kmart based on the album says Brazilian music. I told myself \\"give it a try.\\" I have to say I immediate fall in love with this CD the first time I play it. I don't understand Portugese but the music and the songs are just wonderful. I especially I like Lamento No Morro, Meu Mundo e Hoje, Admiracao and Feitico Da Vila. The CD booklet translated a few sentences of the song into English, which is a big plus for me to understand how romantic the songs are. This album got my highest recommendation. Sit next to my Santana."},{"rating":"2","title":"saves trip to airport","review":"I have purchased CDs from this line in airport gift shops; it was certainly easier and a bit cheaper to buy this one online."},{"rating":"2","title":"dope cd! highly recommended!","review":"this is a must have cd one of the most overlooked rap products ever! believe me u wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Is It????","review":"I would love to review this item...IF I HAD IT! C'mon guys, your departments aren't talking to each other. Thanks anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot for the money","review":"Replaced a 20 year old Kenmore which still worked. Had it a month and so far so good. Love the turntable. Runs quiet. Haven't had any blown fuses.NEGATIVES: Yes the door is loud. It doesn't have a programmable PAUSE(for interim stirring) but the turntable seems to make stirring unnecessary. Also doesn't have timed delayed start. The power cord is too short. Style doesn't work ...the front screen looks like a dented lopsided optical illusion. Night light manages to produce a glare without lighting anything.The crux of things is that it's a powerful spacious multi-functional microwave from an established manufacturer for $100 bucks with free shipping. That's a good deal to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Microwave oven","review":"This is our first microwave upgrade in many years. We are very pleased with the size, style, and options offered by this microwave. We read previous reviews which said they thought the unit was somewhat noisy but we have not experienced that yet, as I would say that this unit is actually quieter than our old one. Cooking/heating time is reduced and we have been extremely happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Door Latch","review":"Presently I'm very upset with Amazon. The microwave arrived on time, but it had a broken door latch. The door could not be opened and thus could not be used. I had to find a service shop through Sharp, and now I'll wait a week for it to be fixed. The man at the shop said for that latch to be broken, the microwave had to be dropped from at least one story. My concern is if the force was strong enough to break the latch, what other damage was done. Stay tuned for further developments. Also, I plan to take the advice of the service man not to buy any electronics or similar products online since he said about one out of ten arrive broken!---About six months after I bought this monster, it caught on fire while I was cooking. I threw it out and that, my many friends, is the end of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"oven incorrectly assembled","review":"The oven arrived with package in tatters. The oven itself seems undamaged, but the door will not close, apparently because it was assembled incorrectly. I returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love all but one thing","review":"I really researched before I bought this microwave. I had owned a Sharp, one of the first carousel type ones, for 21 years, and it still hadn't died, but was slowing down. I knew I wanted another Sharp and had space constraints, so after doing quite a bit of looking, I chose this one. And I am definitely not sorry! I was a bit daunted at first by all the buttons and choices, but the prompts are a huge help, and it really wasn't hard to figure out at all, especially considering my old one had barely any options. The only thing I would change - Sharp, are you listening? is that the door is very loud when you shut it. There are light sleepers in my house, so I find that sometimes, early in the a.m., I have to leave the door hanging open until they wake up! That's the only reason I gave this item a 4 instead of a 5. Performance-wise, feature-wise, you can't go wrong with this microwave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Replacement Microwave","review":"Just recently purchased to replace a late '80's Quasar Microwave/Convection oven, our \\"workhorse oven\\" for many years. The Sharp lives up to it's reputation. Quite a bit smaller, but a nice size for two people or a small family. Fast, multipurpose, good programs, simple to use. Does exactly what it says it will. Simple Users Manual, easily understood. Follow it faithfully. Altogether very nice. We, too, found the noise level of the door, both closing and opening, to be rather loud. You just have to adjust to it. Tried trying to quiet it when it closes and that just doesn't work at all. Don't even go there. Altogether very satisfactory purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for the price","review":"Likes: Good power, nice smooth carousel turntable, presets are pretty accurate, easy to daisychain cooking steps, fairly quiet, the \\"nightlight\\" is actually useful at times.Quibbles: Sorta noisy & hollow-sounding chassis - door clunks open and clunks closed, some of the touchpad buttons could be larger like the Start button, only a single audio signal when done - if you were away and missed it, you wouldn't know without looking at the display flashing \\"END\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"My first copy of this book came to me as a gift from my mentor in college, a Russian historian who travelled through the Soviet Union in the 1970s. It has been one of my favorite books for years because of the writer, John Scott, who went to live in one of Stalin's industrialized towns. He learned first hand how the glorious Soviet system worked and tells his readers all the ups and downs of the process. I found it to a fascinating, first-hand account of the area of history I've dedicated my life to. If you are in any way interested in Soviet history, socialism, or Russia, you should check out this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNHAPPY!!","review":"The reason I ordered this set was because I wanted Deep Blue Sea and Sphere-- well guess what, when my package arrived it ONLY included Deep Blue Sea and Perfect Storm-- I was not a happy camper.

Some intriquing camera angles, image manipulation; close-ups of the cast, who, by the way, are superb at mime. It's a shame that their work confuses the viewer more than entertains him/her.Best bit: Kovacs trouper as \\"Mother Rustic\\", who lives off the land...and relaxes by dabbling in conceptual painting, too far out for The Guggenheim!Main selling-point for this package: Kovac's last show from c. January, 1962. Plus interesting foreshadowings of the popular show Laugh-In.[some racial content, typical of the period]."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cross-disciplinary work","review":"This scolarly work by Dr Jansen takes as its focus the remarkable and strange psycho-pharmacological properties of a substance that is both anesthetic and psychedelic.Psychoactive drugs are a rich source of information about the workings of the mind/brain, and psychedelic compounds in particular straddle a very strange area between notions of mind and matter, or the physical and the spiritual. Their study therefore requires a balanced and multi-disciplinary approach, which Dr Jansen has skillfully managed, by acknowledging the biological, experiential, philosophical, therapeutic and social aspects of this phenomena simultaniously.This cross-disciplinary perspective is what makes this book, despite what may seem a specialist subject matter, of great importance, interest and value to anyone working within neuroscientific, psychotherapeutic and spiritual fields of exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like entering the k-holle while reading this book...","review":"When i began reading this book it was like a flow of information to my brain especiali the midle part of the book.

I'll have to get a 1-piece spit in order to be able to use it again. Other than that, the motor is strong enough to turn an 8 pound chicken so so all in all it's a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill","review":"The split design of the spit is very weak.

Unfortunately, this Rotisserie has one MAJOR FLAW, the spinning rod comes in 2 pieces and the screw that hold them together breaks very easily. After only 2 uses, this rod broke in half. I called Char-broil about the issue and they would not do anything about it. They don't even sell any of the pieces seperately to replace the rod. I've VERY unhappy with this product and would tell you NOT to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to satisfied :-(","review":"I was very diisappointed with this product since I used it twice before it snapped in half.

This is a weak joint and you cannot make it tight without breaking the screw completely off in the other bar. Poor design, weak design. Also, the \\"competed\\" bar is much too long for my Char-Broil two burner grill. In fact, almost a foot too long! This is the Rotisserie that Char-Broil recommended on their web site for this grill.

The writers and director made conscious decisions about the cinematic styles for each era, and even though none of the stories was very long by necessity, they brought the moment into the light and gave you enough for you to hang your imagination on. They went for edgy and succeeded in some ways with stories about love, betrayal, beginnings and endings. The stories are told through the characters' actions and dialog, and you're allowed to draw your own conclusions about what went on after.I liked Century Hotel, it was a fine freshman effort that came in under $750,000. The DVD is nicely done, with a commentary track that is a tiny bit pretentious, but overall they do have a few things to say about the film. The short \\"Moon Palace\\" was worth the cost of the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early work of Anne McCaffrey that shows her potential","review":"This gothic romance/ mystery is one of my all time favorite books.

This is not surprising because I live in east London, where West Ham United Football club is located. It is difficult to explain to an American reader what it means to support an English football club - as Korr explains, it is inconceivable that an English football team could be reocated from one side of the country to another (as happened to the Brooklyn Dodgers) and still attract any support. It is a triumph of Korr's book that he can appreciate the similarities between the principal working class sports in the two counties and at the same time highlight the very real differences.

You also have to say your \\"password\\" twice to confirm it and each time you have to say it exactly the same way. Then when you open the journal with your password, you have to say it the exact same way as when you initially did it. Frustrating is an understatement. I'm 27 years old and consider myself fairly good with electronics, but as of yet I have been unable to figure this thing out. DO NOT BUY THIS!

A combination of 812 filter with UV Sigma filter reduces this effect and, actually, makes skin color look more natural, I'd compare that combination with Cokin 81C filter. The Tiffen 812 transparency is about half stop, what adds a bit contrast to your pictures. The filter (62mm) well made and did not give a vignetting at 18mm focal length (with Sigma 18-200mm lens) even with UV Sigma filter on.

My personal first experience with violin in a band such as this is with Tristania. In this reviewer's opinion, this band is on a higher level to Tristania, in terms of their integration of the haunting sounds a violin can produce - though this album's sound is truly different than any of Tristania's.The vocals are truly masterful, bringing the words to dance upon the darkest of minds in a deathly beautiful ballet of melody.

Of course I'd say my favorite thing that My Dying Bride has put out, has to be \\"I Am The Bloody Earth,\\" but that's just in my opinion, since I also like deathmetal.

Purchasing it will only taint your possible enjoyment with recurring bouts of \\"I paid for THIS?\\". Less than half of the book deals with old, favorite characters, and their story line is left unresolved and undeveloped. The other half deals with a disjointed story of vampires and machine people that is exceedingly boring and uninteresting.

Nothing muchhappens in the first half of the novel, with the main characters from the previous two Ringworld novels appearing briefly, if at all.Things start happening in the second half, but by then it's too late, and the results seems to have been rushed -- especially the ending, which I had to re-read a few times to figure out what happened (or more precisely, what didn't happen).This novel should have undergone a major rewrite before publication, eliminating most of the first half and expanding on the second. As it stands, it's a major disappointment which adds little to the mythos of Known Space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a patch on the first two....","review":"The first two ringworld novels were great, and I had read pretty much all of LN's work up to 10 years ago.

I assumed that this was due to the length of time it is since I read the first two Ringworld titles, but the other comments here suggest that I just wasted my time.No plot, the book rambles along and the ending leaves you thinking 'so what'. Not much is revealed about the Ringworld apart from serial 'rishing'. The first few hundred pages is irrelevant to the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the others before you try this one!","review":"Larry starts this sequel as if it really was chapter 3 as opposed to being Book 3. He doesn't waste one line on pre-history: who is Louis Wu? Who is the Hindmost? Why do we care? He doesn't give us a chance to remember all of the characters, why they're there, what roles they play or enough background to get a footing for a long time. He throws Machine People, Grass Giant and Red People names at us like we're supposed to remember 5-syllable science fiction names just like that! Couple that with a story that doesn't really begin until after page 225, and you have to be a real Niven nut (which I am!) to want to finish it.Typical of Niven lacking a solid, satisfying ending; we really deserved a neat wrapped package and we didn't get one.Even though I rabidly await each new Niven title, I must say that I'm underwhelmed on this one.

Unfortunately, it was terrible. The plot is very disjointed and thrown together. There are at minimum two unconnected stories. The first concerns a group of vampire hunters. Louis Wu is largely absent for that part of the story. Most of the first half is spent with the reader wondering why any of this is important. The second half of the novel concerns Louis Wu and some protectors. I won't spoil the plot for you, but suffice it to say there is almost nothing new in either of these plots. You simply don't care what happens to the characters. Good grief, I don't want to ever read about another protector again."},{"rating":"1","title":"As if the first two of the trilogy never existed.","review":"This reads like the work of an author who wrote two excellent books, then took some time off during which he explored funky religions and had an \\"awakening.\\" The book opens slowly and pokes along, He inroduces many characters with interchangeable names. \\"Rishathra,\\" interspecies sex for treaty building etc. got small billing in the first two novels.

Having read many other Niven works, I recognize this likely to be in the vein of 'write a book, fulfill a contract, get whining fans off my back;\\" tired successful author, minimal involvement. Certainly, the possibilities were nearly endless to develop a good plot, embellish the story with excellent scene descriptions, characterizations, and drama. Unfortunately the experience of the actual read is akin to reviewing overly long Cliff notes...disjointed, major point highlights, skim through, etc. Such are the sad realities when a long career draws near an end, perhaps.

You find out more about the Ringworld, the protectors and it sets things up nicely for more adventures in Ringworld and moving Ringworld into known space. It fills in a lot of details.The first and second part of the books seem rather contrived in their connection and are almost two seperate stories. The protector bit is overdone.

Everytime I would read a chapter I would re-read it thinking I missed something the first time. The story, of what there is of it, is hard to follow. I feel really bad for the people who never read the first two Ringworld books. So if you haven't read Throne don't bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dismal ending to a fantastic saga.","review":"Ringworld, like the story which introduced it, WAS a cornucopia of mystery, adventure, science and diversity. Those attributes added to the rescue story, Ringworld Engineers. Sadly, in Ringworld Throne, the story centers around sex, mysteries are rapidly explained, and only a few chapters show Niven's expected flair. Where we expected a scrith ring, we find only a neon arch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book sat on my bookshelf for three or four years. For some reason, I couldn't bring myself to read it, even though I read several of the Niven-inspired Man-Kzin Wars collections, and even re-read several of the Known Space novels. When I finally decided to read it, I initially thought my disappointment was due to the length of time that had passed since I had read The Ringworld Engineers. I couldn't follow much of the descriptive passages, and found myself losing interest while reading.Upon reflection, however, perhaps I was expecting to read something other than what Niven wrote. That is, I was expecting a science fiction yarn featuring some of Niven's better characters. What I found was not science fiction but \\"engineering fiction,\\" and the attention to the characters reflected an engineer's sensibilities.I wish I could more highly recommend this book, but I cannot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Ringworld book","review":"Not up to classic Niven. If you desperately need a fix of Ringworld, well, maybe, but my suggestion would be to go back and re-read the original. This one does have some neat stuff, but it (minor spoiler) does invalidate some of the moral dilemma of the previous Ringworld book, and for the most part doesn't add any interesting ideas.Definitely this is NOT the book to start with-- this is a minor Niven book, for hard-core Niven fans only! If you haven't already read Ringworld, you have a major treat in store-- don't start here, but immediately go buy a copy of Ringworld and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood","review":"I could not finish this book the first time I read it. It was dissappointing and frankly I kept falling asleep. However, and I cant stress this enough, this is a good SECOND read book. I ended up reading it again just this past week. Curioustiy and just a want for more action on the Ringword drove me to try reading it again. At first it seems a little different because this book doesn't concentrate on one single character, but more on the people of the Ringworld and what they're trying to accomplish. All of those who thought that the original Ringworld was flat with underdeveloped Ringworld natives would love this book. Also, all those readers that couldn't put down Ringworld, stick this one out. I promise you you will enjoy this book once you get through it. It takes patience though. I hope you'll enjoy it the second time around like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After enjoying the first two books of this series (Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers), I was looking forward to learning more about this engineering marvel. What a disapointment. This book did nothing for me. I kept waiting for a climax that never came. It was ho-hum throughout the entire book. I wanted more - and was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eagerly Awaited...Hugely Disappointing","review":"I have never written a review before, but I am compelled to in this case. Larry Niven has always been one of my favorite authors, mainly due to his Known Space series of books and short stories. However, this book was a major disappointment...it was as if someone else wrote it. The book was a bore...poorly developed characters, sub-plots dying out, and the main plot just plodding on and on. If I didn't like the book, I just wonder what those who don't know anything about the Known Space history would make of it. Basically, Niven gave me no reason to have any interest in the characters or the plot. I hope he does better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Trust me, the best thing about this book is the cover. Although I enjoyed the first two books in the series (with my preference being the first one) I simply could not get into this book. The characters were totally undeveloped and I had no concern for any of them. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hated this book!","review":"Whatever happened to Larry Niven? When I first got into science fiction about15 years ago, it was Larry Niven's stories I always went back to after reading something terrible, just to remind myself what great stories were like. Does anyone else still remember the feelings they had as they read Footfall, The Legacy of Herot, Lucifer's Hammer or the first Ringworld novel? I sure do, and it was incredible! But let me tell you something; the gig is up. After reading this piece of trash, I couldnt bring myself to touch another Larry Niven work for months. And then when I did, it was a book that was even worse: Children of Beowulf (or whatever its called). I'd like to make a deal with Mr. Niven. If you promise to delete these books from the publisher's catalog, and NEVER speak of them again, I promise to spend my money on your next book. Deal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bowl of rehashed, 3-day-old fish, it's a stinkpot","review":"The Ringworld Throne is a 417 page rehash of the previous Ringworld novels. And, like a bowl of rehashed, three-day-old fish, it's a real stinkpot. It contains no new ideas. It has the same tired old plot theme: Against all odds, Louis Wu saves Ringworld. That only takes Niven about ten or twelve pages, counting all the times he repeats himself. The other four hundred odd pages are mostly devoted to poorly written, offbeat sexual encounters that contribute absolutely nothing to the story. Worse, they aren't even titillating. Those bad sex scenes were quite apropos, though, as Niven dedicated this book to Robert Heinlein (an insider joke?). In his dotage, Heinlein also resorted to writing offbeat, bad sex scenes instead of science fiction. This book would seem to cry out that Larry Niven was fresh out of money and fresh out of book ideas. Even so, he should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-read Ringworld instead...","review":"Everything that made Niven novels (Ringworld, The Intergral Trees, Footfall...) such great reads is missing from this book. Don't ruin it for yourself, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhhh...","review":"The first Ringworld novel was great, but it just went down from there.

After seeing a few attempts at plot summary, I recalled that the answer was \\"yes,\\" but that the novel was so difficult and unfulfilling that I completely lost all memory of the reading experience. Coming from an avid Niven fan: avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Niven's worst book","review":"Larry Niven is one of the best living SF authors, but he bombed out here. The only thing saving it from the horrible 1-star rating is the fairly exciting first half of the book. Notably, this did not feature Louis Wu, who even in the classic novels Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers seemed to be mainly a window through which the reader could see the real hero, the Ringworld itself. The second half dealt entirely with Protector politics. Had I not read the excellent Destiny's Road, I might have given up on Niven entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Weekly World News instead","review":"Niven exhausted his ideas on Ringworld a book and a half ago. What a shame, because the notion of a \\"planet\\" with 600 million times the surface of earth could have so much potential - you'd think the stories could never run dry.What luck that my cat wizzed on my copy halfway through - I tossed it out and never looked back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Awaited Book Disappointing","review":"I've been a fan of Larry's Niven's work for years, and I barely recognized his style in 'The Rinworld Throne'.There seemed to be many inconsistancies in the storyline, and details that went against the previous books.There is also very little mention of the previous storylines--anyone unfamiliar with the Ringworld, its technology, and its inhabitants will stay that way.Read the first two books and stop there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Larry Niven go?","review":"Larry Niven is one of my favorite authors. However, I'm beginning to wonder if space aliens have kidnapped the real Niven and replaced him with a robot. A robot with few, if any, of the real Niven's writing skills.The orginal \\"Ringworld\\" is wonderful, and \\"The Ringworld Engineers\\" is a more than worthy sequel. \\"The Ringworld Throne\\", however, is a major disappointment. How could this have possibly been written by the same author?I read this shortly after having read \\"Beowulf's Children\\" and I was equally as disappointed with that book. The original in that series, \\"The Legacy of Heorot\\" was top-notch Niven. \\"Beowulf's Children\\" didn't seem as if it could have possibly come from the same pen.Which brings me back to my original point. Space aliens, what have you done with our Larry Niven and when are you going to bring him back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst book I've ever read","review":"Having read and enjoyed Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers, I hoped for a suitable conclusion to the trilogy. Instead I found a boring, unintelligible tale with new characters being introduced late in the book. Larry Niven must have had a wire in his brain, because he writes here as if he were high all the time. His original concept was masterly. I would say Engineers advanced the plot. This culmination leaves many more questions than answers, and I forced myself to get through it, just out of principle. I liked or at least had some sympathy for the main characters earlier in the series. The cardboard cutouts introduced in this book I could care less for. Even the surviving characters from the earlier books lost my interest and sympathy. This is not the normal tailing off to be expected as a series continues on. This is a plunge into the abyss of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the worst Known Space book.","review":"Being a fan of Larry Niven's Known Space and particularly liking the character of Louis Wu, a return the Ringworld seemed like an ideal book. Unfortunately, Larry Niven provides a book that is tepid at best, filled with astounding mental leaps by the main characters and poor characterization, where it exists at all. This book felt like an afterthought, and does not even rate \\"airplane reading\\" quality. Check it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is written with great respect for Larry Niven, just not for this book","review":"It's worthless. Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers are science fiction classics. This is a muddled half-book of interspecies sex and random wanderings. Niven has written other good works since this one, so let's just call it an off-book, and move on. Nothing to see here.P.S. It annoys me though that the professional, established reviews were relatively positive for this book. Could they not say that Niven missed this once and move on too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book is not worth reading. Half of the book is devoted to random ringworlders who dont matter and develop the plot in no way. I could not stand to read about nasty alien sex every three pages. I skipped almost every chapter not involving Louis or Acolyte (Chmee's son, who could have been an interesting addition but sadly was not). It made the book almost bearable. Overall you can skip this book and not miss anything. Here is all you need to know.- There is a vampire protector in charge of the repair center.- He sucks at his job- Chmee has a son, Acolyte, whom he sent to learn wisdom from Louis.- Louis decides that ghouls would make a better protector than a vampire- He arranges it so that a ghoul becomes a protector and and overthrows the vampire protector- This book sucks"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read the others, you have to read this one","review":"That is the ONLY reason to read it, too. His plot is thin and his characters are stale. Still, if you made it through the first two, you will find some closure in this one. (At the very least, you can say you read them all.) The science behind his fiction is so close to scientific possibility that something always brings readers back to see what he has dreamed up next.Pity Niven lacks punch when her writes on his own. His book with Pournelle are stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrong World","review":"An incomprehensible, amateurishly written and thoroughly dull effort.

I am adding my voice so you avoid wasting your money and time on this book.

The first 1/2 of the book is interesting, but doesn't really pertain to the overall story. The second half of the book stunk, and made me wonder if there really was any point to the book.

What I mean is that the book itself really isn't about day to day life in the navy or funny stories from being at sea during the cold war. As a matter of fact, I don't recall ANY stories that took place at sea, this book really revolves around stories of drunken foolishness when on liberty in foreign ports (and to be fair, a good amount in Florida and other US cities too).

This is an account worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy fantasy and poetry this book is for you","review":"The author is highly imaginative and tells a lot about her own life in this mish mash. We never learn much about Daisy Bates. the author writes \\" her body shudders like a dying rabbit and her new husband wakes and stares at his new wife...\\" But the author is really describing her own childhood dream of an old man with his legs wrapped around her neck!!! Blackburn's \\"very personal interpretation\\" of the life of Daisy Bates seems to include Blackburn trying to overcome some of her own childhood traumas and problems with men. If little is known about Daisy Bates' feelings towards her husband, I'd rather have that than a lot of silly conjecture and fantasy. The prose is very good, very flowery and high flown, but it doesn't help tell the story of Daisy Bates. Like other reviewers, I will have to research Daisy, yes even after reading her \\"biog\\". It didn't feel balanced at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject.....resulted in disappointing book","review":"I read this book for my reading group, and if it hadn't been the \\"assigned\\" book for the month, I would not have finished it. I was initially enthusiastic about the book because of its unique setting, and Daisy Bates sounded like an interesting character. Like most of my reading group's members, I was disappointed in the writer's treatment of Daisy's life. She failed to provide sufficient details to form an interesting and cohesive story. I found myself skimming through much of the book because I didn't really get to know Daisy well enough to care about her as a character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor hybrid of the author's life & a biog. of Daisy Bates","review":"Too much novelistic improvisation and repetition ruin this book. Julia Blackburn is clearly more interested in Julia Blackburn than in Daisy Bates. Julia Blackburn's ideas and dreams are constantly inserted just when you think you might get to read something about Daisy Bates! Julia Blackburn presents Julia Blackburn as a dreamy, visionary person, while describing Daisy Bates as a Liar over and over and over again, and then giving Daisy an \\"imaginary\\" life... It could have worked if Julia Blackburn weren't so in love with herself--- I bought this book because life among the Aborigines sounded interesting. But it's really too much about Julia Blackburn and she bores me. I read a lot of novels, biogs, poetry, and history, and this books tries to capture it all and while at times it is eloquent, it often feels false and flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless movies","review":"My whole family love them, so much imagination and adventure, specially the children, fun and exiting, all 3 movies are fantastic"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movies are Great cant wait till 3 comes out in 2011","review":"The store I bought it from refunded me right away because it wasnt in stock as they had thought, so I cant rate them for something I never got, but I may do business with them in the future because of their honesty and quick response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parks and MacDonald","review":"I've heard that Walter Parks and Laurie McDonald (the producers) have now distanced themselves from these movies, It is easy to see why with no laughs and b-movie Rick Baker effects, these films are not real movies, they are a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"reviews of MIB and MIB-II","review":"The movies are great and rate five stars.

They come face to face with a beast that shares a connection with one of them.The good news is that the costume design is great. For being a low-budget flick, the overall video quality was better than most Redbox movies.The bad news is that the movie is just boring. Lots of mediocre acting, laughably bad animal scenes, minimal gore, and the most annoyingly emo monster in film history. The romantic dialogue is corny, and the film's pacing is awful. To make matters worse, Amazon and IMDB both are completely littered with fake positive reviews for the film.Beauty and the Beast has left the building. Normally I'd suggest that people rent a movie before deciding to buy it, this is one occasion when I'll suggest passing on it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVED YOU LIKE A STUFF ANIMAL","review":"Three girls and a guy (2 couples) crash their car due to a blow out. The guy (Jared Edwards) gets injured while being outside the car and has a spike in his neck. His girlfriend springs into first aid action and applies the proper first aid, something rarely done in movies. She even constructs a stretcher out of skis and a sleeping bag. Meanwhile there is a porcupine man (Edward Gusts in the title role) running about who speaks in poetic lines.The movie is a weird Beauty and the Beast love triangle. As it turns out Spike and the girl (Sarah Livingston Evans) were childhood friends who became separated. The movie is boring and shot at night so the scenes at fairly dark. While there are a total if 5 characters in the film, he centers around 2 of them. You keep waiting for something to happen, but it is more of a drama than a horror.F-bomb, 2 girls briefly kissing, nudity (Sarah Livingston Evans), no sex thank goodness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had so much potential","review":"Stars are for the guy playing Spike and the makeup artist. Otherwise, this is slow, dull, and we are never told how Spike came to be, how he knew the girl he apparently grew up with, what became of his parents, or how he can even sleep covered in all those spikes.Quoting from classic lit romance stories does not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waist of time","review":"What a waist of time and a really cool spike costume. Who is it that thinks this is a good movie ? The only way you could write up a good review for this junk is if you worked on the movie, other wise I just call B.S. on any review higher then 2 stars. This is one of those \\"Monster\\" movies that is better left in the shadows and not in the light as you can plainly see this lame actor is wearing a costume with no make up. Why would you use a bright light in every other scene to light up every flaw in the costume and not use a little make up to blend it all in ? It really is worth seeing just so you can point and mock at the sad final cut. If your are not into seeing poor film making, bad acting and shoddy story telling stay away from this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you watch- make sure you are spiked first!","review":"Let me start by saying I love my spouse. However, the rental of this movie (and I use the term movei lightly) would hold up as grounds for divorce in any court of law! Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. No acting, no plot, no coherent story line- you get the drift. I suppose if you are a liberal who is stoned or drunk, you might enjoy this. Suffice to say, if you want to be creative for Christmas- forgo the lump of coal in the sock and stick this in there instead!

After trying these in December, I decided to order a whole case! It took over a month to get here...and now I know why.They taste like some VERY VERY watered down coffee - mixed with DISHWATER. Yes, I would have to say that these are now the WORST coffee candies I have ever had. If you happen to have any made in 2006, you should savour them because that's the end of them.I just scraped off the new label so I can tell you the original ingredient list: Sugar, glucose, milk powder, coffee extract, coffee flavor, vegetable oil, salt, caramel.If your first ingredient is Glucose Syrup (tapioca)...then put them right back where you found them. You will be wasting your money & insulting your tastebuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Grossest Coffee Candy Ever - YUCK!!!","review":"I've tried numerous coffee candies and this is by far the worst I've ever had.

Using this with the Nizoral has started me in the right direction for obtaining a healthier scalp with less irritation and dandruff compared to using Head & Shoulders (NEVER AGAIN!). I really have no complaints about the smell what so ever and was surprised at how good this shampoo was at foaming considering it is without sulfates.

I have psoriasis on my scalp and I have to alternate shampoos regularly. I also have really long hair that requires a great deal of care. Upon first impressions of this shampoo I really hate the smell. I almost did not try it. I read where some people did not need to use a conditioner as the shampoo left their hair very soft. I did use conditioner on my hair (on the ends) since it is really long (almost waist length and I am 5'8\\"). I have since used this shampoo each time I wash my hair for the last few weeks. I have noticed a significant difference. My hair is softer than usual and remarkably my psoriasis has greatly improved (it has not cleared completely, but close).

Ironically and frustratingly apart from this the photos were superb - excellent colour and sharply focussed. I took the camera back to the shop where they had it repaired (taking 3 weeks!) and the defect was removed. I have to say I have been very pleased with my photos since.

Thats just the nature of the game.Add to it if you get a lame recording, like the BBC, you get junk.I have ran this BBC through all types of media, high end, and even the Ipod of myself and others, just flat bad.The younger gen today, I used to try and play it for them, it was ALWAYS, um, ok man, thats like okay, if you say soooooo.well it was all there was for live.

I do like hard rock , which is the music Led Zeppelin are usually classed as, so I like to think I know what I'm talking about.

The live version of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" on this compilation is not for the faint of heart! It will remind you why Led Zeppelin were rock giants among pure amateurs. What other band could take one song, pull your heartstrings and then bludgeon you over the head with sheer rock power... and make you love it!This CD set finally sets to rest the \\"Zeppelin as Heavy Metal\\" argument. They were NOT heavy metal. This is louder than loud amplified blues, yes, but it is their live show that displays their unbelievable dynamic breadth. The band was more rock and roll than it was \\"Sweet Leaf.\\"If you have ever been a doubter of their music after these long years, please at least give this a listen. Live, the Zep weren't FM radio superstar darlings. They were a bunch of guys who happened to make great music when they go together. Here, it sounds like they are just enjoying playing together- no record charts, nothing and everything to prove.It's unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Powerful","review":"I have long been an advocate of \\"Song Remains The Same\\", Zeppelin's other live album. It's polished to the point of calculated versions of stadium filling Zeppelin was, and still is one of my favorite albums of all time.So upon first listening to this immense collection of almost bootleg quality live early recordings, I was kinda put off. But after a few times listening, I began to weed out all the filler that this 150+ minute set contains. And what was left was actually quite powerful.In contrast to the \\"tired but proud\\" performances on \\"Song Remains\\", BBC boasts several firewalled and shakey performances of pre-superstardom Zeppelin.You keep waiting for all the wheels to come falling off, but they never do. This is pure energy. They are months away from all the money and fame, and what you hear is the hunger.So while, \\"Song Remains the Same\\" will always have the nostalgia value to me, I have to recommend this one over it. It's the \\"real\\" Zeppelin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Early Led Zeppelin","review":"Led Zeppelin where one of the greatest live rock n roll bands in the history of rock n roll. When they played the BBC they where very young all seeking to write songs. On the CD their are alot of blues jams in the process. Their are the same old songs as well as Communication Breakdown, and Dazed And Confused. I think this CD really is a great studio (live) recording.

This at first look, looks like a cheap comeback effort and something that you dont really want. When I first saw it I thought this was gonna suck because its all the same songs I already have, but you have to listen to the album to believe how great it is. It became my favorite zeppelin album because it shows the zep live as something that you cant capture on a studio album. It also proves that Jimmy page is the king of guitar and improvasation. I love jimi and think he is great too but listen to this album and Page will blow you away.

The first CD offers you the band ant the begining when its first two records were released. The performance are raw and powerful. Also, you have the opportunity to hear the band in various broadcast and this gives you the songs in alternate versions. The second CD is a more sophisticated band. Their sound is more elaborate but still powerfull and covers material from their third and fourth albums.Listener must be aware that this is not a concert album but a collection of live BBC broadcasts. This means that you have repeated songs in the same CD. Nevertheless, Live at the BBC is as good as Led Zeppelin could deliver and promises not to dissapoint rock fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zep BBC sessions","review":"If for no other reason buy it for John Bonham's powerhouse drumming.

At least there should have been a disclaimer anytime those images were shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staying groomed","review":"This product does better job of keeping my fine & thinning hair inplace after shampooing & combing, than any other product I've everused, & goes on without any sticky feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consort Hair spray regular hold","review":"the price is a little high, but, it is what I wanted. Trying to find regular hold over the counter is becoming harder and harder. I like the way it holds during the day and through the nigit, and in the morning, the way my hair combs out nice and easy almost as if there was no hair spray in my hair at all.P.S. I don't like extra hold because in the morning my hair feels like a tangled web when I first try to comb it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I used it for years and I am very satisfied with the product.

I grew older with the pleasant scent of Consort but where I live now, no stores keep it on the shelve let alone even know what it is. So I order my favorite SCENTED Consort through Amazon and it seems the UPS codes are screwed up at Amazon and I keep getting the UnScented Extra hold instead. This review is intended to shake up the cage over at Amazon and not to undermind the Consort product. It's not the first time Amazon has screwed up and the hassles involved with the expense of return and time wasted is never compensated for by Amazon. So There!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive","review":"My husband and I have found it difficult to find this item through normal pharmacy channels.

A real scholarly work that deserves much more attention that it has received so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"River City High Matures...?","review":"I remember seeing these guys when they first got things going, and their sound completely blew me away. Unfortunately, my then 16-year-old ears had yet to hear TRULY amazing music; but that aside, they were a fun listen and James has an interesting voice in punk music. The four-song demo I paid five dollars for really showed some promise, and so a few years later, I picked up their major label debut. The songwriting talent I heard in \\"Starcrossed\\" and \\"I Wish On Every Nickel\\" was replaced with radio-friendly, pop-punky, harmonized, three-minute \\"I've heard this one a million times\\" songs. In all fairness, this is a hard-working band, and RCH puts on a fun live show. But with the exception of a few songs (\\"Left Behind\\", \\"Runaround\\"), this effort is disappointing and far short of its capability. Pass on this one and keep an ear out for a new RCH sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful jem even with a slight flaw.","review":"This CD set is an affordable and enjoyable way to get aquainted with Ponchielli's masterpiece, however there is a catch to it's unusual price: you should be aware that it is a live recording of a 1979 San Fransisco Opera Production which unfortunatly produces a recording quality that sounds like it was done in 1939. I recommend the recording because of the fact that it \\"is\\" live. There is a certain sence of excitment to hear the stage action (i.e. footsteps, doors slaming, etc...). In addition, to the best of my knowledge, there is no formal recording with this all star cast, and as one would expect, the performers are fantastic - just be for-warned that the recording quality is not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous little historical reference book","review":"I love this chunky little book. While it is true that this hardcover fits in the palm of your hand, it contains 664 pages. I've lost track of the number of times that I've reached for my copy to not just check on a specific date or event, but to read through to get the feeling of a period. It is well organised sequentially by year (starting in 38,000 B.C.) The significant events of an entire year are covered in a paragraph of less then a page, with significant milestones in architecture, art, literature, and music set off with icons immediately afterwards. Moreover, there are very complete lists of rulers, discoveries and explorations, major wars, and inventors listed in convenient tables in the back. While the print is small , it is not ridiculously so- and there is ample room in the margins for your own notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Published in 1997 or 1977?","review":"This book was very nicely illustrated and the directions were well written.

We are in the realm of the true belcanto: that which Bellini had in mind at the time that he wrote this masterpiece. The singing of Eglise Gutierrez is a throw-back to the grand days of the true belcanto singers of the past. Her piano-singing seems so easy! I recommend this DVD very highly; either to avid opera-lovers or to people new to opera; or to this opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Go Back to Tradition","review":"I love La Sonnambula, I love all Bellini Operas. That long arching line of his arias thrills me to the core. This recording is one to listen to but not watch. The chorus is good, Mei is beautiful, the others do a adequate to good job but the production is painful. The other reviwers were correct and perceptive in their comments, lovely music but ugly production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfection","review":"I am comparing this to the nightmare MET HD version. This is a charming and beautifully staged opera with traditional staging in a quaint Swiss village. I have to admit that Gutierrez is going to be the next coloratura soprano STAR. Unfortunately the tenor role played by Siragusa is mediocre. Let's get Florez and Egise Gutierrez together in this opera. Then we will have perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Laughs)","review":"I cant believe that G-Unit is using GTA: San Andreas' as a \\"sample\\" for their new mixtape. This CD sucks when I got it bootleg, and thats all I have to say. And also... G-Unit sucks. As for using San Andreas, the rap is ten times better in the game because it includes N.W.A., Dr. Dre, Compton's Most Wanted and Ice Cube. And for the rock, Soundgarden, Faith No More, Helmet, Alice In Chains and Guns 'N Roses. So, if you want real music, listen to the rap and rock listed above, and if you have this album burn it and put out the fire by pissing on it. Or just use it as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff.","review":"Well this still sounds as fresh as this genre can possibly sound even though this was actually finished and ready for release more than 2 years ago...Record company dilemmas created the delay..Nice to hear they have left alot of that prog/breakz thing alone with this one and concentrated more on powerful melodies instead.This style when bad is really bad and not to mention bloody boring unless you are flying but this cd is fantastic at any time of day and in any mood ..Well done WOW..And also to the earlier comment about the use of a sample from \\"Autumn leaves\\" from a songColdcut made a few years back..In actual fact Coldcut stole this sample as well as it is off a single from the 1970's for which the name escapes me right now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the Effectstasy","review":"An album whose brilliance, like Talmud, becomes increasingly evident with familiarity. Mindcircus and Intensify give Domination--still WOW's best track ever--a run for its money. The tightest, smartest and most emotive lyric-driven trance album ever produced by humanoid life forms. Just as in defining a state (Weberian or Westphalian), regardless of where you fall the name of the best trance artist out there now necessarily begins with a W: Warren or Wisternoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfection!","review":"This is one of the best albums you will ever listen to. If you think otherwise, your taste in music must be tainted. I did not like all of Way Out West's debut album from 1997 (wonderfully titled Way Out West), but I did love their ingenius productions and sweet sounds.Then, after many a long wait for WOW fans, Intensify, this album, is released. And it is magnificent. There is only one song I have a dislike for, and that is Intensify (part 2). But.. this is only due to my general disdain for choppy breakbeats. (Just a personal preference, folks)The album is like a journey thru the minds of two brilliant producers and disc jockeys, bringing us the urges to dance, relax and dance again! Whether you are 14 or 41, or anywhere between, buy this album!(My mother (47), co-worker (39) and friends (18-28) all love Way Out West. Try it, ya might like it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More on the Mellow side of UK Trance...","review":"This is a Great cd in many ways and as a DJ it is not something that I would buy to play at a party.

If you want something to dance to, get a dance complation becasue this cd is not for you... this is a masterpeace, for the listening pleasure....I gave it 5 stars since you don't see great cd's like this with Great original production....More complations now days....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative and Uninspired","review":"I am not impressed with this album. I had heard an excerpt of 'Mindcircus' on iTunes, and had imagined that the song in its entirety would be massive. On the contrary, cheesy female vocals interlock a repetitive (if otherwise decent and catchy) piano hook. The use of middle-Eastern inspired tunes on 'Secret' is also very uninspired, and midway through the song the beat changes in a way that makes me really just want to stop dancing and put on something cheesier, as long as it had a tighter beat.Very upsetting. This is not an album I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tunes, nothing irritating, just let spin away","review":"Solid beats and future sounds make up for a little repetitiveness, though if your like me, a little editing is required to grab the \\"good\\" tunes from the mediocre ones (fading in and out of the continuous song). And a little \\"hall\\" effect couldn't hurt either. not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live Up to the Hype","review":"I really regret purchasing this cd. Intensify is about the worst trance anthem I've ever heard. If you like DJ Tiesto, Armin van Buurin, or Paul van Dyk, you will NOT like this cd. Save your money and stick to the strong mixers listed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, wandering, white noise","review":"If this is the music of tomorrow, then I guess I'd be better off listening to a dripping faucet.Most songs consist of beating one idea into the ground, or in the case of several of the 'versions' of them, one idea into the ground for 'Part I', into the subsoil for 'Part 2', and into the bedrock for the 'vocal mix'.Way Out West will never be confused with Brian Eno or Philip Glass, and this CD will never be confused with 'Music for Airports' or 'Einstein on the Beach'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previous Reviewer..","review":"I just wanted to point out that despite what Erica Anderson says... Jody Wisternoff is NOT a female and did none of the vocals on this WOW album. He is Warren's partner in crime. He and Nick are one of Bristol's two dynamic duos (the other being that of 3d and Daddy G from Massive Attack, whom Warren was a former DJ for).This is a very solid album, and as far as originality goes WOW are mf innovators. This album is top notch. I only wish the Bonus track was PMT's FABULOUS remix of the title track \\"Intensify\\".And the vocalist for Stealth (as stated above) is Kirsty Hawkshaw (formerly of Opus III) who has been along MUCH longer than Jan Johnston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story that parents and kids will love","review":"This is a super, high quality hardcover with beautiful illustrations.

I've used many others that cost less but did not work and were actually rejected by my skin as toxins - what happens when you feed the body's largest organ with crap. So Tend Skin, although pricey is wonderful. The alcohol and aspirin kill bacteria and several humectants work to extract moisture from the epidermis and the general atmosphere or environment. This is important because I put LOADS of this stuff on my skin and it doesn't dry my skin. It has also greatly reduced the acne on my face by drying pimples, exfoliating (also keeping skin very soft), and disinfecting. So basically you should buy this product. Thank you God for Tend Skin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For Me","review":"I used this product several years ago and it didn't work for me.Smells like alcohol so it will burn like hell if you apply it to broken or bruised skin.I also have to agree with other reviewers that it can definitely dry your skin.

It is a significant improvement over Tend Skin--the roller ball applicator is brilliant and I have officially (thankfully) pitched my cotton ball bag. It does not sting nearly as much as Tend Skin. It smells so much better (actually pretty good!) and it works better too. I used to get very dry patches on my neck from using Tend Skin but I have had no dryness issues with Solution 2.

I've tried scrubs, lotions, diet change, etc. and nothing seemed to smooth my skin. TEND SKIN was my answer. I noticed my legs were smooth and some ingrown hairs gone. The only thing is that you have to keep up with it and apply twice a day, otherwise, it will come back. The smell is just like rubbing alcohol. It dries quickly, so you don't have to deal with the smell too much. It does dry out your skin, so be sure to apply the product, let it dry thoroughly and apply lotion. Thank you TEND SKIN! I will be using you for a while :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff works!","review":"This is a really good product that works for me. I am white female with wavey to curly hair and I use an epilator to remove my arm and leg hair and get razor bumps or more like zits to be honest. This product seems to make the hairs staighten out and stand on end so they don't curl up in the folicle and become infected. I prefer to use this at night before I got o bed. I even use it on areas where I tweeze like my chin and eyebrows. I could confidently say that the bumps have been reduced 98 to 99%. I do still get an occassional one or 2 but not a whole crop of them like before! 1 or 2 I can deal with!

At first it was much more potent and worked almost instantly to cure razor bumps and irritation. However, i've noticed over the last couple of years or so the price continues to increase and the product itself seems more diluted and less effective. My last expensive bottle has almost no effect on my skin whatsoever. And I do use it as directed.My advice would be to save a lot of money and use Clean & Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent (with salicylic acid). It is just as effective, if not more so than TendSkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for what it is - just make your own","review":"I tried this years and years ago and it was useful but SO expensive.

Five ounces rubbing alcohol, two and a half ounces witch hazel, twenty-six aspirin. Throw in the blender and pulverize. Apply with a cotton ball.

What I can say is that it smells terrible. Not a weak terrible smell, but a strong, overpowering stink.It also burns like crazy when you put it on.The Tend Skin company puts out this story about a miraculous discovery - a dentists patient came to him after a tooth extraction and raved that whatever the anesthetic was that he was given, it had cured his ingrown hairs.Well, there are three ingredients in tend skin - alcohol, glycerin, and aspirin. Thats it.So apparently this dental patient had been cured of ingrown hairs by taking an aspirin.Bottom line is, this product is insanely overpriced, and they hide it with this distortion, this silly propaganda about its \\"miraculous discovery.\\"A little bottle of alcohol and aspirin should cost a tenth of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly Smelly","review":"I really do not feel tend skin works as advertised.

After using Tend Skin for a couple of days, the results were great.After shaving, you need to wait a little bit so your skin is completely dry before applying it. It has a weird smell when you first apply it, but as soon as it dries it goes away.I would say that Tend Skin has helped me by reducing the amount of ingrown hairs and razor bumps by about 95%.It may be a little bit expensive, but it is TOTALLY worth the price.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"Tend Skin works very well.

I have super sensitive skin and I'm a swimmer, and have always been faced with the choice of either a hairy bikini line, or a bikini line with an unsightly rash. This stuff has given me the best of both worlds - hair and rash free!Two things to keep in mind:1. You must use it immediately after shaving. If it's already been a few hours, and you already have bumps, it won't be nearly as effective.2. It really stinks. I shower (and thus shave) mostly at the gym, and I have to huddle away from the other girls in the locker room when using this because the smell is so pungent and the odor travels!It's worth it, though.

It didn't help me at all. I bought it for my legs, to use it after I shave and although I keep using it, I don't see any improvement. What a waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts!","review":"I don't shave too often, so until recently I had used the more generic brand items to mitigate razor burn. I was optimistic about an upgrade, but disappointed shortly after when I used this product. It was rather abrasive, and left a light rash on my skin for about an hour after use."},{"rating":"1","title":"No results whatsoever","review":"As other reviews have stated, this product did not work at all for me.

I regret the purchase and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"This product does not work. I have tried this product over the past few months and have seen no improvement in ingrown hairs or irritation. This product is overpriced for its ingredients and lack of effectiveness. It is essentially alcohol and salicylic acid. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless product","review":"I was so excited to start using this product and agree with multiple reviews stating that the product is practically the same as rubbing alcohol. It did nothing but dry out my skin and I used it for two weeks twice a day and saw not a single improvement in my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and get harsh painful razor burn and ingrown hairs that cover my legs from top to bottom, and this product did not a thing to reduce any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I have used this product for over a year and have repurchased several bottles so I feel qualified to write a review. Does it work? eh...only a little. I noticed a slight reduction in ingrown hairs, but nothing to jump up for over joy over. Eventually, I grew tired of spending the money on this and stopped buying. The only thing that has helped with the incessant razor bumps under my arms has been laser hair removal. Though I do notice regrowth of hair, growth is much slower and the hair is much finer so I don't even develop razor bumps anymore because the hair is so fine. And because I don't need to shave as often, I don't experience razor burn. Yes, laser hair removal is expensive, but cheaper than using this product for the rest of my life! In general, I don't recommend this product because it doesn't work well enough to warrant the steep price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for my ingrowns","review":"I wanted this product to work, but unfortunately it has not. I get horrible in-grown hairs from brazilian waxing and I needed something to at least lessen them in number. I purchased tend skin based on the great reviews, and was so excited to try it out. I can't tell a difference at all. I'm still getting the in-growns, I guess I will have to try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Tend Skin works really well. Not nearly as many issues after shaving as before (redness, bumps)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns and smells","review":"I used this after shaving and it stings like crazy.

As someone who can't shave my legs or wax without too many ingrown hairs, this product makes hair removal possible when it wasn't before.Use it twice a day, morning and night (wait at least a few hours after shaving to use) for a few days after you shave or wax (or everyday) exfoliates your skin so that hairs don't get trapped under your skin. Works well with a loofah type products like these scrubbing glovesAquaBella Bath GlovesI am only giving it 4 stars because it's expensive.NOTE: DO NOT USE ON FRESHLY SHAVED SKIN! Read the directions. This does NOT TREAT razor burn, but rather PREVENT it. If you use it on raw skin it burns really bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great merchant","review":"I've always loved this product, works within the first use. Merchant was very quick and diligent in responding to my order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be a good product","review":"I haven't used the product as faithfully as I probably should, but overall it seems to work pretty well. I got a wax a couple of days after receiving the product and I haven't noticed any new bumps and it also healed the existing bumps. Of course with my dark complexion, I still have dark marks to contend with, but at least I can address just the discoloration now, instead of having to battle bumps and discoloration with two products that might further irritate my skin. Overall...the product has worked better than anything else I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for razor bumps","review":"This product works very well. I work in the skin care industry, and I decided to use the product after my boss told me she uses it for her bikini area.I always get mild to moderate razor bumps when I shave my neck. The only way I could avoid it was to shave very carefully and slowly while constantly cleaning the razor with rubbing alcohol.Now I shave normally with a regular cartridge razor (mach3) and use Tend Skin afterwords. I do not get razor bumps and I only use very little of the product.****However, the top ingredient in the product is Isopropyl Alcohol. So you should put a lightweight SPF 30 after Tend Skin dries. Lot of people ruin their skin after using Isopropyl alcohol based products and going out in the sun.4 Stars only because they should recommend using sunscreen after use. And, the product smells a little strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folliculitis banished!","review":"This is the best product I have found for reducing ingrown hair and razor bumps on my face and neck.

I am in love with this stuff buy it you won't regret it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"product not worth it","review":"I bought this several months ago to help with ingrown hairs and redness.

I tried it out and it was definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Effective on Old Ingrowns","review":"My legs are covered in ingrown hairs that are at the very least a decade old. I used two full bottles of tend skin as I wanted to give it enough time to really get through several layers of skin, but unfortunately it just didn't do anything for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises everything, delivers nothing.","review":"I bought TendSkin to help with the irritation and razor bumps I get on my neck from shaving. The product claims to, \\"reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and redness from shaving.\\" But despite it's lofty promises and high price, it does none of this. In fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse, I have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol. The directions tell you to apply it after shaving, but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving, it only made my problem worse. I wish I could have rated this product zero stars, because it is absolutely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree 100%","review":"I have used this product for a year now. Yes, it pretty much works but it burns something HORRIBLE. I literally need to prepare for it. Also, I don't understand how I am supposed to use it on my neck! I guess they want me to use a cotton ball or pour it onto my hand and slap it on there like after shave??? Probably the only thing that I really liked about it was the gold cap but that got all CRUSTY after a few uses because the alcohol literally ate off some of the gold paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tend Skin - 16oz bottle","review":"This product was recommended by a friend. I have been using Tend Skin for 9 years now. I use it after shaving, it burns a bit, then I wash my face with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash. It prevents most razor stubble blemishes and ingrown hairs. I also use it to clean off everyday pollutants that clog my pores, also using Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash. I have also found that when a skin blemish appears, I use a Q-tip and apply a small amount of Tend Skin to the blemish, it will shrink overnight and recede within 48 hours. Tend Skin is a bit expensive, but the 16oz bottle lasts more then a year for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My one beauty indulgence","review":"I no longer buy expensive creams, lotions or cosmetics, but this is one beauty product I will not do without. I use it on my legs and upper arms.

I found on Amazon Solution2 and gave that product a try. It's definitely a nicer product. It doesn't sting nearly as much which is a big deal for me and I LOVE the roller ball application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tend Skin review","review":"I love this product! It really does reduce razor bumps and ingrown hairs, but be aware that it will sting if you have any razor nicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tend skin the skin care solution for unsightly razor burns","review":"I started using this product mid-fall of 2010. It did a wonderful job on my razor burns. My ingrown hair has been more of a challenge. I keep a bald head shave and chin/facial hair shave gets done once a week. My coarse hair or sensitive skin is prone/vulneralbe to ingrown hair and razor burns. This product has significantly reduced the incidence of new ingrown hair but unfortunately nothing it has not relieved those already beneath the skin. It does burn a little on contact with the skin but I have learned never to be bothered by such a short lived discomfort. This product has allowed me to risk shaving my pate and face/chin more than once a week sometimes without worry of the razor burn or ingrown."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Product is great!

The Jewels superstar, Moss Cooley, is close to breaking Di Maggio's 56 game hitting streak, but someone is trying to rattle him. The team hires Blissberg to protect Cooley.Harvey and Moss learn to trust and respect each other and little by little, the mystery is unraveled. I was sure I would dislike this book, since I find professional sports boring and Providence is one of my least favorite cities. I was wrong. Rosen makes the game and the people interesting and exciting again (I stopped following baseball when the Giants left New York, when it was a game and not big business as it is today.) Bits and pieces of baseball history are woven into the story as is Providence and its landmarks including Haven's Brothers, a prototype the first diner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big UFC fan","review":"Helped me fill in the holes in my collection.

Not for Witches.","review":"I'm always looking for a good story with a Witch twist, but this one was very disppointing. The only reason I finished the book was because I kept hoping it'd get better. In the end, I skimmed though most of it because it really wasn't holding my attention. I agree with another reviewer that this was another book that did not show Witchcraft in a good light even though it did try. Another bone to pick was that this definately wasn't a mystery! I don't recommend it and the book is in my recycling bag. The reason why I gave it 1 star is because it's like a bad show on tv, or a B rated movie, sometimes when you've nothing to do, you might as well watch/read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pointless pornography.","review":"Ms. Zavala's talent in writing is downright horrible. The characters' speech is dry, unrealistic, and fluffy. The story was just ridiculous. It seems like every other chapter there are long, obscene, and disgusting sex rituals that left me gagging... This also perpetuates a false look on Wicca and its practitioners. They do *not* run around having gratuitous sex with various partners of their coven at the same time to encourage magical growth. Also, spells don't have to be cast in the nude to ensure efficiency...Overall, the first quarter of the book is only somewhat interesting and the rest is a flight of tasteless oversexual fantasy, with a big fat \\"RELIGIOUS\\" label slapped on. It gets one star since it actually delves into the esoteric world, but if you want to read a better occult mystery, get \\"Bell, Book, and Murder\\" by Rosemary Edghill. Don't waste your money on this glorified garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read, Great Book","review":"This is one of my favorite book on helping hurting kids. It is a very easy read.

It was refreshing to see a book dealing with the real hurts of kids that didn't dwell on the more current fad of \\"bullying\\". Sure there could have been a bit more detail and specifics but the author gave a pretty thorough overview. As I was reading it, I kept spontaneously saying, \\"wow, this is good, right on, etc.\\" If you are starting out in ministry with students, you will find this extremely helpful and a great basis for doing a solid job of helping your hurting students. The structure was excellent and the resources suggested for further study very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best techno CD I've ever owned","review":"This album is one of my personal favorites and should belong in every music collection.With it's hard beat and fast pace, this record will get you jumping.

I suffered back pain after an car accident. I loved the lumbar roll i could strap around my waist but it did not keep it's support long. I wanted something that could keep it's support. I thought this would do the trick. However the back is too narrow. In addition it does not come with any type of strapping to keep it in place. It was very uncomfortable. this is definitely for a child or someone with a small build under 120lbs. I though maybe I could use it as a seat cushion. That did not work.

Sounds from another world created by a series of oscillators to form a collage of strange but extremely enjoyable music. Maybe not the best choice of music when your anal idiot boss comes over for dinner, but you'd be hard pressed to find anything like it back in the late 60s, except possibly 50 Foot Hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best in years......","review":"In recent years getting a new Jimmy Buffett album was an adventure in guessing which Jimmy would show this time.The playful Jimmy[\\"USS Zydecoldsmobile\\"] or the mornful Jimmy [\\"All the Ways I Want You\\"] or the thoughtful Jimmy[\\"Last Man Standing\\"]..well with this one you get them all.Soulful ballads,rocking Zydeco,and you even get to the Hokey Pokey.............Parrothead style!!! [\\"What if the Hokey Pokey is all it really is about?\\"]There are so many standouts on this album but the title cut \\"Far Side of the World\\" is the center track..and check out the video on your computer....lyric and travelogue intertwined together.I will be playing this one for a long time to come ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give him an \\"E\\" for effort...","review":"I've enjoyed Jimmy Buffett's music for 30 years, and have appreciated both his highs and lows (that's what keeps it interesting).

I'll give him an \\"E\\" and look forward to his next inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage","review":"I think the best way to describe this CD is Vintage. A great selection of the different kinds of music Jimmy Buffet has been making on his last 32 albums. Familiar yet not redundant, I like it more everytime I play it.

There is a great mix of some mellow music combined with classic Buffett escapism. At least three or four of the songs on this CD are bound to be new \\"classics\\". An absolute must for anybody with a Buffett collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 'New Jimmy'","review":"As 10 year Buffett fan, first having been indoctrinated on 'Songs you know by Heart' I then got into newer stuff (Fruitcakes, Barometer Soup, and Banana Wind), and backfilled the older stuff and realized one thing. How do you classify Buffet? His work has continually evolved over his 33 albums, and this one is no different. This album is a fine mix of what has made Jimmy one of my favorites, his ability to alternate between fun/frivolous songs 9of varying genres) and more serious/thoughtful songs. JB seems to have 'grown up' a tad on many of the tracks with a heavier emphasis on his acoustic skills (Mademoiselle, Savanah, Someday I will, Tonight I just need my guitar) but also ventures into some new territory: An Enigma like anecdotal recount of his St. Barts hotel & a Zydeco song. If you strictly are an 'old school' Buffett fan, you may be dissapointed, but if you appreciate him as musician, lyricist, author, adventurer, etc. you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for the Buffett Fan","review":"... This CD is terrible, and Im a die-hard Parrothead from South Florida !! A collection of ultra slow ballads, some of which I swear Jimmy fell asleep in the middle of. Then a few of those songs yhat arent really songs, just Jimmy talking to himself. The last 3 songs were ok, but sounded similar to some of his older songs. No catchy rhythms or verses, just boring tunes and your glad when their over. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely stinks","review":"I am a huge buffett fan and I own everything he has ever done-that I can find- including many bootlegs, but this blows. The material is very weak and the performance is lounge lizard, at best. \\"Beachhouse on the Moon\\" had a few great songs, but the rest of it was...well...like this. It's still better than most music recorded in the history of mankind, but if Jimmy was an athlete they would say it is time to retire. \\"They're sending the old man home.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Jimmy's gone to the well one too many times...","review":"I've hung on every line since JB's early days and relished every release since then. The old stuff is incomparable and wonderfully classic; but, each new album lacks the magic that brought all of us aging Parrotheads through many a tropical situation or made us laugh at life's little quirks. This new album reflects that ebbing trend, in my opinion. JB is still the last word in the type of music he pioneered and shared with us, but I think the well is drying-up. And maybe it should... He's covered as many bases as is humanly possible in his art style! I'll keep buying 'em if he records them, but I think we're due a magic trick! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Parrot Head","review":"I am beginning to wonder if JB is running out of things to sing about. The mood of the album is subdued and reflective, (much like Beach House) and it lacks originality. The lyrics and music sound like they were derived from previous albums and a few songs sound like nothing more than filler. What is a Jimmy Buffett album without a single steel drum or a harmonica?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bad....","review":"OH MY GOD>>> Jimmy, go spend your money and stop making lame music!! This one is terrible... Time to put Jim away and plug in some John Hiatt or Neil Young, some talent...

Since he and his family moved to West Palm Beach, his music shows. He now wants to be the Poet of Palm Beach. The music tempo is certainly not condusive for a Parrot Head Party. But it would make very good background music at your great uncle's funeral. Since he hit the half century mark, his style has been more reflective. We all hit 50 years of age sometime in our life and he was the reason we became parrot heads! He made us young and reckless again especially with his concerts and new releases. But this is just another perfunctory CD before another tour. After suffering through the entire disc, I gave it to Goodwill. For me, it's back to the boxed set to dream of bars, beaches and ballads. JB, let's get back to the basics. Marvin Gardens has left the planet! I have been a Parrot Head since 1974 and want my old JB back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"far from good music","review":"this is the worst cd i have ever heard. i think buffet has lost his mind. trust me, i am a buffet fan, but this is not even music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things change!","review":"Yeah It's changed all right..I guess MONEY does change everything. Long are the days of the creative singer songwriter that used to give a damm about his art. Now it's obvious that he can throw any \`ol [junk] out without caring about if people will like it or not..He's made his Billions (and it shows). And most disturbing to me is not having made the slightest reference to the Attack on Sept. 11th, you'd think he would have some gratitude to the people who made him a success. My hat goes off to Neil Young."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks","review":"If you look at Jimmy's first album and at his latest, it's a vivd comparrison. It's totally different, however it is all in the genre that contains exclusively jimmy buffett music. Something about it is universal but each album is distinct as a whole. Each album casts upon me a different mood.This particular album is, as many others have dubbed it, introspective - And it has that effect on me. Even without listening to the words, the tone of music is very thought provoking. Jimmy has masterred the ability to subtley convey his emotions into the sound of the music he plays. That is the mark of a veteran truebador.I can't give it 5 stars, cause it's not barometer soup. But I can give it four casue it's pretty darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over it","review":"Hvaing perused the reviews already submitted , I can't help but notice the continuing theme of disappointment in the style of this album. However , those complaining seem to want JB frozen ib time, a monument to beach bums and margaritas.When I first listened , I noticed the change in his voice , the absence of the steel drums and harmonica , the reflective tone and I wasn't sure I liked it. But the more I listened , the more it grew on me. This is a journey on a different continent , a road less travelled.Those complaining should realise that there's more to the world ( and indeed the man) than cheeseburgers and tailgate parties. He writes about life experiences and attempts to take you with him on a journey. Go along for the ride , you might learn something."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too far on the other side of the world","review":"I'm a JB fan from waaay back, but I just can't warm up to this CD. I have read many of the glowing reviews and have to wonder if they would not have been the same if JB had just hummed the hokey pokey for the entire cut. Africa meets Nashville and the two just don't make a JB album. The Nashville sound crops up in the most unexpected places and has the same effect as fingernails on a chalk board, leaving you with a itchy feeling and wondering how it fits. Jimmy has come a long way in his music style, The last recent departure from the standard Buffett, Don't stop the Carnival, was an interesting album, a very good story, and had several very good songs. This departure leaves me wondering when Buffett will really be back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE YOUR UNDER MY SPELL SO BUY EVERYTHING I PUT OUT","review":"One ok song, two at the most. Keep putting these albums out though because you know all your fans will keep on buying them. Time to stop figuring out how to make more money and sit down and think about...your writing. Havn't had a great album since FRUITCAKES. So, let your executives and accountants figure out where to open the next Margaritaville and how to make sure that you keep raking in the money and then maybe you can concentrate on becomeing the person you used to be such a long time ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the slower Buffett","review":"This album seems to be more like some of Jimmy's earlier music, a little slower paced and relaxing. Maybe Jimmy is slowing down a little bit in his \\"old age\\" but I think the album fits in well with the rest of the Buffett music. It's nice to see an album with all new songs for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING AND REFRESHING","review":"This album exceeded my expectations! Far Side is an absolutely amazing album... Don't listen to what that guy said who gave the one star, he's not a true Parrot Head. This Album is great, I love it... If you take my advice and dont like it, a 1000 apologies, but I am sure you will be happy to add it to your collection. When Buffett teams up with Sonny Landreth on the cover of his song \\"USS Zydecoldsmobile\\" you cant help but want to dance.... Mademoiselle (Voulez Vous Danser) is another amazing track, along with the title track \\"Far Side of the World\\"BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Mellow But Still Good Buffet Tunes","review":"Most songs are slow and really do reflect a lot on the \\"Come Monday\\" style of music that Jimmy has done. Still, the CD is great and if you truely love his work you'll enjoy it. I think the song reflects more on his personal life and not so much about us drunk & rowdy parrotheads. I still can't shake the feeling that Jimmy owes us some songs to hangout and have a good time with on his next one. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Won't Have You Breaking Out a Blender","review":"Not the Buffet I was looking forward to hearing. Except for a few decent songs I find the album to be lackluster and boring. \\"Someday I will\\" and \\"Far Side of the World\\" show some promise. Sadly I found myself skipping to the next song on several occasions. Disappointing to this long time Buffet fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy has left the building","review":"I am a huge fan for over 20 years, and own every album and cd up to this point.

Now, there's just so much going on in the song, you lose the words. Which, as gifted as a singer-songwriter as Jimmy is, is just lacking.Luckily, you can see the flicker of the muse returning on this album, but it's not the classic Buffett of 10 years ago, or earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to like.....","review":"Very disapponinting.

If I had not read the book, I would not know about anything that was going on in the film. It was such a microcosm of the extensive tome, it should not have been made into a movie unless it was three hours. The film omitted the strong emotions that were in force at the Citadel, and it also left one to wonder why anyone would go there in the first place. Will's past and also his involvement with the pregnant girl were left out; these facts contributed to why Will was at the Citadel. Moreover, Pignetti's \\"walk of shame\\" ended with his simply getting into a cab.

This movie is the worst portrayal of a novel I have ever seen. The movie left out the most important parts of the book (such as his relationship with Annie Kate). I knew not to expect the movie to be quite as good as the book, but I sincerely feel that I wasted my time in renting this particular movie. I think Pat Conroy would be very displeased if he saw his amazing book converted into a couple of hours worth of nonsense. Even the ending was awful. My two pieces of advice are: 1) If you have read the book, don't ruin your experience by watching the movie. And 2) If you haven't read the book, do so, but don't watch the movie.

It would continue to be somewhat painful and only various pillows would bring relief. Lucky for us, we bought the chairs from Amazon and after de-installation and repacking we returned these items.

Shop did not advise me this item is back ordered until I asked him the status. Shop behaivior is not kind one. At any rate today I received the chair and completed the assembly work somehow. Assembly work itself is not difficult, but I took one hour to comple the assembly work of ottoman. Two of four 50mm screws could not be tightened with Small wood frame. Possibly the holes depth of small wood base differ L and R. I put extra washers in one side holes and could tightened these two screws. Much higher quality control of parts is required.The sitting feel is very good. Finish of wood work and cushin is good. I found that I will be able to enjoy home theater movie confortably.

With one exception, it has done a beautiful job cooking everything I have tried.

You can just barely squeeze a chicken into the oven, but it works best with smaller roasts and frozen items.After six years of constant use the light bulb burned out, so I used that as an excuse to picked up a refurbed Delonghi Rotisserie oven. It was _huge_, and it failed after about a year. (It was an analog 'Retro' design, and the timer never worked right. Finally, the thermostat broke, and it would never shut off.)On the other hand, the digital timer on the AD699S is accurate to the second, and it's really easy to use.This refurbed AD699S was in great shape, and works like a charm!I'd say if you get one that's DOA, or in bad shape, just have Amazon replace it for free.This is a great toaster oven for two people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one shipped DOA","review":"Unbelievable, amazon keeps sending out these DOA refurbished ovens, they should read the reviews and stop selling these.About 50% of these ovens are sent out DOA, not worth the hassle.Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA as well","review":"I purchased this as a gift, and was shipped promptly.

I created a heat block with some aluminum flashing to protect the electronics from heat. I will put it back together this weekend and try it. Basically it is fun if you like to take things apart but I have not gotten any further than that so far. Don't even know if it comes on.

Amazon decoded to let me try again, and the oven that arrived (by UPS Next Day) was in fine shape and works well. So definitely a bit of work, but ultimately this seems to have worked out well.

Even though my musical taste is mainly rock, I respect the effort put forth by Santana and Rob Thomas. The vocals go well with the instrumentals, which is a definite plus. Thomas' voice is definitely one that works well with that type of 'smooth' flavor. I look forward to hearing more of this new venue of music, the combination of Latino rhythym and white-boy singing. It's great to hear the world coming together in a song or two, even if it's just a small part of our me-society. Keep up the good work, men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the music, the Latin flair, and the beat","review":"This is the greatest Santana song to ever come along in my opinion.

I found myself skipping long paragraphs a lot throughout the book. And secondly, I found the heroine frustrating and sometimes annoying. I did not like the way the hero and heroine in the book committed adultery and I did not like the way the heroine treated her husband. She should've left her husband or divorced him instead of running around with someone else behind his back and therefore humiliating him. Her husband was a good man and shouldn't have been treated so unfairly. I sympathized with her husband more than the couple.

Gundula Janowitz is far and away my favorite singer of lieder. Her voice is remarkable for its clear and even tone; although she doesn't have the power of Te Kanawa, say, she makes up for it with the beauty of her interpretation and sound. But this disc is terrible. It sounds like someone's niece's recital. The piano is lugubrious (very unusual for Irwin Gage, who is normally a sensitive accompanist for Janowitz), and Janowitz's voice is too far back. Rather than this disc, buy Janowitz's rendition of Strauss' Four Last Songs with Karajan; Tod and Verklarung on the same disc is also divine. Or you can buy the two CD set of Janowitz singing Schubert, on which you'll hear how beautifully Janowitz sings lieder and how well Gage accompanies her."},{"rating":"2","title":"RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE","review":"I have several of these albums and will continue to buy them.

However, \\"Origami Boxes\\" has far superior diagrams, making it much easier for those not used to 3D/modular. This uses the standard origami notations, but her final notes for assembly are extremly limited, making a certain leap of faith necessary.That being said, \\"Origami Boxes\\" forces you to make certain leaps of its own to make certain boxes she shows in her pictures. This book allows for more complex boxes with more complete variations.So overall: Not for beginners or people with little 3D experience. Good for intermediate to advanced folders. Still highly enjoyable, just a bit challenging!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice variety of designs","review":"Nice variety of designs for box tops here. Directions are clear and easy to follow.

I would recommend almost all of her books. This book is no exception. As a lover of origami, and practical things, I can't go past Tomoko Fuse's box books.I was a beginner folder when I first bought her box books and have never had a problem following her directions. I have also taught the folding or some of her boxes to a group of 10-15 year olds. Although they needed a bit of help here and there, they were capable of folding the boxes. (Some, of course were better than others at understanding the diagrams, but most caught on eventually).The boxes have endless uses, paperclips at work, shortbread in them at Christmas time for gifts, to hold Easter eggs at Easter.As the cover illustrates, this book has more boxes with raised details (such as the crane, flowers etc) than Tomoko Fuse's \\"Origami Boxes\\". Both books are fabulous though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love boxes and working with paper. This book left a lot to the imagination.

I got to say that I've heard their earlier stuff and this blows it away. I can tell that they have matured since the last cd.

The musicianship is great and I can hear a mix between bands like Emperor, Neurosis and Kiss it Goodbye. But with more melodic parts. The cd also contains a remix by Merzbow which is kinda strange for a hardcore group. But I can't say that Burst is a hardcore band. It seems like they put together all their favourit bands, put them into a blender and out comes the result. 10 great songs which screems of agression, despair and hope for the future.

There are two sad things about this album: 1. \\"Riding with the King\\" could have been great, because it is conceptually promising; 2. That Clapton and King released this mediocre album shows that both musicians have poor taste as they reach the end of their careers (and I say this most with respect to Clapton, not King)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Da Blues?","review":"I love BB and Clapton, but when the two got together something went wrong!

How anyone considers a wealthy British guy a \\"blues\\" artist (with a straight face no less) obviously doesn't know the first thing about the true spirit of the blues. This is not the blues, this is two wash-outs in the twilight of their career looking for a bit of extra retirement cash. What respect I had for BB King walked out the door when he teamed up with Clapton on this unimpressive cd which is not worth all the hype it seems to be getting. \\"Riding With the Jokers\\" would be a more appropriate title. For true blues, listen to Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, or Elmore James, not this commercial garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish!","review":"This CD must be one of the worst ever.

Unfortunately, this CD is more promotional hype than substance.I don't know why these two guys seem to be acting so condescending towards each other when they are both true talents that could blow away most people with their blues ability and experience. Yet when they get together they are seem more focused on praising then playing. Maybe this album was never meant to be a serious blues album, but a good time get together between the two.

But the age difference, difference in era, styles and voice types makes this a unique project.Most interestingly is the heavy, \\"opinionated\\" musical styles of both artists. At times, there is an ungraceful colliding of voices as beef smacks up against beef. But instead of being uncomfortable and strange, it's like a couple of blues masters jamming together.It's the guitarists who will likely find this album most interesting. The combination of steel & acoustic styles and sounds blend into a sweet sound, requiring only a snare drum and organ (Key to the Highway) to make it the perfect accompaniment to the soulful voices. It's almost like master and star student are performing together.

B.B. and Eric together how could you go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Most songs on this CD are rather good, especially those which are sung solely by B.B. King. Real blues songs are songs where melancholy and the struggle with life are eminent and B.B. King is one of the best performers in the genre. Eric Clapton is a most exquisite guitarist, but I am sorry to say it, he can't sing (at least not the blues). In the songs on which he features next to B.B. King the magic of the blues is gone and annoyance and anger take their place. The final track Come rain or come shine is a pinnacle of musical poverty.Moreover, the sound quality of this record is rather poor. All instruments are taken on one line, there is hardly any subtlety, there's no stage, the voices are explicitely coming from the right or from the left, the songs where the voice of B.B. King is nicely centered are rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton and King Together at Last!","review":"Great CD! Cant recommend it more!

I loved \\"Worried life Blues\\", \\"Riding with the King\\" and of course \\"Hold on, I'm comin\\" not to mention everything else on the CD. This one will go to work with me. If you like Eric Clapton or BB King you will want this in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of the best play together for a great album","review":"This CD was one of the wisest purchases I have ever made in my entire life. If one looks for guitar in an album, look no farther for this is the top of the line. If fans of either BB King or Eric Clapton want a great CD this is a wise purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, they're 2 stars, but...","review":"58 rhapsodizing reviews...What I can I say--both of these guys have better albums individually, and other than their status, this is far from the most *interesting* blues music being put out today. Look at the covershot, everything about the packaging...slick car, slick suits, the most expensive guitars available. These guys started in the blues, but their music has transcended to something else.No hard feelings, but I don't think it's that great, either. Give me a new Fat Possum release over this , anyday. I want raw, and I want emotion. BB's voice indeed still carries that, but the playing is so uptown, and Clapton is NOT in blues mode, he's still stuck in Babyface/cross-over crooning.Buy a poster if you can get one; this disc will be forgettable as soon as all the cloying fawning has passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got the blues baby !","review":"This is a long time BB and Slowhand played together ! God, they can do that whenever they want ! Actually, i wasn't a real BB King fan ... but after listening to this cd i changed my mind, he's the blues himself ! This cd is a real tribute to the blues music. Clapton is smart enough to set himself at the service of one of the greatest voice blues has ever known !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just buy it","review":"I'm really glad my mom turned me on to bb king when I saw a kid, I owe her.Just buy the cd, make up your own mind. Yes, it's a polished piece, perhaps overproduced; they have the bucks, the studio and the talent - who can blame them for making the cuts the way THEY wanted?You and I certainly can't do it and that's why I'm gratfeful BB and EC did do it. It's a shame it's over so quick however.\\"Worried Life Blues' worth the price of admission alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My current favorite CD","review":"I've been hitting the repeat button on this CD since I've gotten it. Two legends for the price of one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great covers","review":"Every blues lover dreams of some intense meeting between legends : last year was published a live recording with Albert King ans Stevie Ray Vaughan. This year an excellent brand new studio album : BB & EC. With the complicity af the young talent of Doyle Brahall II, with Joe Sample (piano) and Steve Gadd (drums), this CD brings a true dream team together. What is more impressive is the perfect intricacy between old 12 bars blues songs and recent songs (from Bramhall's Jellycream), between Clapton's strat and Lucille, between two different good voices, between styles (there's even an Isaac Hayes'cover). This CD should put smiles on your face... PS. Steve Gadd is a genius on drums. Listen to his intense and judicious job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget About Eric and BB -- Andy Fairweather Low is God!","review":"Ok you adult contemporary types, go ahead and rebuke my review, but you didn't really need it in the first place because you are not interested in objectivity; you are interested in agreeing with the opinions that you have already formed. (Yeah, yeah, you Oprah and Martha Stewart loving types--you would only know the blues if you were critically short of breath!) \\"Riding with the King\\" is a sad attempt at the blues, due to Eric and BB's feeble efforts. The album is only the best blues album in history because it features the songwriting of Doyle Bramhall and the real guitar genius of Andy Fairweather Low! They tear the roof off the joint! Buy this album from Amazon now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton doesn't understand the blues","review":"Clapton's \\"whitewashed\\" version od the blues just pales in compariosn with BB's soulful meaningful and powerful blues. If we could only edit out all of Clapton's parts thsi would be a great date. Too bad they didn't match BB with John Lee Hooker instead, he was still around back then. Oh well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"Riding with the King.... Yes, and not listening to what I'm doing. Why the hell didn't these two call it: Earning money without work? Two names, making you believe in big things to come. But, no way. It's only two old men and a lack of new ideas. We all know that Clapton is not god anymore and B.B. King will not be the one re-inventing the blues. But we love them for what they are. But there was really no need for this CD. I can only say that I wish I kept my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I would have thought that two titans of the business such as Clapton and King could produce an amazing album without even trying. I was wrong. This album makes me think of two old geezers glued to their rocking chairs trying to recall the good old days but not even having the energy to take their memories seriously. The title song \\"Riding with the King\\" is an embarrassment. Save your money and your memories of who these guys used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please....","review":"Get between Eric Clapton and B.B. King any way you can.... If you want to Save the Blues.My 2 star rating is in support for Blues Master B.B.King. I am really feeling the blues now. Blue about the money I spent on this CD.Pass on 'Riding with the King' and buy B.B.King's CD's (without Clapton} or any of Stevie Ray Vaughn's music. Now these two gentlemen Know the Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is Clapton so highly rated?","review":"Clapton as usual runs through the same old pentatonic blues scale guitar riffs that he's been playing for years. And with very little imagination or even the attempt of trying something new on this album. I think Clapton is good, not great and he's certainly not God! I know he was one of the early pioneers of rock guitar but does anyone really think he stacks up equally to his peer group of Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck? I guess if you already love this stuff and accept that nothing new will come of it then you'll buy this anyway. On the other hand, if you want to avoid the latest slick packaging work from the record companies to snatch [more money] out of your pocket then steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but less than I expected.","review":"There are a couple of great tracks on here (come rain or come shine is one), and some classic tunes. The problem is that it feels like both of these men are in too much in awe of each other to play strongly together. There is a mutual deference in the playing that keeps several of the performances at a tepid level. Still worth having though, definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Legends","review":"After listening to this CD, I have wondered why more blues artists don't team up for albums like this. The interaction between Clapton and King makes this CD a must buy for any fan of music. I own CD's by both men, and hearing them sing and play together keeps them in the CD changer. Let's hope that other blues artists will take the time to do something special like this.If only SRV were here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"I think both of these artists were having a great time recording this cd. This was a recording of mutual respect. Great guitar work too. I've enjoyed it and encourage anyone to purchase the c.d."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count me among the disappointed ...","review":"This seems more like a ploy to get fans of both artists to fork out the cash. A wholly uninspiring compact disc with nary a memorable tune to be found. The best thing about this compilation is the cover. Wish I could say more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't quite reach my expectations...","review":"This is a very good album that didn't quite reach my expectations (which were probably unrealistically high). Half the album are classic BB songs and the other half are blues covers. Highlights are an acoustic version of \\"Key To The Highway\\" and the King classic \\"Three O'clock Blues\\". Awesome talent behind these two legends as well, including Joe Sample, Andy Fairweather Low, Doyle Bramhall, Steve Gadd and Jimmy Vaughn joins them on a song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to play BB King 8-tracks (YIKES) in the car and I HATED it! She would say, \\"boy, don't you know you're ridin' with the King?\\" When this CD was released I just sat and LAUGHED thinking back to 20 years ago when she'd say that. This CD was well done. An All-star effort, with the production values to match. The KING on the right, SLOWHAND on the left - this CD was meant to be enjoyed. The blues flavor has once again been enhanced by the 2 of the best! Here's to these two getting their just due when the Grammy's roll around. As for grandma...well she's gone now, but I'm SURE she knows that I am enjoying...RIDIN' WITH THE KING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A red moon rising on a warm summer night","review":"What more perfect release date for this work than the week before the start of summer? The voices of King and Clapton don't always quite work together, but the results are fine and take me deep into the hazy nights of summer just as good blues should. I just hope these two had the forethought to videotape their sessions - it would be a priceless documentary, one I would I love to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Buy","review":"No guitar heroics in the album, but that is fine with me. Not nearly as good as \\"From the Cradle\\" but this is a richly satisfying album.Keys to the Highway was my favorite song, esp. if you remember the song as performed by Derek and the Dominoes.The best way I can describe the album is that it has a good vibe. Clapton and King complement each other very well. Clapton lays back on the guitar, but that makes it better for me. The songs seem to take precedence over the artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"BB & EC? - I've barely heard the Amazon CD Samples ...","review":"... but I'll be on my way to the store as soon as I completethis \\"review.\\"...Blues? Guitars? Vocals? BB King &Eric Clapton? - Together? Can anyone spell ... NO BRAINER?I once heard a story from Chris Tarrant (London Radio DJ and originator of the \\"Millionaire\\" game show) about how The 'Profession' column in Clapton's passport is filled out with the title of \\"LEGEND.\\" - Nothing less can be said of BB - Teacher, Mentor and (with little argument) only the best Bluesman ever.And if you're accusing me of being an apologist for these Fine Gentlemen of the Strings? - go ahead and fasten the handcuffs - but please! let me get to the store first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slowhand and B.B., why did it take so long!","review":"Together at long last, these two legends fail to dissapoint. The laid-back, fingers gliding over the frets, cruising down the highway blues will not fail to move you. The 12 classic cover tunes on this CD are a must for anyone that loves the blues. From the rock-n-roll inspiring title track to the threadbare soulfull vocal of Three O'clock blues you'll be jammin'. Listen to the rolling down the Mississippi voice of B.B. King on Ten Long Years and you'll want to glide along with him and Slowhand. The pleasure I get hearing B.B. King's voice with Eric Clapton's guitar cannot be put into words. This, more than his own blues CD of last year, is what Clapton fans have been waiting for. Pick up this CD and as Genevieve Williams said in her review, you'll get \\"...the kind of pleasure one gets from jamming late at night with a good friend.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Two blues great's don't necessarily equal a good blues album","review":"I bought this CD without hearing anything about it on the day it was released. I asked myself \\"How great will it be to hear Eric and B.B. working together?\\" With the typical expectation of fantastic chops(and being a guitarist myself, they were not unexpected), I put the CD in my car player leaving the store. I was horrified to learn that these two greats could fall so short in putting together a decent album.I felt like I was listening to a mutual admiration society recording, without the typical substance to the music, or the musicianship that I expected. I would definitely not recommend this recording to anyone who enjoys real blues, or is serious about ANY type of music. BB and Eric should stay away from each other and concentrate on what really is important...music rather than condescending playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Let B.B. Play","review":"Since the title is \\"Riding With the King,\\" one would assume that this would be an essential component to any CD collection. Wrong. While the title track is good, the ride turns into a crash course. Simply put, you can hear the commercialized influences of Clapton throughout the recording. This album had so much potential if only Clapton would have not produced it. B.B.'s the King so Clapton should have taken a back seat to him. While there are a few bright spots, overall it was a big disappointment. Next time, just let B.B. play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Mom always said...","review":"Here you have two Greats playing together. I think you might find a few songs you like, but like Mom always said, \\"If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.\\". Keeping that in mind, I have nothing more to say and I love the blues and these two artists. Maybe my expectations were just too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Style And Rhythm.","review":"\\"Riding With The King\\" is a cool trip down the exhilarating highway of style and mood and atmosphere. Here we have a fantastic collaboration between two great artists. The songs are full of style, richness and sometimes maybe even a little touch of dark comedy. The first track, \\"Riding With The King,\\" is a pure delight, all style and cool energy and lots of fun too. Other songs like \\"Ten Long Years\\" and \\"Three O'Clock Blues\\" are nice atmospheric pieces and you're surprised at how well B.B. King's and Eric Clapton's vocals sound together in a song. And then there's the richness in the detail of the music. You never get tired of hearing how King bends the strings in that unique fashion as well as Clapton. This is an album full of talent and style, one of the year's best releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"blues for breakfast","review":"since the first time i listened to this album it has been in heavy rotation. the guitar work is consistently impressive throughout and is understated in that it is more about flawless execution, inflection and tone than it is about blistering and technically challenging solos. it is also the best collaboration of two such peers, both axemen and both estemeed vocalists, both parties do what they do best and serve as complements vs. substitutes or competitors to one other. i enjoy trying to figure out what guitar parts are being played by who and i can almost see BBs hand working his famous butterfly tremolo. this album is pure, clean, pristine and hard driving blues by a couple of the Kings.Guy Smiley signing off"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collaboration","review":"Well this cd certainly has more fans than not. It is just so hard to believe that even the small minority here can have given it 1 star, but like the old adage goes, \\"You can't please all of the people all of the time\\". One star though, is an insult to these two greats. This is an excellent blues album and should please most fans of either artist. The songs are all great, not a bad one amongst them. I, for one, love this album, and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some classic tracks - but lacking raw energy of...","review":"...EC's and BB's live albums (e.g. From the Cradle, Live at the Regal). The album sounded good, but a little bland the first couple of times I listened -- I suppose I like my blues a little raw, and this is very polished and professional. The album quickly grew on me though. I particularly like \\"Marry me\\" (good energy and wah!) and \\"I'm coming\\" (guitar sex?). There are several other good tracks. The title track is pretty good when you get in the car in the morning (tip: just don't over play it!). If you find this a little too smooth for you, then I can highly recommend: Blues Breaker with Eric Clapton, From the Cradle and BB King Live at the Regency. Also check out Freddie King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snag the Kings!","review":"Hey, out of all the combined 14 or so CD's I own of both Artists, I would say in the event of Earthquakes, Flying Nukes or Rocketing Gas Prices (heaven forid)I could take \\"Riding with the King\\", a tank of gas,a trusty Gibson and a cooler.....and feel pretty damn good about things....considering, that I left 13 Clapton & BBKing CD's at home and all...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't decide on a gift? Buy this.","review":"This is an excellent gift for anyone. Seriously. If you have no idea what this person like or if they like all types of music, then get this CD for them. You seriously can't go wrong. Unless they're into polka. Then don't get this CD. There is no polka on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived on time and undamaged","review":"This was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a DVD recorded show of BB and Clapton...it is only the music and plays on the DVD player. I was disappointed since I wanted the TV show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Letdown!","review":"Both of these guys are great on their own, but together they really are lousy.

The opener is good, but drink lots of coffee if you want to make it through the rest of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear Why They Are So Famous","review":"If you want to know why BB King and Eric Clapton are famous, check out this CD. Each of them in their own distinct style is a master guitarist. For many years I have been an Eric Clapton fan, in large part due to Layla, Cream, and live work. On this CD you hear Clapton ripping through the Blues with everything he's got, playing off BB King, who is superb in his own right. I'm a guitar player, and I play the blues enough to know how good these two men are. This CD is a masterpiece. They are better than ever here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once in a blue moon","review":"This is one I heard at a friend's house and had to get it. I liked Clapton back when he Shot the Sheriff - but he's even better laying down a blues track. I think the combination of he and B.B. is like Haley's comet - rare and something you have to experience. Clapton's guitar is as emotional as good blues harmonica (see Charlie Musselwhite) and B.B.'s middle name is probably Blue. When they both sing and play, you also pick up on the mutual respect and fun these two demonstrate. This sort of alignment occurs once in a blue moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL \\"REAL DEAL\\"","review":"IF YOUR SOME WHAT NEW TO THE BLUES SCENE,YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ALBUM(CD)THIS IS AN AWSOME PIECE OF WORK BY MR.

There is little debate the EC is one of the fastest and cleanest guitar players around. Also, there is little debate that BBKing is at the apex of blues guitarist. He has many prodigies, but it's tough to take away from a master who's done so much for so long.Now, these two combine in a ripping, soulful, engaging collection that is as amazing for the vocals (the voices are unmistakeable, even for someone without the jewelbox)as it is for the guitar riffs.Great addition to any collection, with a mix of fast and slow, new and old.It's just about magical. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"for music lovers","review":"I have never been a blues fan until I purchased Doyle Bramhall II's \\"Jellycream.\\" Today, I listened to \\"Riding with the King\\" for the first time, and all I can say is, WOW! You don't need to be a raving blues fan to love this genre of music. The guitar playing on Riding is excellent. The songs come in a diverse variety, from big-band sound, to solemn bluesy sunday afternoons. I purchased this album for Bramhall's contributions (I Wanna Be and Marry You), but it took no more than one listen through the album to come to this conclusion: this album will become a classic. It is a must-have for music lovers. Also appearing on the album are Andy Fairweather-Low, who, along with Doyle Bramhall II, are touring with my favorite artist, Roger Waters."},{"rating":"2","title":"my Review","review":"I loved this move. Not only is it a sad love story, but it teaches all teens like myself a wonderful lesson of love and acceptance. it was beautiful and makes you cry of saddness and happiness. I find it impossible not to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"A Walk to Remember is a great movie with excellent plot, character development, and acting. Shane West and Mandy Moore star in this film, portraying the life of two teen lovers journeying with each other on the road of life. West plays the role of Landon Carter, Moore plays as the seemingly ethereal Jamie, the daughter of a Baptist preacher. Landon and Jamie eventually become close friends, and both realize they are in love with each other. After the marriage of Landon Carter and Jamie, the film ends on both a sweet and sad tone.I also enjoy the soundtrack to this film. The music is part of what makes this film great, besides the well-developed storyline and development of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"A Walk to Remember is a classic love story with a caring ending. In this movie, eight-teen year old Landon Carter (Shane West) falls in love with a goody-two-shoes, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore). After Landon put a newly met friend in the hospital, he is sent to do community service. Along the time he spent working, he meets Jamie Sullivan, the girl that changed his life. While helping Landon study lines for the musical, Jamie makes him promise that he will not fall in love with her. Although he says it's not a problem, he falls for her anyway.A Walk to Remember is a truly outstanding movie. I rate this movie a five on a scale from one to five. This true story makes about how love is like an ocean and there is a good side of everybody. Mandy Moore makes this movie an emotional ending that will make you cry. Shane West makes his promise but never kept it and showed and interesting of giving help to those needed. I recommend this dazzling movie as one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Case of Missing the Point","review":"I saw A Walk to Remember after reading the book. The book was quite sweet. It was set in the 50s, which fit the wholesome quality of the characters and theme. The movie, however, attempted to contemporize the story, which turned it into a sappy, unrealistic tale. Key elements of the book were changed just to showcase Mandy Moore's singing, which destroyed much of the storyline's credibility. Also, while the book leaves the ending a bit mysterious, the movie chose to directly stamp out any ambiguity about the fate of Jamie.I really reflected upon this, and I feel I would have hated this movie even if I hadn't read the book. It was too cloyingly sweet, and basically pointless. Don't waste your money buying it or renting it... if you must see it, get it from your local library. And prepare to be disgusted.By the way, I tried to give it no stars, but the website wouldn't accept that. So I give it one star under protest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy.","review":"I bought this DVD on the advice of a few adults, all of whom told me they watched it at least three times and cried. Ugh. I watched it once. Nice, but not moving. Classical teen outcast wants to date the Reverend's daughter. (ho-hum) - a lot of drama could have added to these particular scenes and made the movie at least a bit tense, but this did not happen. So, if you buy this DVD, perhaps your teen will like it. As an adult, skip it, not worth the money and it will keep you yawning. The ending is predictable, the actors/actresses ok but nothing to rave about, and it seems to go slow, as boring movies I guess can do. Truly sappy. Mushy. Cornball. But, as I said, a teen might really like it. We adults maybe have seen too many like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"People who HAVE read the book","review":"Oh my goodness, if you have read the book I can sum up the film in one word -- DISAPPOINTMENT! The title of the book refers to a very important event that DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN THE MOVIE! The whole reason it's called \\"A Walk to Remember\\" is because the main character was in a wheelchair and managed to walk down the aisle to get married -- that's why it was a walk to remember! But, gee, I guess we can't have people in wheelchairs in movies....seeing this movie and hearing that it got good reviews made me sooo MAD! Save your money, buy the book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting - horrible story line - waste of time.","review":"Terrible acting - bad story line and just a waste of time. Horrible from the start and it gets even worse as the movie rolls on. Total trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"SYRUPY MARATHON OF CLICHES","review":"Hard to believe what a director can do with a perfectly decent novel. Nicholas Spark's book of the same name was rendered so shamelessly into a teen weepie that looks like a research effort on all the teen movies of the 90s; it probably has the about a hundred scenes swiped from them to show for itself.Think Love Story, Carrie, the Grease series, etc etc, perhaps all of the names you can think of contributed heavily to this sachharine drivel about a guy and a girl who start out oh-so-at-odds with each other in high school (she's a nerdy choir girl and he a prankster dude, but of course tides turn) and then perfectly predictable events ensue.To its minor credit, the film at least keeps away from typical teen movie gags and goes about its business with a predictable rhythm. It's probably a decent date movie, but not something you'd enjoy too much if you're over 20 (mentally)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"After reading the book a Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks, I was very excited to watch the movie. From the opening scene I was very disappointed. Don't bother watching this if you are expecting it to be anything at all like the book.

This movie was, though really sad, was better than OK. I would give it a 3.5, though I really thought Shane was a really good actor and is totally hot! Mandy Moore makes a great breakthrough in her first big role (played minor role in \\"Princess Diaries\\")! This movie was truly sad, and though I often never cry at movies, I have to admit I got a bit teary-eyed at the theater! The climax is a bit obvious and is forshadowed throughout the novel and the movie. Though I love Mandy, she seemed a bit to optimistic about her problems. But all in all, a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story, worse acting","review":"Ok, tell me if you have heard this story line before: Innocent girl ends up being with the popular,arrogant guy, who shouldn't be with her in the first place. They fall in love, then there's the big secret, blah, blah, blah..... So, have you heard it before? I certaintly have. Except this time, the acting was horrendous. I could not get involved with any of the characters at all. Mandy Moore is a talented person, with a great voice, but she should really stick to what she does best: singing! If you want to see a much better movie with the exact same storyline, watch \\"Here on Earth.\\" The acting is a whole lot better than \\"A Walk to Remember\\", along with a better cast. But if all you want to do is kill some time, this movie is tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST MOVIE!","review":"I just recently have finished reading the book A Walk To remember and then watched it. It is a amazing story of true love and how it can happen to anyone. Jamie Sulivan( Mandy Moore) is the ministers daughter and has lost her mother, Landon Carter (Shane West) is the popular guy who jokes around. Landon ends up getting punished by the principal by having to join the drama club where he meets Jamie. After much struggling he decides to ask Jamie for help. Jamie aggrees as long as he promises not to fall in love with her. Eventually he does but discovers Jamie is sick with Lochiemia.

I have never enjoyed a chick flick in my life, until I saw this movie. I actually cried during this movie, which is unusual for me to do. A sad story, but an even happier one because it shows that its better to love than not to love at all. Everybody and anybody should see this movie, it's great! Plus SHane West listens to OneSideZero on his headphones when he is on the bus. An awesome band! Also Cold's song No One is in the movie. Good Music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This movie makes me cry almost every time I see it. It isn't just a teen flick. I'm sure even 'mature' audiences will understand the story.

But it all changed as Landon ends up doing a school play with Jamie (which was part of his punishment when he and his friends almost had a fellow student killed when that student tried to do a stunt in order to be accepted) and goes through an unforgettable journey with her.Shane West and Mandy Moore (in her 2nd film) both did a bang-up job in their roles they play (I still can't get over how \\"stripped\\" down she looked for that role compared to when I see her now). They really show great chemistry together. I really love this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I love this movie! I didn't get a chance to see it at the movies(I wanted to!). So, I rented it as soon as it came out last week. I loved it, it was so incredibly sweet. That's what true love should be like. I loved it so much that I bought the DVD on Friday and then had to go get the soundtrack on Sunday. I love it too! This is a movie that I will love and cherish forever. I cry like five times during the movie, Mandy Moore is wonderful in it and I now am in love with Shane West! I recommend that you buy both the movie and soundtrack. My only pet peeve with the DVD is there are no deleted scenes:( But the commentary with Shane, Mandy, and Adam Shankman is funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk to remember is a memorable movie","review":"When i first saw the preview trailor i thought oh great another teen movie with another pop star trying to be an actress but let me tell you..mandy moore's performance is really good..in fact it is excellent for a first time actress...shane west is an incredible actor and because of him i beileve that mandy moores performance is even better. the chemistry between them is visible... This movie is based on a nicholas sparks novel...the book is set in 1958 but here it's based in present day..a movie about love, trust, frienship, faith..it's a wonderful and touching movie...loved it..i give in five stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull!!","review":"I thought that this movie was wonderful. It was sweet, sad,and very touching. Mandy Moore and Shane West are both wonderful performers and it was great to see them both starring in this movie. There were no dull or boring parts, and it is a movie that could be watched numerous time. It was the best romance that I have seen in a long time. I would recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Love this movie!!! Now I can watch it whenever I want to. If you have never seen it, watch it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie, Not great extras","review":"A Walk to Remember is a great movie. It's about a kind of reckless guy, Landon, who is popular and causes trouble and whatnot until he meets/falls in love with Jamie Sullivan, the good-doing daughter of the minister. It's such a great love story for teens (mostlikely girls) or adults. It was one of those movies that are just so good after renting it, I just had to go out and buy it. The only thing is the extras are not good and not worth watching, but the movie is just fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good old weepy...","review":"this film is so amazingly brilliant,i saw it at a sleepover with all of my friends, and by the end of it there was not a dry eye in the room. we are not usually a weepy bunch, we thought we'd got an average teen movie when we rented it, but once the plot got underway, we discovered how unbelievably sweet it is and couldn't help crying!even though the main guy is not goodlooking, you are kind of weirdly attracted to him because he is just so so sweet and lovely to her...or maybe that's just me!it was nice to see something different from the american pie type genre i usually watch, so if you'd like a change or just a good old cry, go and watch this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Love Story and a Fresh Twist","review":"I would like to say that I absolutely loved this film. It is a true love story and although it is filmed with teenagers as the core audience, I think it can be enjoyed by anyone. It's mature theme is universal and real. It was truly refreshing to see that even though Jaime and Landon are on different sides of the track, he being \\"cool\\" and her being \\"spiritual\\", Jaime did not let their love compromise her faith and her spirituality. Instead, Landon was the one who grew closer to God. Also, one of the greatest things about the movie is that the writer and the director did not feel the need to demonstrate love and affection through sexual acts which is seen quite often in movies. Love and relationships are more than just that. I would recommend this movie to any hopeless romantic but also to those who are cynical. This movie has changed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Possibly My Favorite Movie","review":"This movie is absolutely amazing. It is definitely in my top three movies of all-time. Just watch it and you will see why it is so special. The DVD is in very good quality and there are some nice bonus features along."},{"rating":"2","title":"clean & sweet","review":"I'm not a teen, I'm a mom of a young teen & it's been hard to find clean movies I feel comfortable enough for her to watch. Yes, I'm protective, but it's not necessary for young adults to be exposed to wrong behavior so constantly. this was perfect. He doesn't fall in love with her for her looks & what he can get out of the relationship. She sees him as better than he thinks he is & grows to become the man she saw him to be. THAT is a great love story. We cried together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must watch to appreciate","review":"First there was \\"Love Story\\". Then there was \\"Ghost\\". Now there is \\"A Walk to Remember\\". I had never heard of Shane West or Mandy Moore but their acting ability to bring this movie to \\"real life\\" is fantastic. I enjoyed this movie very much. Everyone should be able to identify with a school member in one way or another. This is my first viewing of this movie but I'm sure to watch it over and over. But then I identify very much to the plot and the ending. Don't let the title or other opinions decide for you. You must watch to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk to remember","review":"Beautiful. I cry every time I watch it. And I watch it daily. I can recommend it to everyone who wants to see how your behaviour can change other people's life especially when there is love.

Beautiful.............."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LUVED A WALK TO REMEMBER","review":"A Walk to Remember was soooo good! Yes, it was a chick flick, but who cares?!?! IT WAS REALLY GOOD!

Shane West is soooo hott!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie To Remember!","review":"I first watched this movie when I was in college and I loved it .

The whole cast was amazing. I must admit I cried for a long time, even afterwards! Love the music too, especially when Mandy Moore or Jamie Sullivan sings in the springplay. I think some people will find this movie pretty lame, mostly guys. But I still recommend you to see it, it really really touched my heart. The transformation of Landon Carter is very realistic, well done by Shane West! It's good that Jamie Sullivan is so confident and don't care about what other people will think of her! I won't give it away, but when I heard the \\"secret\\" of Jamie Sullivan, the tears was just streaming!I truly love this movie, and I beg you to see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk to remember","review":"Great movie he really did this well I love the music to this film I really love when Mandy Moore sang this song only hope the guy at first was trying to be funny but then I love it when they got together he really did an awesome job with how he cared so much for her and what he did before she past away I won't forget this it was a very good film it came on time and I really love it thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific movie with great values!","review":"I have seen this movie three times over the past year on television and I wanted to order it for my own DVD collection! Great family movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romantic Walk","review":"This movie is one of the most romantic stories I have ever seen. Well, I bought this for my wife, since it's her favorite movie, and I discovered the beautiful tale of two people in love against all odds.Regarding the dvd, is a good product, not many extras (or at least not that interesting) but due the quality of the movie itself it's a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"You know how it feels when you can watch a movie more than once and it's still as touching as the first time watching? That's this movie! It is so beautiful. All the things that love embodies is what this movie is about. Laughter, tears joy, and pain. Love changes us. It makes us better.This film shows how Jamie's kindness and love for Landon helped him to be more than he thought he could be. Landon's love for Jamie gave her peace with her life. Shane West(Landon) and Mandy Moore(Jamie) were perfect fits for their characters. It wasn't overdone at all. I was very pleased with their performances.\\"A Walk to Remember\\" will be a movie that will be part of my library for years to come. And is one that I have and will continue to revisit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"AN INCREDIBLE STORY ABOUT LOVE AND HOPE. I recommend it to anyone looking for a story that'll blow your mind. Best movie I've seen in years; 5 stars. Stupendous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet movie about first love.","review":"Having read this book and loved it, I had no idea what to expect when I went to see the movie. I was especially uneasy about the movie being transplanted into the 90's, I felt it could lose a great deal in translation. Happily, my fears were unfounded. Instead of bowing to all the traditional bents of a teen movie, A Walk to Remember stayed sweet and touching, just like the book.Mandy Moore is excellent as Jamie, the goody-two shoes misfit with a big heart. She brings the character alive in a way strikingly similar to how I imagined her. Shane West, meanwhile, has a most memorable performance here, as Landon Carter, first as a member of the in crowd, who has no plans for life beyond weekends and then as a young person in love.Sweet, touching, and emotional, this is a beautiful movie. And whether or not it is considered a \\"teen\\" movie, I highly recommend it to people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"a journey through love","review":"This movie explains how two people with two totally different personalities can fall in love so easily. This movie takes you through a journey of love, faith, hope, and through all the hardships of being different. Landon Carter(shane west) plays the bad boy teenager who has quite and edgy part to him. Jamie Sullivan (mandy moore) plays the sweet church girl who believes that everything happens for a reason. Throughout the movie you'll hear her say, \\"Maybe God...\\". Mandy Moore and Shane West did and excellent job in this movie and I don't think they could have picked a better actor and actress to play the part. This is definately the best movie I have ever seen because it's just so sad and I like those kinds of movies. Before you sit down to watch this movie grab five boxes of tissues!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie of the next three Generations","review":"\\"A Walk To Remember I beleive will be the movie of the next three generations this week I have watched it like 5 times a day and still have not gotten sick of it this is not only appealing to teens but to adults to chidren and to teens.

It was awesome:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk to Forget","review":"Let see how this movie goes. One guy for some reason jumps of the tower to the water and breaks his leg. That is the end of this plot. Next plot, there is a girl who walks around in one sweater. Another guy falls in love with her. His father is a doctor. The girl is poor. Then the girl got sick with leukemia. Doesn't that sound like reincarnation of the \\"Love Story\\" with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal? Yes, it is, but a very bad one. This movie is just horrible. Don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A [Movie] Not To Remeber","review":"I thought this was the STUPIDEST movies of all times! Mandy, I have to admit, did really great. I HATED Shane West. He was a bad actor. It should have been rated PG-13. They pushed the limit. Not worth your time. A LOT of language, and drama. If you were to rent the DVD, think of it as a PG-13 movie.

Having read and loved the book. I was expecting something more along the lines of The Notebook film, but this isn't. Dissapointing as it could have been a great film.

I wasn't impressed with the book, either, but the way the movie just took an idea or two out of the book and left anything even remotely good out of it is just plain wrong. \\"Based on the novel\\" is saying it in the loosest of terms.Acting is downright horrible, and the essence of the characters from the book is completely missing. Modernizing the story probably did more harm than good to the movie, as the story is about the simplicity and the power of love, which can't be portrayed with today's problems of the youth.Simply put, it is a bad movie, and that's two hours of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully Boring !!!!","review":"This movie simply is boring and I had hard time to remain awake.

I've heard so much about the movie and people are starting to rag on me, having not yet seen it. It's an added bonus that it's on Amazon Prime! And let me tell you, what a gift that is, because I do not recommend that you watch this video ever.Now just because I don't fancy it doesn't mean you won't. After all, look at the average rating; 4.6 stars. That's a pretty ace rating.What I dislike in this film is how unrealistic it is. I suppose it is meant to be romantic--bad boy meets good girl, girl changes boy, boy falls in love because he is spoiled and oppressed and girl is \\"different\\", girl has tragedy, CAN BOY OVERCOME OBSTACLE FOR LOVE?The answer is yes, ladies and gentleman. Mr Boy here will be the most absolute prince handsome charming gentleboy any dying girl could ever want.Sure, it sounds sarcastic. But that's the movie. It's an angsty waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Movie To Forget","review":"I rented this based on it's amazon good reviews.

Jamie (Mandy Moore) played a preacher's daughter with inner beauty and dreams. Landon (Shane West) played a hot bad boy but was different from everyone else. They both were beautiful and at the end, I cried, but most people who've seen this movie probbly did the same, I bet. Me, being a normal teenage girl, has no problems with these emotions, so just let it all out, k? :*() I highly recommend this movie to just about anyone.

It is one of those movies that tend to stay with you through out a lifetime, such as; The Godfather, Gone With The Wind, Fireproof, The Notebook... and so many others have stayed with me. I can usually figure out the entire plot of the movie before the first quarter has even played, BUT not this one! It had a surprising twist in it that left me in tears.

This movie is amazing: the cast is perfect, the scenes are perfect, and the music is amazing!

This movie has without a doubt changed my life...on how I look at people, never again am I to judge a person before I know them!

It was the best romance novel I've ever read. I watched the movie the next day. It was so fabulous and Mandy did better than I ever suspected she could do, and I am an actress. A MUST SEE"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the absolute best movie in the world!","review":"After I saw this movie in the theater, i couldnt stop thinking about this movie for days. A Walk to Remember is sweet and touching. Mandy Moore and Shane West do an awesome job, and they make the movie so wonderful. I love this movie from the bottom of my heart. It is so good, if you watch it 50 times, you will never tire of it. 5*s for this movie! Take my advice and rent this movie. You will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more than 5 stars!!!","review":"This is definately not another teen movie. In most movies with romance, the relationship is based on sex and nothing else. In this movie there is none of that, and only romance. Jaimie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is very spiritual and is invisible to the character of Shane West. But of course he realizes that love isn't all about looks, its about how you feel on the inside. At the beggining all he cares about is what his friends think. But he is forced to join the Drama club with Jaimie and gets the lead role. At the performance Jaimie looks so beautiful and sings a beautiful songs that makes him realize how wrong he was about her. He slowly looks into the depths of his heart and soul and quickly forms a deep relationship with Jaimie. And then something terrible happens that will turn things upside down. This movie is a definate TEAR-JERKER and pretty much a CHICK FLICK and surely a ROMANCE. Even the toughest of people will start to cry like a baby in the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper","review":"This is a good, clean movie.. a good mother/daughter movie. But be warned, it's a tear-jerker. Even so, you'll want to watch it more than once. It's just that good. Definately touches the heart. For any age. I'm 51 and like to watch it once or twice every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE W/ MEANING","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. It has love and so much more as a young man learns there is more to life than silly high school stuff. He learns a great lesson in life to go for what you want. Even though he loses his true love, it's still a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, so-so dvd","review":"The movie itself was amazing! I cried my eyes out, and Mandy Moore and Shane West were absolutely incredible. If you haven't seen the movie you're missing out. However, I felt that the dvd could have been better. It didn't offer very many special features. There weren't any deleted scenes, outtakes, or behind-the-scenes featurettes. There was a music video, a trailer, and two commentaries. In my opinion, that's not enough to buy the dvd instead of the vhs. So, you should see the movie, but just be on the lookout for sale prices!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never saw it.","review":"I didn't watch the movie because you never sent it. Plus I wanted to buy not rent, your web sight was to tough for me to navigate, I will not buy or rent from you again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"This movie was way too sappy and predictable. I think the idea of the movie was sweet, but it's already been done and re-done... Though Shane West is undeniably good looking and appealing as the bad boy w/a good heart, the idea of such a character is as fictional as the unicorn. Not to mention, how many movies have the \\"nerdy\\" girl that everybody picks on, then voila, she's beautiful, just add make up and a new hair do (I wish it was that easy for me in high school)! I felt the emphasis on Christianity and faith was laid on way too thick. It bordered on preachy. Not to mention they throw in the inevitable tear jerker: \\"I'm dying...\\". The movie tried way too hard to tug at heartstrings.I give it an extra star for Landon's classic Camaro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on the movie if you liked the book","review":"I think if you read the book before the movie you will hate the movie. So many of the wonderful moments that are in the book between Landon and Jamie arent in the movie.First off the movie is set in present day but has a 50's feel to the clothing which is really cheesy. In the book Landon was a somewhat \\"bad boy\\" because he didnt take school seriously and was a smart mouth, bad by 1950's standards. In the movie they made him be malicious to other people to make him \\"bad\\".The sweet story of the penny jar and the presents for the orphanage is left out, which I really enjoyed from the book.This is an awful version of a book to movie. If you liked the book I would really pass on this movie it will just frustrate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shady, sad","review":"At first the darkness, cursing and foolish stunt leaving one boy nearly dead was just BAD, better to have left it out. The rest of the movie is an honest effort to actually have a healthy love story, but is stopped by illness. Dark, shady and sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE TO REMEMBER!!!!","review":"I absolutey loved this movie. It really shows the good in people. Mandy Moore and Shane West do a wonderful job acting as well as the other performers in the show. I love chick-flicks that aren't all about getting a cute guy. It really has a deeper meaning to it. Also, any guys out there reading this? Watch this movie, because this is what girls would love a guy to do for her. I rated this movie a five because it truey is a movie to remember!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!","review":"OMG This movie was awseum! I really thought Mandy Moore was going to ruin it, since she's never acted before, but she was BEAUTIFUL!! I really recomend this movie, just bring a gallon box of tissues, cause even if your the strongest person, you will cry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What i think of \\"A walk to remember\\"","review":"The book \\"A Walk to Remember\\" was definently one of my favorite books. After I had read the book I read the movie and I actually liked the book more because it was so much more in detail. I liked the way the author let the reader know of how all the characters were thinking constantly until the very end. I would recomend this book to every girl out there because it is kind of a love story of two people falling in love unexpectatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Romance","review":"If you like romances, then you should definetely buy this movie. This is not a regular romance though. I am not a big fan on romances, but anyone who watches this and thinks it's bad is crazy! It is about a high school kid who has to play in a play at school because he was caught drinking on school grounds. Well, anyway, he has trouble with his lines and he needs a little help learning them. He goes straight to the girl who has no trouble learning her lines. Before they can do anything, though, he has to promise NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. Well, you can pretty much guess he does. But, she tells him not to fall in love with her because an unexpected incident takes place. Mandy Moore and Shane West play a break through performance in this ROMANCE/DRAMA. It is such a good movie you will watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a movie to remeber always","review":"I really love this movie. i have already bought it, my husband bought me the soundtrack for my birthday, and i just ordered the book. i found it to be not only entertaining but inspirational and thought provoking. a teen movie with values. it is totally awesome. i feel like my life is much richer as a result of this movie. i am a very religious person and this movie made me feel closer to G-d and to nature. i even look at the stars more and appreciate them more. i think this is one of the greatest movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNFORGETTABLE","review":"I read the book \\"A Walk to Remember.\\" Shane West and Mandi Moore did exceptional jobs at making these characters come to life. For an acting debut, Mandi Moore was excellent in the role of Jamie and captured Jamie's innocence beautifully. Shane West shows enormous range as an actor in this role as he comes of age in this beautiful story. I am hoping to see him in many future roles. It is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again and in some way, will become a part of you. It will lift your spirits, and take your breath away."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing movie","review":"This movie is really great. I specially enjoyed the last half of the movie.

Basically Landon Carter is the most popular boy at school, and Jamie Sullivan is the totally non-cool pastor's daughter...yet they fall in love. In a subtle but powerful way, Jamie influences those around her, causing relationships to be restored and even the worst kids at school are changed.Though the movie is also good, I think the producers created a less innocent and not as sweet Jamie.

I watched this movie before I started reading Nicholas Sparks. This movie prompted me to start reading his work. I started with \\"A Walk...\\" the book. And even though it's a lot different from the book, I appriciate both for being great stories. Both of them are good stories, and I think the adaptation of this one rings true to the book. They are different time settings - the book and the novel - but most of what Nicholas wrote stays with the movie. You'll be blown away by Shane West and Mandy Moore. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll find yourself being moved.

She said it was her favorite movie. During that five-day rental, even though she had already seen it enough to memorize all of the songs, she watched it at least twice a day (she would have watched it more had she been allowed). She was also still asking questions and learning lessons. Between the sweet storyline and the good music, I couldn't believe it, but I wasn't sick of it either.

This is by far the sappiest movie I've seen in years. It has all of the classic elements of sap: boy and girl from mutually exclusive social realms fall in love and one of them dies at the end (hmmm just like Rome and Juliet, West Side Story, Titanic, and a myriad of other stories with the same plot). This movie piles on the sap extra thick at every turn. For those reviewers who thought that this was a good teen movie, all I can say about that is, \\"You've got to be kidding me.\\" This movie is as non-intellectual and unrealistic as many of those mindless movies that the film industry targets at teenagers. If you like total sap, then this movie might be for you. For those of you like a movie with substance, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Sappy","review":"This is just a complete mass of incredibly sappy people acting in a completely sappy movie...my friend cried, but i thought it was pretty stupid.

I mean, yeah she dies. just say so and get it over with...don't drag it out for 45 years. I mean, you can pretty much guess what's gonna happen. We predicted a lot of things that happened. I guess if you like this sort of movie, it'd be ok...certainly not for guys! My friend says that it would be a good girlfriend/boyfriend movie, if the boyfriend was REALLY patient.

Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy turns his life around and has life-changing experiences because of girl. Sound familiar? It's only been done about a million times. This is as cliche as it gets.The story is incredibly weak. The characters love each other, hate each other, and love each other again from one scene to the next. The plot is very, very flimsy to say the least. Oh, and the acting is horrendous. Even the high school play didn't look acted well enough to have been real.Like I said, the plot is weak, but at least there is a good moral to the story, and at least it's clean. It has a touching ending, with everyone loving each other and living in perfect harmony, but that just isn't enough for me. If you're like me--if you want an actual plot in the movies you watch--you might want to avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This was obviously a movie for the \\"Dawson's Creek\\" crowd of teenagers.

But this movie does not do her justice. I think the problem was the whole story line. Way too unbelievable and yet predictable at the same time. I admit some things were really cute and romantic but there were so many loose ends at the end of the film that I am still left wondering - \\"What's with the stupid sweater!!!?\\" I kept thinking throughout the movie that perhaps they would explain that it was her mom's and that's why she wore it all the time but NO! There WAS no explanation whatsoever! Truly frustrating. Also, the scene in the school play where she sings - oh yes she's got a beautiful voice but songs in plays don't usually go on and on for THAT long. Weird! There's much more I could say if I watched it again but I couldn't - I just couldn't subject myself to another viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk to remember","review":"I rented this movie because it has always been one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books turned movie.

The story is simple enough - a bad-boy (West) comes together with the good-girl (Moore) daughter of the town's Minister (Peter Coyote). They have nothing in common, so everybody who knows each of them must do their utmost to keep them apart. The comedic possibilities obviously eluded the script which plays up the story's romantic aspects and keeps it straight (never going for the quirks that make \\"Gilmore Girls\\" such a treat) by relentlessly tugging at your heartstrings. I know that we've been deluged by crude-teen flicks, but even \\"American Pie\\" was smarter and had more heart than this confection which shamelessly sends you in search of a box of Kleenex and offers nothing in return."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"I think this movie is very good.

There is no dialogue whatsoever and music plays throughout the film which lasts about about an hour. There are three girls living in a farmhouse. They look to be 19, 18, and 15. The main plot development is that the 18 year old keeps sneaking off to have sex with her boyfriend. Otherwise, we see the girls sleeping, waking, washing, and riding their bikes through the countryside.

The middle solo that Sparks and Galas used to give & take on is noticeably missing. And lacking. And Barden cannot range the lyrics as before. Plus the song selection basically sucks.

Stephen Moore is on Diane Rehm today, June 17 2009, telling listeners how global warming is a bunch of baloney. If the guy, who claims to be an economist, was so 'bullish on Bush' in 2004, and was so wrong on the consequences of Bush policies, why is he put on the airwaves to blow hot air on climate change? These Republican supporters go from causing one train wreck to creating another."},{"rating":"1","title":"70 Year Conservative Fight","review":"The 70 year old conservative ideological fight against the Social Security Act is now incorporating the usual metaphors we've come to expect from this Administration: \\"train wreck,\\" \\"bankruptcy,\\" \\"cancer,\\" etc. As long ago as the late 30's, conservatives claimed it would bankrupt the nation. Then it was Barry Goldwater's turn in the 60's, then Reagan's in the 80's. All took their shot at it, but none have come as close to transforming this great program than Bush. All someone needs to do to determine the validity of Bush's claims is to carefully read the 225-page annual report of the Social Security trustees to see that the system is probably in need of a small adjustment (such as those Congress has approved in the past) but the system IS SOLVENT AS IT IS!This book is merely the P.R. hatchet-job by an Administration hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated bore of a book","review":"I bought this book having enjoyed Moore on TV many times. However, Moore should stick to TV as this rambling, one-sided, economics disaster-of-a-book put me to sleep on three different occasions. The foreword by Larry Kudlow (who I'm not impressed with on TV) definitely got things off on the wrong foot as Moore ran with this book the rest of the way. Too bad he was running into the wrong end zone. Very disappointing, considering how short the book was. Too much GOP cheerleading, too little objective analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road to Bad Economics Ideas","review":"Sad, very sad. Despite the facts on the failures of the Bush administration, Moore is still lost in the wilderness. The WSJ needs some new faces as well as some people with new ideas if we are going to work our way out of this mess, only some of which can be blamed on Bush. The rest of blame goes to people like Moore that have helped to produce this free market financial disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"As simple as that, it is just another boring world-music/lounge CD.

I had high hopes after finding out it was similar to the old Car Wash movie - which I love and highly recommend - and then I saw that Snoop and Dre were in it... then it just wasn't that funny or really even attention holding.I recommend the Friday Trilogy, Little Man (which was a surprise!), and the OG-triple-OG Car Wash with Richard Pryor for some really funny stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wash","review":"People cant be too critical of this movie, just a little comedy with Dre and Snoop as the main characters.The story wasnt really nothing special, but it was still quite funny. This movie has its funny moments, like when Dre has the girl over and Snoop turns up the music and they keep doin it back and forth. Also when Snoop tells off Dre when hes tryin to sell weed to people at the wash. I recommend this movie to fans of Snoop or Dre, and fans of comedy of course. Im not being critical of this movie because its not that type of movie to be really criticized.In alot of comdedies, I usually dont laugh at the stupid stuff, but this movie actually made me laugh quite a bit because of how they act so check this movie out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this movie!","review":"I don't see how anyone could give this movie five stars.

It stars Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and George Wallace, and features people like Ludacris, Eminem and Xzibit. It's not as good as Friday but it's ten times better then Next Friday. Snoop and Dre each hold thier own in it, but Eminem is wack as hell just like in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This movie was a total waste of my time. I went to see this movie thinking I was going to have some laughs but was terribly dissapointed.

Possibly one of the funniest movies I've seen, the part where Eminem makes death threats to Mr. Washington has to be the most hilarious part in the scene (the first time he makes the call is the best bit!) The movie also stars heaps of rappers too! If you're in for a laugh, this is the video for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Friday","review":"I recently watched The Wash on DVD the other night and I was kinda disappointed by it.

BESIDE SNOOP PLAYING A TERRIBLE FRIEND TO DRE AND DRE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR HIMSELF AND HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE DOING IT THERE REALLY WAS NO STORYLINE. THE ONLY FUNNY PARTS IS WHEN MR. WASHINGTON (GEORGE WALLACH) GETS DEATH THREATS FROM CHRIS (EMINEM) A FORMER EMPLOYEE. I WOULD TELL YOU TO WAIT TILL IT COMES TO CABLE SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"I thought this movie was going to be hilarious, being dr. dre & snoop dogg were in it. but it's poorly done, not even funny really. snoop & dre should just stick to the music business! this flick does'nt even come close to ice cube's fridays flicks. just beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS SO FUNNY?","review":"IN THIS MOVIE, SEAN [DR.

MAN, FIRST OFF, WHAT WAS SO FUNNY ABOUT THIS MOVIE? AND WHY DID IT EVEN GO TO THEATRES IN THE 1ST PLACE? I MEAN, THERE IS VERY FEW FUNNY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE. IT'S BASICALLY A BUNCH OF RAPPERS AND OUT OF WORK ACTORS TRYIN TO MAKE A MOVIE, WITH TERRIBLE RESULTS. THIS MOVIE HAS CAMEOS BY SHAQUILLE O NEAL, PAULY SHORE, LUDACRIS, EMINEM, AND DJ POOH. IF YOU WANT A BETTER COMEDY ABOUT A CAR WASH, RENT OR BUY CAR WASH."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the plot","review":"I watched this expecting some type of storyline, but got nothing. This movie was a waste of time and somebody's money. The acting was horrible. DJ Pooh, who everyone knows co-wrote, needed some help on this one. He tried with failed on 3 Strikes as well, but that was funnier. Even George Wallace couldn't save this sorry piece of \\"art.\\" The soundtrack is better than the movie. They should've just given the movie with the soundtrack instead of the other way around. The only reason why I gave this 2 stars is 1 star each for Snoop & Dre for what they are really good doing: making music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protected???","review":"Three thumbs down for some kind of copy protection...that won't play in my Toshiba sd2700!

Movie was boring and wasn't funny..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to NOT remake a Classic","review":"This movie, though saw on bootleg, wasn't even worth the dvd it was burned on. The writer ,DJ Pooh, who hasn't written a really good movie since \\"Friday\\" should've known that superstar rappers can't save a doomed storyline. While the concept was a good one, well as good as you can get when someone mentions remake, it needed a complete overall.Dr Dre's character was just down right pathetic.It seemed as if Dre didn't even want to be in the flick, perhaps that contributed to this stale comedy. His character and Snoop's character were so mismatched as friends that I wondered through the whole movie why Dre's character even knew Snoop's let alone lived with him.The only thing funny about this waste of creative energy was DJ Pooh as one of the kidnappers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Wack","review":"Snoop had some funny lines but overall this film is at best a direct to Video type of film.this film in no way should be compared to Car Wash at all it ain't even close.this film is surrounded with a 2ns tier cast of Comedians overall to me.I dig George Wallace He had some moments.Eminem did nothing for this clunker.Dr.Dre has no Screen Pressence He tries to hard.Music is His Strength not Making Film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"Before I watched this movie I expected lackluster acting but a funny script as it was written by DJ Pooh (Friday). I was right about the acting, which was bad. Dre bored me the whole time he was on screen, and Snoop was OK I guess (but wasn't this supposed to be a comedy?) - DJ Pooh did make me laugh a few times at his character, the dumb kidnapper. The plot was basically wack, and the movie just ends suddenly, and you think...what JUST happened? is that it?!! Don't bother spending money on this, but wait for it to come on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Whack!!!","review":"Ok the title was lame like this movie but give me a break!!!

I recommend skipping the intro (gives away too much) and reading the glossary in the back first. Read it before you see \\"Castaway\\".

It's a fast read and appealed to me even though it may be a guy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, but would like more opinionated text","review":"I bought this guide, plusMoon Northern California Camping: The Complete Guide to Tent and RV Camping (Moon Outdoors)andFoghorn Outdoors California Hiking: The Complete Guide to More Than 1,000 Hikes (Foghorn Outdoors). I like that it specializes in No. Calif. I wish it were a little more opinionated and would highlight the MUST-SEE attractions, e.g., see this/don't bother with that/that's a MUST-SEE/that's a little hokey.

Since I routinely read 10-15 books per week, I gulped it down . . . only to experience the mental equivalent of heartburn.After I finished the book, I felt sorry for Mr. Helfgott, not because of his emotional problems but because he's apparently married to an overcontrolling, patronizing, astrology lover. I wondered what unexplained dynamics in the relationship gave Mrs. Helfgott the power to decide what her husband should eat, chew, smoke, and do.I also came away from my reading quite perplexed, wondering what Mr. Helfgott's diagnosis was and what occurred during the many years of treatment that are glossed over in the text.I've never seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely magnificent","review":"I play piano myself.

My plea to the record companies and R. Kelly is to continue to SNEAK a project like this into our lives. It's a private obsession for those for those in the church who sneak and listen to secular music...LOL!

I feel like the author tried to target 13 year old boys with this style of writing. One of the great appeals of the World of Darkness is that you never know what's going on around you. The methuselahs are supposed to be shady characters whom you never see and may not actually exist. In these books, almost a dozen of them are running around. The younger vampires are more common than normal people in the story. The characters were often one dimensional and stereotypical. If you want to buy a comic book with no pictures, get this series. Otherwise, take a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rock\`n\`roll Masterpiece","review":"Probably their best album.

A few hours in the company of Piper, her delightfully loony family and her elf-friend Aelvarim will make you feel like you just had a vacation. So indulge. It contains no calories, no artificial ingredients and though some of us regret the great lack of elf nudity, it does make the book rather wholesome. Probably good for you, actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Lame","review":"I am a great fan of character fantasy where the novel features one main hero or heroine and generally sticks to his or her point of view. It gives a unique bias that you can only find inside another persons' head. Unfortunatley, the main character of Eccentic Circles, Piper, has no definete opinion on anything throughout the whole plot except to say, \\"Oh my, I'm confused and upset.\\" Piper lacks the conviction of a real personalitiy and therefore the entire story comes off as lame, weak, and underdeveloped. With no real goals or emotion, Piper ambles through a mystical world and has virtually no reaction except to giggle and the horribly cliche comic releif. If you were reccommended this book after reading such dynamic novels such as \\"Daughter of the Forest\\", \\"War of the Oaks\\", or \\"Kushiel's Dart\\", do not waste your time with this book. While faintly amusing, it does not measure up to the greater works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Adult Read to Satisfy the Adult","review":"I think I was told this was a young adult book, but I am in love with the Fae so I had to give it a try. I LOVE it. I am definitely going to look for other work from this author. The book moved at a nice steady pace and for only 200 something pages, you were not left needing more detail. Everything was nicely filled in. Now as an adult, this ended WAY to fast. I would have like to seen more of that happily ever after story with the elf Aelvarim (sp) and the human Piper.

They have released two songs from their latest CD (!ZUMBALE!MARIA) AND (BAILA CONMIGO). I think the response to these songs have been good,if you can find CD or tape, once the stores get them they are gone. I had to reserve one so I could get one. I don't know if their record company realizes what they have or if I'm just too anxious to see them move up. They are a young group and have time to move up.

The usual Streetwise quality is evident in this map; the only quibble I have with it is the rather odd orientation. Thanks to the fact that all Streetwise have to fit into their standard rectangle shape, and the somewhat unusual shape of Toronto means that in order to fit it in, it has to be oriented with north nowhere near \\"up\\". Once you get used to that, though, you have a dandy, sturdy map of Toronto, including the TTC subway lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD AS A GPS AND CHEAPER","review":"The first thing I like about the Streetwise Maps is that they are laminated. No need to worry about getting them wet, dirty, smudgy and having to replace them. When you buy one for a particular city, it should last for years. It's even possible to use a dry erase marker and simply wipe clean.The map includes all pertinent details of the city, including of course, the streets, hospitals, shopping malls, businesses, museums and landmarks that you would otherwise not know about using a GPS system. If you have a GPS in your car, it's not much good if you're flying to different cities. These maps can be ordered ahead of time and just put them in your briefcase.

Most of all they made my skin crawl to even here the ways they sang the songs. My all time fave U2 song \\"With or Without You\\" when Bono sings it brings tears to my eyes his voice is so beautiful. This guy on this tribute did the same; it was tears of pain and my ears hurt too. This is a BAD tribute. No pun intended using the word \\"BAD\\" which of course die hard U2 fans know is a U2 song.

They marry and this fellow gets off staring at her through a peep hole while she undresses. But the viewer never sees anything whatsoever except for her taking off like 2 underskirts and she still has the clothes piled on her. Then we see him getting off as she trims his nose hairs and his eyes are rolling to the back of his head in arousement.

The first time through I was captured by the total presentation; verbal and visual images combined. The minimalist technique is very effective since it allows you time to process the underlying meaning which you are always groping for in this film. Virgil is an unglamorous hero, but his morality is always on the line and being tested strongly as he copes with the harshness of his environment. One wonders about the source of his resolve and conviction. He is above all human however and cannot escape the overwhelming forces that surround him and try to destroy him at every turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and Ugly Film","review":"No one is redeemed in this film.

I also got annoyed with the banter and music.Once I got well in to my third trimester I found I didn't want to do my tougher workouts and gravitated towards this DVD. I just turned down the volume all the way and played my iPod instead and I found it a nice way of getting some strength training in. I wouldn't say it made me sore at all but I felt good doing something over daily walks. I'm due in 2 weeks and I'm still doing the workout a few days a week. I also bought a prenatal vinyasa DVD and long and lean which are more challenging, long and lean being the best quality DVD. All 3 have been a good mix over the last 9 plus months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy workout, Sanders is fun!","review":"Easy to follow, such that you will feel that you can do it and will do it.

I really like that there are different workouts for each trimester because your capabilities change during different stages of pregnancy.

It also has a longer video 60 min and an express video 30 min."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little too easy","review":"Overall, I like this DVD. It's lacking on the cardio side. I know I'm pregnant but I don't need to take it as easy as they make it out on here. The one thing I don't like is that the trainer sets up pillows, gives her water, and the band throughout the work out. I don't have someone there doing that for me so I feel a little rushed at times. Other that that this is a good DVD overall....I'm in my third trimester but still do the second trimester workout....it is the hardest one but still what I do on my easy days. My hard days (when I have the time is Hot Mamas and Erin O'Brien's (my favorite))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good workout","review":"This workout DVD is pretty good, but I like Autumn Calabrese's 9 Months of Fitness and the Lindsay Brin series way better. The latter two incorporate more cardio with strength/toning and are a better workout for someone who wants to still be challenged during pregnancy. I find Summer to be a bit annoying in this video as well, but it does offer an overall decent workout if you are looking for just strength and toning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I am an active person, this video gave me a good workout throughout my pregancy.

This is by far my least favorite, although there are some great leg and butt exercises (at least in the first trimester session). The actual workout is on the easy side. I find Summer and her sister-in-law trainer to be obnoxiously goofy - and I've dealt with three rounds of Tony Horton in P90X - so I can handle goofiness! I will continue to do this DVD in my workout rotation (on low energy days) but will put it on mute and play my own music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This is my first pregnancy, and first prenatal DVD. I really appreciate that she has this video broken into a workout for each trimester, and that there is an express & full length workout version (though I've not used the express workout yet). I find Summer to be down to earth, and energetic without being annoying. My only complaint at all, is that I wish there was an additional workout option for days when you really have alot of energy. I am in my second trimester now, and find myself doing step-ups as I follow the arm excersizes on the video, just to add a little extra work for myself. I do like the length of the workouts though- I think they run 45 minutes or so for the full length version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Prenatal Workout","review":"I was pretty in shape prepregnancy. I ran a few times a week and lifted weights, although mostly focusing on my upper body. This DVD was quite a challenge for me, though! I began by only doing the shortened version (30 minutes with warm up and cool down). I was sore for 2 days afterward. I really felt like a I was getting a workout. After a few sessions of the 30 minute workout I stepped it up to the full length (60 minute) workout. It is still a challenge for me, but it feels great. There is a great combination of legs, back, arms, and abs that makes for a complete workout. My only complaint is that the 60 minute workout is basically a repeat of the 30 minute workout. You do two cycles of the same workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun pregnancy workout!","review":"This is a fun pregnancy workout. The only problem was it uses resistance bands which I don't have but I substituted using no weight and also 3 pound weights. It moved quickly and has variety which is nice. I felt sore the next day but didn't feel strained while doing the video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT video!","review":"I LOVE this video! I've tried several prenatal workout videos, and this one is the best to keep me motivated. It's real and Summer is funny- like working out with friends who keep you moving when it starts to burn. I feel awesome after this work out! I also recommend Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga to alternate during the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout for All Three Trimesters","review":"This workout will not help you lose weight (not the point of a pregnancy workout), but will help you maintain tone and overall physical condition, so that you'll be ready to go after the baby is born. I love that you get 3 workouts in one, though I used this only during my 2nd and 3rd trimester. I like that there is an express workout option (30 mins) or a full length (20 mins). I was in fairly good shape before, and I find the workouts challenging, but not overly so. Plus, they explain ways that you can make it easier throughout the DVD.Summer Sanders is a bit chatty, it didn't bother me a bit the first time, but I suppose it could get annoying if you do only this DVD since it'll be the same comments each time. I have 3 different DVDs so that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout.","review":"I exercised somewhat before my pregnancy, mostly jogged and ran on treadmill. So was bummed that couldn't run while preggers. Purchased this video, LOVE THAT ITS SEPARATED IN TRIMESTERS. So far I've done the first trimester, going on my second and have to say, it's a good workout. Theres express and full version. I love that exercise focuses on butt, legs, arms, shoulders, and abs, yes, even abs. I showed my doctor and doctor said perfectlly healthy and recommends. I really think this video will stay in shape, so far my butt is showing for it :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Prenatal toning....love it!","review":"I have to say that I am always skeptical of work out dvds...I have tried several and they are all the same. I opted to try this one as I was desperate to have a dvd at home and I was very pleasantly surprised.First, the chemistry between Summer and the trainer, Keri is awesome. So real and honest. You feel as though you are standing right next to them.Second, its a perfect supplement to my cardio at the gym. It focuses on toning and toning right. When the baby comes and my gym time becomes limited, the dvd will continue to be in my routine. Its easy, yet challenging and in 45 minutes you have completed an entire body work out.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, but be careful with abs","review":"I purchased this workout because it seemed to have a lot of good reviews and I wanted to do a workout that was safe during pregnancy, even during the iffy first trimester. Today I went to my doctor (I am about 5.5 weeks) and I mentioned that I was doing this video which included crunches, and he said he doesn't recommend doing any type of ab work, so now I know to lay off this portion of the video.. otherwise I am pretty sore the next day (Definitely feel it in my butt!) just be careful with the abs part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"The doctor told me if I don't exercise don't start but I use to stand 8 hours at my job and was moving around burning calories. Now I stay at home because we moved to another country so I wasn't doing anything but sitting on the couch. I started the program and it's super easy it starts off not advanced like most exercise movies and it's easy to follow. It has 1st trimester 2nd trimester and 3rd trimester! So you don't have to worry about straining yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So annoying!","review":"Given the many positive reviews for this dvd, I was expecting a bit more. Although the dvd gives you variability in workouts depending on your trimester, I found Summer Sanders to be extremely annoying. She constantly prattles on about \\"your booty\\" and other such nonsense which is a huge detractor. I wish she came with a mute button! I found myself becoming more and more irritated through my workout and often turned off the dvd player before being done. If you can, rent this dvd through your local library before purchasing to see if you can tolerate Summer enough to stomach her on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Prenatal workout video","review":"Absolutely love this video!

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout","review":"Picked this up after I got through the 1st trimester blahs. I love how the video is split up by trimester and exercises are modified by where you are at in your pregnancy. Also tried the quick workout which wasn't really that quick (it was still 45 minutes long, maybe about 10 minutes less than the normal workout) but I think I actually liked that one just as much if not better than the normal workout. This DVD is a good buy: the exercises push you just enough, it's entertaining and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not EASY","review":"This is my third pregnancy workout video and by far my favorite. I'm in my second trimester and finally had to give up running last week as it was just too uncomfortable. I continue to walk as much as possible but wanted something more - this video is it. Coming from someone who exercises regularly, this workout is not easy. My other videos are only about 20 minutes long and left me feeling like I hadn't done anything - not this one. The second trimester workout is a full 50 minutes long and challenging, left me sore the next day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Video wouldn't play on our DVD machine....","review":"I bought this DVD due to all the great reviews it has.

Every time I moved from a standing exercise to a sitting one I would have to re-adjust the computer screen and that's not always the easiest thing to do while being pregnant! Otherwise, I really did feel the burn and thought it was a good work out. I just wish it would play on a regular DVD player!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this video","review":"You cannot skip right to the workouts, that and the fact that the music sounds like Indian techno, makes this video VERY annoying. The workout itself is pretty good, but the fact that you have to go through 2 minutes of ads before getting to it really pi$$es me off. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Annoying-dont waste your money","review":"The ladies in this video are so annoying-the way they talk and joke just so annoying! And this is not even that great of a work out1. In one of the trimester work outs the non prgnant woman is setting up or passing the weights to the pregnant lady so she is quickly ready to go. Me on the other hand doing this workout alone at home have to scramble to get my stuff to be in time for the next set-or u have to pause it-ugh2. In 3rd trimester workout the \\"trainer\\" will say to do something and then prgnt lady will say ok hold on let me stretch-which is weird-this is a workout video pick a direction and give it-it almost feels like she is making things up or adding things in along the way-ugh!3. music is blah4. exercises are not blah-not that greatI really wish I hadnt wasted my money on this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Summers annoying","review":"I do not understand how this dvd gets such good reviews. I have been working out regularly for over a year and am only six weeks along and this video was pretty much a waste of money for me. There is no cardio and in the beginning you don't even get a decent warmup before they start having you stretch. Summer Sanders is super annoying and is basically like \\"look at me trainer\\" when the trainer is trying to show modifications of the exercise. I will keep this in my rotation for a variation on toning exercises, but I need a video that is cardio and toning in one. I don't have time to work out for hours a day. I recommend Erin O' Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix for more advanced exercisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent strength training workout for moms-to-be!","review":"I LOVE this workout! I am an athletic mom-to-be who is trying to stay active and in-shape throughout my pregnancy. I've had trouble with other prenatal workouts not being vigorous enough, but this one's perfect. It's a great all-around strength training workout, with a circuit of moves to tone all major muscle groups. There is 1-hour workout, and a 30-min express workout. The 1-hour workout does the circuit twice; the express only once. You need a resistance band for the workout. There is a brief cardio/warm-up section at the beginning to get your heart rate up, but it's mostly a toning workout. Summer Sanders, and her trainer, Keri Crockett, are pleasant and upbeat. They do a good job leading the workout and are not at all annoying to listen to over and over. I highly recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This is by far one of the best toning pre-pregnancy DVD's I have done. I am pregnant with my second child and I am an avid exerciser. I use this DVD once, maybe twice a week and my arms are so toned! It's not very easy but it is a good workout. I highly recommend this DVD if you are looking for some new exercises to incorporate into your existing workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"I bought this DVD due to all the rave reviews. Sadly, I found it to be annoying. The workout was good but the music bothered me and Summer Sanders is much too chatty. The setting of a large cold living room made me feel uncomfortable. I prefer a more relaxing workout with calming music and professional instructors. I love this one:Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to buy resistance bands!!","review":"I love this video and am in my 20th week of pregnancy...opened the DVD last night and did the second trimester \\"long\\" workout and watched the \\"short\\" workout. My kids joined me (age 4 and 6) it was fun! The steps are basic and easy to do, but also effective and get your heart rate up...the voices/music were not annoying so I would definetly recommend this for others to buy. The only thing that bummed me out was that 75% of the exercises used a resistance band...I didn't know I needed one for the video and would have bought it earlier if I had known."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so ANNOYING!","review":"This has got to be the most annoying workout video I have ever done! I thought Denise Autsin was bad. Summer is so annoying! She talks to her sister-in-law/trainer and thinks she is hilarious. She tries to crack jokes and thinks she is so funny. Her and her SIL's banter is just intolerable.If I do this video again, I will mute the volume and put some decent music on so I dont have to hear Summer.I am so disappointed I bought this. It gets 2 starts because it is a decent workout. It is really long and drawn out, especially the long versions...I would definitely recommend only doing the express workouts. Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.I cant believe there arent more reviews of annoyed viewers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed... not very fluid workout","review":"I purchased several videos and was the leaast impressed with this video. The instructer was not very fluid with her movements and they did not flow together at all. The movements were sharp and instruction was very poor and uninteresting. It felt like one of those skits from Saturday Night Live, where the women are talking on the radio with very bland voices and tones, but not funny at all. I would definately not recommend this for prenatal workout. Perfect Pregnancy Workouts were my absolute favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty great except for 3rd tri","review":"I do this DVD 3-4 times per week. I am currently 30 weeks and have gained 16 lbs. I sleep so much better when I do this DVD and have less pain in my back and hips. It is a great DVD... I love all the squats! Squats are awesome for keeping muscle tone throughout pregnancy. I was disappointed when I went onto the 3rd trimester workout though... it's really easy and that's too bad b/c I've been doing the 2nd tri workout forever and was looking forward to a change. I'll probably just keep doing the 2nd tri workout til I can't anymore... maybe like 36+ weeks I'm thinking. My belly is also a lot smaller than Summer's 2nd tri belly so maybe that's why I'm feeling like the 3rd tri is too easy... I'm still really mobile and rather small for 3rd tri. Definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video!","review":"This video is not only do-able at any level, the commentary between Summer and Kari make you feel comfortable doing this in your living room. I highly recommend this to all my friends and will use this video for the rest of my pregnancy as well as all future pregnancies. Many of the band exercises even kicked my husbands booty! Definitely great to use even post-partum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I'm truly surprised at how much I like this. I'm usually a BeachBody workout kind of girl and this gave me a great workout without too much strain on my back etc. I'm in my second trimester and will do this at least three times a week throughout the pregnancy. I also do yoga twice a week just for relaxation and flexibility reasons"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly challenging","review":"I was extremely skeptical of how much I would get from a prenatal workout. Although the moves alone looked very simple I was happy to find my heart rate was up at the end of the workout and that I was sore the next day. I will definitely continue this video through my pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad. not professional","review":"They talk too much. Pretty much just a repetition of a few exercises. Not good for moms who used to workvout before. Will not even sweat a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring for me..","review":"I used to excercise hardly.. so, during pregnancy i got couple of cd workout all are ok but this one isn't interesting so much especially the full lenghth workout.."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible workout","review":"i only bought this dvd because it came up to the top when i entered \\" prenatal yoga\\". i needed a yoga workout for my trip to france that i could do on my hotel room. i didn't realize that 1. it's not a yoga workout, 2. the dvd starts with a long obnoxious commercial, 3. you need props (bands) to do the exercise and 4. the workout itself it's pretty lame and 5. the instructor is annoying. what a waste! really disappointed that Gaiam would sponsor such a poor quality dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious Commercials Precede Workout Video - No Chapters","review":"I just came back from a run with the intent on heading directly into this workout program. I am using the enormous amounts of time that I have while waiting for all of the GAIAM commercials that precede the actual workout to write this review. There are no chapters on this DVD that allow you to skip right to the workout. I wonder how many times I'll have the patience to sit through their ads while waiting to begin my workout. Insanely annoying. Interesting, apparently the chapters aren't available until after you sit through all of their BS commercials. It's so obnoxious. I already bought your product, why must you inundate me with further ads?!???!?!??!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good weights workout, informal, not a lot of cardio","review":"I bought this DVD for a weights routine, and that is definitely what it is! There is a warmup, and they keep you moving a bit so your heart rate doesn't drop completely, but it is not a cardio workout. I think Summer and her sister in law are funny during the workout, but it is definitely informal. I do this routine at least twice a week, and recommend it for a nice change up to prenatal yoga!! I rotate yoga, this routine, and walking and I seem to be keeping in shape just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful workout","review":"I'm a long distance runner who doesn't feel comfortable while running after becoming pregnant. I purchased a few exercise videos to keep me in shape throughout my pregnancy. While I don't get the same runner's high from this type of workout, I highly recommend this video for those who are serious about staying in shape while pregnant. So far, I have only done the second trimester section, but I love it. Summer and her partner and upbeat and funny, but not annoying. It is challenging, but not so hard that I dread doing it. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent workout, gets heart rate up and toning is good too","review":"Since I am normally very active and play various sports, I wanted something I could do during pregnancy that would be baby-friendly but still give me a good workout. Honestly, the best thing is to go to the gym and get on a stationary bike. This DVD is an okay workout for days when I can't get to the gym, it gets my heartrate going and I like some of the toning excercises (for which you are supposed to have one of those elastic bands) but definitely not as much of a workout as I would like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Energy Boost","review":"Seems like a lot of the maternity workouts are for women that don't usually move. I know that we aren't supposed to loose weight or work too hard. This video is perfect! Not too much and not too little. You can do an express workout that is perfect if you don't have a ton of energy. They also take time for you to get water which is really important while you are exercising. I don't have an exercise band but I used hand weights and it works just as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to follow, great toning workout","review":"I got this video right as I was starting my third trimester. I had been staying active throughout my pregnancy by taking prenatal yoga and pilates reformer classes but I wanted something that I could do at home for the days I didn't feel like going out. I like how you can choose a workout based on your trimester and you can choose the express workout or the longer one. There are great toning exercises and Summer Sanders has a very calming voice. She does all the exercises along with you in the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for each trimester","review":"I started this during my second trimester. There is one workout per trimester,but each workout keeps you moving throughout. It's not about cardio but focuses on keeping trouble spots in check while raising your heart rate a bit. I definitely feel like I get a great workout each time and haven't gotten sick of it after a couple of months - which is saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video!!!","review":"\\"This is a really effective, low-intensity pre-natal workout. In particular, the upper body exercises are really good, and it's really nice to be able to choose between the express and regular workouts. I think it's a great DVD for finding out that you CAN exercise during your pregnancy and look great! I do wish there was a little more cardio involved. The only negative thing I have to say is \\"Summer's comments can be a bit annoying, particularly after you've heard them a few times.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout but missed some details in description","review":"This is a great workout but I missed the detail that an exercise band was needed for the workout when purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get an actual workout!","review":"I've been looking for some type of prenatal workout dvd that actually provides you with a workout. It seems most prenatal exercises are so slow and mostly involve stretching. Not this dvd. You will actually get a decent workout in and feel sore the next day. Don't think it is going to be anything like your gym classes with modifications; it is still relatively slow but manages to be challenging at the same time. When you are pregnant you are supposed to be able to carry a conversation while exercising anyway so you are limited in how far you can push yourself. Just enjoy it and hopefully keep your biceps, triceps and thighs from getting flabby with this video =)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Optimistic but boring","review":"I wanted to like this DVD, but was annoyed by the Summer and her sister-in-law, they chat the entire time. It is distracting for me. In addition, I thought the moves were repetitive and boring. They do have three different programs for the trimesters, but it's too prosaic for me to sit through them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout throughout Pregnancy","review":"I bought this DVD in my first trimester and have been using it a couple times a week.

They keep you moving and are not boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the market","review":"I absolutely love this video! I love that it's broken into three separate trimester workouts so once you're starting to get bored with the first trimester workout, you're ready to move on! And what a great idea to have a shorter version of each one in case you're short on time. I have a yoga DVD (Bethenny Frankel's Skinny Girl Yoga workout) as well that I do and then do the shorter version of Summer's DVD, just to mix things up. I also do some speed walking outside or on the treadmill a couple days a week to get some extra cardio in, but this is an excellent all around workout. And I love Summer and Keri. I didn't think they were cheesy at all. And Summer's growing belly was real motivation! Also, I do not have the band that they use - I use 5 lb. hand weights and I think they work just fine. My arms are burning by the end! I would love for Summer and Keri to make a post-natal video to help shed the pounds after the baby is born!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss leading","review":"This product clams to remove hair but 2 tubes latter i'm still growing a beard complete misleading false clam don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!

This book is the worst I have ever seen. It took a month to get and when I did I went trough the book playing most of the songs I already know, the chords seemed off. The author does warn you of this saying the Beatles sometimes play tune down a semitone or below concert pitch and if you want to play along with the record tune your guitar higher.

This is a great Beatles book, the only problem is that the small page format along with the almost 400 pg. makes it near impossiable to open the book to a page and have it stay open. I liked the book and way the songs were done so well that I found a solution for the binding problem. I went to a local office supply store and bought a smaller sized 2\\" 3 ring binder. Then took the book to a speedy print shop were I had them drill 3 holes in the book for the binder and then cut the binding off of the book. Total cost 9 bucks, but now I can open it to any song I want and it stays there.

I agree with other reviewers that the binding is extremely impractical; I always end up holding the book open with my knee as I'm playing. I think I'm going to follow another reviewer's suggestion of getting it rebound with a spiral binding. If it were not for the binding, I would have given the book five stars.The publisher really should put out a 2nd edition of this book with the following changes:1) a heavy-duty spiral binding2) fixing the order of the several songs that are out of alphabetical order3) including \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I'm beginning to understand what my brother meant when he said the Beatles broke the rules.Very enlightening, not to mention instructional and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for songwriters!","review":"I am not really an aspiring songwriter, but I do like to write songs from time to time.

Recommend for anyone that wants to learn chord structures by The Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"I'm a beginner guitarist and wanted to learn to play a few Beatles hits. The way each song provides the details for each chord was very convenient for me to skim though the songs and determine which ones I would start with simply based on the amount of different chords needed for the song. I would say that a beginner can easily play at least 5 songs within a week or two. It's a great start, especially when using youtube to hear the song while you practice. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition a real disappointment","review":"The formatting isn't properly done, so there are pages with only the chord diagrams. Also, the text size jumps around, and the line breaks don't match the hard cover edition. They missed a huge opportunity to do this right, in keeping with the tradition of Hal Leonard chord books doing only the minimum necessary. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two pages shy of being truly complete.","review":"This book is a bare-bones chord structure guide to the songs written and performed by the Beatles in the 1950s and 1960s. It gives no real illustrations as to the exact fingerings used by the Beatles on their records. Titles include official discography rejects like That Means A Lot, You Know What To Do, and You'll Be Mine (all of which made appearances on the Anthology), but, inexplicably, do not include the 1970s Lennon demos-made-Beatles-singles Real Love and Free As A Bird. Seeing as the latter two songs were released as singles and thus should count more as Beatles canon than early-era testbed dross like In Spite Of All The Danger (recorded and released purely by incident), this book is, in my book, somewhat less than complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"This book is great for all levels. It clearly shows chord names, lyrics, and finger positioning. Great for any Beatles fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Me","review":"I play guitar and keyboards at the professional level. Any rock guitarist who is familiar with the Beatles' tunes will love this book.Just lyrics with chords written above the lyrics. Every song written by the Fab Four."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Sound' foundation","review":"Excellent, accurate chords and lyrics.Great price too.Sure, there are no fingerpicking guidelines as Moley noted, but what do you expect for the price. Given the accuracy of the chords, and the keys in which the songs were played, it is very easy to use this book in combination with the actual song recordings, to work out the picking on all the goodies! A lot of the songs don't require picking anyway. Part of the fun of playing these acoustically is to work out your own arrangements of the sometimes multiple guitar parts.This book also serves as a great 'instuction manual' for barre chords! No better way to learn them than in the context of these tunes!If you want full picking / band arrangements, drop $$$$$ on that book (it's on amazon, forget the title now). But, this is excellent for the price and gets even better if you put a little time into listening to the songs at the sametime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatle Fan","review":"I've loved the beatles since the first time I heard them over my step fathers tapes. So I went searching on ebay, in different stores, and then someone told me about amazon and thats where I found this purfect book. Since I love playing guitar this book has made it more fun, because I get to learn songs from people I've never met but would love to meet one day. The beatles are inspiring and just filled with life even though the beatles are no longer a complete set like they used to be. Now I play the beatles songs and have fun doing it. I've even shocked my step father who learned guitar way before me on how well and how quickly I've learned the songs. This book was amazing and I will defintly keep it for a long time and continue to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Book for Any Guitar Playing Beatles Fan","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this songbook. But let me just say it was/is beyond my expectation. It has every song you can imagine. It shows exactly how each chord is supposed to be played ([...] wise)....Lennon and McCartney did not believe in typical chords, they obviously liked to add something almost each time. It's been a blast to play songs that I never could've picked up otherwise because of some of the special chording. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, accurate, marvelous","review":"Im really glad with this buy. It has the perfect chords, i.e., different positions for the same chord in the same song, but it sounds different, just as the original song. Anyway, if that's difficult for you, you just can play the chords on their base position.I havent yet found any errors on the book. It even includes some very strange songs I never heard of. Not even in singles.This book is a must buy for beatles fans... I formerly was downloading tabs and chord files from the internet, but they are all so-so versions. This one has the right versions, no doubts, it is just perfect. Save yourself time and get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may want both","review":"I have had the original \\"Beatles Complete\\" for years and was used to transposing the chords to a playable or singable key, or at least the key that followed the chords on the Beatles recordings. This book is already in the key you expect it in but it does not have music, just words and guitar chords. If you know how the song should sound and just need the words and chords, this is the book you want. Most of the songs are one page with guitar chords above the words, just like you would do it long hand. Not much help for someone who reads music but what guitar player does that on stage. This is also a fun book to have for sing-alongs around the campfire. Our keyboard player reads music and likes to look at the old book to get some of the patterns down and than transposes it to the key in the new book, so you may benefit by having both versions.If all you want to do is strum and sing, this is the one you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of the greatest songs","review":"It has most of the songs - I was looking for Mr. Moonlight, but will get it off the web and clip it into the book. I am very hally with it and will be enjoying it for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beatles complete chord songbook","review":"Excellent resource for any gigging professional musician. I found it hard to find songbooks of the beatles works, and this book has been a great find. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Beatles Songs' Guitar Chords (see reviews of alternate copy)","review":"There is another listing for this bookThe Beatles Complete Chord Songbookwith 160 reviews and an average star rating of about 4.5, so don't pay much attention to the crappy combined rating here. Most reviewers are quite happy with this book. As one of the most helpful reviews says, it does exactly what it promises."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!!!","review":"This book is a treasure.

The chords and organization make this book a players delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like The Beatles did them!","review":"I have been playing guitar and songs by The Beatles for many years. This is the FIRST book of chords that actually gets them all right. You will love this book. And, you will learn many really neat and possibly new chords. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Beatle Music Songbook ever","review":"Best purchase of music I've made in years. It has it all. And not just the simplified chords, but the AUG7ths and 9th, etc. that gave the Beatles their unique sound. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK. DIMENSIONS OF BOOK STINKS.","review":"You get the Beatles songs in words and chords. Wonderful. Beware that the books' format is a SMALL ONE. Slightly bigger than a a dime store novel, and thick. There is a slight drawback in keeping the book open, being so thick, that eventually you must break the spine of the book to keep it open. I'm waiting for the pages to start falling out. Book should have been issued with a spiral spine format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles Song Book","review":"I bought this for my son and he loves it. He had wanted a book of Beatles songs he could play on his own with his guitar. This book is great for him, give him, cords, notes and words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are These The Real Chords?","review":"I've been working with this book. The chords don't always sound right.Also, the chord tabs often seem to choose a difficult fingering for a chord that has a much easier fingering.I find that when I can get chords on the Internet, they often sound better and are easier to play. Are these chords coming direct from the Fab Four, or did someone make these up from listening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one by","review":"If you are looking for a chord guide to Beatles tunes, pass this book by and save yourself a few bucks.Not only do a large percentage of the songs have the wrong chords, but the chord diagrams would require the player to have 6 fingers!On many songs, the chord changes are indicated at the wrong place.Cheap \\"perfect\\" binding insures that not only will this book fall apart with minimal use but also won't stay open to the page you want.I can not think of one positive thing to say about this dreadful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, This Is What It Would Sound Like","review":"I love Big Star, but can't stomach this album. Why someone would want to listen to this and not the originals escapes me. I guess the sound is edgier, more driving, but ultimately you listen to Big Star for the awesome songs. Yet, the voices here are so distracting (the Posies are too mellodramatic, and Chilton can't save the set) it pretty much wrecks it. Too bad, but I guess they had to prove it could be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"S**T\\"","review":"The last song is listed as having a running time of 9:51. Not true. \\"S**T\\" actually is 3:44 of music followed by 1+ minute of silence. Hard to understand how this was setup. It would be more helpful for purchasers to know about the gap. A T-Rex cover does begin after the \\"silence\\" and it's not credited on the track listings. Buyer beware! The music is fine but the gap is really an unnecessary distraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags...","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this CD. The band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags. However, that could be blamed on lack of preparation because this was a reunion concert. They seem to be striving for a Badfinger/Wings sound but fall far short of their lofty goals. The two most memorable songs here are both covers...Marc Bolan's \\"Baby Strange\\" and Todd Rundgren's \\"Slut\\". That's a pretty good indicator of how weak their own material is.I have yet to get the whole Big Star mystique. I saw them last year at Little Steven's Garage Fest and they were one of the very few low points. My son felt exactly the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"2/4 of Big Star avoid sounding like an oldies act","review":"Perhaps it's a testament to the songwriting of Chilton, Bell, and Hummel, perhaps it's that Chilton and Stephens haven't been retreading these songs in concert for the past 25 years, or maybe it's just the added energy of the Posies' Ken Stringfellow and Jon Auer, but these renderings of Big Star's essential canon sound *fresh*. The performance is at turns sloppy, inspired, raw, and cohesive. It doesn't shed new light the way \\"Big Star Live\\" did at the time of its release (mostly because this isn't the first peek into Chilton & Stephens live sound), but it's certainly a welcome addition to any Big Star fan's collection.Now what *I* want to know is where to get tapes of the two missing tracks (shown in a photograph of the set-list, but missing from the disc): \\"O My Soul\\" and \\"13\\" - the latter being my very favorite Chilton composition. At less than 45-minutes, there was certainly room on the disc for these two tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best live show available","review":"While far from perfect this particular disc is the best live show available of the reconstituted Big Star. The live set on Big Star Story box set from the 70's is a better show, but for the modern Big Star the Columbia show is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Big Star","review":"I love this recording of the reunion concert (without two of the original line-up). This has grown on me over the past two years and I find it is on my stereo more than any of Paul Westerberg's solo albums. I like the arrangements of the Big Star material and the guitar of Chilton is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"good moral lesson for kids","review":"wonderful adventure, parents should watch with their children to help them learn why bullying is not fun, or exceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent animated film, reasonable lesson taught","review":"Unlike other animated movies of recent times, this one actually does have a pertinent and clear message delivered, don't bully and respect others. This is a pretty kid friendly film (ages 6-7 and up) that tells the tale of a young boy who is small for his size, and gets picked on by a neighborhood bully. It is affecting his life and making him feel miserable. To relieve his stress, he has been taking it out on an ant colony in his front yard. Well, one night the ant's decide to turn the tables, and he is shrunk by magic to the size of an ant, and has to live with them to earn his way back to full size. There are several funny stops and situations along the way, with only a few crude jokes (more tasteful than many \\"childrens\\" films of lately), and minimal scary parts. Worth renting and watching with your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film for the family","review":"Great movie for the family, I have to say I'll think twice myself before I go and kick or destroy an ant hill again! Totally enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Hi Def Picture Quality and Sound.","review":"What a great family cartoon. This movie really shows off HD DVD's strengths. The Picture Quality and Audio Quality are phenomenal. This movie will keep you happy for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"ant bully","review":"The item arrived in good condition some scratches but able to view movie well i would buy from this seller in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought \\"Ant Bully\\" would be a lot like \\"Ants,\\" but I was mistaken and disappointed in it. What I didn't like about it was the gratuitous rude and uncivil dialogue between the characters which I felt was in poor taste and a very poor example for kids. I would not show it to my grandkids, as they learn from movies and videos and I would not want them to emulate the attitudes expressed by the characters. There are already too much iresponsible and negative attitudes expressed on TV. I am amazed that Tom Hanks and the other Hollywood actors got involved in this cheap take off on \\"Ants.\\" The insects did not even look like insects, but rather grotesque charactures that were unnatural. Made for a quick profit, not any redeeming value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gonna get it to watch again!","review":"I loved this movie! I hadn't bothered with it before as the reviews were pretty bad, but it was one of the movie options on a transatlantic flight, so I thought I'd give it a try. Well, shows how much they know! I was impressed! So many movies now are washed-out tripe devoid of real spunk, but this one was spicy! The moral messeges are delivered in a way that seems part-disney, part-brothers grimm. It works perfectly though, it's that sort of mild horror kids dig, like in Monster House.Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"My 5 year old daughter is an ant bulley too, this had a few laughs in it, entertaining for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to a 5 stars....fun","review":"Took me a while before viewing this one....and that was to my disavantagebecause this one.....is a very good movie.Yep...good for kids and adults, the animation, the characters and everthingelse works together and what comes out is a great fun movie.Just wait till you see the frog part.....excellent...I enjoyed it soo much, that i watched it again on the next day...Give it a try"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, entertaining kids movie","review":"My Daughter tried this during a sleepover with kids of various levels of maturity for age 10. They laughed hard at some of the scenes and were entertained. Good kids movie. Not epic funny like Shreck or some of the others, but like I rated 4 of 5.I must have had some network issues with it being Saturday night as the streaming part on my LG DVD w/wifi did not work well, we had about 10 freeze ups where it had to spool the data back up to start. I would think since I paused it for 10 min in beginning to make sure everyone had popcorn and stuff that it would have spooled to the HD on the DVD player (which is 400 gig) but for some reason it did not do much of that and seemed to rely on data flow. Not sure that is part of this review but since its listed as a Prime video stream thought I'd mention it.I just started trying this service and my other movie it streamed just fine 100% no issues, but was not Sat night."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the second bug movie I've found myself hating","review":"I'm sorry but the few funy scenes aren't woth he grossness and the stupidity of thsi film. I don't know what about it hit me the wrong way But jst like the movie 'Antz' I feel sick at the thought of it. Maybe it's the scene where the bug pulls up the ant's head or the need to make every thing as ew as possible or maybe the ant religion. Please if you want a good, CLEAN bug movie rent or buy 'Bugs Life' and skip this gross film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a boys movie","review":"First, the premise of this film is essentially that what boys need is a good dose of feminism to teach them how to be men. Second, the scene in which Julia Roberts' character stings the pest control man on the genitals was totally inappropriate for children. In fact, it was just downright inappropriate for anyone. But it set the tone for this movie more than any other scene. If you have boys, get them something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"would've been good except for nasty jokes!","review":"ok what's up with this ok i forgot most of it because i couldn't think of anything past the NINJA TURTLES MOVIE!!! oh yeah the way leonardo was swinging his swords,showing off his ninja skills oh right!!! but anyway this was ok until he was trying to find clothes to wear Y-U-C-K the queen was talking to him then she peeked over the blind and said some nasty things about him and when they were putting him on trial.yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor service","review":"I ordered this video for my grandson's birthday back in Aug.

The \\"protective film\\" used on the disc is defective.

Out of the two hundred blu rays I've collected only this one and \\"Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme\\" are like this. I asked for replacements of both and the replacements did the same thing.

And very impressed was I. I won't compare him to the likes of Autechre (being as how NO ONE can be compared to them), etc. This album just kind of stands on its own as a collection of masterful pieces of music. Maybe that's a bit of an exagerration, but it is very well done nonetheless. The only reason I knocked a star off was because of the fact that, though well done, it is missing something. I can't put my finger on it, which kind of makes this review a bit useless . . .but, oh well. Pick this up though if you enjoy funky beats with good (though a bit melancholy) melodies.

This mouse sucks! I got the Copperhead from my brother and was excited to try it out after hearing the reviews as a Top Gaming Mouse in comparison to the Logitech G5 - plus it's backed with the Razer reputation. I was surprised to find it flimsily constructed (the edges of the plastic isn't completely in-line at its base. I can feel the uneven edge of the plastic at the butt - think scraping) and it's super lightweight! The contour of the curve isn't comfortable and it's slim so even the smallest hands can't \\"rest\\" on it. The wheel is awkward and it doesn't glide smoothly (for smaller hands, you have to reach for the wheel). I honestly can't imagine how they could sell this as a premium product. Aside from the software, it feels more like a stock mouse you get with your computer but with lights.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Razaer Copperhead","review":"The Razer design and construction is quite nice, and the options for controlling DPI, sensitivity, etc via the bundled softare are excellent. Overall its a great product. I gave it four stars because its not quite as comfortable as the mouse it replaced (MS w'less Laser 6000). However, this a gaming mouse that is still pretty comfortable, looks great and works a treat. I am more than happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"$90 Wasted on both Mouse and Deluxe Mouse Pad","review":"I was so excited when the mouse arrived in the mail. The packaging looks great and it was very easy to install.The problem is if I move the mouse at a very slow speed, the mouse doesnt move because it's too slow for the sensor to know the mouse is moving. It's very annoying when you need to move at a slow and careful speed and it's not moving. I've tried putting the mouse on different material thinking maybe the Razer Mouse pad was the problem but the same thing happens.This mouse would be great if you're always moving the mouse fast but if need careful precision speed, it's very annoying. My plan is to ebay the mouse and try another one.The 4 buttons to the sides are a little stiff but since i dont use them that often, it doesnt bother me. The front 2 buttons are about right in stiffness but I wish it was slightly more soft on the clicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you...","review":"At first when I bought this mouse I didn't like it. It just didn't fit my hand the way I was used to holding a mouse.... but after a week or so I really started getting used to it, and now I do find it comfortable. All I can say is give it a chance and get used to it... it grows on you!Response is great and the on the fly synapse adjustment is nice... handy when you want to change sensativities without going into a setup mode.Some said you can't use the side buttons... I find that only 50% true. You can use the side buttons on your side, but the far side are not really useful in my opinion.What you do get is a quality mouse which should last some time...I find the side rails on this mouse slightly annoying. Thinking I might cut them off with a matte knife and then apply a hot knife to the cuts to soften the edges off.... but not right now, can't justify that in case I mess it up... so sometime in future I will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a while but grows on you.","review":"I bought this mouse a couple months ago and hated the feel and design of it. The side buttons are almost imposible to reach and the way i hold a mouse made it tough to get used to. Over time I began to get the feel for it and now love how it fits in my hand. You can customize just about everything in the configuration setup. I adjusted the sensativity of the x and y axis of the mouse so that my y sensativity is toned down and it is perfect.

But it has one major problem. It is too big for anyone with a smaller hand.From my wrist to the tip of my middle finger, my hand is 6.5 inches long. This mouse is 5 inches long. To comfortably hold it, i cannot reach the mouse wheel. The two buttons on the right side are completely inaccessable to me, rendering them useless. To reach them, i have to hold my hand in a painful claw position because my pinky does not rest that far out naturally.This mouse is probably fantastic for a normal man's hand, but i have a smaller woman's hand, and purchasing this was a waste of my money.If you are a woman or a man with a smaller hand, you must take this into consideration when ordering this mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice before it started double clicking","review":"Just a few months after ownership, this mouse started randomly double clicking when single clicks were intended. Adjusted double click speed to the slowest but no change. Searching the problem found many users with the same complaints--even with mice that were returned under warranty. Unfortunately, Razer needs proof of purchase for claims...even though the serial number would probably confirm the mouse was made in the past 2 years. For a high end mouse, this is not acceptable. I think I will just stick to a MS mouse--those things are workhorses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annoying","review":"Originally bought this for gaming because of all the extra buttonsvery awkward feel from most mice..the extra buttons on the right side of the mouse are nearly impossible to hit without shifting your hand..so it makes them pretty much useless while playing combat, or pvp type games that require quick reaction timefor the most part its a decent mouse if you stick with the standard 5 buttonsgoing back i would have bought something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of light filter","review":"It is a too dark blue filter and as such it cannot be used in a regular photography.

My husband and I (both professional musicians) were truly impressed--need I say \\"flabbergasted\\" at the wonderful playing and the orchestral integrity.

I've always loved the 2nd and 3rd concertos and the Paganini Rhapsody, and those are terrific performances here too (despite the cuts to the 3rd), but the two less familiar works really shine here. The sound is excellent for the 1960's, but don't expect up-to-date digital sound from recordings from this period regardless of \\"remastering'. This isn't smooth 'civilized' Rachmaninov like, say, Ashkenazy, although I enjoy much of those recordings as well. Earl Wild was truly \\"a romantic hero of the keyboard\\" as one of his album covers proclaimed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Rachmaninoff 2nd...","review":"Passionate and lively, Wild's 2nd is by far superior to any that I've heard. The only one to get even close is Van Cliburn. I do however prefer Argerich's 3rd to his. I've yet to listen to many others' verisons of the 1st, 4th, or Rhapsody, although of the few that I have (Ashkenazy, Horowitz, Rach himself) his are better (recording-wise for Rach). This CD is a MUST own for any fan of Rachmaninoff, or it is a good starting point for anyone new to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Awareness","review":"The Power of Awareness is one book that I totally agree with.

Now, I realize the importance of different influences in the pseudo-industrial genre, where I believe this will be pigeonholed. Killing Joke is by far one of most unique bands I've heard.

ATT technical support seems to have difficulty understanding the 8525, and so it took me 5 months of nonfunctional email to finally get this information out of them. In addition, the ATT email server is frequently down and has constant weird glitches, like refusing a \\"reply\\" command, or replying to the wrong email address. So if you are looking for a device to grab and manage your emails, it may be better to look elsewhere. Too bad, because otherwise this could be a terrific device."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware when purchasing this phone.","review":"Talked to at&t; about this phone.

The talk button brings me to the phone screen then the phone goes immediately back to the start screen.2. Going to the text message screen then clicking on the center button to read a message brings up the options menu and will not allow me to read messages.3.

The screen is way to small to realistically view any webpages although it loaded pretty easily with the 3G network. I quickly found that the green phone function button would not work after the phone had been locked and then unlocked...so to get to your phone book or to be able to dial a number you had to go through the menu and a long drawn out process. The phone was short so uncomfortable to talk on and clunky. Somehow the phone also would get stuck on my call history page and wouldn't go back to the contacts.

The problem that the other reviewers stated that the phone reboots, is 100% true. It locks up, does not allow transfer of data to the memory card and does not work with the software included.Amazon is supposed to replace this poor excuse for technology with a Palm Treo, but dealing with Amazon is turning into an obtuse situation.

I am upgrading from the Treo 600 and WM5 sure takes getting used to! WM5 is a resource hog. Installing and using the ActiveSync software can bring tears to software engineers (yours truly included).

Ulisses gaze is the cinema itself. The blue ship which travels us along the sky. The best movie ever made. Directed by the most important director alive.By Theo Angelopoulos (as M.Scorcese said in Cannes)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"i have no words to express how deep it touched me, watching that particular dancing scene, where all the generations and ages passed by, a ten-minute-scene without any cut!-and a second one, Keitel walking through the bombed city-war as horrible as noone can imagine...wow- an underrated movie and director for sure. Angelopoulos' movies are cinema at it's best, and Karaindrou's soundtracks (to almost every of his movies) are superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And no stars for the DVD...dissapointing","review":"I had high hopes for this film, but it ultimately comes off as a pale imitation of a Tarkovsky film, an attempt to copy in form while paying little attention to content. It just seems that Angelopoulos had a few very thin ideas and he spread them over three hours so that they would appear to have some weight. While there are a few excellent images in this film, they are few and far between, and there is little to hold your interest otherwise. The acting is also, at times, very stilted and clunky. If you would like to a see a film that is similar in pacing and theme then see Tarkovsky's \\"Nostalghia\\", \\"The Sacrifice\\" (both of which also feature Erland Josephson), or \\"Stalker\\".About the DVD: Even if you enjoyed this, or think you might, this is possibly the single worst transfer to DVD that I have seen. The image is grainy, colors are bland, and digital blocks and color lines pop up periodically. Very, very sloppy. Steer clear of this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but ultimately confusing and disappointing","review":"This movie is about a personal journey by one man looking partly for lost reels of film, and partly for his own past. The music and much of the cinematography in this film is quite beautiful; some of the images, such as the statue of Lenin floating down the river are absolutely unforgettable. The problem is that the director's artistic vision seems to be getting in the way of storytelling, and the result is a film with a lot of atmosphere and little substance.Anyone who claims to really understand this film is probably afflicted by the \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" syndrome: too embarrassed to admit that this artful film just doesn't make any sense. Harvey Keitel and Maia Morgenstern seem to float in and out of various characters without any explanation. Had the editing been a lot better, perhaps the filmmaker's message would've come through. As is, it's mostly just confusing and ultimately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger Ebert is mostly right","review":"The philosophy and intelligence that went into making this film is very admirable, but hey it doesn't make it a good film. Remember, it's the execution of the film that matters. And I think this film is executed in a very awkward fashion. Angelopoulos is clearly going for something transcendental here, with his sometimes-magical imagery (like the Lenin statue and the blue ship). But there are so many awkwardly staged scenes and Keitel's performance is so out-of-place that the film just doesn't work for me. If you want to see a really tremendous Eastern European film, go rent \\"Before the Rain\\", not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly pretentious","review":"There are points in this film where I was totally convinced that Angelopoulos was astonished at his own profundity. The scene with the Lenin statue turning slowly in the boat goes on and on and on. And nothing happens. It is a shot of Lenin's head and hand. It occured to me that is was supposed to be profound, but it wasn't. This film is so slow, so heavy-handed, and so unforgivably arty that it's almost humorous. There was clearly a big problem with the translation of dialogue, and the characters speak in poetics. They are not real people. No one here is. This is like the longest, most arty home film ever made. Angelopoulos puts the viewer in his living room and runs his most personal movie for the viewer for THREE hours, and gives us nothing in return. Nothing to think about, barely anything to feel. And to think he was upset at not winning the Golden Palm. This is almost as appalling as his next film, Eternity and a Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"snoozer","review":"Roger Ebert was right on. This movie does not need a mumbler like Kietel. anyway, if this is your taste in cinema - you might find these DVD's more entertaining, if you want a haunting film, pick up \\"Aguirre:The Wrath of God\\" and if you are into a \\"one mans mystical journey film\\" pick up Andrei Tarkovskys \\"Nostalghia\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious blaha","review":"One of the most pretentious attempts to overdo things, this one is utterly boring. It is too long. One hour of it is totally useless. And a display of artistic ego and navel gazing. Nothing else. Unfortunately, it also became one of those movies that rightly did not pass thru the meticulous Cannes Festival, and the prize went fairly to Kusturica's \\"Underground\\".It is supposed to be about Bosnia and the conflict in Balkans, but what we see an aimlessly wandering Keitel - who apparently does not know why he is in that movie - and lots of meaningless shots and empty monologues.That said, let us get the record straight. Theo Anghelopoulos is one of the greatest film makers and humanists ever, and this is frankly his worst movie. Because he is uneven. He created a masterpiece: \\"Eternity and a Day\\", which is a must for movie lovers.His \\"Theatre Company\\" (1975) and \\"Landscape in a Mist\\" (1985) are other jewels. Demand and wait for them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody nudge me when its over.","review":"Indulgent pseudo-intellectual prattle.

Yes, the book is fairly simple and short, but that doesn't mean you have to read it that way. As she has gotten older, now 15 months, we have read it differently. Add some pauses and build anticipation, and this book can last. Once peek-a-boo isn't as entertaining, you can even use this book to teach the sounds for each object. I recommend this book not only for fun, but to spark creativity and recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niece's favorite","review":"Awesome board book with bright contrasting pictures.

However, my 10 month old went crazy over it. He \\"reads\\" all by himself. The last page is mirrored and he loves looking at himself. The pages have cut outs that make the book interactive for him. He brings the book to me to read over and over! He is now 14 months old and still loves this book.We took it to the doctor's office today. I was reading to him in the waiting room and a group of children gathered to hear the book. Several of the children were older (3 and 4), they were trying to guess what was in the cut outs and guess the possible rhyming words. They were tickled pink at the mirror on the last page.I would say that this book was a big hit with the kids so it must be a good book!By the way, I had to read it again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a favorite 8 years later...","review":"My daughter got the book before her first birthday (she is almost 9). It was her favorite then...All you had to say was \\"Peek a WHo?\\" and she'd go crawling across the house looking for it, and wouldn't return until she found it, and then you had to read it. My second daughter, now age 1, loves it just as much. Yes, it is simple, and there aren't a lot of words, but it engages them and they love to turn the pages. And in response to the post complaining about the presence of a ghost...that is my daughter's favorite page...she turns to it and says \\"O\\"...she doesn't see a ghost, she see's cheerios for eyes. It was a winner when my oldest was little, and my youngest loves it too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it over and over again!","review":"My son (13 months) has loved this book for about 6 or 7 months now.

He has learned to turn the pages (and since the text is so short, I can read it before he turns!) He loves the bright simple pictures and especially the mirror at the end. He always kisses himself, it is SO cute. Course, now he kisses anytime he sees his reflection. This book is wonderful for the simple text and great pictures and the predictablity (a great pre-reading skill!) Our son is 10 months and will sit and \\"read\\" it to himself now! A must have for any child's nursery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peek-a-Too Cute!","review":"Got this book for my niece for her first birthday. It is super adorable and a little bit different than your typical \\"baby\\" book. Somehow it's actually entertaining for the parent as well as the child. My only qualm is that the mirror at the end seems a bit obvious(the cut-out is so big, the kid can practically see her whole face without having to turn the page), and some people might take issue with there being a ghost in a toddler book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is one of my favorite books for a baby. My 4 year old has memorized it (it's really not difficult) and reads it to my 1 year old. They both love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"A book for a curious two year old. She likes this book. It is quite easy for her to read as she looks at the pictures and has heard it once or twice. I like board books for this age because they survive an active child's play."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 month old loves","review":"We started reading this book to my daughter around 5 months and by the time she was 6 months it was clearly her favorite book. It's stimulating enough that she pays attention and looks at the pictures, but it's not so long that she looses interest. The pages are thick enough she can turn them herself (not always in the right direction!). I'll definitely recommend to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay...","review":"I expected this book to be much better, especially after reading the reviews. But I'm really not impressed at all. Just not a very creative attempt at rhyming. Doesn't really make sense - the rhyming is all \\"oo\\" sounds but really the context seems off. And even the owl on the first flap falls flat. The ghost doesn't make sense either. It's a strange combination of being too simple (with basic rhymes) and too complex (really young kids are going to have a hard time grasping \\"zoo\\" \\"boo\\" ghosts, etc.). If you want a good rhyming and flap book, I'd go with some of the ones from DK Publishing or Baby Enstein's Mirror Me book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantile Book","review":"This book is for really young babies who respond to bold graphics and colors. It's very short and very basic, containing 3-word, repetitive phrasology (Peek-a-Moo, Peek-a-Boo, Peek-a-Zoo, Peek-a choo choo, Peek-a-You - there, now you've read it.)IMO it will bore most older babies, because it lacks even basic concept development or rudimentary story progression. To my 13 month old it may as well be a drink coaster. (In fact the book is about the same size as a large coaster, maybe that's what I will use it for.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book contains a grand total of 15 (mostly repeated) words","review":"This book is so brief as to not be engaging/ entertaining whatsoever...it literally contains 15 total words, 10 of which are \\"peek a\\" and can be read in 30 seconds. Provides insufficient enjoyment for a little rascal as not much to discuss/ describe on each page. I didnt know it was so easy to get a 4.5 star amazon review for a crappy children's book...maybe I picked the wrong line of work.p.s. I don't find it \\"cute\\" or \\"fun\\".

Despite the fact that I put it on the porch for a month hoping the wind may blow away some of the smell, it still has that odor. I think it's because the pages are laminated by plastic. Anyway, I didn't give it to my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate Content for Age","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon because I trusted the reviews. However, I won't give this book to my 1-year-old granddaughter because the author included a ghost in the content. No child this age needs to be hearing about ghosts. It only opens a door for discussion of this subject at an age when the child can't possibly understand even the best explanation... not to mention all the weird explanations that might be given."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero creativity","review":"I have bought this so called board book after reading the reviews. And I have found out that a video review would have helped a lot.Our 5 month old boy did not find the book attractive at all. And the pages are so hard and thick that it might be harmful for your baby if you let him/her play with it alone. May be it is more suitable for a toddler.I also did not like the fact that there are not many pages to skip to. If your baby does not like one of the pages, there are not many to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddlers and preschoolers","review":"We've had this book since my children were babies. My 3 1/2 year old loves to \\"read\\" it to me now. It is great for emerging readers because of the repetition and rhyme. Even my 1st grader still thinks it is funny because of the play on words. It is a simple board book with few words: Peek a ...on the next page MOO! with a picture of a cow for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is the first book my 11 month old wanted to look through. She loves it! She will sit through the \\"story\\" and smile. She looses patience in other books. She actually looks at this one. I'm so thrilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in the length of this book, and with the lack of text. My son prefers books with some sort of a rhythm to them, and this one had so few words that sharing it with my son doesn't really even count as \\"reading\\" to him. To me, this is more of a picture book or an exercise in visual stimulation for the under 12-month set, than a book I expect to keep my son entertained now that he's a toddler. If you are looking for a book to that will be relevant for more than the first year of your child's life, I think there are much better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product!","review":"I purchased it, but had to return it. Horrible soundtrack with frequent loud popping sounds that both startle and annoy. I own a much cheaper version and the soundtrack is vastly superior. Why they have this spread out on four discs I have no idea. Selling gimmick I presume. The Clutching Hand can easily fit on to one or two discs. Mine fits on one, and the picture and sound quality are as good or better than this seemingly pointless release (except to make money of course). The DVD case is designed to only hold two of the four DVDs securely in place, so the other two are always coming loose with the greatest of ease and moving around inside the case getting scratched up and whatnot. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Set Free From Dieting!","review":"I highly recommend this wonderful God-given book! I am a former Weigh Down Workshop coordinator, was searching for a less condemning approach, and God led me to this book! The \\"Hunger Scale\\" is easy to abide by and the spiritual approach is very inspiring, uplifting, and healing. I believe the answer most people struggling with weight control is looking for; it certainly was for me! It is written in a format that can be used personally or in a small support-type group setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"So inciteful!","review":"I myself, like a few others, had done the Weigh Down program with no long term success. I was able to keep most weight off, but wasn't successful losing anymore than that. After reading this book, I finally understand the reasons I wasn't successful. The weight is already coming off and I feel finally free from the addiction to food or needless eating. It explains in detail why we fail and gets to the heart of our problem with addictions to either food or anything we focus on. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to be rid of their weight problem once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Judy Wardell wrote one of the very best, and first, non-diet books for achieving desired weight loss - \\"Thin Within\\". Then she got married.

However, it suffers from poor organization and a disjointed narrative. If the stories of historic and unusual cannon were placed in a separate chapter, the book would be easier to follow. The mass of data should be repeated in tabular form in an appendix, instead of being solely displayed under each individual cannon's picture. This book is good for the Civil War artillery enthusiast, but Olmsted's book is better for field artillery and Stark's book is better for heavy artillery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful reference book","review":"I found Warren Ripley book to be quite useful in some areas, not so useful in others. I agreed with the previous reviewer that the book wasn't very well organized. The amount of information in this book proves to be quite impressive but it hard to get to at time. Still, I found it to be a very useful reference book and since it covered all type of artillery and their ammo, its an useful single volume to have. What I found so useful personally, was to identifed many of individual cannon types which I photographed during my many trips to the Civil War sites. I have taken hundreds of photographs of cannons and this book proves to identifed all of them. Ironically, finding the photo in the book to match the mystery cannon photo of my own, with the information already there under the book photo proves to be quite useful.Depending on your usage, this book may worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to use","review":"Currently calling this gadget the \\"iLuv\\" is just too ironic. I hate it.For some reason when it can't find a clear signal; for example when passing through a town and it encounters some interference; it will reset both of the saved frequencies! What is the point of being able to save a frequency if this thing can just reset them? Crazy. The result is that I can't use this if I'm driving on my own - which is most of the time.Highly recommend that that you get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work out of the box - customer service non-existent","review":"I bought this item for my daughter - after fighting with it for an hour we tried calling their customer service for help (we could never get in touch with a live body to help us - just transferred from number to number in a circle).

For all their dense, breathless wordplay and thick, stewy production, you'd be forgiven for thinking that there's a surfeit of content, threads to untangle, layers to peel through.

But, the movie takes these complicated personal and political issues and addresses them in an exceptional way through the relationships between the lead characters. There are many levels to the movie, particularly the love story between an Israeli and Palestinian which is made more relevant by its connection to the headlines and the conflict in the Middle East. I highly recommend this moving piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science with Religion","review":"Prior to reading Yogananda's books, i read several ones on philosophywhich did satisfy to some extents, and doubts remained. ParamahansaYogananda is direct, and his words hit the chord with body, mind andsoul.

What are we, who are we, what is our purpose in thisworld (beyond eat, drink, sleep), what is life and what is religion.His words echo those of Swami Vivekananda who gave a set of stunningargumentative lectures based on religion from science and their symbioticexistence.

This guy has been honing his art since he was about 12, and he only gets better with time, so you will not be wasting your money if you buy this CD by any means. That said, however, this one isn't going down as my all-time favorite of Sonny's records. The songsmithing is interesting, but not as well-honed as it becomes by \\"The Road We're On.\\" The guitar is clean and beautiful, but perhaps not as richly plentiful as it is on later efforts. It's really fun to hear the early studio version of \\"Congo Square,\\" and there are some cool tunes on here you won't find anywhere else, including the title track, but if you are just getting into Sonny Landreth, and want to be purely blown away by his genius, start with \\"Grant Street,\\" then work your way back to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not include the story I bought it for!","review":"I bought this because my kiddo needed to read, \\"The Bass, The River, and Sheila Mant\\" for school.

First of all, I threw the mopping pads out the door after the first use and used regular rags from that time on. They were much more effective at cleaning, not to mention a lot more cost effective.Eventually the weak plastic part on the handle cracked, making the whole handle bend every time I pushed the mop forward. I used electrical tape to barely hold it together until it was replaced.Last, the spray mechanism didn't last long either. I refilled the bottle with a 1:4 vinegar water solution several times, then the venting mechanism stopped working. About every 4 or so sprays I had to open the lid to vent the bottle otherwise it would just drip water out when I tried to spray.I'm replacing this with a Rubbermaid Reveal mop that I saw my sister use.

So I contacted Clorox customer service via email explaining the situation and asking for a new bottle and nozzle. They responded a few days later with surprise that their product was defective. So they only mailed a new nozzle even though I requested a new bottle as well (the bottle probably costs more than the nozzle).

The Buddies series is a \\"Tales of the City\\" for the New York '80s. This collection of short stories tied together by the main characters that inhabit Mordden's world is at turns hysterically funny and deeply poignant. I cannot get enough of his work. I ripped through two books in three days which demonstrates his books to be an easy read as well as compelling. You care about the characters as much as you memorize the brilliant put-downs and asides which dot the stories. Have I said enough?"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I picked this book out of the blue from Amazon, and man-oh-man was I thrilled by my lucky choice. I ended up reading every book in the series, and I continued to be blown away by how high quality the writing/story telling/dialogue was. He emphatically chose not to \\"dumb down\\" these books. They are written intelligently, and intelligibly. Yeah, I had to grab the dictionary occasionally -- but that's a good thing. There's something for everyone in this book, love - justice - psychology - counseling - sex - politicization of the cause - etc. It's great. Buy it, and you'll be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Buddies, and the rest of the Buddies Cycle, represent an important piece of literature not only for the gay movement, but for everyone. Unlike many authors, Mordden doesn't gloss over the uncomfortable facts of life. He tells of abusive lovers and the sometimes truly bizarre relationships we find ourselves in. And yet, at the end of the book there is some hint of hope that the world is a good place and that we CAN rely on our buddies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This man is a gem.","review":"I have enjoyed every one of Ethan Mordden's books I can get my hands-on. I think it is reasonable to compare him to Edith Wharton. His finely drawn characters and his ability to capture the texture of a moment are beyond compare. Where Holleran is often depressing and Picano a bit introspective, Mordden presents a rich synthesis of both the joys and the tears of what it is to be gay in our time. I still think the best of what he has written remains \\"How Long Has This Been Going On?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls You In","review":"I found this second book in the buddies series to be far more enjoyable than the last, which could be in part because I've now a familiarity with the characters.

You can also select triplet or sixteenth subdivisions. I may upgrade to a drum machine but this is an ideal entry-level product which will take you far."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"I like the volume control. I like the compact size (it is the size of a deck of cards). My nine year old son has had no problems with figuring out how to use. The \\"chirping\\" sound it makes sounds like the old Atari games; I don't find the sound to be annoying at all, but then again, I'm a mom of four kids, so it would take a lot to annoy me. I have two sons in piano now. One is an audio learner, the other visual. This metronome works for both. One watches the digital stick, the other listens to the the chirping. It compact, cost efficient and for my beginner pianists, it does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it is","review":"This is a nice little (and it IS little, much smaller than I thought) portable metronome. I wouldn't recommend this to be your only metronome, especially if you're a drummer, as it does have its limitations already pointed out by the other reviewers. I bought it mainly to use with a practice pad, and to have with me at rehearsals and gigs. The earphone feature is kind of a joke - one volume level, and it only plays out of the left ear. Had I realized that, I'm not sure I would have purchased it. However, now knowing that, considering the price and the size of it, I'll deal with it.And, for you blasters out there that are worried about it only going up to 208BPM...why not just set it to 120/125BPM and play 32nd notes? You won't be able to figure out the tempo of a song using the tap feature if the song is faster than 208BPM, but the 208BPM limitation shouldn't limit how fast you can practice with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome metronome","review":"Very versatile and compact. Awesome product.

These features work well and the device is easy to use, but it sounds TERRIBLE! For one, the metronome tones are at a high frequency which is too close to the range of my violin, no matter how high I turn it up I can't hear the thing above my playing (though my ears start ringing). And the tones that it produces for tuning are too...droning and dull- I normally have a really good ear but for the life of me I can't tune my violin with this thing- if you want to tune your violin stick with a good old fashioned tuning fork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well...but not for long.","review":"We ordered this item based on other customer reviews. It worked well for about 3 months, but then just quit. We've tried everything, but have had no luck with getting it to start up again. The return window has, unfortunately, slammed shut, making this a waste. Live and learn, I suppose. The product was a good fit for our advanced, intermediate, and beginner level students. Now, the search is on for one that will last a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, compact","review":"Though I prefer the older \\"dial\\" metronomes for quick changes in tempo, this Korg is easy to use and shifts quickly between tempi. It also remains on the selected tempo after it is powered off so that you don't have to reset it every time you turn it on. (I found that on a different metronome and hated it!)This is good for students. I am a music teacher and have purchased several of these for beginning music students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever little device!","review":"I purchased this product for use in my piano course. I would highly recommend it to music makers at any skill level. It can count in different meters, you can tap in your rhythm to match something you're listening to, and it does tuning as well.

Great features, great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"The Korg MA-30 offers the same features as metronomes that cost up to $15-$20 dollars more. For the money it's a great value. The metronome is plenty loud. It can beat sub-divisions, time signatures, and has an adequate digital display. It's also very durable. I've dropped it countless times and the machine still works great. The only feature this metronome doesn't do is beat sub-divisions while beating in a time signature. The cheapest metronomes I found that offered this feature started around $40, like the Dr. Beat 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guitar players: This is not loud enough to hear when you play through an amp","review":"I'm a guitar player and I bought this to be able to hear when I play through my amp. I play my amp at a reasonably low volume - between 2 and 3 on my 100w Twin - and I want a metronome I can hear without headphones. Long story short: this ain't it. I tried using my headphones - good quality ones - and that was ultimately the reason I'm sending it back: the sound of the beat in the headphones is just mono and such a poor sound that it wasn't worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoying sound","review":"Korg has packed a lot of nice features into a small package, but as soon as I put in the batteries and turned it on, my entire family (including me) laughed and said \\"we have to return it.\\" The little high-pitched beeps it makes are ridiculous -- a high tone for the interior beats and an even higher tone for the downbeats. They sound almost EXACTLY like the beeps in the German \\"da da da\\" song that a Volkswagen TV commercial made famous.

Someone must make a digital metronome with a better sound, but we're probably going to play it safe and order a mechanical one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying sound.","review":"This is a good metronome except for the beat tone.

I have it a week, and put my headphones into it, and they started shorting out. I tried them with other devices, and they work fine. If I don't press the headphones all the way into the jack, they work great, but if I put them all the way in, the sound goes out completely. If I leave them half out, when I start playing they fall out. This works fine if you don't want to use headphones with it. Otherwise, stay away and find another metronome.

Further, it's takes longer to change tempos on this unit than on a dial unit -- this metronome jumps by 20 bpm when the adjuster buttons are held down, but that takes a second and if you're in between the 20's, you have to back track. Finally, if I need to signal a tempo to my drummer before starting a song, there's no bright light showing the tempo -- and in a bar, he can't hear the clicks on this unit.Avoid this unit if these items are necessary for what you're doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"Not the best and not the worst.

You have to push in two side tabs and pull apart the two halves of the box to insert the batteries next to the little circuit board.

The first week I used this product it was okay. The lights worked and was somewhat pretty in the small area it worked of the pool and then after a week or so it broke! The water had seeped into the battery compartment. I tried to dry out and clean up but I could never get this product to work again.

The vacuum is not what it's hyped up to be. The suction is Ok however the whole vacuum is inefficient. THis is not a commercial-type vacuum. There's no cleaning tools with it and no hose. It is a below standard vacuum that is no way worth the price. A $80 entry level Hoover Tempo that I have at my home is a much better vacuum: easier to use, more efficient and at a fraction of the cost. People who see all the Oreck commercials get sucked into buying this crappy vacuum.. I don't think you're even paying this much for the vacuum, you're paying for the Oreck commercials. Get off your couch, go to the store and get yourself a real vacuum like Hoover or even the Dirt Devil.

Typical example of Hollywood producer putting up with his nonsence just to get his name on the film, regardless of artistic merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Island of Lost Souls","review":"Criterion did a great restoration job on this classic. The fact that it is a pre-code sensation, with a salacious Charles Laughton makes it better still."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is the Law?","review":"This atmospheric old thriller is amazing. With the limited techniques of the 30's it manages to be more moody, chilling and effective than it's modern remakes (both of them, the one with Burt Lancaster and the other with Brando).The lack of modernity actually helps the movie. Black & white photography with it's deep black shadows, torch lit jungles, etc. makes for a much more sustained sinister tension. The makeup effects are fine, and again so much more effective shot in the half light of black & white.Laughton is simply wonderful as this unrestrained loony Dr. Moreau, performing his hideous torturous experiments on his animal/human subjects. That his just desserts are served up to him in his own \\"House of Pain\\" is perfect. Lugosi is fine in a bit part.But, this is Laughton's show all the way, and his final scene....broken glass, scalpels, and crescendo of terrified cries of agony...well, it'll put shivers down your spine.

Island Of Lost Souls is not only the best screen version of the story, but one of the best early horror classics of all time. The film is filled will great atmosphere and acting including wonderful performances by Lugosi and Laughton. It's a mystery why Universal has been dragging their feet to release this gem of a film. A great film with a very memorable ending that will leave you chilled to the bone! Come on Universal get with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doctor Is In The House (of Pain)!","review":"You call yourself a scientist? THIS guy is a scientist! Doc Moreau does cutting-edge (heh) research the hard way. Laughton's performance is flawless. And Bela Lugosi, while not given much to do, does it well as the Sayer of the Law. The murkiness of the film is a feature, not a bug: you're heading into the Heart of Darkness. And as a statement, the film is more timely than ever. There are things going on nowadays --off the beaten path, mostly, like his mad little island-- that put Moreau's work in the shade. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology","review":"This book is a must for all students of phonetics and linguistics as well as for those working in this area. The dictionary is particularly comprehensive in articulatory phonetics, structural, and generative phonology. An asset of the book is the inclusion of outdated terminology which are difficult to find in other liguistc dictionaries. It also covers basic terms used in acoustics and auditory phonetics. However, I find it a little wanting in this latter areas.

It has helped them to learn the creed of course, but the beautiful illustrations have also served as great launching points for discussion. There are lots of little things to notice in this style, it continues to reveal itself to young readers over time. I am amazed at how often when I finish my girls say, \\"Please read it again!\\" They love the creed, partially because of this fine presentation of it.

Check. Complete and utter disregard for continuity Chuck Norris riding a motorcycle one second, and suddenly appearing on the back of a truck without ever showing how he got there)? Check. Children constantly in peril? Check. Ninjas, ninjas, and more ninjas. Check.All of this, and Mr. Norris' physique which in this cartoon is about twice as buff as the actual guy (which is clear because he spends most of the show shirtless, for some reason). Most of the action involves laser guns and falling steal beams. The funniest scene I remember is when Chuck Norris steals a bike from a little kid, and the kid gets upset.At the beginning and end of every episode the real Chuck Norris is shown at the gym or martial arts studio and talk to the audience. It would usually be about the moral of todays episode teaching kids about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best indigo video","review":"this was my first indigo girls video to watch. me and my 2 die hard's were delighted to find it at a local video store for $1.99 to rent. it was the climax of my falling in love with the indigo girls. for all of us. the home video clips are priceless. closer to fine video- with a home made look and amy's torn jeans. in this song amy and emily are walking around sidewalks and the backs of buildings with their guitars, playing singing and walking at the same time. amy trips over a step and they both laugh and keep playing. it's good that they didn't cut that out. the interviews are of great value to any real fan, and contain interesting personal information about amy and emily. another songs video has amy and emily's quotes printed on the screen and they are real good ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watershed: Ten Years of Underground Video","review":"As a dyed in the wool IG fan I thought this video was fantastic. It gives more insight into the women behind the music. Just great footage altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watershed is Awesome!!!","review":"One of the best DVDs I've seen in awhile. I was very impressed how they made the whole things so personal as they talk through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Video and hope for An Update Too.","review":"I bought this documentary in 1994, and I absolutely LOVED IT!!!! I STILL like it a lot, as I'm never about to give up my IG videos, it includes a year book you can click on, and you'll get a bunch of snippets of interviews, and shows that was probably used as a promo you know ?The one thing I'm terribly missing, and am waiting for......an update! They could call it Watershed 2: 25/or whatever years Together or something. How does that sound ? I really wish theywould update the info in this.Otherwise I really like this, it's fun to watch the Galileo video!! Although I understand Amy, I do think she's alittle hard on Catholic priests.In the Galileo Video she writes,\\"I was a priest.....I thought about God and sex all the time.\\"If you want to see Amy breaking strings during \\"Land of Canaan\\" of all times, and having to change guitars mid song while \\"singing\\" throughout, just BUY this video, because THAT IS CLASSIC,AND FUNNY AS HELL!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD ever Created.","review":"Not by much but this is the best CD ever created. The vocals that Maynard provides are so melodic. The guitar done by Adam Jones is absoultly amazing and i love every song. The drums as with all TOOL albums are astonishing. And the bassist Justin Chancellor has such mellody that it is almost un-real. For any one who dosent have it should. It is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most talented bands ever.","review":"I can't write anything that would give this band the justice that they deserve. If the rest of the MTV world didn't suck so much they'd realize that tool is worthy of the fame and recognition that equally talented and creative groups like Pink Floyd get. Tool should be legendary, they're songs are amazing, their lyrics are cool, they can actually PLAY their instruments (not like many popular bands I shan't mention). Their third album is as good as any album gets, equally as good as such classics as Tool's own Untertow, White Zombie's La Sexorcisto and Rage's first release. This is a must have for any hard rock fan or lover of fine, well constructed, rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Buy This CD NOW!","review":"After hearing this very album, Tool instantly became my favorite band, and I encourage EVERYBODY to give this album a try. Don't listen to the people that critisize Tool before you give them a chance by hearing them. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I'd much rather listen to Undertow","review":"It's a good album, but please, stop calling it the greatest album to ever grace the Earth. It's not the greatest thing, but it's still good.I really miss Paul's bass, but overall, the whole package is very good. The vocals are probably what sold me on Tool back when Undertow was first released, and Maynard's voice isn't given enough \\"room\\" so to speak. His voice is drowned out a lot, which is really a shame. If you want real Tool, go listen to Undertow. Don't listen to this expecting hardcore metal, or you will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album ever!","review":"This album is a true masterpiece. Every song on the track is awesome. I particuilly like Stinkfist, Eulogy, H., Forty-Six and 2, Pushit, and Aniema. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves any sort of hard rock. I believe it to be the best Tool album so far and can not wait until their new album comes out. It seems as though their albums get better as they make them. This is definatly a must have album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NIMA","review":"Stinkfist= kicked ...!Eulogy= greatH= cool46&2= solidHooker w/ A Penis= for the hatersIntermission= awesomeJimmy= awesomePush It= greatNEMA= kicked ...3RD Eye= the best"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOOL","review":"Amazing album (in my opinion) and personally i think tools best anyway if your not into long/really long songs (although they are really good!!) then dont waste your time with this cd. If your not into taking songs beyond face value and figureing out their true meanings...then, again, dont waste your time with this album. If youve heard about how great tool is but have never heard them or want to check them out then i would say this is the cd to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"better every time","review":"this was the first tool album ive bought and by far the best. i'm normally not a metal guy so i was a little nervous about listening to this but as soon as i heard it, i was amazed with the expert intrumentation and vocals, the complexity, artistry and overall perfection of the musical experience. The sound itself is unmatched, unique. At first the lyrics just seemed like a pretext for the amazing melodies but after a few listens, i found that the lyrics are truly biting social criticism, and very well delivered. This aspect is more prevalent in this record than their others, and it truly makes for excellent listening. This has been in my tape deck for months now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album, ever.","review":"That about sums up what I think of Aenima =)Put on a pair of headphones, sit in a dark room, and really LISTEN to everything that's in this album... I've heard it thousands of times, and I *STILL* discover new things when I listen to it.Best album... ever =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I JUST NEED IT!","review":"I'm a HUGE heavy metal fan, and when I listened to this recording I liked H.M. even more! If you don't like H.M. I think you should not get this recording.But if you do, this deserves a spot on your shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Ever","review":"I've heard this albumn countless times and I must say it gets better every time I hear it! I really don't think that Tool is the best band, I mean let's face it they've made only 3 albumns thus far (which are all quite good.) But, I honestly feel in my heart that this is probably my favorite albumn of all time! For me, and perhaps many others, I can't just listen to 1 single cut off of the albumn. I HAVE to listen to the entire thing! It's sound is so dark and the metal cuts deep! Maynard has one of the best rock voices ever, and his lyrics are hard to top. On top of that, there is a tribute to my hero the late GREAT Bill Hicks. I can't ask anymore of this albumn. It's breathtaking! If you don't have it you need to pick up a copy now! Believe me, you won't regret it! Tool rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible CD! all time favorite","review":"Anema was the first cd that i ever bought. I have purchased about 35 more cd's since and this cd remains my favorite. The drumming is Stunning and the it is put together so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible to say the least","review":"Tool is not your average band. Anyone who listens to tool quickly goes to lateralus saying it is their best album. Lateralus is an increible album but aenima has so much more meaning to it and aenima is also the album where they started to explore their sonic template. This album also has many themes to it as well that make it an incredibly well thought out album. Songs such as eulogy and pushit are songs that show tool's more aggresive side but then you have songs like stinkfist that ate about compasion and third eye, a song about drug abuse. This album really made tool shine, to say the least it is an absolutly amazing album that i would recomend to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the toolsalesman","review":"Thank you for writing that: I was in fact once hit in the face with a flying wrench! It broke my poor little nose. It hurt. But I'd still prefer that to listening to this horrid album. (Well, not really, but that sure sounds mean!)Tool is dark? How? They have no emotional output or specific point of view. They're lightweights. If Maynard kills himself I'll take him seriously. I take Kurt seriously.What's-his-name (Carey) is a decent drummer, I suppose, but he's nothing special. But what can you expect from someone who uded to play for joke bands like Green Jelly? Besides the fact that they move on to other joke bands?Maynard as a vocalist? He's not as bad as I've heard others say, but he makes no attempt to sing on Tool records, only on A Perfect Circle releases. I could name ten better contemporary rock singers (and songwriters) who are better right now. But I won't. I'm tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think that the CD is way overrated","review":"All of the songs are at least ten minutes long. I really think that the guys from Tool should write shorter songs.
