There's one thing that you might want to consider if you're interested in buying this watch - it is very battery-consuming. Three weeks after I got mine, the battery died out.

Nelson Bridwell and Jim Shooter. This book starts off with a bang with the death of a Legionnaire and follows up with appearances by the Legion of Super-Villians, Legion of Substitute Heroes, and the retirement of a Legionnaire. There are several fun back-up stories here, including the romance between Brainiac 5 and Supergirl and the story of how a normal fan got to be \\"Hero for a Day\\". Some stories are less interesting, but overall a worthwhile read for a Legion fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone sucks even at this price...","review":"I thought I would try a dect phone so as to avoid all of the connection problems I was having with my old 5.8ghz. First off, the phone feels cheap. It's SBC branded and even though this phone has a color screen there is no reason why it should. You can't change the screen image or connect the phone to your computer to upload any data. So why a nice color screen? So you can see the SBC logo better? Lame.Second, the number 6 button barely works. Actually, come to think of it, the feel of all of the buttons is super cheap. I can only imagine the rest of the buttons will stop working or in the near future. I am thinking of returning the phone based on the issue with the number 6 button but I've already trashed my box. Anyway, don't buy this phone. It's terrible SBC trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very valuable but somewhat misleading","review":"This book is an extremely useful work for historical reference, perhaps the only one in its category extant. It can be called a magnum opus. The narrative of its writer is, of course, tinted heavily with his own emotion--and he has pointed this out to the reader himself when describing the nature of his book--therefore this aspect of the book may also be taken as a \\"historical reference\\", to its VIP author's attitudes, but otherwise has no value and is sincere, but very harmfully misleading to the unacquainted reader, about the true nature of the evil Pathan society and its ways, in the present time especially. The Pathans/Pakhtuns/Afghans were always a backward, turbulent society with a criminal culture, but they have changed drastically for the worse in the 44 years since this book was first written, mostly in the last 20 years or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"I slept on this bed for 2 years","review":"until I upgraded to a more expensive memory foam bed.

This album fits this sterotype exactly. Tom's voice on the album is horrible. The songs all sound the same with the pop Blink 182 sound. This album is not worth your money. Blink 182 is not punk music but mainstreamed, corporate jingles. How old are these guys anyways, they sound like they just hit puberty. This is not for the true punk rocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOYPAJ","review":"Really great CD and loved the rocking and high feeling to it.

If you like creative punk music, I'd suggest going elsewhere. Pre-enema listeners will be in for a big let down.The record industry has taken hold of Mark, Tom, and Travis and made them sound like a bunch of whining babies. They threw in some explicit tunes that'll surely make the kids snicker with delight.I heard two songs that were decent, you may too. That is why I gave it a generous two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am very fond of all Blink 182 and I have been a fan since Chesire Cat. The main thing that upsets me about this album is the bonus tracks there are three differnet CD's and they have differnet bonus tracks. I bought the green one and a friend of mine has the red. This to me is very sucky of Blink to do. Other than that every song on this album is great. Especially Anthem part two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, A Return to Their Punk Roots","review":"I have to start out saying that I have been a hardcore Blink fan sine they released Buddha several years ago. And along with the other true fans, I was very disgusted when they were being labeled as pop because they were on MTV and 10 year old girls became fans during the Enema of The State phase. Well, I think its safe to say that time is over. This album is fa edgier then Enema, and is in my opinion right up there with Dude Ranch as their best. I like/love evry song on this cd, and the bonus tracks are hilarious. So anyone who was a fan during the earlier punk years, buy this cd. I promise you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...","review":"I have been a really big Blink fan until this cd. After I was finished hearing the whole ablum I was disappointed. This is definetly a change for Blink- whether people want to label it as bad or good. I don't like most of this cd. It's pop rock with a bit of punk popping up here and there (but not too frequently).If you really liked their previous cds like Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch, this cd isn't like them. It has the pop rock feeling of Enema of the State; however, this cd is more mature. This is one of those cds that I have to skip over every other song just to get to something that I wouldn't mind listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically repetitious and nothing original","review":"After releasing \\"Enema Of The State\\", Blink 182 has had a sudden surge of popularity among those who had never heard of their MUCH better \\"Cheshire Cat\\" or \\"Dude Ranch\\" albums. What seemed to be a unique band, their devoted, earlier followers have ditched them. Why? Because of their releasing of pop-driven, annoyingly repetitious albums like \\"Take Off Your Pants And Jacket\\".Their strongest point has always been the ability to amuse their listeners. \\"Happy Holidays, You Bastard\\" isn't a track that makes you laugh like their previous recordings... But just annoys the hell out of the listener by throwing randoms explicitives in here and out there with every change of tone.Blink 182's \\"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\\" is not funny, not entertaining, and not in any way unique. Filled with songs that are barely distinguishable from the other, this album should just be one large track. Why separate 'em if they all sound the same??Overall Grade: D-"},{"rating":"2","title":"San Diego, the greatest place on earth.","review":"Blink 182 is a good band.

I am sick of people saying how much Blink have sold out. They have not in the least bit. When ever a band hits it big, everyone accuses them of selling out. Going big just means that they have made even better music, thats why they have sold so many albums, and that goes for every band that is accused of selling out.

It just feels like its been tampered with too much on a commercial level. I believe this band peaked on \\"Dude Ranch.\\" It blows away EOTS and TOYPAJ. However \\"Cheshire Cat\\" is thier opus. Its raw,funny, unbridled, gritty and not TRL friendly. I still like Blink I just take smaller doses these days. I just hope they dont repeat themselves (TOYPAJ) and that they begin to write honest songs again ( the track \\"a new hope\\" off of Dude ranch is a fantastic example) or they might find themselves in the \\"Where are you now\\" bins in the next year. Of course up and coming bands will wet themselves to acquire Travis if that happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pop punk CD of the year","review":"This CD was great.

I couldn't get through it without cringing. It is the most blatant case of a sell-out I've ever seen. The tracks are nauseatingly poppy, and no thought has been put into the lyrics. Contrary to The first albums, the melodies aren't catchy at all. Blink 182 is clearly pressured to cater to the MTV kiddos, who care more about publicity than they do music.

I made the mistake in doing so, and most of the other reviews are saying this is their best and most punk cd yet. Although they said that the new cd was going to be faster and more punk, it isnt at all, all the songs sound the same, and the lyrics are terrible. In about every song they swear, and it is not needed and makes the music sound as though it was made for 10-13 year olds who think its really cool to swear and hear swearing. Given that they had 2 years pretty much to make this, I think they couldve made it better musically to be able to distinquish the songs, and better lyrically atleast to make up for the lack of musical talent. There are really only three stand out songs that took them more than 10 minutes to write probably, and those are Anthem Part 2, Stay Together For The Kids and Please Take Me Home. Blink has definitly sold out, and now are trying to even more it seems by only entertaining the 10 year old audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good...","review":"Not even close to Enema!

The songs were fun and enjoyable to listen to. Though, I think there has been a small change in the type of music Blink has done since their other C.D, Enema of the State.

On this one i really only liked one song (anthem part 2) and all the rest was crap. I mean the swearing in it wasn't needed and there was way to much of it. It seemed like a really rushed album and if they had spent more time on it and didn't make it so nsync pop like then it would have been a good CD and mabye they would have had a brighter future. But it seems like they have fallen in to the trap of MTV and they won't ever make great CD's like Buddha or Chesire Cat or Dude Ranch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink and Pop","review":"Most of the album is typical Blink 182 with songs about getting with girls, and breaking up with girls. This is basically just pop-rock (punk if your offended) and nothing more.The album does have it's share of DUDS in \\"Reckless Abandon\\", which is annoying as [heck], and \\"Every Time I Look For You\\" which sounds like a filler. \\"Story Of A Lonely Guy\\" has a great chorus and music but the stupidest lyrics. If you want something that sounds all their other albums, and just want something to make you smile, go ahead and buy this.But if your looking for real rock, definetly avoid Blink 182.Hoped this review helped you. If not, I'll try better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does the 182 stand for?","review":"One day I saw a car with a Blink 182 sticker on it.

Songs like \\"Stay Together For The Kids\\" and \\"Anthem Pt.2\\" have the more \\"rockier\\" feel to them while the first single \\"Rock Show\\" and \\"First Date\\" have more of a poppy sound.

Well, they obviously haven't listened to Take off Your Pants and Jacket, the groups best and most punk CD to date. All of these distortion filled punchy punk tracks are the perfect thing to put in your stereo and blast until your neighbors yell at you. Not only are they loud and fast, but if you listen to the lyrics you can see what great songwriters they all are.

Same on take off your pants and jacket. Maybe slightly more on their newest release, with the exception of \\"happy holidays, you bastard,\\" a 42 give or take second long song that barely has any lyrics on the clean cd because it's so explicit. The music sounds very familiar but is still phenominal."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it again...","review":"Blink 182 has never reall dissapointed me, and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket fufilled my expectations and more. Theyve turned slightly from more of a pop/rock style in Enema and turned it into a more punk rock love song feeling. You could classify them anywhere and they still would rank high on any chart. People think Blink's songs are too similar. I guess you need to be a fan to realize how many diverse songs there really are on this album. My favorites after listening through are, First Date, Story Of A Lonley Guy (which i believe could be their next single) Roller Coaster, Reckless Abandon, and Shut Up. Rock Show is great too, but that one has already collected its fame. I believe this is Blinks best group of tracks ever, and i hope they just keep on putting out albums, because there are alot of people who will never get old of their great sound.

I had previously owned a burned copy of this cd but it was so good i went out and bought it earkier today. The best part about it is that the songs are so catchy not only can u listen to them over and over again but u will want to listen to the songs sooo much that you cant help it! Also please do not classify this as pop. OK people pop is that crap like backstreet boys, N*SYNC, and other \\"boy baands\\" and people like britany spears and justin timberlink. but if u classify blink as pop ir flppin crazy.

They have just made the worst album of theirs ever. it is especially disappointing because enema of the state was such a good album. it had surpassed cheshire cat and dude ranch by far, and they were awesome. so when i got this cd, i was shaking with anticipation. then when i popped it in, the first five songs seemed decent, although not very thrilling. and then it slowly digressed, to the point where i was getting a headache from the terrible music erupting from my speakers. they do have a few good songs on here, but don't expect much more. i say don't waste your money and wait for the hits to come out on some hits collection cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs from a great band!","review":"We all fell in love with Blink's first cd. This cd is as great and better. This cd they talk more seriously and maybe have a few slower songs, but it's still the same Blink that we came to love with the older cd. My personal favorite song on the cd is The Rock Show. You also need to see the video for that song. It cracks me up every time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JOLLY GOOD(!?)","review":"AIEE!This is a good cd. That's why I gave it 5 stars, you disgusting pile of discarded meat products. The only not real good song is first date, but that's only because it's on the radio all the time. The best song is, well i don't know what it is, because they're all good. I just wish blink-182 was a bit more punk. the guitar is good, the drums are good, and the bass is probably good, you just can't hear it. The lyrics are pretty funny, but the funny thing is tom's vile screeching monkey voice. try and get a cd with bonus songs, which are hilarious (Mother's day, grandpa song). bottom line: buy it, you twit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great disc","review":"I own all of blink182's albums, i know their music well, and i have to say, this is definitely their best yet. the first time i listened to this, they sounded all the same. after many, many listens, this is my favorite cd. every song is amazing, and every song is my favorite, although the best is probably anthem part two-that catchy guitar hook makes the song great- and the worst is roller coaster-just not a great song- even though it's still pretty good. overall, i give this disc 6 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"uh, it kicks A**","review":"Well, lets see. It take the talent of cheshire cat and the organization of Enema together to make an awesome CD. While other punk bands may decided to complain about things they dont know about (I'm sure one band is probably on the verge of writing a song about starving kids in canada), blink prefers to go the real way, writing songs about things that actually effect them. I'm happy about this CD, because they didn't let fame go to their heads and they didn't make a totally crappy album. Thank you blink, for the album that saved my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"its no dude ranch","review":"its good blink 182 if you like this kind of music, but this album is nothing compared to dude ranch which is there best album"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"this is a really good cd. not as good as dude ranch or eots, but still very good. my favorites are online songs, anthem part 2, and story of a lonely guy. also, the bonus track\\"hold on\\" was really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this cd","review":"this is a good cd... only bad words can fully describe the extent of its goodness... yes... you must buy this cd... it will add to any collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD from the Blink boys yet!","review":"Being a huge fan for a few years, I consider everything they do good.

Ive had it since it first came out and I still listen to it like alomst everyday! I still laugh everytime I hear Happy Holidays, You Bastard(It may be immature but I love it!lol) The whole cd overall is great. I dont care for Online songs that much though, and since the first time Ive heard them Ive been hooked on Stay Together for the Kids, Give me One Good Reason and Shut Up(despite the great number of times Tom says f@ck...that can always be fixed with the edited version, but it doesnt sound as good with all the blanks) If you dont have this cd(or all three-take off, Pants, and Jacket; they have different bonus songs) then you NEED to get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow up please","review":"Blink 182 could've done so much with this album they could've tried a little harder to actually care about their music but instead they sold out even more and put out this album which is just an \\"Enema of the state part 2\\". They have their formulaic pop-punk down to a tee. The fact is most of the songs just sound very childish from guys who are in their late 20's. They are no longer writing good music because they don't have to anymore. They are appealing to 10 year old girls and thats what makes this album suck. They have a few good songs but there are too many duds. The few good songs include \\"Story of a lonely guy\\", \\"Rock show\\", \\"online songs\\". Even on these semi-good songs they sound like their 13 years old. I wish they would take a nod from Green Day and try to pretend they are over 18 at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink's best showing to date","review":"Take off your pants and jacket? Catchy title, eh? The album itself is just as catchy.Blink 182's new album comes off as a much faster and aggressive punk rock record. The two best songs off of this CD, in my opinion, are The Rock Show and First Date.Rock Show is a very edgy hard all-out rock track. Where First date comes across with a more punk-like feeling that we normally associate with previous Blink albums.Stay together for the Kids is the only real ballad on the album. It isn't as good as most of the rest of the albums, but the message is 10 times stronger than that of any other song on Take off you Pants and Jacket.A must buy for all fans of music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"blink 182 strikes back!!","review":"Oh Yeahhhhhh. Blink 182 is back to it's original sound, This one is muc~h more like Chishire Cat or Buddha which proves that blink AND punk are still alive!!

Definitely!","review":"People love to argue over the merits of Blink being a punk or a pop band, and this album certainly wont help the situation. If Rancid or NOFX define punk for you, then prepare to be disappointed because this is not Cheshire or Dude. But if youre like me and think that Enema was quite listenable even though it punk foundation was questionable, then you'll love this CD. The album overall is quite different from the much played Rock Show, but not to its own detriment. The lyrics have matured a lot since Enema, and while the musical themes seem to be repeated a lot throughout, almost every song will remain in your head throughout the day after one listening. For some, that makes it pop, for me it makes good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst blink cd","review":"I really liked Dude Ranch, Cheshire Cat, and Buddha, but TOYPAJ just doesn't live up to those. Sure, Mark is still a bad bass player, Tom still can't sing, and Travis is the only one with talent, but their music isn't nearly as good. They were probably overtaken by money right before Enema of the State by a new record label and were bribed to do more pop music. The good thing is this is a bit better then Enema was. I enjoyed songs 9-11. Everything else I can't really stand. \\"Online Songs\\" is basically the new \\"All the Small Things\\" It takes that same sort of kiddie punk sound and adds in the na na na's and all that other lame stuff. \\"First Date\\" is also pretty lame and just shows that they can do better then they are doing. Blink, I'm ashamed of you and wish that you hadn't sold out and that someday you'd come back as a real punk band again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but..........","review":"....it's a little weak. Lonely Guy and \\"Happy holidays\\" are good but the rest of the CD is 30 year olds whining about high school angst. Grow up, it gets old.

Obvioiusly anybody who listens to this album has NO taste for music. All of the songs are about having sex when none of theband member's balls have come out of their sacs.The album mighthave nice sleeve art but the album itself is horrible. Try real punk bands like The Dead Kennidys or perhaps The Rammones. Kids,this music is for eight-year olds trying to act cool not teenagers with no music taste.

If you don't throw it away I'll bite you."},{"rating":"2","title":"keep those pants off","review":"So, its been a bit, but finally fans have more than the Mark Tom and Travis show to listen to over and over again.

I like almost all of the songs. \\"Reckless Abandon\\" and \\"Happy Holidays are kind of funny, but they get old fast. Over all, though, this cd is one of my favorites, \\"Roller Coaster\\" being my favorite song. This cd is full of energy and is great to listen to when you're trying to get ready in the morning, or when you get home from work (or school).Note to parents: Don't let your 8 year old listen to this. The subject matter and language are not appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing something","review":"I bought \\"Take off your pants and jacket\\" thinking it was going to be a great album like \\"Dude Ranch\\" and \\"Enema of the state\\".

Which in my words is NO \\"Enema of the State.This album feels rushed, the songs are so-so except for the first single \\"Rock Show\\". 15 songs are on this album and 14 are fillers.This is what happens to a band when they have great effort that is critically and financially a success. The record label puts demands on the band to rush out another album, FAST!....and what we get is \\"Take Off Your Pants & Jacket\\", which graphically is a very polished cover which does NOT represent Blink 182 and nor does the music inside.Blink 182 has lost it on this album. It is not a bad album, it is just ordinary.This album is NOT impressive, or great it is ordinary. I am still playing \\"Enema of the State\\" today, as for \\"Take Off Your Pants & Jacket\\" it is going back on my CD rack.A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Pop Slop","review":"Throwaway, immature lyrics, the same stale power chord riff recycled 13 different ways, and horribly juvenile sexual jokes from three 30-somethings with children.

I know I'm really sick of it (not to mention nu-metal and this new post grunge sensitive trash), but Blink 182 is sure grating on my nerves more and more. I never liked Blink 182 to begin with, even before they became MTV puppets, but this album is undoubtadly the most uninspired made for radio wanna be punk music I have ever heard. What gets me even more are the kids who think that this is what real punk rock is, and this isn't was punk rock is; real punk rock are bands like The Ramones, Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Suicidal Tendencies, or even NoFX, not this uninspired repititious garbage. If you want a real punk rock experience, try those bands, and leave Blink 182 where they should be: in the dirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this suck any more?","review":"Could this album and this band be any worse? How simple-minded do you have to be to even consider this or any Blink album music? It isn't music.

This is the album that started all of the crap-a$$ poseur punk that rules MTV, VH1 and the radio now. I hate Mark and Tom, they are probably two of the most talentless musicians you can find, they both cant sing for s***, Tom cant make quality riffs and Mark cant even follow with some good basslines. The only talent in the whole band is Travis Barker, he's the reason why I'm not going to give this one star. But not even Travis can redeem this band for being so terrible so until a revolution in the music world takes place (like Nirvana and Van Halen) then we're going to have to put up with talentless bands like G@y Charlotte, S*!tty Plan, Avril Lavigne, New Found G@*ness, very little talent bands like Blink 182, poseur rap like Eminem, bubble gum pop divas who think they're Madonna and very crappy non-poseur rap. I hope something happens very, very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink is pretty awsome","review":"I think this is one of their best cds except for their new one i will be pickin that one up soon but ne ways take off your pants and jacket is a good cd. first song i heard was first date which is one of my favs. i also like anthem part 2 alot. blink 182 put up another great album and go buy it just before their new cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm cursing at a 10th grade level!!!!

Three 30 year old men (or are they older now)stringing random curse words together, or at their best, singing about rebelling against their parents, is sort of pathetic. It's obvious they are targetting a younger crowd. I'll admit, when I was 11, I enjoyed their music, but to even suggest they are a good band is a joke.

The songs have a softer, more refined edge, and there are backup vocals in just the right places. Sounds good, right? No, this album is boring and trite. The songs are repitious, and the content was obviously selected to please the lowest common denominator of the human population.

They changed too much and if they make another album, they should stop trying to be some other band and be themselves. They are my faviorite band. I am excited about Plus-44 and Angels And Airwaves.

I was a bit worried when Anthem 2 didn't live up to its predecessor (but in my mind, what can except for something like untitled or enthused) but I soon realized that Blink has gone back to their Dude days and that is good news for all the true fans out there. This is not for those teeny-boppers that think they are going to get more \\"small things\\". this is a true fans' cd, complete with a hilarious secret song. My favorite tracks are Stay together for the kids and rock show."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply supurb","review":"when i first heard this about this cd, i was a bit \\"achey\\" to buyit. this cd actually is more punk than anything. it is an awsome cd and i recommend it to anyone. blink is (and always was) my favorite band and will be for years to come. I think the best songs on the cd are: WHAT WENT WRONG (SECRET), Lonely guy, Stay together for the kids, and Anthem Pt.2. ---just to add, the take off your pants and jacket tour was awsome. i cant wait to see them in concert again. GOOD BAND=GOOD MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a BIG punk fan, but I like it.","review":"I got the Blink 182 cd that was edited because I don't apperciate bad language.

Blink 182 is really cool, but they would be a lot cooler if they didn't use obscene language."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new N'Sync","review":"This album totally caters to Blink's new teenage girl fan base.

It's more marketing than music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone please cry Sellout!","review":"topher 1 has no idea what punk rock is. Blink 182 are the biggest sellouts i have ever heard. If you want punk rock listen to Rancid, GBH, Dead Kennedys, Vandals, H2O, Bouncing SOuls,Misfits or pennywise. Blink is not a punk band. There has never been a punk band that has been nominated for any MTV award. There never will be. Punk Bands do not need major labels, MTV, or Radio play to establish themselves. THey need their own talent. Blink 182 have established that they have none. They are an insult to everything punk stands for. THey have proven themselves too be more like Backstreet Boys with guitar. Come forward and say you're alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is wickid!!!!!!!!","review":"This cd is their best cd (well i think so) get this one first because it rocks hard !!!!!!!

Of course Blink-182 loves music, or they wouldn't be musicians, but the reason they change their style is because they belong to the music INDUSTRY and want to make MONEY. If that means they're sell outs, then they are sell outs. Then that means William Shakespeare is a sell out. He didn't write for free. He got paid for what he wrote. Every band who ever puts out a CD are sell outs. They create a CD to make money. That's all there is to it. They have talent and the ability to make MONEY.And another thing. The fact that Blink 182 and other bands can make all different types of music just shows they have more talent than anyone thought. Did you think the only type of music they liked to create was punk. Get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little harsh","review":"ok 1 stars is a little harsh but to be fair its not a patch on enema of the state.a does however contain at least a couple of songs you'd listen to over again but nothing really like aliens exist or whats my age again?. its seems like there trying to hard this time around.still if your under 13 and want a good introduction to alternative musics this is as good a place to any to start"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Punk Gone Bad","review":"Blink182 was an incredibly good band, 5 years ago. From the underground releases of Cheshire Cat and Buddha, they made a smooht transition to the mainstream with Dude Ranch, and still didn't lose much. However, with Enema of hte State, they had lost all respectability. Continuing with Enema's trend of skin-deep lyrics, poppy melodies that someone who doesnt play could learn to play in less than an hour (see MTV Becoming), and a style of music that is an incredibly warped version of pop punk that resembles NSync more than any respectable punk band. They have gone from respectability to a boyband who writes and performs their own music, to their credit. But the effect is a horribly generic CD that is mostly filler space and lyrics that could have been written in record time \\"I can't wait for the warped tour...\\" Blink182 has lost its fan base and found a new one, and a common link with the Backstreet Boys in the pre-adolosecent, pre-pubescent, boy crazed girl"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good, Most Bad...","review":"Simply put: 3rd worst blink cd (worst-mark,tom, travis show;2nd worst-enema).First few songs are ok, but loses stamina by finish and gives you that light-headed feeling after hearing the whole thing in one sitting. I especially hate the tracks where they try to be \\"serious\\". I like how they made this cd more punk sounding--not because of the quality of the music, but it's funny to see this pop band try to go back to punk. Hopefully this is their last cd.If you hated this CD too, and want to listen to some \\"Good\\" Punk music, try out Guttermouth's-Musical Monkey; Blink182's-cheshire cat+dude ranch; or AFI's-Halloween E.P.+Art of Drowning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won''t take off my pants for this album","review":"I would rather listen to this album than Britney Spears, Christina Agulaira, Avril Lavigne etc. any day of the week, but Blink 182 are sold out, and I think they made this album to please MTV. They don't care about making punk music anymore, they just want to make money, and I don't blame them, but that's what this album is. And the problem is, once you're mainstream, there's no going back. I'm sure at least 8/10 of you who like this album also like pop music, music that gets lots of radio play.

For all you people who say \\"oh yeah its a great punk cd\\", you are messed up. THIS IS NOT PUNK! ITS BUBBLEGUM-PUNK! Its barely music. They just sit there strumming 3 chords and singing in high pitched voices and think they're cool. THEY HAVE NO GUITAR TALENT WHATSOEVER. They're drummer is...not bad, but that doesnt make him cool.

Everybody knows this. And Take off your Pants and Jack It is their worst album, much worse than Nothing Gold Can Stay, Lechuza and the Ever Passing Moment. Even though they are the originators of emocore, they've seemingly become worse than their imitators, and bands like American Hi-Fi have taken the title of \\"punk rawk kings\\" directly from under the heels of Mark, Tom, Travis and Show. My favorite song on here is \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction)\\", even though it's a remake of the Britney Spears classic. But overall, Blink 182 needs to change their name to Blink 41 to give credit where credit is due. Canada forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUTS!","review":"Ok, Blink sold out with 'Enema of the State', but at least that had good lyrics!

So 5 days later, I am positive it was a good move. I absolutely LOVE this CD!

They are still the foul mouths we fell in love with, but with a quite more...fluffy sound. They have crossed the pop genre line, honey. They are now the boy bands of punk. Regardless, I love the album. It isn't the same blink we remember from Dude Ranch, but music is metamorphosis, right? Exactly. So give it a spin and see what you think. Everyone has an opinion. I gave it four stars simply because they still know how to rock...no matter how much their definition of the word \\"punk\\" has...well, melted.

The drumming is also fantastic, really loud and hard. I would recommend this album to teenagers wanting a fun time, and seriously ADDICTIVE music! Ever since I cuoght this album, the words have stuck in my head and it has not been out of my CD player. An impressive collection, some of my favourites are:Online songs, Anthem Part 2, Shut up- (because it lets me sing along and release my anger!), and story of a lonely guy.

I couldn't believe that the reviews are only averaging 1.5 stars-- and had to write a review (my first). A low rating for this book is patently absurd. This book is AWESOME for looking at the two or more \\"sides\\" of various topics within the pale of Christian orthodoxy. If you're looking for an objective account of how \\"good people have disagreed\\"-- now and in the past, then you've come across an unmatched resource.

It has been over three weeks and now I am informed that Sony had sent the wrong parts and I will have to wait. It is very annoying to pay a Sony price premium and experience the problems that I have encountered. Sony has lost the trust and custom of my family.

If I end the call and go through the process again, it works fine. Kindof strange. I have noticed a few \\"button glitches\\" like this. But the worst problem I have experienced is after using the phone for about 6 months. The Line 2 button just quit working all together. It just will not allow me to select Line 2.

I don't like to give the show a bad rating if the problem is with Amazon, but I can't find where else to complain.Revised:Amazon has excellent customer service, fixed me right up, and this is a great episode!!! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Many Faces of the Doctor","review":"Being a life long fan of the Doctor, I have can say the newest Doctor really had me questioning the path this character was taking. It wasn't until the season finale that I felt he truly captured the essence of the Doctor. Granted many of the previous persona's he had were more fluid in their conversions, I really feel that the initiation of this new form really clarified for those unsure of what it is like to get a new body for the Doctor. In previous series, it was hinted at but not quite as clear but this series really gave shape to the challenges the Doctor faces when his form changes.I also think this new perspective of the Doctor with a more dark and less empathetic for the human kind has become more like the Master was in the earlier series so I wonder where they are going with this approach. I wonder where we will go next. But you can be sure, I will be right along with him as he goes through these challenges and changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Couldn't be happier!

I'm not a big fan of how the case is set up to hold the blu-rays, I think it would have been better if it was thinner. My star wars blu-rays are in a much smaller package, and it makes for a much nicer package.The series is great and the quality of the video and audio is superb, if you liked the series when it aired, you will love it in this set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BBC Video Does It Again","review":"BBC Video Does it again, delivering this show (which I'd rate 4 stars for content) in crummy, stuttery 1080/50i-- which is the UK's HD format for broadcast not for Blu-Ray. Everyone else is delivering 1080/24p which is universally compatible. It's smoother, looks better and is the current Blu-Ray standard everywhere. The problem is that unless you have a Playstation 3, you're most likely going to be suffering with a stuttery, jumpy picture, as your player tries and fails to bump up the 1080/50i to 1080/24p. If you are suffering this issue, manually switch your Blu-Ray player to 1080i output NOT 1080p. Our US standard for 1080i is 1080/60i not 1080/50i, so it won't be perfect, but it will reduce the issues greatly.The reason that BBC Video in the US keeps dumping these awful 1080/50i releases on the US market is because they are too cheap to re-author the discs from their UK counterparts to the US standard. Here's an idea-- release them both in 1080/24p. Imbeciles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh YES it rocks!","review":"Everyone, including myself, seemed to be doubtful about Matt Smith as the new doctor, replacing the great David Tennant, who had brought a whole new generation and fan base to Doctor Who. Thankfully, all doubts were in vain. Series Five rocks, and I recommend to anyone who enjoys good writing, and fun sci-fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite thumbs up!","review":"Well if you were thinking about purchasing this season... do so! I must say I have been a Doctor Who fan for some 27 years now and I have seen more episodes than I can count or recount if you get my meaning. As with the change from Christopher Eccleston to David Tennant I was not sure I would like the new Doctor, but Matt Smith nice job mate. I have all of the newer series and I have to say each one has been very entertaining and wonderful. I have a 9 year old and we have been watching each of the new series as they come out. This year has been wonderful and different than all the others. I thought the writers did a nice job bringing in new content and weaving in the old. I am really looking forward to the next season and I do hope they expand River's role some more. The characters of Amy and Rory were lovely as well. I will admit I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars because although it was truly lovely I'm saving my 5 in case next season is even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing makes for weak season 5","review":"Season 5 starts off with a bang with the new doctor and the first episode is amazingly fun.

The set of DVDs were in reverse order (the first episode DVD was last, the last was first). Two of the discs are unreadable by either my DVD player or my computer. The DVDs are seen as region-free by my computer software, which I find curious.

Episode. Ever.","review":"I'm a big fan of Doctor Who, both new and old, and this is easily the stupidest and worst written episode I've seen. I serves no other purpose but to introduce the candy colored daleks to sell video games.Especially since the daleks don't appear again for the rest of this season, this supremely sappy episode can easily be skipped. Go straight to River Song and the weeping angels.

Can not take this new doctor. Have been a fan for years and always found it difficult when a new doctor I liked left and a new one appeared. But I always ended up liking the new doctor and stayed a fan since the Tom Baker years. The new series I thought would never work but to my surprise the first season was amazing. Then I see Christopher Eccleston is leaving the series and David Tennant is taking over as the new doctor. My first thought was what a dumb move they will never find a new doctor like Chris Eccleston. But to my amazement they found an even better doctor in David. I even loved Billie Piper and hated to see her leave. But this third doctor is pure torment to watch. I have tried, I honestly have tried, and it saddens me there is no possible way into tricking me into liking this new doctor. Horrible and terrible!!!! Should have ended the series after season four."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Dr. Who disappoinment ever!","review":"I have been a devout fan of the new Dr. Who series and I have been looking forward to this installment ever since I finished watching all of the David Tenant episodes. But this whole series story line lacks so much in so many ways. Everything is really obvious with no under story. A crack! A crack everywhere! Ugh! And both Amy and the new Dr. Who are exceptionally uninteresting. The stories are also without any humor or depth. And, one of the best previous Dr. Who stories in my opinion was \\"Blink\\" so you would think that the same guy could again write a compelling story, but no! A most disappointing purchase. Wait for a new Dr. Who to come out - not a new series, but a completely new person with a completely different companion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Version (and season) of Dr. Who","review":"These episodes don't compare well at all with the last series starring David Tennant.This Doctor has a TOTAL dependence on that darn sonic screwdriver...he would be toast without it and that's not cool! The stories are just plain bad and I have started going to my local library to check out older series versions, and watch them on Saturday night instead of this season. I think the Sontarans would wipe out this cast quick, HA!I really hope they change both the characters and writing soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible new direction for the series","review":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Matt Smith is a lightweight and his new companion is a joke. How could you possibly follow the brilliant David Tennant and his amazing sidekicks with Matt Smith and Karen Gillan? It seems that, by trying to make the show younger and hipper, they have killed it. All of my Doctor Who-loving friends don't want to watch it anymore. Bad choice for a new direction. Steve Moffat had a chance to really keep the series going in a positive direction, but instead he killed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dr who fifth series","review":"This is the worst Dr Who series ever.

Sometimes hitting first season quality level. A couple of rough spots for the new Doctor, but not too bad. As someone else said, they did the best with the stories they were given. The overall writing was not as great as previous seasons, though it did have a few good moments. Better than expected overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, Bad Blu Ray Product","review":"The discs in this set will not play right on my Samsung 3D Blu Ray player. The sound cuts out constantly and you have to keep hitting pause then play to hear a few more seconds of audio before it happens again. I sent back the set and got a replacement, but the new ones did the same thing. I took my Blu Ray player back and got a different model, but the problem was even worse! I don't know if it's a problem where these won't play on just Samsung players, or if this is widespread, but I really wanted these to work. Instead I've had to send back the Blu Ray set and I guess I'll have to settle for DVDs of Season 5 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"I am dumbfounded at the number of people giving this incarnation of Dr Who good reviews. I've watched Dr. Who since I was a kid in the 70's. Most recently, I loved both Christopher and David as the Dr. (David Tennant is my fellow sci-fi friends and my favorite)This new Dr is so boring and bland I could barely stand to watch. Even the stories are dull and lack any real humor. We all tried to get into this new incarnation and none of my group can find something to like. I would say to anyone reading reviews before buying; Watch a few episodes first and decide for yourself. I guess it's all very subjective. But if you ask this Sci-fi fanatic, the newest Dr Who sucks and falls WAY flat of filling any of the previous Doctor's shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging Issues","review":"Let me start by saying that what I've seen of Matt Smith's tenure as the 11th Doctor is very promising so far. That's not what this review is aboutI was shocked, having purchased previous series of new Who as well as everything available at present of classic Who, to see how cheap and shoddy the packaging is the Series 5 releaseJust one piece of tape theoretically holding together all the trays the various DVDs are in. And numerous cracks in thoseBut the worst bit was being right in the middle of the two-parter The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone and, when I went to put in disc 3 to continue to story, having it not play. And then, turning the disc over, seeing a huge crack in itI'm not sure if something happened during shipping or what, but I'm quite disappointed and will be returning it. It's put a hamper on my enjoyment of Series 5.

However, we got the DVD version of the fifth season and, at least on the disks we got, the sounds reverberated so badly in many scenes, especially inside closed spaces such as the Tardis, that we had to turn the sound off and read the subtitles instead. It is hard for us to believe that such an irritating sound recording could have been intentional."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed ...","review":"With Series Five, at least for our family, Saturday nights were set aside for watching Doctor Who. However, as the season progressed, we found ourselves actually forgetting to watch. The stories were just not intriguing enough to keep us interested.As for Matt Smith, I loved him. He is cute and reminiscent of Tom Baker enough to engender a love of him in the role. However, while Karen is a good actor, I did not care for her character at all and I especially hated her too short mini skirts.All in all, I think I will purchase a couple of the Tom Baker episodes rather than the Fith Series. Hopefully, the next season will be an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic-Screw Everyone","review":"Like it, hate it, or I don't care, the Doctor will carry on.

I Loved all the Mofatt eps in Davies era, so I was looking forward to the new series. I'm sorry but it's a total disappointment. I watched ep 1 online and thought that I had accidentally downloaded some cheap Scifi show from the states. The story line was unappealing for adults older than 8, the new Doctor is emotionless and cold, and Amy is as charming as a pouting goldfish. Why did they do such a horrible job at casting? I kept watching, hoping that it would eventually get better, but even the ep with the weeping angels was an utter disappointment, by the time I got to the Vampire ep, I just stopped watching. I think I just keep my old DVDs of Ten/Davies era and forget about this new \\"kiddie\\" Doctor who.

The character development shown here, the relationships, the people and civilizations saved, and the stories that unfolded were all erased in the final episode. Evidently the way the epic was progressing was not worth keeping so the writers simply deleted it all. Moffat took a cheep shot at story telling by building up impossible odds to stun the viewing audience, then, instead of working his way through a difficult solution, he simply said oops it never happened - never mind. I suggest then that the true fans do the same as the writers did and just forget about this season. Hopefully a new season will emerge that will be worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame. . .","review":"OK, sure, it's the new Doctor Who, but. . .they should have just retired it when David Tennant left. BORING. What happened??? I've TRIED to like it, but he's just too lame, too pale, overly animated, and the music is usually too loud to understand the dialogue! No, I won't be buying this series.

I have been a fan of Doctor Wwho since the Tom Baker days and I really love how the Matt Smith Doctor has been a return to some of the eccentricities of that era but truly shows the chutzpa of a 900 year old alien from a VERY highly advanced race. I must say I have also been very impressed with the scoring for the 11th Doctor's adventures. It truly adds to the excitement of the series.

Very much the distillation of the most successful elements of the last several seasons (or series as the case may be)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Tennant","review":"Matt Smith is a strange guy, which I think may be a prerequisite for playing the Doctor. I've really enjoyed Season 5 and the Christmas episode but so far he isn't half the Doctor that David Tennant was. Now, with that being said, this season is my second favorite season of Doctor Who, right after series 2 and I have a feeling that series 6 will blow it out of the water. Steven Moffat has shown that he is a tremendously talented writer and has done a really great job with long plot threads and keeping things together. The twist to the episodes with the Weeping Angels (revealed many episodes later) was great to see, and I have been happy to see more of River Song. All in all it is a fantastic season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the New Doctor","review":"I love the new Doctor and the series. I have followed Doctor Who since the third Doctor, JP.

Writing started of very well and slid backwards toward the end (aside from the awful Dalek Story) when the show became more like the past few series. Steven Moffatt's abilities were stuck more on strong situations and a little less on logic of the stories. The acting and characters were warm and welcoming. Smith's Doctor was an old man in a younger body and came off as someone that is more like Doctors prior to 1980.If this is a progressive step, the next years could be the best since Tom baker left the series.

Lil Wayne's latest CD is pure recycled garbage with brash and boastful lyrics from a would be superstar who is ready to wear the mantle, but who isn't yet capable of delivering the lyrics he believes he's capable of. In short, the spirit is willing, but the mouth just can't deliver the goods. Manny Fresh gives Wayne the beats to work with--not Manny's best, but good.

Her family, while not observant, always closed their store for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, never missing a Passover seder. Ferber felt that being Jewish was to be subjected to anti-Semitism. In 1917 she wrote Fanny Herself, based largely on the experiences she had while growing up in Appleton, Wisconsin and later in Chicago, Illinois. Her's is a tale of a young Jewish girl trying to become a successful businesswoman in early twentieth century America without denying her Jewish roots or subverting her social conscience.

Finally, there's the awesome Chang Yi (just check him out in \\"Shaolin Invincible Sticks\\", \\"Eagle's Claw\\" & especially in Samo Hung's \\"The Victim\\".) Except for the rousing opening & the fairly exciting end fight, the middle is absolutely boring. I don't know if anybody else noticed this, but almost all the fights in the middle took place in the dark. This is a lame tactic usually used because 1) the DP was incompetent, 2) the film's budget wouldn't allow for more lights or 3) to cover up an actor's lack of martial skill. A so-so film recommended only to Carter Wong and/or Chang Yi completists only.

For instance, this record opens with a sort of a 90s smooth-jazz version of \\"The Thrill is Gone,\\" which, as opposed again to the previous reviewer's comments, is not an alternate version, but sounds like some type of bootlegged recording from a soundcheck.

It had no magic, no zing! Although there was plenty of sex, there was no passion. I found myself not caring about either of the protagonists. I knew I was supposed to feel sympathy for them and suspense at the various trials the hero underdoes, but I didn't. I read the first 60 pages and just scanned the rest of the book.

How fortunate she is that Gavin Elliot comes along and becomes her protector and rescuer - He truly is the kind of man women are all looking for. I mean he has only even had one woman in his life - unique to these stories for sure. It will take much patience and trust between this couple to ever find true happiness though. And their horrors do not end with the islands of the East - when they return to London they still have demons to fight.

Quiet Girl, the first track in this album, finds itself in one of Sher Music's fake books.This album is full of unbelievable tunes, masterfully played by Billy Childs, Bob Sheppard, and others. One of my two favorites is Quiet Girl, a song whose changes are really quite complex, yet with a haunting melody that is very compelling. The other, Backwards Bop, burns white hot, again with Billy Childs trademark abilty to extend classical Jazz forms (in this case hard-bop) using innovative rhythmic and harmonic structures.Another note: Bob Sheppard, the sax player on this album, is phenomenal. This is a tight, solid group and one of my all-time favorite albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, just short of fantastic","review":"as with the previous recordings of Mahler symphonies by the SFSO and MTT, i really like this recording. the sound and playing is very good, as always with this orchestra. i give it 4 stars only because i am comparing it to the Royal Concertgebouw under Chailly recording, also an SACD. listening to this recording alone, i would say it is great, but in comparison to the Chailly recording, this disc is just missing something. it does not feel as dramatic, as explosive, as depressing as the Chailly recording. if for some reason you have a qualm with Chailly, than i would suggest this recording over all others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoping for the best","review":"I am very leery about these flat screen monitors.

From the traditional \\"insert document, close lid, pray that the page didn't move\\" kind to the hand held type. All had their drawbacks.This scanner with the see through positioning rocks. I now know immediately if I need to reposition the paper just be seeing how it looks through the glass.Additionally, I have scanned large (36\\" x 36\\") plans and used the included software to create a single document. I was completely stunned when I couldn't identify where in the resulting document the software overlaid the individual scanned images. Nice.The included OCR software works great, I've copied whole pages from books with 100% accuracy.The only downside is that it's a little slow. It takes about 20 seconds to grab the first image, and maybe 15 seconds thereafter. But then again, I don't sit around and scan all day.Don't bother with the traditional scanners requiring a lid.

As a museum educator I am always on the look out for a children's book that will hold the kids interest and get them excited about history. This is the book!The layout is great. It is almost as if the authors took the concept of computer interactives and laid them out on paper. That may not sounds terribly enticing but it is -- and it works. The information is thoughtfully prepared and presented in a way that kids should love. Questions at the bottom of each page encourage kids to jump from one topic to another as they make their journey, by covered wagon, across the American West. All the hazards and pitfalls are included, along with several vingettes of the daily life of various members of a wagon train. This is a book that shows history as vital, exciting and human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking 1 2 3 Five hundered fabulous three-ingredient recip","review":"Wow,what a gold-mine! Rozanne Gold is a genius and genie when it comes to flavors. I'd recommend this book to aspiring chefs to understand flavor systems as well as home cooks who want a little sophistication in their menus. This is NOT open a can or box and dump cooking---far from it. This is a collection of recipes developed over nearly a decade by a chef who looks at minimalism just as an artist or poet does. My favorite recipes are cornish hen under a brick,wine dark short ribs, and chocolate truffle torte. But with 500 recipes I'll bet I'll find more. She even makes turnips sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking 1-2-3","review":"I use this book many times each week. It is easily the best book in my busy household.

The transcriptions are quite accurate and sound good on the piano. The vocal part requires that you listen to the CD to know what it is actually supposed to sound like on the verses, as Sarah changes them a bit. The piano part is a good mix of the original piano part plus some of the synth and guitar parts, a mix that is very pleasing to the ear.

Fifteen years later, for Andie, Julie and Raven, someone's after them, when they try to solve the murder of \\"Mrs. X\\" and the disappearance of \\"Mr. X\\". And sometimes, Andie doesn't know if she can trust them, even if loyalty binds them to murder.

The book is about 500 pages, which is about the same amount of times I rolled my eyes while reading it. The cliches are so deep you might want to bring a shovel to dig your self out. The syrupy sweet friendship the story revolves around is totaly unrealistic. The plot was about as hard to figure out as a Scooby Doo cartoon. The characters were stereo-typical - the dumb pretty one, the tough one, the very normal average one... are we watching Charlie's Angels ? Or maybe an episode of the Power Puff Girls ?If you're looking for a VERY easy read, that will not challenge you in any way, you'll enojy this. The story idea isn't bad, it could have been a good book. I'm sure there are many people that will like this book. The author and I just have totaly different ideas about what makes a good book good. Why did I bother to finish it ? If I start reading a book - I'm going to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"Loved it! great characters and plot. definitely recommended and will read more by this author. grabbed my attention from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"It took a little while for the action to start, but the wait was worth it. I usually like mine to take off right from the begining. It was worth reading, and I will suggest this title to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the quality of her other books","review":"I just can't recommend Shocking Pink to anyone, unless they have too much time on their hands and nothing else to do. The opening sequence, set in the past, dragged on for WAY too long. So much so that I was about to give up on the book altogether, and it is very seldom I put down a book without finishing it. But it finally segued into the present, and it did pick up from there with a good story and more interesting characters. (although as one other reviewer notes, the three leads are stereotypes.)Once you're done, there's not much explanation of WHY the killer did what h/she did in the past, just a flimsy premise. Read something else of Erica Spindler's, pretty much anything else, and you'll be better served."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written","review":"I wanted to like this book.

I have been a fan since, and gone through multiple copies of this book.The book introduces three friends, and takes you on a wild ride through something they involuntarily step into as teenagers, and believe me, the ride doesn't stop once the author brings you into their adult lives.I don't want to give much away about the premise of the book itself, as I think it is important to read the tale in its entirety to get the full scope of this story.Erica paints a very vivid picture and takes you deeply into the frightening depths of the scarred mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would read this over and over again","review":"I read this book when I was in the tenth grade and I loved it! I read it in one sitting I liked it so much that I asked my dad if he would help me find out how to order it. I never got the chance to order it but I bought from the bookstore this May when it was released again and I have read it over and over again it was incredible the ending was so shocking to me I was amazed when the killer was revealed. This book is one of my favorites and I have many favorites but this one stands out from the rest.I have purchased and read Cause For Alarm, Bone Cold, All Fall Down (which is my second favorite), and last but not least Fortune. All of them are great reads and I can wait to read her latest when it released in a paperback edition. If you like romantic suspense then you will love these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I'm only left wondering why I have never heard of Erica Spindler before.

Bailee & Carter are both virgins & don't have much clue on love or romance. It's fun watching them discover each other as well as themselves. Carter is not your typical hero. From the beginning he is very shy & quite but it plays into the story very well. You may see him as a weak person when he gets beat up a couple times but I still liked him. Bailee is a little bossy but if I were in her shoes I'd have to set some ground rules also. I highly recommend this book & can't wait to read the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.

Interesting and attention getting story. Some sexual buildup, but you have to wait to the very end for the big scene. Good solid character development and growth as two people who are strong and vulnerable learn to live with and love one another. A little mystery story thrown in, some plot tension from the bad guy, but more a love story. There are 3 loose ends, the other two women from the wagon train and the young woman who works (?) in the local whorehouse. There is a preview of one of the other stories at the end of the book.

The machine that ripped them must have been under stress at the time as there are numerous skips and dropouts throughout the album. Listen to the audio samples. The imperfections are representative of the entire recording. I personally find it quite distracting.It looks like the album is now out of print. I would recommend trying to get your hands on a used physical CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicking Through The Glass Ceiling","review":"As a young Filipino-American pursuing a career in higher education, I enjoyed reading Shattering the Myths. According to the data shown, women have clearly moved forward in attaining undergraduate and graduate degrees but continue to be underrepresented and underpaid in many career fields. Why must women follow male-dominated standards to gain equal status? Our reference point for business practice revolves around a male-centered referent. Changes must occur in our entire world of operation in order for women to attain economic and social justice. Collectively society can reinvent current organizational models of leadership. In the new model, \\"tokenism\\" must be discarded as the organization moves toward a deep commitment to and an appreciation for a woman's assets and her personal contributions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that Jessica Harper!","review":"We have been listening to Jessica Harper albums from the library for years now, and finally have gotten our own.

The info is organized well, into chapters covering physical fitness, a proximity to and relationship with nature, relaxation, and diet. Through each of these, she illustrates how it's different from the frenetic life of a business professional (which she'd once been), and give practical advice for those of us whose lives are still frenetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scandinavaian Culture Supports Well-Being---Beautiful Book!","review":"*****This wonderful book describes a vision and philosophy of well-being inspired by Scandinavia. It appealed to me because of its emphasis on simplicity and place---a place known for darkness and coldness, interestingly. Since I live in the Pacific Northwest and often find myself through winter months yearning for sun and light, I thought I might find myself inspired by this book. And inspired I was!The author sees Scandinavia as \\"an exotic culture with universally relevant ideas\\". After moving to a simple life on a small Swedish island, she transformed the way she saw life and well-being. The author details how this well-being can be manifested in a Scandinavian-inspired way of life no matter where you live.Highly recommended.*****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I honestly don't know what everyone else sees in this book.

It has become a treasured heirloom because most of my family (McCuskers, Phillips, and Martin's) grew up working at the park. Even though I wasn't around during the parks hayday, having been born in the mid-1970's, stories about the park still fascinate me to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality, a bit light for espresso?","review":"This is the lightest roast I've encountered that calls itself \\"espresso roast.\\" The quality, however, is so much better than what I've been drinking that my wife and I are torn on the issue of purchasing more. On the one hand, we'd like a darker roast. On the other, the quality of this coffee is so much better than what we've been making espresso from that we aren't sure we want to change coffees. I think we'll probably search for a darker roast that has the quality of this Lavazza, but, if we don't find it we'd be likely to come back to this quality rather than drink a darker roast of lesser quality. Excellent coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I was really looking forward to trying this espresso blend and was very disappointed, the beans were very dry, unlike most espresso lenses we h ave purchased before.

Otherwise, it would be a very nice brush for cold applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"The band 'The Strokes' are trying to be.","review":"While I don't mainly listen to punk, I still thought album was fun and very enjoyable. The singer isn't some ..., distorted [person], the guitarists actually play differnet chords, the bass is alive and well, and the drumming fits the music perfectly. I believe The Hives are out there just to have fun and enjoy the music they play, unlike 'The Vines' and 'The Strokes' ('The' must be the new trend in bands these days), who are obviously trying to bring back the full on punk assault of the 70's/early 80's and take all the credit for it. Definately a must listen for fans of REAL punk and rock & roll, and even for fans of metal. Hail to the Hives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfect...","review":"Isn't refreshing to hear music not associated with pop. That's what I consider this album. Refreshing. It reminds you of years gone by. That is because it sounds like others, as has been pointed out. Is that bad? No. It's like listening to the \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" soundtrack thinking new classic Bowie music had been created. It just makes you happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums in a long time.","review":"... Anyway really good album allot of just 2 or 3 min tracks. If you are tired of clone bands ....

With all the hype about these guys I expected something better than a cheap imitation of early Kinks or Romantics. Punk is just a code word for I cant play this equipment,but I look cool. These guys cannot play,the guitar playing is somewhere above Sid Vicious & less than the dead Mark Bolan,and he knew all of 9 chords. If you see this in a budget rack for 3 bucks,it might be worth it if you are hard up.

That ... music died a long time ago and people still want to milk it. Punk was about bad playing, bad singing, and statement making. The statement made was \\"We Suck\\". And just as so called \\"punk\\" bands before them the Hives fit that statement. The singing, if you can call it that is god aweful. The musicianship is non-existant. The length of the cd should tell you about the song craft. The amazing thing is that people are eating this ... up. So if you like garbage than by all means buy this.

The songs are quick, but fun and rocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets Think Now","review":"With all the horrible music that the industry is putting out today it is tempting to jump on anything that does not totally stink. Resist! The Hives are not a horrible band but they certainly are not on the same level as The Pixies. In an interview with Rolling Stone lead singer \\"Howlin\\", as he calls himself, is quoted as saying that he does not listen or even like a lot of music. That would explain the total lack of diversity that he shows as a singer. In a music industry that is surrouned by pre-fab boy bands and and annoying wanna be Korn childern (god knows why) this may seem like a relief but just becuase someone slaps the label Punk on themselves does not make them worthwhile. Investigate other avenues of music before succumbing to this new wave of surface punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal, derivative","review":"people have latched on to this hives album as if it signifies something \\"new\\" about punk rock. garbage: they're just ripping off bands like Turbonegro and the Hellacopters who have had a massive underground punk following. since they're from sweden, chances are they've been to a number of Hellacopters concerts, and have probably caught Norway's Turbonegro touring. i can't stand bands who are built up as the next \\"new thing\\", but everything they write is just a rip off of great rockandroll pioneers.the main reviewer said they were loud and raw, or something to that affect. listen to Guitar Wolf, Turbonegro, the Hellacopters, Electric Frankenstein, and the Nation of Ulysses instead. then you'll see what \\"loud\\" and \\"raw\\" truly are."},{"rating":"1","title":"trends, trends, trends...","review":"First the Strokes with classic rock rewrites and now the Hives with Rolling Stones rewrites.

The rest of the songs could also be played on radio, but it just is lacking those intangables. The Hives cockiness is aparent in their performances, and can be backed-up for the most part on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"It took me a few listens to get into this CD. I listened to the whole record straight through, was unimpressed, and let it collect dust for a while. Later, I decided to give it another shot. I ended up liking a few more of the songs, so I tried listening to it again. Every time I heard the CD, I ended up liking more songs. Now I really like almost all of them.The band is really talented and they've put together a great little CD. A few warnings, though: First, the band tries to sound very garage-ish, I liked this little effect, but more than one passenger in my car said that it annoyed them. Second, many of the songs sound very similar. Third, it's over all too quickly. It's certainly not the shortest record I've ever heard, but it is over a bit quickly.If you liked \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\", you should check this CD out. Just be sure to listen to it a few times before you make any final decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the music, not the critics.","review":"This album just plain rocks. I was skeptical of The Hives at first, because I was sick of people compairing all of those \\"The bands\\" that the mainstream has recently decided to pay attention to. Don't listen to the critics, check these guys out.They are completely doing their own thing. Of course there will be bands out there that might have a few similar elements to their music, but every band has that. It's not fair that they got swept into the wave of *gasp* what's \\"trendy\\" right now. The Hives have a lot more to offer than 'Hate To Say I Told You So'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Incredible","review":"This band has more energy than any I have ever seen before.

From sincere screaming vocals to fastpaced energenic rock music to lyrics that are sooo cool its unbelievable, this band is flat out amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trick or treat!","review":"Listening to the Hives is a bit like answering your door on Halloween and finding your neighbor's ten year old kids dressed up in homemade Iggy Pop, Fred 'Sonic' Smith and Sky Saxon costumes. They're simply adorable, and you love their spunk, but there's no way in hell you'd mistake them for the real thing. The Hives have obviously spent quite a lot of time perfecting their trashy lyrics, wailing Ron Asheton guitar licks and rock & roll attitude, and therein lies the problem. Everything about this record is flawlessly executed, and totally predictable. It's easy to grow your hair out and jump around with a vintage guitar hollering about tearing things apart, but it's a lot harder to do it like you really mean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NULLAS SALUS SINE THE HIVES","review":"Like the phrase says, there is NO salvation without the hives.

Sure, the first time you listen to it its highly enegetic and outrageous and you love it, but this CD has no replay value whatsoever.

Anyway, this CD is decent, but not if you are looking for depth, lyrical prowess, instrumental skill, talent, or anything else. This is a FUN album, which you dont see much anymore. But Thats about it. Main Offender is actually a really good song, but nothing else really stands out. \\"Find yourself another Girl\\" somewhat stands out, because its different, but that doesn't mean its good! However, I do respect the fact that they are making a valiant attempt to revive punk rock in these awful times of self proclaimed punk, orpunk bands like BLink 182, Good Charlotte, and Simple plan, who actually all .... This CD is decent but ultimately not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too few one star reviews","review":"I was looking through the reviews of this album and noticed that there were too few one-star reviews. This band deserves 10,000 one-star reviews. Their little cocky attitudes and the fact that nobody in the band wrote the lyrics makes this pop garbage.

It's a damn good thing there are actually still one or two bands out there making actual music. This, however, is NOT one of those bands. It is blasphemy to even compare this pile of ... with MC5, it's not even close. MC5 is a classic band, untouchable in the annals of history. Is this an [inexpensive] Rolling Stones knockoff?

Such albums as this seem to have cemented their spot towards the top of our collection. The cd starts out with the contagious sounds of Declare Guerre Nucleiare, and never lets up. Although nothing can compare to the wonderous days of The Ramones and Elvis Costello, The Hives come pretty close. Bands such as this enlighten me with hope on the possibility of good music actually being available to the mainstream audience since the days of Nirvana. If you enjoy to be blown out of your mind with the rocking tunes of fast drums and guitars with amps set to blow your mind, I highly reccommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"the hype","review":"the hives have catchy tunes, and this cd may strike some as new or original in the likes of other \\"punk\\" of today (new found glory, starting line, good charlotte, ect.) but this cd is basically a tribute (rip-off) of early rolling stones or the who. not to mention, the hives arent the only swedish act garage rocking the U.S., the (international) noise conspiracy (ex-refused) have been playing garage rock style punk for a few years now, after refused's the shape of punk to come elluded to the \\"new\\" sound. for anyone who settles for the hives, im sorry, for good garage rock, pick up the (international) noise conspiracy's survival sicksness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to say I own this cd","review":"I regret buying the cd.

Heat up for 6 minutes (3 minutes per side), slide into the protective sleeve (protects you from getting burned, among other things) and then have a nice warm seat when you get in your freezing car in the middle of winter. Cover with a pillow or towel, and it's till warm (enough) when you get back to the car 8 hours later. Can't say enough to recommend. HOWEVER, this is my second. First one I had for 5+ years and it just exploded one day (in the sense that the seam broke and the \\"goo\\" leaked out so I couldn't use it anymore. Glad to see they're still sold on the web as I bought one from Amazon the very same day mine died. Makes the early morning commute so much nicer.

It's cold, period. But Lava Buns makes an excellent seat heater. No wires to trip over, nothing to tangle up with the stick shift or console, and it takes only 2 min a side in the microwave to give more than enough heat for my daily drive. (The instructions call for 3 min, but I found this too warm. YMMV) Consider using it for your lower back as well. Something about that warmth at the base of your spine that really helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold as ice","review":"I bought this seat, and another just like it, for my wife and I to use at the Breeder's Cup in Kentucky last month. It was cold and we were going to be setting outside for 5 or 6 hours. We heated the seat's inserts in the microwave according to instructions, taking care not to heat it too long so the inserts would not burst. The seats were warm for maybe an hour and one-half, much, much less than the 4 to 5 hours advertised. For the second day, we even heated it as long as we dared and it still only provided about one hour's worth of heat. We were very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought these for use at winter soccer games. They work great.

I arranged for my wife to give the \\"Buns\\" to me as a Christmas gift, and I was very eager to try them Christmas evening. I followed the instructions for microwaving the gel insert for exactly three minutes (CAUTION: THE GEL PACK IS TOO HOT TO HANDLE WITH BARE HANDS AFTER MICROWAVING), and then I placed the unit under my butt while I watched some TV. The unit was pleasantly warm--as felt through normal slacks--for almost one hour; after that, the warmth factor decreased so much that I could barely feel any warmth at all, even through my \\"street pants.\\" There is NO WAY Lava buns would put out effective heat for anywhere near six hours, especially in a cold environment, and especially to be felt through heavy outdoors-type clothing. I returned the Lava Buns for a refund using Amazon's easy-return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work as advertised and provide a very nice seat cushion as well","review":"My wife and I were surprised the first time we used these. We took them to a nearby beach which can be cold with the wind coming in off the ocean. Not only did the Lava Buns keep us warmer the gel actually provided a more comfortable seat which was an unexpected bonus.They are not difficult to use, removing the gel pack and placing it into a microwave for heating and then putting it back into the cloth pouches.

It started making a popping noise when I got over 2 mins., so to be safe I heated it for 2 mins. on each side. It was enough and I was comfy thoughout the game.

It is a nightmarish mish-mash of material. Many times the same story or fact is repeated in several consecutive chapters because there is no strong outline of what material is to be covered when. This jumping back and forth effect also causes confusion in understanding the sequence of events in his life.

This is preferable to stepping on his toes because that would be harder for the owner to maneuver-Too militaristic/barbaric for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas","review":"This book addresses training issues simply and straightforward.

I'm thirteen, male, considered intelligent, and my favorite genres are Sci-fi and Fantasy.The concept is intrigiuing. Unfortunately, the author doesn't expand beyond the \\"Boys look for father, find themselves...\\" idea. This severly limits the plot progression and character development.The excessive description was taken one step too far, detracting instead of adding to the story. If the books are plants, and description is water, Cynthia Voigt's neighborhood is now a lake. Case in point: There are more than four full paragraphs describing one character's musings about flea eyes.The truth is, I felt very little desire to complete the book...... until I remembered that a major part of my grade depended on it. Even though I resented reading it, others may find it to be one of their favorite books.

I am a 13 year old teen. This book contains none of the elements of a story that I enjoy. I thought the book was extremely dull. The plot was well developed, but nothing kept me hooked except the due date of an essay I had to write on the novel. I prefer action, and this book had little. It was a deeply sentimental book dealing with the family troubles of the Tillermans. The book is nowhere near in my favorite genre. But if you prefer the emotional novels of Cynthia Voigt, this book's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was horrible","review":"I read this book and I hated it.

I loved his first CD and was carried away with his first concert! When I saw \\"Greek\\" for the first time I was shocked to hear his voice and the problems he was having on a few of the songs. No, I didn't come here first because I don't care about other people's ratings. As a matter of fact I noticed that some people were posting 5-star ratings before the Concert was shown or even sold! Hmmm. I'm just giving my review now. Unfortunately I am not happy with what I heard because of course I could also hear it on the CD. My Christmas money could have been better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keeper!","review":"\\"Live at the Greek\\" will be making a trip back to the store...for a refund. This mess doesn't deserve to share space with my other Josh Groban CD's. What happened to his voice? I don't know and I'm so disappointed I dont really care. Looks like many fans noted the problems with Josh's voice. I heard it in the first few minutes and just sat there shocked. I sincerely hope that the mistakes made here will not happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just my Opinion","review":"I think \\"Live at the Greek\\" had great potential. The potential to be as terrific as anything Josh Groban has done before. Unfortunately for me I can hear the vocal issues (strain, nasal sound) on some songs that others have noted. There's just no true comparison to the wonderful vocals he has done in his three other CD's. This isn't his best work or even \\"Closer\\" to his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at the Greek","review":"I posted a review on the major website for Josh Groban's concert, \\"Live at the Greek.\\" The rating is the same for a very different performance.

The only thing you have to lose is your hard-earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"After watching \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"I decided not to buy the DVD and not to buy a concert ticket. I see where the concert go'ers state that this recorded concert is \\"exactly\\" like the way he is in concert. Well, that's enough for me. I could barely watch the PBS concert on TV without groaning, Groban's voice was so bad. I enjoyed hearing \\"Caruso,\\" a difficult song for anyone, but the special effects were childish. It just gave me a headache. Groban is not a stage performer, his only true talent lies with his voice. When that voice is nasal, well it's not worth watching. Groban can't afford another bad performance like this one or the fans will be departing in a Los Angeles second."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek: Bought it,, Watched it, Returned it","review":"I won't wax on about why because it seems like many folks already stated the obvious. I bought it because I love Josh Groban and have everything he's done so far. Yes, I am a fan. I watched it eagerly expecting to hear his gorgeous voice. I watched it twice, still expecting to hear his gorgeous voice. That didn't happen. I liked his different look, the drums, sets, all that. No problem with it at all. My expectations were to hear his gorgeous voice. I heard a nasaly congested voice instead. So I went to my store and returned it. When I got home I played Josh Groban's first concert DVD and I was happy with it from the opening scene of of \\"Alla Luce Del Sole,\\" to the finale of \\"Let me Fall.\\" That's Heavenly! This concert is farther south."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek is poorly done!","review":"I bought my \\"Greek\\" concert DVD+CD here at Amazon.com. I watched it yesterday for the first time and listened to the CD. This concert is so poor it's hard to believe that a slew of professionals had any hand in it. Josh Groban's voice IS nasal and poor in a few of the songs. The camera work is sloppy and visually poor. While it may be a terrific keepsale for those who attended his concerts, it isn't for me. I have all the CD's and the first concert Groban did. Those are worth keeping and I listen to them often. This is going back as soon as I can get to the post office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the REAL Josh Groban?","review":"Is the REAL Josh Groban the man with the terrific, impeccable voice we heard on all music prior to the \\"Greek\\" or is it the rock-styled, nasal man we now see on the new DVD release? I think we all know the answer. As far as \\"Loyalty,\\" that has to be earned, especially when it comes at a price. I didn't get this DVD handed to me freely, so Groban shouldn't expect a free pass. Like so many others, I bought it, listened, and it will be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"PBS Concert at the Greek","review":"This was Josh Groban?? That's what I kept asking myself while I watched the concert and felt my interest go away quickly. The only performance that even reminded me of the previous concert was when Groban sang with the beautiful Lucia Micarelli on the violin. But while she was dressed in a lovely gown and performed from the heart, Groban looked unkempt and remained standing in the dark. At the very end of the performance he shouted out her name and she was seated to the side. Her solo was lovely. Josh Groban was less than entertaining (since he wanted to do that rather than show us his gorgeous vocal talents). Wierd camera angles, loud and different arrangements songs that have become his standards, and bad sound make this concert really poor. I heard some of the \\"old\\" Josh Groban but the strain still asserted itself. It was more of a strain for me to watch. Forget the pledge breaks, this was one annoying mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a very poor performance by Groban","review":"I was extremely excited when the \\"Live at the Greek\\" concert DVD went on sale in Christmas. With all the pre-release reviews (like the one above) from rabid fans I was sure this one would be yet another beautiful recording by Josh Groban. To my great shock and disappointment, Josh Groban's voice was very poor, very nasaly and he looked less so different. The once gorgeous looking and gorgeous sounding guy is sadly no more. His stage presence is uncomfortable because he knew his voice wasn't up to par. Not even close. Too bad for Groban. I can tell that even here on Amazon his sales record isn't even close to bottom. I returned mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice Issues Mar the \\"Greek\\"","review":"I was very happy to buy Josh Groban's second concert \\"Live at the Greek,\\" even though I did not see it on PBS first. However, when I watched the concert I felt so disheartened by Groban's performance I couldn't believe it was the same man! In \\"Mi Mancherai\\" I immediately heard a nasaly strain in his voice. Disappointing because it's one of the more lovely songs on \\"Closer.\\" Speaking of \\"Closer\\" where was it? There's only a handful from that CD and too many of previous CD's that had already been done on the first concert. Everything about the \\"Greek\\" is sloppily done as though the filming was an afterthought. One thing I know for sure. After buying the \\"Greek\\", I won't be buying a ticket for the concert when it comes to my city. Another thing: I'll never buy another Josh Groban CD without checking it out first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exchanged the first, returned the second","review":"I bought my \\"Live at the Greek\\" DVD at a local Walmart and it sounded very bad too (the often-mentioned nasaly sound). So I returned that one and bought another today. Unfortunately it too sounds nasaly as well. I don't know what the problem is, but I won't be getting a third. I think the chances of my getting a superior DVD like a few mentioned here are slim to none. I don't believe this is really representative of Josh Groban's voice but I can't give a rave review for a defective DVD either. Odd, though. My sister only watched it on PBS and said Groban sounded that way on the televised concert. Warner brothers should do a recall so Josh's wonderful reputation isn't harmed by this lousy copy. How about it Warner???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe it!!","review":"I can't believe I'm rating Josh Groban so low. I absolutely love everything he ever did and bought up his first concert DVD for me and so many others it wasn't funny! But I really have to be painfully honest here, I just couldn't watch my Greek DVD without wanting to cry. Regardless of how much I love my other Groban music, this one is really, really bad. Josh's voice is so strained on \\"Mi Mancherai\\" that I fast-forwarded it too get to the next song. Was that really Josh? Apparently it was because it's not just here that I've read the poor reviews. I got my DVD from Barnes & Noble and people are mentioning it there too. All sites are saying the same thing....that Josh is nasal and strained. It comes across painfully clear. I did return my DVD to the store for a refund. I'll probably buy his next CD, but I'll absolutely do it after I hear a sample at the store first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully better next time","review":"I passed up buying \\"Live at the Greek\\" after watching Josh Groban's concert on PBS. I heard the now infamous \\"nasal\\" voice then and knew it wouldn't be one to add to my music collection. I hope Groban's production crew will take note of the lagging sales and poor reviews and never record Groban in an outdoor theatre again. There's no way we can hear the rich deep voice with all the background noise and outdoor elements to affect him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned my Greek DVD the same day","review":"I wasn't one of the fortunate people who had an opportunity to see the PBS showing of Josh Groban's \\"Live at the Greek.\\" I was one of the unfortunate people who bought it absolutely certain that it would be as wonderful as his first concert. I am now among the many people who stood in the return line to get my money back. Perhaps Josh Groban could have sounded better than what I heard on the Greek concert DVD, but it doesn't change the fact that this specific performance was the one that was recorded, packaged and sold. Since this is the place for \\"reviews,\\" I decided to put my two cents worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the Real Josh Groban?","review":"After watching \\"Live at the Greek\\" on PBS I'm really confused. The first time I saw Josh Groban was on PBS with his first live concert. It was wonderful, beautiful, perfect in every way and I bought the DVD many times over (for me, for gifts). Well \\"Live at the Greek\\" was a big surprise, and not a good one. It's a mystery as to what has happened to the man with the golden voice. It's certainly no longer beautiful. I guess if you love watching those gosh darn big screens, hearing the LOUD screaming of grown women, and don't mind a nasaly singer....you'll love this DVD. This all comes with the package. The first concert was a sensory feast, both visually and to the ears. This one was minimally bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooooh. This is painful","review":"Josh Groban's Greek concert was painful to watch and even more painful to hear. I taped his PBS concert from the first showing but couldn't watch it through. I watched it later thinking it was just me and it would sound better. Sad for me, Josh didn't sound better. He didn't even look good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very Confusing second concert by Josh Groban","review":"I remember in the early stages of Josh Groban's career there were lots of comments about his singing style...whether it was Pop or Classical. What I and millions of others loved was that it was both, wrapped up in a gorgeous package and performed beautifully. Now we have the Greek but in such a confusing mix that it leaves me asking HUH?? This concert has Pop and Classical styled songs, sung in a rock-pop-classical-alternative music mix. We have a rock drum solo, flashing overhead lights, audience viewpoints with twirling glow sticks, moving backgrounds. So much of everything!! That wouldn't even be a blip on the radar if it weren't for Josh's voice too. It's good, poor, great, nasal, good, great, good. By the end of the concert I was so darned confused I was exhausted. Of course I was disappointed too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at the Greek on PBS","review":"I consider myself one of the lucky ones because I watched Josh Groban's Greek concert on PBS before deciding to buy it. I immediately heard his voice problems and decided it wasn't for me. Lucky for me I didn't get stiffed buying an expensive DVD and CD that I wouldn't enjoy. I didn't watch more than 40 minutes of the PBS concert and it was free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at the Greek","review":"I wish I could write a glowing review of Josh Groban's concert DVD, but I can't. I loved and bought all of his CD's and the first concert combo until it came to \\"Closer.\\" Although I liked a couple of tunes, it wasn't exciting or even run of the mill. I had high hopes for his Greek concert though. There are too many problems with the concert that have been mentioned often here, and I agree they make the concert a disappointment for Groban. Hopefully he can rescue his voice AND make another studio album that is appealing. His Live at the Greek concert isn't. It was just one disappointing turn after another. And Yes, please retire \\"To Where You Are.\\" Performers can be categorized by repetition of one song. Groban already is and if he isn't careful, he won't even have enough fans to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Real Josh Groban????????","review":"omg....What did they do with the real Josh Groban?

His first concert was gorgeous. But THIS!! What happened to my guy? Oksy it wasn't all terrible. But I just couldn't take all the other silly women screaming over him.

I kept saying to myself \\"This CAN'T be the real Josh Groban,\\" and all that other stuff including excusing his poor performance. After reading the past few reviews by people who actually attended more than one live concert, I realize this is what Josh Groban really looks and sounds like Now. Well, now that it's been confirmed by the forgiving fan base (they call themselves \\"Grobanites\\"), I know it's time for me to move on. Unfortunately for Groban I can hear perfectly well and can hear every bad note he forces out. Fortunately for his existing fan base, they'll have lots of cheap DVD's to buy because mine will also be going to my used record store. If anyone hasn't bought it yet and is contemplating a purchase, look to \\"half.com\\" or your used record store. I'm sure they'll be lots of cheap ones to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Performance by Josh Groban at \\"Greek\\"","review":"I got my DVD from Amazon.Com on 12/29. I've watched it four times and each times I just sit there thinking I'll find more to enjoy. Simply stated, I can't enjoy Josh Groban's singing in the Greek Theatre. The sound is very poor and Josh's voice, his only true talent, is not always good. Add to that the annoying lighting, and alternative style music and this is pretty much a disappointment. Groban sounds congested and like he's trying to sing from his nose in three songs. \\"Canto Alla Vita\\" which was so beautiful in his first concert is ripped apart here with a grating psychodelic introduction on the synthocizer by Groban. YUK. After about the first 30 minutes, Groban's voice seems to clear but gee, it's too little too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Josh!!","review":"I waited patiently for Josh's next concert and I can't believe this!!!! It can't be my Josh!! His voice sounds so bad I wanted to cry. He looks good but all the stupid views of older women were even worse. I can't return it so I'll be selling it to the used music store. I love Josh Groban so I'll wait until I get something that has his beautiful voice back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a very disappointed fan","review":"After anxiously awaiting the release of this DVD, I am so sorry to say I think it simply does not meet the very high standards of his previous work--the CDs or DVD. I saw him in concert in Atlanta and was very impressed with his live sound. In fact, I thought he sounded better live than recorded (which I thought was impossible.)I noticed two significant problems with Josh's voice: a fast vibrato and a nasal quality. Unlike other reviewers, I found the quality unaffected by my audio settings. Frankly, I think he needs a long rest and a better voice coach. He's been on the road for a long time and probably could use a break.Despite this, I have bought tickets to his next concert in Atlanta. I'm crossing my fingers that this DVD is just a blip for an otherwise exceptional performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rescue Josh Groban!","review":"Help rescue Josh Groban from himself!!

Since there's more than 200 reviews here and a majority of them note that fact, I feel justified in adding mine here. I bought it, I'll return it. I'm doubtful I'll buy anything else by Groban.

Whatever the reasons, I'm not going to keep this badly done DVD and CD in my house. It doesn't belong with my Josh Groban music. He was just too good to push this on us. Since everyone in charge of making this DVD, including Josh, had to know it was bad, I'm not making any excuses for them either.

Unfortunately, I can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groban's Second Concert Not Impressive","review":"Josh Groban's vocals in \\"Live at the Greek\\" can't even be compared to his previous work. In his first CD, his first concert, and \\"Closer\\" his voice was absolutely gorgeous and perfect in every way. We heard a young man who deserved every accolade and he had a stage presence to match. The Greek concert DVD has none of that. The vocals on \\"Mi Mancherai\\" and \\"Remember when it rained,\\" are so poor with a much noticed nasal sound in his voice, it's shocking. And if I have to read one more review reminding the rest of the world that it was recorded \\"LIVE!\\" I'll choke. We're not deaf, people. Nor are we stupid. We KNOW it was recorded live. We can hear the massive roar of crazed fans. We can see them constantly. That it's a live concert is evident. My review is that this concert didn't impress me at all and if Josh Groban wants to reach out to those of us who initially bought his CD's and concert DVD, he better take care of his voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at the Greek","review":"I saw the concert this weekend and it pains me to say that I didn't enjoy it.

He was so super with that voice, even for a dweeby kind of guy. But this is so not him!! I liked only two songs from this DVD and the rest is garbage. He's so nasaly and slacker-looking. Hey, I'm a teenager and I don't like it. I read someone's review where they said it shouldn't have been done and never released like this. Josh should settle on what he wants to be and stop this.

All of his CD's are truly beautiful and the music is simply great. While I wasn't exactly thrilled with the lyrics in some songs on \\"Closer\\" it still was an excellent album. However, Groban's voice is unfortunately good then bad then okay in this concert. The lack of continuity makes the DVD difficult to watch also. I heard the nasal sounds in his voice and it was very hard to take. I'm sure there are many reasons for this but with the cost of DVD's I just have to be selective. I received this one was a birthday gift and was very grateful that the giver, my daughter, watched it with me. Afterward she returned it for something else. I hope Josh Groban takes care of his voice. His singing is truly beautiful. It just wasn't very good this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Live at the Greek\\" DVD+CD are Terrible","review":"Before adding my review about the \\"Live at the Greek DVD,\\" I wanted to check out some reviews here. Everyone who have a 3-5 star review talked about being AT the concerts and how great Groban was. HELLO!! This is the review site for the DVD+CD!! That's why people are talking about what they heard and saw on the DVD.I really don't care what goes on at other concerts or for that matter what went on at this one. What I cared about is that I bought this DVD set and it was beyond disappointing. Groban's voice was so bad I couldn't believe it either. Visually it was annoying. When you're AT a concert, you don't see all this. But here it is on DVD for all to see.This was not a worthy second concert by Josh Groban. I have the first one and it is spectacular. So now he wants to do other things....Let him. I'll be buying other music. Something where the singer doesn't sound nasal. Hmmmm. That shouldn't be hard to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"PBS's Josh Groban Concert","review":"While I do have all of Josh Groban's music, I decided not to buy \\"Live at the Greek.\\" My sister did buy the DVD set through a very big pledge with her local PBS station and she loaned it to me. I watched the concert DVD and was startled by Groban's voice!! This was in the first few minutes of the concert. He was nasal and often had problems in many songs that he had previously done so beautifully. While I do acknowledge that this concert was \\"LIVE\\", the first concert was live also and it was excellent. Regardless of the reason, I decided not to buy it for myself. It just wasn't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully it doesn't get WORSE than this!","review":"I can't help but notice that one of the Spotlight Reviews was written in OCTOBER which was BEFORE the Greek Concert DVD/cd set was even released for purchase (December). Obviously from some concert follower, you know....one of the SCREAMERS! Another obvious fact, now that people have their DVD's in their homes to actually listen to it, it's not exactly making anyone happy. It didn't for me, so I returned it. As did many, many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I heard on the Greek","review":"I can only state what I heard while listening the first time to my DVD of \\"Live at the Greek,\\" and it wasnt' Josh Groban's beautiful voice. Not all the time anyway, not even close. There were moments of the greatness that I used to admire but it was hard to stay watching since the difficult parts are in the beginning. Since I couldn't care less what others have to say, and still don't, this is MY review. It could have been filmed better with less views of screaming women and waving arms. That was VERY stupid. It could have been sung better by Josh Groban himself since they had TWO nights to film it. That is, of course, if his voice isn't permanently nasal and strained. All in all I'm disappointed with my DVD. Don't know at this time if I'll keep it but it isn't enjoyable when you have to skip to the good parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh isn't magical at the Greek theatre","review":"Josh Groban definitely has a new look but not an improved sound. I don't know what led to the problems but the production crew needs to go back and fix it. Groban can't afford to present another poor performance or he'll definitely lose me for one. The DVD is really poorly done. Why didn't anyone in the editing room catch the voice issues? That a few poor sounding songs were included is puzzling to me. I bought all of his CD's including \\"Closer,\\" even though I wasn't in love with it. Hope Josh doesn't grow so much that he loses his voice. It's really the magical part of any Josh Groban concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed with \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"I am a dedicated Josh Groban fan and even I have to admit that I'm disappointed with my concert DVD. Where's the gorgeous guy with the equally gorgeous voice?!? I read a few reviews and people call his voice \\"nasaly\\". I agree that I hear it too on my DVD. This is very disappointing because I was so excited to find out he had a new concert DVD. He's trying to change his image and that's okay with me as long as I still have a DVD I can watch. I tried to love the Greek concert but just gave up. Too many shots of screaming women ruined it too. Especially when it's at the cost of seeing Josh, which is the only reason why I bought the DVD in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"My \\"Greek\\" is defective (?) too","review":"Sadly I had to return my \\"Greek\\" concert DVD too. I don't want to chance another until the company fixes the issues. There's so many complaints I think they would address it by now, especially for those who bought theirs at a store that doesn't provide refunds. I can't give this a high rating because I got one of the DVD's that has Josh sounding nasaly. Since I can only do one review this is the one. I'm disappointed in what I hear and Warner Bros hasn't issued a public announcement about it, so I will just rate the DVD. Whether Josh Groban is really nasal or it's a defective DVD is up to them to determine, not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incredible Waste","review":"Josh Groban had such promise, with a tremendous voice with incredible range and a budding, strong presence. Then came \\"Live at the Greek.\\" It saddens me greatly to see that Groban has sold out and is now paying for it with voice problems. They're notable from the very beginning of this concert DVD, where Groban sounds strained and nasal. There's no denying that Groban is a grown man in control of his career. He claims credit for this concert as a producer, writer, creator. Even if he didn't, he's getting paid mega wages for it. So I find it impossible to cut him any slack for such a poor performance. \\"Live at the Greek\\" is a waste of Groban's talent, and (I agree with other disappointed buyers), a complete waste of money! My advice? Get it at a used CD store. I'm sure the stores are full of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban's Voice isn't Great anymore","review":"With Live at the Greek we now have a newer performer in Josh Groban. Sad to say it's at the cost of his voice. Josh Groban the piano player, solo drummer, leather pants wearer, and guy full of insipid banter. Looks pretty dull and eventually you can't be fooled by the fact that Josh Groban the singer is less than what he's been in such wonderful past performances as his first CD. Even \\"Closer\\" was somewhat of a disappointment, with the dark songs written by Groban himself. Don't quit your day job, Josh! It is disappointing but somehow predictable that Groban would sell out to the dazzling special effects. He better do something fast, because from the looks of it, the customers aren't too happy with all of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groban wears out his welcome at the Greek","review":"Maybe it's because our Public Television station is showing Josh Groban's concert AGAIN, begging for change AGAIN. Or perhaps it's because Groban is so miserable during this concert. Actually, it's both. I saw it the first time in December. We're getting cheap commercials for \\"Closer\\" and \\"Live at the Greek\\" during regular programming. While I loved and bought all of Josh Groban's prior records, the Greek just wore down my last nerve. Trying to get through it when his voice was congested took all my enthusiasm away. Groban has grown up and gone in a different direction. So have I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasaly Voice Haunts Josh Groban at the \\"Greek\\"","review":"Groban can't seem to ditch the nasal, strained voice in the first half hour of \\"Live at the Greek.\\" As noted by many, many people here, it's obviously an issue with Groban and although he gets better later, I could hardly bear to hear it. He can be a great singer if he keeps up a schedule and stays with a vocal coach. The Greek is definitely not his best and hopefully not his worst. Groban has lots of appeal but people buy his music for his voice and no other thing. Throw that away and it's one dull concert. This is pretty close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Josh Groban's second live concert was not very good at all. I didn't know what to expect because I didn't see any reviews before I bought it. However, while watching Josh Groban I just couldn't see it through to the end. His voice is not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it, Watched it, Returned it","review":"I bought Josh Groban's Live at the Greek concert DVD+CD set in early December. I watched it 3 times. I returned it for my money back. Simply said, I want quality for my money. This certainly isn't and I didn't enjoy it because of the lack of a quality performance. While there were glimmers of a good voice, there weren't enough for me to keep it. Actually, I \\"tried\\" to watch it through to the end three times. I made it the first time with great difficulty. The second and third times, I turned it off when I couldn't take the poor vocals, screaming, and lousy camera work. I thought I was buying a CD by Josh Groban, not Elvis."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Won't Be Buying \\"Greek\\"","review":"I watched Josh Groban's \\"Live at the Greek,\\" and it was obvious that he was having multiple problems with this performance. Of course, the mail issue is with his voice. He was unable to hit the stronger notes and sounded nasal from the start. I also have \\"Josh Groban in Concert,\\" which was \\"Live\\" and far more superior. This concert is just one big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trill is Gone (but not for long)","review":"Yes, I'm singing the blues. But hopefully not for long. Josh Groban's newest concert \\"Live at the Greek,\\" is not the best I've heard. There are repeats of older material, such as \\"To Where you Are.\\" The CD is miserly with only a few songs. My biggest disappointment is with the DVD. I was hoping for more from \\"Closer,\\" like the absolutely gorgeous \\"My Confession, or his first in French \\"Hymne a L'amout. No such luck. Josh strains on a few songs and it translates over to the CD and DVD. He's definitely at his best when recording in a studio and performing in a closed theatre. For those of us who have not attended a live concert, his dramatically changed looks and performance style are a shocker. I will be looking for the new CD when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Josh Groban's Best","review":"This was not Josh Groban's finest hour (or two hours with pledge breaks). The fine young singer has tremendous potenttial still and I'm sure there will be many years of successful music. I won't be adding this concert to the first. That was the performance that made Josh a mega-star practically overnight. Perfect sound, tremendous vocal quality. This second effort is missing everything that we saw in the first. Whats in the future? I'll wait and see. I'm still hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Second Concert on PBS","review":"I watched Josh Groban's second PBS concert over the weekend and was very disappointed. On some vocals his voice was poor, and the \\"Greek\\" is definitely not the place to record a concert for packaging to a mass audience. Odd filming and poor recording don't help either. I have a big collection of Josh Groban's work. This concert won't be added. However, I'm looking forward to future offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought the first, Didn't buy the Greek","review":"I bought Josh Groban's first concert DVD set two years ago after seeing it on TV and have loved it ever since. I too have all of his CD's, including his latest \\"Closer.\\" So I was all prepped to love \\"Live at the Greek\\" with as much gusto. I'm sorry to say that the concert wasn't interesting for me at all. I think that Josh's voice problems were just too much for me to handle. With such a tremendous voice, Josh should really protect it. Outdoor concerts may sound great to those who are there (and busy screaming) but it doesn't work for Josh Groban on a DVD. I also was disappointed that he repeated so many of the selections from the first concert and they weren't done very well this time. He actually does have newer material! Anyway this concert was not worth my buying. So I didn't buy it. No regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little to enjoy in \\"Greek\\"","review":"I won't be keeping my \\"Live at the Greek\\" DVD and Cd. I saw the DVD for the first time yesterday, when I played it for friends visiting for Christmas. A couple of friends who also like Groban remarked immediately on how different he sounded and looked. It was so bad that I turned it off after the first few minutes. Whatever Josh Groban is doing or not doing to have such a bad effect on his voice, should be stopped. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because he wasn't completely awful. (I would give that to people like Britney Spears if I wanted to waste my time). Regardless, I'm not keeping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was alone!","review":"I bought Josh Groban's \\"Live at the Greek\\" DVD and was shocked also at the degradation of his voice. I thought I was the only one who heard it, but then I came here and read the reviews.I hope Josh can recover and get the beautiful quality back. What he really needs is a smaller indoor theater for his concerts AND to never film the ones outdoors again. I think he is affected by the outdoor changes too much because it definitely affects his voice.I didn't enjoy the concert because of this. Also, this concert wasn't really for \\"Closer\\" as it was constantly advertised on TV. There were a lot of songs from his first concert. And I loved the first one too. It was wonderful and I enjoyed every minute of it. It was stunning. But Josh really needs to take a look back and PLEASE not do this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","review":"I watched Josh Groban's concert on PBS and taped it to watch again afterward. What happened? Josh seemed to think we would prefer someone different and different he is! With a Rock, Pop, Alternative, Classical mix that didn't seem to work, Josh belted out his vocals with lots of rock star attitude. That's unfortunate because the one thing that set Josh apart from anyone else on the planet, his gorgeous VOICE, wasn't profiled. Josh Groban the \\"performer,\\" with popping overhead lights and things projected on a huge background screen were annoying distractions. Lucia Micarelli was beautiful and performed perfectly, a reminder of what Josh Groban used to be. He sounds good in a few songs but not so in others. I won't be buying this concert. Hopefully whatever he does next will focus on his voice and leave out the circus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at the Greek","review":"I'm definitely disappointed with my DVD-CD set. I bought it before I saw the concert on television. That was a big mistake. This is Classical, Pop, Rock, all mixed together in one big confusing mixture. Groban sounds very diffrent from anything I've heard in the past including his first CD and Closer. For me, none of it works. I'm very sad to say this because it was a terrific experience to listen to his voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I had to \\"Let Go\\"","review":"Josh Groban didn't \\"Raise me Up\\" and my spirits were so dampened I can \\"Remember When It Rained\\" and became very sad. I'm happy I live in \\"America\\" and \\"Believe\\" that even \\"Caruso\\" had a bad day. I don't think they recorded him when he was at his worse, they way they did Josh Groban at the Greek. Although I am disheartened, I won't slash off my ear the way \\"Vincent\\" Van Gogh did. Josh, \\"You Raise Me Up\\" with your beautiful music, but this time, I had to let go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It, Didn't Enjoy It","review":"The PBS station in our city is now showing Josh Groban's concert again in yet another pledge drive. I'm sure it's because PBS lost big money and hasn't been able to pawn this poorly made concert off on anyone with good hearing. They didn't hook me in this time (I got the first one through a major pledge).Wow, looks like the overwhelming majority of reviews here agree with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Josh Groban has a Different Type of Audience","review":"And I couldn't way it better or with more finesse than the person who wrote the review beneath this one.Case closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban's Metamorphis","review":"I loved everything that Josh Groban did up to \\"Live at the Greek.\\" I have all of the CD's and first concert too and absolutely loved them because Groban's voice was so beautiful. I didn't care for \\"Live at the Greek,\\" and didn't buy it mostly because his voice is so congested and nasal. I saw the concert on tv and didn't watch it through. Not exactly what I expected but the metamorphis isn't why I rated the concert so low. It's just that most of his vocals were truly bad. His laid back appearance and banter with the audience were okay. He could fly across the stage in a tutu and I wouldn't care if his voice was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CAN'T be Josh Groban!","review":"What happened to Josh? What happened to his voice?? His concert at the Greek definitely isn't what I expected. I'm just very confused that he sings everything so different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid! Run away as fast as you can!","review":"Bottom line, buy the first Josh Groban DVD (originally shown on PBS). This new 'thing' is just plain BAD. I got uncomfortable watching it for Josh seems to be burning himself out. Its just too much: teetering on hysterical and a complete mess. Someone is pushing this young man too hard, perhaps it is Josh himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why you SHOULD Buy \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"I watched my DVD of \\"Live at the Greek\\" for the umpteenth time, so last night I decided to write down all the reasons why YOU should buy it too!! Here they are: (1) Ummmm, (2) Duhhhhh, (3) Where's the coffee??, (4) Maybe if I took a little break, (5) I KNOW it'll come to me!, (6) Darn, I didn't take notes!, (7) I'll be right back, (8) Playing the DVD again, (9) It's loading in my NEW DVD player, (10) Oh yeah, I forgot! Uh......NEVER MIND!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban Live at the Greek","review":"This concert set won't be making my collection. It's simply a trash cousin to the first. Actually there's very little to compare to the first except that Josh Groban was there. I just found this second site. All the major reviews are at the other site (yes there's two)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is my favorite concert by Josh. I don't think you couldgo wrong with anything he does. Big Fan here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek Concert is Badly done","review":"The first few minutes of my Greek DVD were torment! I've attended many concerts and have more concert DVD's than I can count but this is an unfortunate first. Josh Groban's voice is so bad that I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of it. This one will be returned for a refund but I'm not happy to say it. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prediction for the Greek","review":"I got Josh Groban's Greek concert as a Christmas gift. My husband immediately said it's okay with him if I return it because it's so poor. I read about 15 reviews before posting because I thought I'd get creamed for giving it only a 2 star review. But as I can tell, I'm not alone. That's very bad for a rising talented singer like Josh Groban. I truly hope that his next release is better. It would be great if he gets back to his roots and drop the pop star routine but I don't think so. He's been touring this concert for at least a year now and I see he's got a full schedule next year. That's a shame but it's also his decision. He has (had) a uniquely beautiful voice. Now I can see he's just a mediocre Pop singer. It doesn't take a fortune teller to figure this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best and Worse from Josh Groban","review":"Anything that Josh Groban did up to \\"Live at the Greek,\\" was superb!! I loved everything on his first CD with \\"My Prayer\\" (duo with Charlotte Church) being the epitome of a perfect blending of voices. Okay, I'm not getting to the reason why I gave this concert one star. Josh Groban's vocals are very poor in some places, strong in others, then faltering in yet others. Gee, does the Josh Groban production team really think we want to see Groban as anything else but the perfect vocalist that he was in other things? I don't think so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"Josh is always consistent in his singing. He was doing his best at the Greek and it showed. What's wrong with a lot of women screaming and jumping up and down?? Like, that's bad or something? Wow, when he did \\"Mi Mancherai\\" with Lucia Micarelli, it was incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Greek\\" is Disappointing for me also","review":"Although it's painful for me to agree also, but I found the Greek concert by Josh Groban disappointing also. His one true talent is his voice, his beautiful voice. Not the paino, Not the drums....couldn't care less. His beautiful voice is not quality all the time and it is painful to hear. I sincerely hope Groban understands this and pulls back on the concerts. Otherwise the live audiences will be the only ones he has left, and that doesn't sell millions of CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"This concert is TERRIBLE","review":"Good Grief I can't believe this poorly done, badly sung concert!!And now they're trying to sell the DVD!! I watched it on TV and switched the channel after the first hour. I was actually happy to have the PBS Pledge Breaks. Josh Groban is a singer, making money off his trade. He's a performer and we're the customers. Whether I want to buy it or not is my decision, but this is the place for REVIEWS and I'm chiming in with mine. Josh Groban's \\"Greek\\" concert is TERRIBLE. The man is nasaly, warbly, strained and looks like a bum. PERIOD. Would I buy it? Absolutely not. Would I come here and make excuses because I like him? Ditto. He may be a nice guy but that's pretty easy to do when you're a very, very rich guy. What I expect is someone who actually can sing through a concert and that is what I would buy, not this mess. I need my money more than Groban does and I work harder for $20 than Groban. As a matter of fact, he's not even trying here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Josh Groban's Shining Moment","review":"I hate to think that this is the turning point of Josh Groban's career. In just a short span of a a few years we saw a young man with a golden voice turn into a stage performer. In some people it works, with Josh Groban it doesn't. This is a jumble of genres: Pop, Rock, quasi-Classical. The filming is frantic at times and I was left feeling dizzy. The biggest issue for me was Josh Groban's voice and the radically changed performances of previously recorded songs. There's just too much to mention here. Suffice it to say that I won't be buying this concert DVD-CD set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just my Opinion","review":"I've watched the \\"Greek\\" concert three times now. It's so painful to say that Josh Groban can do anything less than GREAT, but this is much less than what I've come to expect. Nobody is perfect but when I spend my money on music nowadays, I spend it cautiously. I am a fan and will stay that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUITE AWFUL, EVERY DREARY MINUTE","review":"I'm so disappointed with Josh Groban's performance and how badly this performance has gone. I'm happy to see that someone, or a few someones out of the over 250 reviews enjoyed it. They can certainly buy my DVD. I'm lucky because I was able to sell it to our local used DVD shop. My sister wasn't quick on the draw. She tried to do the same and the shop told her they had enough copies to re-sell, with no buyers. I could tell the story of my family and mention how many children I have in my home but do YOU really care?? Just take some good advise and listen to it in a record shop BEFORE you buy it. Don't take my word for it, or any other rabid Grobanite for that matter. After all, it's YOUR money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"Josh Groban has talent beyond compare and a voice so beautiful that I can't help but feel major disappointment with this second concert. I bought both of his concerts and there's definitely a difference in his voice. Where the first (2002) was beautiful in every way, the \\"Greek\\" is flawed. Groban's voice is strained and noticably nasal in some vocals. I don't buy the \\"defective DVD\\" excuse. That would be laughable if it weren't for the fact that I paid $29 for this concert DVD/CD set. If the vocal weaknesses weren't disappointing enough, I also have issues with the new arrangements for his standards like \\"Canto Alla Vita,\\" the song he previously did in his first concert with the Coors. Josh goes to the keyboards and plays an introduction that sounds like scratching your fingernails across a chalkboard! What was that?! The staging, lighting, stuff projected on screens behind him were just annoying distractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing","review":"I was really impressed by the song Remember in the movie Troy. So when I saw this dvd/cd with it, I quickly bought it even though what I wanted was the studio recording of Troy. I figured that a live version can't be that bad as Josh has a gorgeous voice. After just one play, I returned it to the store and changed it for something else. Josh sounds really nasal here. Perhaps he had the flu? Then they should have postponed the recording. I cannot sit through this concert without comparing it to the previous which wasexcellent. Josh, back to basics please."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shockingly Bad Performance by Josh Groban","review":"I couldn't believe it! From the first few minutes of watch Josh Groban's \\"Live at the Greek\\" concert I was in shock. The PBS concert was so badly performed by Groban I knew I wouldnt be buying it. From the looks of the majority of reviews here, I was one of the lucky ones because I didn't have to stand in a Return line. Groban has been out of the public eye for two years since his last televised concert, but has he changed!!! Looks like Hollywood has gotten to him and so has a belief that the fans would stay regardless of what poorly made music he puts out. Well, the young guy is learning a valuable lesson. I didn't buy it and so went the rest of the fans. I sincerely hope that Groban goes back to what made him so popular and that's his VOICE. All the rest is just fooolishness and it looks like no one else is buying it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groban's Voice NOT Kissed by the Gods this Time","review":"The usually superior voiced Josh Groban didn't quite live up to his standards with \\"Live at the Greek.\\" From the looks of it he also knew he wasn't quite able to hit the strong notes. His presence was stiff and he looked very uncomfortable in the first few minutes. It's unfathomable that the professionals (?) in charge of post-production for this concert didn't edit it better. With so many non-professional listeners catching the nasal strains, where were they? Oh well, that's not really the issue now. There are a few who will buy the \\"Greek,\\" warts and all. It's their money. Mine will wait until there's a better CD. If not, I'm that much the richer."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Greek DVD didn't work.....so I got another","review":"Mine made grinding sounds from the moment I put it in the DVD player, so I returned it to the store for another. Sorry to say that it was a big mistake. Instead of the grinding noise I heard one of my favorite singers of all time open his mouth and a nasal, whiney sound came out. (No it wasn't the sound of bad reviews!, which came later). Now I'm stuck because my store will not refund my money just because I'm unhappy with the performance. I should have gone to Walmart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned My \\"Greek\\" also","review":"I've read about 20 of the reviews and see that I'm not the only one disappointed enough to return the \\"Greek\\" DvD. I won't keep it around because it's just not good. Josh Groban sounds poor, but it's not my problem, it's his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groban could do better","review":"I am one of the few people who did not buy \\"Live at the Greek\\", mainly because I saw it on PBS in December and didn't care for it. Groban did not sound very well and his performance at this concert was not very good. I have his first concert DVD which was also recorded live, so it's really that the \\"Greek\\" concert is not that good. I've seen many of the guest shots and with all of them, and his recordings, he sounds fine. He just didn't in this latest offering. Groban definitely could do better work than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Problems with Josh Groban's Greek","review":"I can't believe it!! I got my order from Amazon yesterday, with a total of 5 copies of Live at the Greek (one for me and four for gifts). It's true!! Josh Groban sounds poor, strained and nasal in a few of his songs. All of it is getting returned to Amazon and I've never had to return anything to them in the past. I have to rush out and buy lousy gift cards. The major issue is his voice which leads to the fact that no one should be expected to buy this OR buy the excuses (a defective DVD???). IF the DVD was defective ALL of the songs would sound the same. This miserable excuse for music was released before Christmas for the shopping season. I didn't see it on PBS but I just trusted that Josh Groban's concert would be as great as the first. That trust has now been shattered. Never again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to Say This about Josh Groban!","review":"I absolutely loved all of Josh Groban's CD's and his first concert was so beautiful, it was fantastic. But I too am sad to say that I was shocked at the changes he has made and none of them for the better. His voice is so bad, very nasal, very noticable. Groban looks sloppy and the general swirling circus around him is just too distracting. Only a few selections are actually from \\"Closer\\" and with the exception of \\"Per Te,\\" and \\"Mi Morena,\\" the songs in this concert aren't the best. They left out one of the most beautiful songs \\"My Confession,\\" for the dull \\"Remember When it Rained.\\" Groban really should let the professional songwriters and musicians do their jobs and just focus on singing. That's the problem here with Groban trying to be everything BUT a good singer. Believe me, it shows. This concert is just one big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban can do BETTER","review":"Yes, I bought Josh's \\"Live at the Greek\\" concert DVD. Yes, I returned mine also. It's just that Josh's voice is awful and he could have done better. I don't blame anything and my DVD worked great, it's just that Josh's voice didn't. All the other on-stage stuff didn't make me ignore the fact that he sounded so bad. I'm lucky enough to have gotten my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to watch \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"From the first minute to the last, \\"Live at the Greek\\" was difficult to watch. Just the opposite from \\"Josh Groban in Concert\\" Groban's first live concert. That one was done just two years ago, and it was so beautiful I couldn't take my eyes off it. So what's different now? Everything but most importantly Josh Groban is different. He looks, sounds and performs differently from anything I've seen him in before. None of this would be at issue if his voice were okay. It isn't. Without his beautiful voice, Josh Groban is just another dull entertainer. He doesn't have the glittering personality to hold the home crowd. I've been to live concerts and of course the experience is different from watching a DVD at home. I didn't buy the DVD either and I'm happy I didn't. Looks like many who did are not happy campers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban","review":"Our PBS is showing Josh Groban in concert also. It's Spring so we must have another Great Performance to beg for money! The first time Josh Groban was on PBS was so memorable. It was actually the first time I loved every minute of a Great Performance on PBS and even enjoyed the pledge drives because they interviewed Groban during them. This time I could hardly believe the changes in Groban. His looks, the concert venue, and his voice were so very different. I always thought he had a good voice and enjoyed his appearances. This one was not very much to watch, and appeared to be more of a rock concert. Groban doesn't do rock very well, and neither does his voice. The concert was not much to speak about. I didn't buy this one this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban's Greek Concert","review":"I could hardly bear to watch Josh Groban's \\"Live at the Greek\\" concert when it was on PBS for free. I'm certainly not going to pay money to buy a DVD of it for $25.00. I've read a few of the reviews here and they're pretty much on track with what I thought too. Groban was okay in some songs but nasaly and strained in many others. His voice and appearance were poor. It seems that the PBS recording of one of his concerts was an afterthought and slapped together deal. At the end of our PBS stations showing, they made an announcement that Groban would be performing his concert in our nearby city. If that had been said for his first concert, I would have gladly bought a ticket. With this concert I won't even buy a disc. Now that Groban has dumbed-down to suit the concert audience, I can move on. When Groban first started I was thrilled that I had someone with a lovely voice that I could actually listen to. No longer. Seeing the man that he has become, I'm just sadly moving on."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is what the Concerts are like!","review":"I am so thankful to PBS to provide me with a second Josh Groban concert. It saved me so much money! I watched Groban's concert last night on a rerun and it pretty much helped me make up my mind. Unfortunately he's touring in my city this month but fortunately for me, I won't be wasting my money on a ticket. Heck, I even erased my videotape of this disappointing concert! Groban's performance is disappointing beyond description. I leave him to the lions (the ranting, screaming females). Yuk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned my copy too","review":"I bought Josh Groban's Greek concert last month. I didn't see any reviews or articles before buying mine so I had no idea that Josh had changed so much. I was truly shocked at how much he's changed. Appearance and voice-wise, Josh just isn't the same. It's not simply the voice but that's really his only true talent (any kid can play the drums and piano, we don't buy Josh for that). He truly \\"had\\" a knock you out of your seat voice that wasn't just powerful but beautiful as well. Notice how I used the past tense. Unfortunately this concert did not portray Josh in a good light with his voice so badly done. I took my copy of the Greek back to the store too. It just was so hard to even hear his voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban's Problems during Greek","review":"It's quite obvious that Josh Groban was having a few problems while performing at the Greek Theatre. He attempted to sing while his voice was not up to par. I just hope he gets professional help with his voice issues before he attempts to record anything else. I watched his concert on PBS and didn't buy the DVD set because of it. Perhaps next time. Hopefully next time. Otherwise they'll be very few left to sing his praises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to smile about with the \\"Greek\\"","review":"I didn't see \\"Live at the Greek\\" on PBS or anything. I just got my DVD yesterday and couldn't wait to see it. WHAT HAPPENED TO Josh??? I can't believe it's the same guy. The smile I planted on my face when I got the package soon faded when I heard his voice. Ohhhh. That beautiful voice, what happened?? A couple of friends told me they thought it was bad and that was before I got mine. I thought they were nuts, but I see what they mean. He doesn't even look as cute. What's with all the screaming women and why do we have to see them?? It made me so miserable seeing this stuff and not seeing or hearing my Josh the way he was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Was Truly Lousy at the Greek","review":"I really don't know what Josh Groban is doing with his career, nor do I care. I only know that I blew my money on this DVD and it is a miserable thing to watch. In at least half of it he is noticably nasal and very strained. In all of it, he looks bad too.Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Vocals by Josh Groban","review":"In \\"Live at the Greek\\" Josh Groban seems to think being loud is okay even if the voice isn't. In the first few minutes of this concert his voice warbles and strains to come out nasaly! Gee, and we're supposed to buy this?? I taped it off the PBS showing and have taped over it since. To me, sadly, it's not even worth the price of a video tape. I can't imagine how I'd feel if I actually bought the DVD. Well, I can tell from the reviews that many wish they hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"So THIS is Josh Groban's latest work? Gee, and I actually expected someone who had a great voice. He actually did in the past but watching him at the \\"Greek,\\" his talents seem to be affected by the lack of a voice coach. I thought I was the only one to find his performance lacking until I came here. WOW! I'm not happy to see that many others agree with me. I really liked the guy but not enough to drop my hard earned dough on this. I do have the first concert DVD. It's excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"I bought the DVD/CD and I thought it was a great concert. I did not hear any bad voice problems that I've been hearing about. I've played it on my computer which has good speakers and my normal dvd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban, HEAVEN SENT","review":"This young man has such a bright future. This CD/DVD, along with all his previous work has given so much joy to so many people of all ages. The backstage scenes show that this is a very large part of his life and his greatest joy is to perform. I for one, thank The Lord for his talents, and his ability to bring such joy to my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Same Josh Groban!","review":"This definitely isn't the same golden-voiced Josh Groban who was stunningly terrific in \\"Ally McBeal\\" and perfect in every public appearance on TV. This isn't the same Josh Groban who was perfectly beautiful in his first concert and \\"Closer.\\" This Josh Groban sounds so bad that I had to send the \\"Greek\\" concert DVD and CD back to my online store. It's the first return for me and hopefully the last. From now on I'll be cautious and check out the performance before I buy. Josh Groban is growing older and obviously some things are changing with him. Too bad that it's his beautiful voice that's going downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek is a Career Killer for Groban","review":"Count me among the many who returned my DVD of Josh Groban's Greek Concert.It lacked quality in both Groban's vocals (after all, he IS a singer), and everything else.Hopefully Groban will avoid the outdoor concert venue like the plague. It destroys his already strained voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live At The Greek","review":"I have all of Josh Groban's CD's and DVD's. I was very hesitant to buy this DVD as the reviews were so poor. After watching \\"Live At The Greek\\" I feel the reviews were to harsh.Josh Groban is a very talented young man and works very hard to please his audience. Do not be afraid to buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek Concert Not Enjoyable","review":"Josh Groban's second concert could have been as marvelous as the first, but it wasn't. While everyone expects to see a young singer change through the years, we shouldn't expect one of those changes to be a very bad voice. I heard the nasaly voice from the beginning. It's really a shame because I'm sure that all of this is due to the lack of a good voice coach. Whatever the reason I was very shocked at how bad he sounded and even more disappointed with \\"Live at the Greek.\\" My disappointment was multiplied because I bought it at a store that doesn't take returns. I'll definitely know better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"I wanted to love this concert as much as I loved everything else Josh Groban has done. I bought all the previous CD's and his first concert DVD/CD combo. But after watching this concert on PBS this past month, I was just too shocked to even think of buying it.Josh Groban's singing was very poor. His voice sounded sick practically from the beginning. This concert had all the trappings of a Rock concert too, but without much real excitement generated from its star.If it weren't for Lucia Micarelli, I probably wouldn't have much positive to say at all. She was truly spectacular!However, Josh Groban needs to go back to the drawing board. Hopefully the next time he releases a concert DVD it's when he actually sounds good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucia Micarelli was Wonderful at the Greek","review":"Lucia Micarelli was beautiful, and performed beautifully at the Greek Ampitheatre. But who on earth was that nasaly, sloppy guy singing? Lucia was so perfect in a lovely gown and as she played each note her face showed such emotion. It was easy to get carried away. But then that same guy kept getting on the stage attempting to actually sing through his nose!!If not for that singer all all those camera shots of the silly women in the audience, Lucia Micarelli's concert would have been perfect.Oops! I just noticed. It wasn't supposed to be Lucia's concert. It was for some guy named Josh Groban. Oh, he must've been the sloppy rock guy with the bad voice! Who on earth would give this guy a whole concert to sound and look so bad?Bottom line. Lucia Micarelli was wonderful at the Greek."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing performance by an amazing singer","review":"I am a huge Josh Groban Fan and personally, have been moved by his music. I feel so guilty as this is the first time that I am publicly writing anything about Josh and am going to criticize an amazing artist. Plan and simple, I honestly believe that Josh's voice was strained in this concert and unfortunately PBS chose the wrong time to make a recording. In songs like Alejate, he sounded like a billy-goat when he was singing the refrain. If you listen to Josh Groban in Concert and compare it to this DVD concert, you will definitely hear the difference and understand where I am coming from. However, I hope people don't judge his vocal ability by this one concert as I have heard him perform live many times and can honestly say that he has one of the best voices that I have ever heard, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban's Voice is better than LATG","review":"I think someone wrote here that Josh Groban is better than what we saw at his Live at the Greek concert. I agree. It was a bad night and a bad time for him. But we're rating the DVD, not an actual experience sitting in a concert audience. While I don't want to rate anything by Josh Groban so low, I can't help it. His voice is very congested and it's difficult to listen to. We are seeing re-runs of the concert because it's pledge week! Even seeing it again, I came to the same conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek bears no resemblance","review":"to anything Josh Groban has ever done. I have both concert DVD's and the Greek is absolutely inferior to any CD, DVD or personal appearance he has made. Josh Groban's voice is poor and nasal in enough songs for me to give this rating without a second thought. With his first concert, Groban's voice was marvelous! The sets were beautiful and visually stunning. In the \\"Greek\\" we get none of it. While I don't expect perfection, I do expect a concert I can enjoy without shuddering at a nasaly performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Josh Groban's best","review":"I bought this DVD-CD combo of Josh Groban's concert and it does pain me to say that this is not the best work he's done. It doesn't come close. I'm such a big fan and I never thought I'd be giving such a review but here it is. For those of us (millions who do not attend the concerts), his appearance and stage presence is a big change. However, my problems with the concert and not with that, it's the sound of his voice. There's a few songs that I can hear the nasal tone and instead of that beautiful quality, it's simply not there. This is, of course, just my opinion. I bought it and I'll keep it because there are some moments of enjoyment. There's just not enough for me for write a glowing review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not the only one!","review":"I thought I was the only fan who was unhappy with my DVD of \\"Life at the Greek\\"!! This makes me so sad because I love Josh's voice. Since I'm also studying voice he was a role model. Now Josh seems to be just another rock star now that he's let his voice go for sure. I can hear the strains and my teacher would too. Josh just needs to re-train his voice to get the quality back. He truly sounds better in his first concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought it, I can't Recommend it","review":"Like many others, I have all of Josh Groban's stuff. I bought this one too, but \\"Live at the Greek\\" is so disappointing I can't recommend it. If anyone is thinking of buying it believing that it's the same Josh Groban, you may be unpleasantly surprized. I was. I bought it, I regret it, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greek has many flaws","review":"The biggest flaw with the Greek concert is Josh Groban's voice. Sometimes it's powerful and clear but most of the time it isn't. Unfortunately Groban's voice issues show up at the start in \\"Mi Mancherai\\". I read that the concert DVD was recorded over two days and that's puzzling. I can't believe that over two days they couldn't get clear recordings of Groban's singing most of his songs. I also think that they didn't have the best (or even good) people recording the concert. There are too many bumpy camera shots and the sound is not good either. Very sloppy work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I'm a Josh Groban fan, and It felt like a stab in my heart when I read all the bad reviews about this cd/dvd. I listen to the cd just about every day and absolutely love it. Mi Morena is so sexy.I've watched the dvd 3 times and still enjoy it. The audience is passionate, so what's wrong with that? When JG sings \\"To where you are\\" (beautifully, I might add) I cry every time. Yes, you see a couple of tiny American flags waving from the audience at the end, but it's so beautiful because it reminds some people of their loved ones who died on 9/11/01.A beautiful concert. Love, love, love.And Josh looked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singer and fan who understands","review":"I bought this locally and I admit Josh's voice is not the best I've ever heard on this DVD however I have sung (not in front of thousands) just hundreds of people and I can tell you that no one's voice is perfect all the time and your voice can do contrary to what you are trained sometime. I do think people are being glass half empty here. To the person who's going to move on to the next \\"boy wonder\\", good luck. I know in my lifetime he is without a doubt the best voice to come along that I can remember. I would never forget a voice this good. If I am in a public place and I hear his songs I still stop and think \\"WOW\\". I gets me everytime. His new CD is different but in a good way. FYI-I am not a Grobanite, but I am qualified to know amazing talent when I hear it!Give the guy a break, no one is perfect not even opera stars that choose to remain in the box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh sounds better in a closed Theatre","review":"His first concert was \\"Live\\" also but the sound was so perfect that I didn't believe it was a live recording. The Pasadena concert CD was so clear and Josh's voice so vibrant, it pretty much justifies the multi-million dollar sales. The Greek was not good for recording his second concert with all the sound problems and of course the affect it had on Josh's voice. I bought this DVD and CD also but it will be going back to the store. I just can't bear to hear his voice sounding so nasal. Maybe next time, but I'll be more cautious to watch it before I buy. Our music store is a 24 mile drive, another annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Messy Turn by Groban","review":"This whole productionis messy. Haphazard vocals by Groban (eek! Nasal and poor). The filming will give you vertigo. I'm only happy about one thing........I saw it on PBS for free and didn't waste my money on this DVD set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed with \\"Greek\\" too!!!","review":"All these poor reviews are devastating. It's even worse because I can't do better either! \\"Live at the Greek\\" is just that bad and Josh sounds that weak. Oh well, back to the drawing board. I hope Josh's next CD is beautiful. Since his CD's aren't recorded outdoors (hurts his voice) around all those loud people (UGH), I'm sure it will be. I'll wait and buy that one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Rocks, PBS Sings the Blues","review":"Yes, Josh has taken a rock turn in his newest concert (even playing drums too). Thankfully I watched it on PBS because that's when I decided not to buy this one. A changed Josh Groban is reflected in the poor album sales. All other Josh Groban CD's hit platinum sales this release is not even on the charts, so it looks as if I'm not the only one who isn't buying and for good reason. I have the first CD and Closer. They're terrific. In this concert Josh Groban is pushed to the limit and his beautiful voice suffers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Second Concert by Josh Groban","review":"I challenge Josh Groban to sing better than Josh Groban did at the Greek theatre!! (How's THAT for a challenge!). That would be pretty cool since he really does a disappointing turn here. All he has to do is match his own voice, the one we heard in all his prior CD's, personal appearances and first concert DVD. I bought all the other ones. I won't be getting the \\"Greek\\" concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Josh GROBAN concert yet!!","review":"I was also present at the greek theater for this taping. I have been to 10 concerts also , and these by far were the best shows I have seen. So I know for a fact that this CD/DVD will be a best seller. Josh RAWKS out on the synthisizer, and the drums for Canto Alla Vita. He sings in Italian, Spanish and english... something for everyone, you will really enjoy it .I will be buying everyone I know this for Christmas.And who knows maybe you'll even see me in the 3rd row.. :)Jennifer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban, \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"Our PBS station is now having a pledge week also and they showed Josh Groban's \\"Live at the Greek\\" concert last night. Good grief what's happened to Josh Groban? Within minutes I was at a point where I could hardly bear to listen anymore. His voice was powerful but very congested and nasal. I really wanted to go to one of his concerts this year but this performance was quite poor. I don't think I will take a chance.What Josh Groban needs to do is stay in an enclosed theatre to perform, and perhaps cut back on his concert touring. But I think he knew that before this latest concert schedule was announced. From what I read in other sites and this one, Live at the Greek didn't sell. Of course I could tell why. I could hardly watch it on my TV for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban \\"Live at the Greek\\"","review":"omg I thought it was just me!! I LOVE Josh Groban but when I saw his newest concert I was shocked at how bad Josh sounded. His beautiful voice was so bad that I couldn't watch any more than the first half hour. Unless you've been going to the concerts to see how he has transformed himself, you're also in for a shock because Josh looks different too. I just think the whole concert package was disappointing. I'm giving it two stars because I can't bear to give it one. I hope this change isn't permanent because I'll just not be able to buy Josh's songs anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"The NEW Josh Groban??","review":"We have a totally NEW Josh Groban at the Greek, a revamped warbler attempting to look comfortable in his new Rocker skin. Too bad for the fans, it doesn't work. Josh Groban comes off sounding bad, nasal in fact and the sloppy laid-back dude comes across as ....a sloppy laid-back dude. I didn't buy the DVD and it looks like many previous customers aren't coming back too. I also believe Groban can resolve his voice issues if he also resolves his appearance issues. Maybe, maybe not. All I know is I won't jump to buy the next CD without hearing it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for the Perfect concert DVD??","review":"If you haven't heard Josh Groban in concert at all and you're looking for the perfect DVD/CD set you may want to pass up the \\"Greek.\\" I would suggest that you buy \\"Josh Groban in Concert,\\" his first concert set. It was perfection and was a great showcase for Groban's impeccable voice. Groban's \\"Live at the Greek\\" has left many people (including me) incredibly disappointed. Even though it's only been two years it hasn't been a good two years for Josh. I bought both DVD sets and the difference is so obvious. So are the reviews by people who have seen them. Just compare the reviews (and overall grade) here to the reviews for Josh's first concert. But don't take my word for it. Most stores have a listening area where you can compare them for yourself. I couldn't listen to Greek for more than 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be keeping Mine either","review":"The Greek DVD doesn't deserve to share shelf space with my other Josh Groban music (I have everything he did). Whatever the excuses, whatever the reasons, it's just not good. Nasaly? Congested? Strained? Yep, I heard it too. Josh Groban is the man with the beautiful voice. It was a big mistake to sell this one with the problems. I love Josh and because he's always so darned terrific, this one won't stay in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at the Greek: Poorly Done","review":"I bought Josh Groban's latest concert, \\"Live at the Greek\\" to enjoy a second concert by one of my favorite Pop singers. Unbelievably, I couldn't bear to watch the first 30 minutes. I kept fast-forwarding hoping Groban would sound and look better. He didn't. Whatever he decided to do on his concert tour it certainly isn't much of \\"Closer\\" as advertised and it certainly isn't the quality that anyone should expect from any singer. His voice is so poor I just turned it off. I also determined it wasn't worth keeping and returned it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm neither Deaf nor Blind","review":"That's really good for me but not so good for Josh Groban. Since I can HEAR VERY WELL, thank you, I can also hear the nasal twang that brings Josh Groban's performance down. Buy it?? No way. I'm leaving it for the \\"Loyal Fans.\\" I liked Josh Groban when he could actually sing but that was a very long two years ago. If I wanted nasal twang I'd buy Country....but that would hurt even more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard the Problems with Groban's voice too","review":"Yes, I heard the nasal twang too. I heard it during the PBS concert also. Too bad because Josh Groban is really a terrific singer, just not this time. Since I don't buy music where the artist sounds so bad, I didn't buy this one. From the looks of it I made a very sound decision. I work too hard for my money to buy something that doesn't make me thoroughly happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"Josh is incredible in this concert!! What's up with all the bickering?? No need. Josh will always be mystifying. Since very few words can describe his voice, I'll stop at a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","review":"I didn't even think about it, I watched this concert knowing it would be beautiful. Well, it was okay. With the first concert I was plastered to my chair. With this concert I just wanted to get plastered! Okay?? For Josh Groban?? This doesn't happen. Well it did happen. It's still being televised on PBS stations, so my best advice is watch the concert before you buy this set. Make your own decision!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"Josh has done it again, I relived the summer concerts moment by moment !! His voice sounds magnificent, his stage presence and playfulness is so charming and engaging. The addition of Bela Fleck on banjo for Alla Luce Del Sol was genius, the drumming break was energizing, the passion in My December, Remember When It Rained and Never Let Go left me breathless, like I was sitting in the front row again. I treasure this DVD, it's the next step for Josh. The first PBS was the \\"introduction\\", this is \\"getting to know you better\\" and I cannot wait to see where this extraordinary young man takes us in the future. I will be there, no doubt in my mind! Just a note...some of the cds have sound problems on the first three cuts, so if you think he sounds pinched or nasal, the cd is defective...some have reported this, however mine is great, so it's a production problem apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't my Josh","review":"omg Josh what happened to your wonderful voice?? I just got my Greek dvd today and I can't believe it!! It has to be a mistake with the recording of that gorgeous voice. I'm shocked. This isn't my beautiful Josh. I blame the record people for this and not Josh. He's always wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with \\"Live at the Greek\\", so I returned it","review":"Unlike \\"Josh Groban in Concert,\\" which was Groban's first concert before a live audience, Groban's \\"Live at the Greek\\" contained very little to make me happy. Within minutes of watching my new concert DVD, I was surprised by his new looks but that's not my biggest concern by far. Groban's voice was clear, then poor, strong, weak. I thought the bright spot was beautiful Lucia Micarelli on the violin. The remake of \\"Canto Alla Vita\\" left me speachless with disappointment. I grabbed the remote to turn down that screeching introduction and kept the sound low. Someone should have told Groban to leave perfection alone. The poor remakes of \\"Alla Luce Del Sole,\\" \\"Vincent\\" and \\"Alejate,\\" in this concert left me wondering WHY?? With all the issues I have, I decided it wasn't for me so it went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Problems at the Greek","review":"Josh Groban's \\"Live at the Greek\\" DVD just contained too many problems for me to enjoy. The most obvious one, of course, is his voice problems where he sounds really nasal. Then I can also add in that I didn't enjoy his new image and style. I can't understand why I still see advertisements on TV telling us that this is a tour of \\"Closer.\\" The concert DVD has so many of his older songs and ones he did on the first concert. I agree that they weren't as good as the first. Groban couldn't improve on \\"Alejate\\" from the first concert it was so beautiful and he sang it so perfectly. Well, if this is what he's become, I'm out of it too. This DVD wasn't entirely bad, but bad enough for me to be angry with myself for buying it without a preview. Now I know I can listen at these websites before I buy. IF I every buy anything of Josh Groban's again, I'll check it out first. Right now, that's a big IF."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Josh Groban?","review":"I just played my \\"Live at the Greek\\" DVD yesteday and I couldn't believe how poor his voice was! I also had guests over and they commented on how his voice was nasal in some songs and just poor in one other. It was so disappointing that I took it out and played the first concert DVD. Very noticable indeed! With the first concert we heard the beautiful tones of Josh Groban's voice and everything he sang. I believe this is only the span of two years between concerts. Lucky for me I bought it at Sam's and can get a refund. This one is going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh is Wonderful in Concerts","review":"My Josh is always terrific in concerts.

Josh Groban was absolutely terrible. His voice was congested, nasaly, and lousy. What a big come-down from his earlier years when his voice was so good. As far as this concert, the constant views of fat stupid women jumping around and acting like they had a clue was really sad indeed. Looks like they had a few too many before leaving home. Making such fools of themselves for a man half their age....YUK.Then you have to look at the fact that Josh Groban sounded and looked so miserable.Only buy this DVD if you really love badly sung DVD's.

I didn't like \\"Live at the Greek,\\" because of his voice problems so I didn't buy it. I heard it during the PBS televised concert. For other CD's that I bought my reviews on another site were glowing with words like \\"wonderful, gorgeous, mezmerizing.\\" I want to be able to write that again. I read some of the reviews and it hurts to agree. But there it is. Warner Brothers should never have released this DVD or should recall it since so many people who bought it are unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ths is for different kind of audience","review":"Fans of josh has been cranky these past fews months following the release of his second live album and i want to try to offer an explanation. The concert is more like a rock concert than the previous concert, and rockstars sings like that or even worse. so whats wrong with josh. nothing. simply his audience like a different artist. whats wrong when josh sings like a popstar? we'll he will have more audience. middle aged housewives will be joined by their sons and daughters. and i think this is good. spreading the voice of josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groban at the Greek is GREAT!","review":"I LOVED this CD/DVD!!! The music is superb, the performance was polished and professional, and the bonus footage at the end is terrific! Not only is Josh Groban an accomplished vocalist, but his bits on the piano and the drums were very entertaining. His choice of songs shows versatility and a sound grasp of what his audience likes. I can't wait until he puts together a Christmas album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Josh LIVE at the Greek?","review":"Yes, we know Josh was supposed to be LIVE at the Greek because that's the name of the concert, \\"Josh Groban LIVE at the Greek.\\" We know the audience was lively because we heard the rumble of their voices and we know the choir was LIVE because they all waved their arms like tree limbs in a hurricane. But Josh certainly didn't seem very much alive and his performance was pretty much on life support when we heard a croaky, nasaly voice. Whatever happened to Josh's voice, I hope it improves before he cuts his next CD. Don't think I'll stay around for another croaky album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love lost and found","review":"Love is lost and then found in an unexpected place in this movie. I have loved this Danielle Steel movie from the first time I saw it. John Ritter and Polly Draper are exceptional in this story. As a happily married career women whose husband walks out after she refuses to abort their baby, Polly Draper plays the character of Adrienne just right, not to weepy but strong enough to stand on her own decision and go on with life. John Ritter's character comes into her life and as the loving father of two sons from a previous marriage he knows exactly how to win her over and become the husband she deserves and the father her baby needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbeat","review":"If you enjoy seeing a couple come together after a tragic event and see the romance blossom between them you will enjoy this movie especially with a great actor John Ritter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Heartbeat","review":"I have twice notified Amazon that the picture included with this item is wrong - the response: No Change - stating nothing wrong - But the picture is of an UK actor named Nick Berry and it is from the British TV series Heartbeat which started in 1992. Now the actors listed for this product include John Ritter. John Ritter was never on the UK show - He may have made a movie or US TV show called Heartbeat, but to include a picture from a different show is misleading. I was hoping to find DVD's of the UK show - but at present I do not know exactly what they are selling or trying to sell.If the seller reads this they need to clarify what it is they are trying to sell. And, I know what I am talking about - I watch this show, in England, daily. Nick Berry (pictured) played PC Nick Rowan from 1992 - 1998.

John Ritter and Polly Draper displayed such a warm chemistry and you just rooted for them to find their way to eachother despite the many hurdles they faced. Eventhough I've seen this movie several times over the years, I would watch it everytime it would air on Lifetime. It's just the kind of movie you could kick back, relax and shed a few tears of happiness at the end!!! I'm so glad this movie has been released on dvd because it's another body of work I can collect on the late John Ritter, who I still miss very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Pass This One By!","review":"Not many people read John Buchan's works, but they are without a doubt worth reading. This book is one of his best. He has taken character's from his Richard Hannay series, and in one smooth, skillful chapter he throws them into a different world. While his other books deal mostly with the spy games of WW1 era, in The Courts of the Morning three of his best characters (Sandy Arbuthnot, John S. Blenkiron, and Archie Roylance) are transported to a small South American country to try to bring down a man who is almost insanely bent on world conquest. To accomplish this process, they organize the cleanest revolutionary guerilla war ever concieved, and with a mixture of brilliant spy techniques and unexpected mercy they win a victory better than anything the recent war turned out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I'm only giving this book four stars because Buchan and others have written better stuff. This novel, concerning the Richard Hannay menage (but in which he makes no more than a guest appearance) is more the tale of Sandy Arbuthnot, master of disguise, and newlyweds Archie and Janet Roylance. In a South American republic, revolution is afoot and Sandy is behind the scenes pulling strings and living in the danger. Archie and Janet stumble upon it by mistake, but then they join Sandy and co. Then Janet is kidnapped and Archie takes Geordie Hamilton into the heart of the toxic Poison Country in a desperate bid to rescue her.The story takes a little more time to get going, unlike Buchan's tauter, shorter books, but once it does, it's gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"please, save your country-fried soul, and buy this","review":"Here it is: This is the kind of music that feels like it always was inside of you, but you never knew where it was, until you turned off this highway down this tarchipped road and before you knew it, you were in the pines thinking of how your grandmother used to look smoking winston 100s in the kitchen of her trailer, which sat on a half acre of land not far from Swallow Falls, Maryland, and inside, there's the memory of the rumble of the Conrail trains that used rock on by, a rumble that's warm and sad and good all at once, and so you stop among those pines just to take a break and breath the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Crow Medicine Show","review":"Like hearing the old-time bluegrass with a contemporary spin.

Not to take anything away from them, their version is excellent. Good music for any fan of something real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nashville ruined these guys.","review":"If you can track down some of their independent albums, check those out instead. They used to explode with energy. This is polished Nashville CRAP! Before they sold out, I'd compare them with the great Gus Cannon. Looks like they'll soon be on tour with The Dixie Chicks or possibly Creed. Corporate music has ruined another band. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drink Coaster","review":"Saw this band live and was very impressed.Bought this disc and was not...CD is best used as a drink coaster.As others have stated, does not capture the vibrancy and fun of their live show, and is just not a great recording or performance.However, it will prevent glass stains on your furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha! Ha! Ha!","review":"Did another reviewer mention \\"Man of Constant Sorrow? I think they did. That should tell you how commercial this crap is. I agree with the earlier review. Sold out. Buy some Uncle Dave Macon instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Old Time Music","review":"I enjoyed the O.C.M.S. very much. I have been dismayed for the last decade or so about the homogenization of pop music. I can't tell country from rock or rock from hip hop. Along comes the O.C.M.S. and I can hear something that stands out from the rest and is a lot of fun to boot. I realize that their music is not ground breaking or visionary but it is not self absorbed or annoying like most of the so called folk or singer songwriter crap that is dominating the adult alternative market (which is where the program directors are probably pigeonholing them) these days.If you just want to hear some great goodtime music to have a hillbilly party with, pick up O.C.M.S. crack open a bottle of Jim Beam and grab your honey.P.S. I can not find any Bob Dylan song called \\"Wagon Wheel\\", and I've searched long and hard. What up with dat?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacks the energy of their live show","review":"I eagerly anticipated these guys' first studio release in a couple of years (last year's live album is very good). For the most part, I'm not disappointed, since I really think OCMS has a lot to offer. But, if you've ever been lucky enough to catch the group live, this album is like a collection of their slowest, lowest energy songs. Don't get me wrong - I think \\"Take 'Em Away\\" and \\"Wagon Wheel\\" are amazing, but I miss a bunch of their real up-tempo material. Live, these guys nearly explode; here, they just burn steadily, with the occasional flare-up.Bottom line - a good album, well worth buying, but I agree with earlier posts - if you can get your hands on their earlier albums (try their website?), do so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST!","review":"This band is amazing if you like old timey music! My husband and I first fell in love camping and riding around in the Colorado mountains listening to this CD. It will always have a special place in our hearts, and we even played Wagon Wheel at our wedding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to Bluegrass","review":"I was never a big bluegrass/country music fan and a friend introduced Old Crow Medicine Show to me. They single handedly changed my mindset and open the doors to an amazing knee-slapping world! Right from the get go on this album with Tell It To Me I was hooked. Seeing them perform Wagon Wheel live last summer melted my heart and absolutely suckered me into more bluegrass exploration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"I know little about contemporary country and less still about bluegrass, but even in a vacuum, this album is top notch. It was given to me as a birthday present by someone wanting to introduce me to bluegrass, and my first reaction was where can I get more CDs by THESE guys. Unfortunately, this is is their major label debut, which means a long wait before their next record. I've ordered their self-orduced CD, \\"Eutaw\\", from their website. But the point I'm talking around here is that this is fine, exuberant, play-the-cd-til-you-wear-it-out music. Most of the tunes are traditional songs, but they blend seamlessly with the originals and the Bob Dylan cover. One of the most enjoyable CDs I've heard in ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Already a fan....","review":"So here's the deal... All I know of O.C.M.S. is seeing their video on CMT for the song \\"Wagon Wheel.\\" I recorded the video on my Digital PVR Recorder, and I have to say... I've watched the video and listened to this song about 50 times.... IN A ROW!I've not heard the rest of the album, but I soon will. From this ONE song though, they present a sound, style and attitude that has been missing from music for quite some time. It gives hope that Popular Music CAN still be an ARTFORM, rather then just another media outlet for record labels to make money by appealing to the lowest common denominator. \\"Hey..... Mamma Rock me!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me Miss the South","review":"These boys are incredibly talented with such a timeless sound.. Generally, I'm not a huge fan of bluegrass/folk/country, but I LOVE this band (and not just because I went to high school with one of the members..) I agree with the others who rave about the live show.. it's incredible. Their energy and sense of humor gets the crowd clapping and stomping."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent debut from musicians who know their craft","review":"OK, I start with an admission - I've never been a country music or blue grass fan. And it was only by chance that I came accross OCMS when watching the TV highlights from the Cambridge Folk Festival. They showed an accoustic set from OCMS with their track \\"Wagon Wheel\\". I was captivated! I can't quite put my finger on why - I guess it was a combination of their superb musicianship, tight harmonies, unbridled energy and rawness which just touched a nerve and left me desperate for more. I immediately looked them up on the web, found their album and bought it - on the strength of just one song I'd heard, once! I have not been disappointed - the album is a real gem. It has a great mix of tunes ranging from the foot-stomping up-tempo to the thoughtful & soulful. Whether you're a country music fan or not, BUY THIS ALBUM - you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie's Addiction","review":"I cannot stop listening to this CD. I am 50+ and haven't heard anything I liked quite this much since Phil Ochs (and that is going back a piece). The fiddle is brilliant and vocals so earnest your heart goes out to these guys. It is just profoundly good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it...","review":"I had never heard of this band before, but heard one of their songs \\"Wagon Wheel\\" on an internet radio station. I was hooked..can't wait to buy another CD. I wish they would come play in Alaska."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Quality Meals","review":"This is an excellent cookbook for the cook who wants to prepare quality meals, but has limited time. Most ingredients, including seasonings, are easily procured or already on the shelf. Photography is beautiful and adds to the appeal of the food. I could happily have done without Martha's tedious running commentary on her fast track personal life, and that of her now divorced husband. But that can be ignored. It's the recipes that matter. This is a cook book that gets pulled down from the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankfully . . . something different","review":"If you're tired of the typical thriller/mystery paperback rehash, give this one a read.

I thought that who ever wrote this book has a very creative mind. This book is very interesting I think that this is the best book that I ever read.

If I was able to recommend this book I would recommend this well written book to little children because they are our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activism disguised as children's literature","review":"While beautifully illustrated and highly imaginative, The Great Kapok Tree is a heavy-handed attempt to create environmental activism in young, impressionable children. It is utterly one-sided, and places the welfare of animals above that of humans. At no time is the human story told. Instead, the \\"right\\" side of the issue (the politically correct side) is presented as the only possible way to think. It attempts to place on the shoulders of children the responsibility for \\"saving\\" the rain forest. Saving endangered species, environments, etc. is not the job of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Kapok Tree","review":"I like this book because of the colors and the animals.

On a scale through 1 to 10 I think that it will be a 5th grader book. I would think that it would be a book for ages 4-10. I think this is a good book for these ages because you will learn about the rainforest and the animals that live there. It will teach kids what a rainforest is like today. It will teach kids not to do anything to hurt the animals that live there or hurt the rainforest by cutting trees down or burning it. If you hurt the rainforest then you will take our oxygen away.

My respect for her is boundless. That's why I am incredulous that she created this just-plain-awful album. The idea of producing an album of children's music is not inherently bad, but the execution on this album was terrible. Every song on this album made me cringe.

It was just Carkeet moving from one quirky player's problems to another quirky player's problems. I only read until page 50, and the book's plot had not start moving at that point. Not a good sign.I also didn't like the tone of the writing. Carkeet seems very taken by his quirky style and cleverness. It overwhelms the book, and is ultimately what keeps the plot bogged down in minutiae.Perhaps his existing fans will like this book, but I found it boring and unenjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was recommended as a great baseball book, and perhaps that sets the bar pretty low. Carkeet knows baseball, writing easily about nuance and detail of the game - to the point where a casual fan or non-fan will probably be at a loss. The problem is with the structure. The premise is that every member of a contending professional baseball team simultaneously falls into depression. Hijinks follow. Unfortunately, the narrative clicks so quickly from one character to the next, and there are nine protagonists, that it eventually becomes impossible to sort out one character from another. I found myself paging along, not remembering which character had which peculiarity, waiting for something to happen. Very little happened.Carkeet's prose is cute, and occasionally powerful. But the book is not particularly strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light treatment of a complex life","review":"This documentary gives an important albeit superficial account into the spiritual development of a man who is arguably the most influnential Catholic figure of the twentieth century. Its structure is conventional as might be expected. However, for those who have followed the life and times of Father Merton it supplies important visual images of Merton, his friends, peers, and, perhaps most interesting,the hermatige of Gethsemene and its surroundings within which he spent a large portion of his life. Missing is mention of many of his most important correspondences such as his relationship with D.T.Suzuki.Still the footage of Merton giving his final thoughts to a group of fellow contemplatives and monks just hours before his death is well worth the price of the DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame attempt to cash in on a tragedy","review":"As someone who was personally involved in this incident and who knows as much or more about it than most, this book was insulting.

Here are two people who just happened to be in Glenwood Springs in July 1994 thinking that gives them some kind of \\"direct connection\\" to the tragedy. What a joke.

And Chick Corea is hot, driving all the way! get it, It is stone bargain!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unbeatable","review":"Some of the best music and most beautiful scenery available on DVD.Great for lobbies, waiting rooms, or home viewing.

I have two separate ratings for this book. I think this is an important book and the material in this book will change how you think about things. For that, I would give it a 5 stars rating. But I found the writing to be extremely irritating. This guy probably has about 30-40 pages of stuff to talk about and he stretches it out to 200 some pages. So I'm giving a one star on the writing. The repetitiveness is maddening. It's almost like reading a college student report and you know he's inserting some paragraphs in there just so he can reach the page requirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended edition IS NOT EXTENDED!!!!","review":"\\"The updated edition includes an extensive new chapter on cooperation in cancer cells and among terrorist organizations.\\"WHAT??

It is elegant in its ideas and the way these ideas are presented. It is easy to read and understand with very simple math. Yet, the insights and conclusions of the book are very powerful and very interesting.The book studies how agents behave and interact in social systems. It studies what strategies those agents might adopt and what strategies are most beneficial to the agent and to the whole social system. The results are very interesting. Another major question the book tackles is whether or not the strategy of cooperation can evolve in a social system where the majority of agents don't cooperate. The results are very interesting.I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tit-for-tat !","review":"Great read.

Well, you just have to check it out!I'm reading the sequel (\\"The Complexity of Cooperation\\") right now, which is also amazing.

Just from the kindle sample you can see \\"6100,000\\" when it should be \\"$100,000.\\" In addition to html and epub formats, the Online Library of Liberty has both scanned and OCR'd text PDFs of the book.

I was still neck deep into the convolutions of Henry James and whatnot (I even asked people what's the big deal with Hemingway). In rock n' roll terms, Hansen, like Hemingway, was just two chords going back and forth. Twenty years and an extended stay in the hard knocks school of life I now treasure my two-chord Bruce Springsteen classic Jungle Land, my one-chord-and straight distortion Velvet Underground vynils and my no-frills-no-fancy-posh language Brandstetter collection.

Its not Gone With the Wind. Its a monster movie.The number one complaint seems to be the new effects are mostly CGI. Is this a problem?There was no CGI in 1982 when the first one was made or they would have used it.The 1982 version and the new one are like the difference between Alien and Aliens. The 1982 version was spooky, claustrophobicand slimy ( I mean that in a good way).

Carpenter's script is much closer to the book too, Carpenter is a bit like James Cameron, he knows how to tell a really good story as well as scare the bejesus out of us at the same time.This version is dreck, it looks like they took the Stepford cast from a Macy's clothing sale catalogue, pretty, but dumb as rocks with dialalogue to match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compare to THE THING 1982","review":"Not a very good prequel as some have stated. Other then the being, the end, and the Norwegian guys, it is so much like the original you may think you're watching a poorly done remake. You may give it a chance if you want to waste 3.99 as I did, but it was a waste of money for me. The Thing (1982) with Kurt Russell is awesome, this movie is eh. This movie does have up-to-date special FX, but it doesn't improve the movie at all. All I can say about the FX is \\"Big whoop!\\" (80s joke for us middle aged folks). I'll take Kurt Russell any day, these actors, who ever they are, do not do this movie justice. I'm not sure if any of them would do any movie justice. I wanted to like it, but I didn't.

I loved the creature effects and gore scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty much the only reason I wanted to see this because I enjoy her movies and she's very pretty. Some scenes dragged, and others were suspenseful. I love how it leads right into the original. In 1982, a paleontologist named Kate Lloyd is asked by a Norwegian scientist named Sander to travel to Antarctica to uncover a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship. They find a creature frozen in the ice, and bring it back to base. It soon thaws and becomes each member of the team and tries to escape.

Here we have, well, a CGI creature, that we see too often, too clearly, and wouldn't look out of place on your PS3 game.

And who didn't see the woman as the last one standing?What they had alot of was special effects, which became boring quickly. And finally, the ending, which is the beginning of Carpenter's version. Too bad. Sometimes prequels work.

It barely even has the jump-scares that normally Hollywood can be expected to deliver.In 1982, Kurt Russell scraped hot wires in petri dishes of blood to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.In 2011, Flavor of the Month Actress #7209 shone a flashlight into the other characters' mouths to see if they had fillings to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is it!?!?!","review":"The main problem with this film was that is is advertised as a prequel, the overall plot is so similar to the original that it just seems like a remake.

There is no clue as to where this \\"thing\\" comes from (other than space), what motivates it, or anything else that may differentiate from the original, even though that is the point of this film. The performances were good but the story predictable; sure, it ends directly how the beginning of the original starts, but the movie (as a whole) is sort of a waste).

Oh no, not Universal. They are going to pad this thing with as much advertising as possible.On to the movie. It was boring. There was no suspense or innovation. Nothing new at all. If you are going to make a prequel, or sequel, to a successful movie, it has to have something to make it stand on it's own. This movie does not have that.

I finally got the nerve to watch this movie and was pleasantly suprised to find out that it was not a remake, BUT A PREQUEL! For years, my friends and I always had wandered what had happened at the Norweigan camp MaCready mistakens for a Swedish camp.

Rule of thumb: if you're going to invoke the name of a beloved classic and slap it on your film, it better be a damn good film, because comparisons to the original are inevitable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the ostensible lead here, as a paleontologist who is brought to an Antarctic research station where a spacecraft has been discovered beneath the ice, complete with an extraterrestrial survivor. When the alien promptly escapes its icy prison and begins taking the form of the various researchers, jump scares and gore ensue.

Throw in some laughably bad CGI and you have yourself a movie that is easily forgotten...this actually put me to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential lost.","review":"The special effects were well done and scary but the problem I had was the fact that the \\"alien\\" was intelligent enough to carry on a conversation, and even operate a freakin spaceship, yet it continued to act more like a wild tiger hiding and hunting!W.T.F.?We are a smarter audience and we deserve better. This movie does have its \\"entertainment\\" value but there was a much more interesting story that could've came of this and we didn't get it! It seemed geared toward, shall we say, a teenage audience. This movie is a poor follow-up to the original (circa 1980's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I hope the DVD comes with 10-15 extra minutes of footage that was left on the editting room floor because the final cut gave almost ZERO time to any of the characters other than Joel and Mary Elizabeth. There was no tension or intrigue trying to determine which character had been infected. The director displayed a lack of understanding, of how to effectively pace a horror/sc-fi flick. It's unfortunate because some of the death scenes were pretty darn chilling! I just didn't care about anyone in the movie and only knew 4 or 5 of their names. There is a reason why this film only lasted 3 weeks in major maket theaters. And why the release date was pushed back from April."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"I really wasn't sure about buying this. You know, there were no particular known actors and quite frankly I don't trust prequels or sequels. BUT, this is one taut movie. The writing is excellent, and contrary to some of the other reviewers there are no areas of loose plot. I love the monster. It really shows the influence of HP Lovecraft on modern film. The creepiest part concerns the female Norwegian doctor. I loved the short story, loved the original, loved Carpenter's remake and love this one. It is great the way they took great pains to make sure the 1982 film segued into this one. People say the movie leaves us hanging, but I don't agree with that. We wouldn't be here if she hadn't reached safety. By the way, I stick by this review, even though some people seem to hate the movie.

Slightly better than the first one. I'll give it a c+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prequel (or Remake?) without the tension","review":"First I'll say the John Carpenter one was very enjoyable. You could feel the tension and distrust between everyone. This one felt forced. The tension was never really believable from anyone aside from Ms. Winsted. She made it better though the only tension was when the Thing was hunting people. Everyone else seemed to be going through the motions. Second, I wasn't sure if I was watching the JC version or a prequel. I thought it was supposed to be a prequel, but it felt like I was watching John's version. Everything seemed lifted: from the test to the wandering in the storm. They did try and alter the test but it all felt too familiar.I will say I loved the tie in at the end. That partially made the movie for me. Fit very nicely into John's version. Aside from that, this was a pretty mundane creature feature that would have been better served with another name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Well there goes a little over an hour I'll never see again. While the special \\"monster effects\\" were grotesque and well done, the characters lacked any empathy at all. I could not have cared less about any of them. The ending didn't make sense and was inconclusive. The female lead was flat and had no spark at all. The characters were 2 dimensional and not at all developed. What a waste of time! The only good part was the little song the Norwegians were singing after they found the \\"thing\\" in the rec room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious and Entertaining","review":"What a strange book this is! Part childrens' fairy tale (old school - bad things do happen to good people), part political satire, part fantasy, A City in Winter weaves an enchanting melody amidst its disconcordant environment.I'm not sure who the target audience is - the illustrations and language make the book suitable for kids, while the bizarre characters and convoluted social system are friendly rejoinders against centralism and establishment.One thing is certain - it is brilliantly written - a captivating book that takes little time to devour. The imagery is outstanding, the characters are engaging and enjoyable, and the plot moves along handsomely. For as short a book as this is, there is sufficient depth to make it worth more than one read."},{"rating":"2","title":"please read this!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When reading this book, you will probably find it surprising that this book is a sequel to what happens in the ballet, \\"Swan Lake\\". But this is not a childish book describing the positions of ballet or some halfhearted fairy tale. This is what you can call quality reading. Believe me, it is not boring, it is suspenseful and exciting. (Having read this in third grade, I know that it covers a wide range of ages.) It is not just a children's book, either. Adults will enjoy the breathtaking illustrations and the amazing story. Mark Helprin sure knows how to weave words, and Chris Van Allsburg can paint illustrations that play with light and are almost as captivating as the story itself. Congradulations to the author and the illustrator! And if you plan on getting this book, good luck and happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ A CITY IN WINTER!!!!","review":"A City In Winter is a wonderful book. It's about a little girl who goes on an adventure to find the person who killed her parents. When she gets to the village, she meets two bakers who's names are Astrahn and Notorincus. They help her throgh the story. They told the little girl that if she ever got caught, to tell them that she's a yam culer. During the story, the little girl works in the yam kitchen and finally meets up with the tutor, that raised her when she was little. He knows that she is the queen and in order to keep her safe, he sacrifices himself to tell everyone that the queen is alive. Also in order for the queen to be safe, Astrahn and Notorincus ran up the stairs to the tutor's room. On the way, Astrahn is shot and can't go on. So Notorincus finished running up the stairs and kept the queen safe.In the end the little girl opens the door and everything and everyone gets silent, for they know that she is the queen.I thought that this book was a great book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most best book I've read!","review":"One of the most exiting Book I've read!

While watching it, feel free to point out the plot holes, various continuity errors, and just about everything else. The acting is as good as a horrific soap-opera gone wrong -- random movements and actions where they just don't fit in.The direction of this movie suggests that it was originally meant to be a drama, however, after audience walk-outs and the cultish following it gained in LA, Wiseau now covers it up as if it was originally meant to be a black comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're tearing me apart!!!","review":"This movie sucks.

The pacing, the writing, the acting, is all terrible. The random thug who shows up to scream at some kid for money (because Wiseau wanted to cram every possible Oscar-worthy type of content into one film) is the best actor in this movie. The pacing is terrible! The mother shows up to tell the female lead that she has cancer, but it's no big deal. People randomly play football, though it's clear the actors have never thrown a football in their life.This movie is so bad that it's worth a party just to watch and make fun of. Hilarious.

And I do not regret buying it. Why?It's a poorly made movie, filled with lots of unnecessary scenes, characters, and transitions. The plot is so terribly executed,it's basically a 'rewind' movie. The characters are very flawed. And I don't need to say that Wiseau is maybe the worst actor ever in American cinema or in all of cinema.Yet, I like to watch it. Why?Because it makes me think I can act better than Wiseau. To me, it's the necessary \\"101 On How To Not Make A Good Movie\\". There are some many lines I can remember by heart and formulas that I can easily rip apart.Is it a bad movie?Yes.But the expense of watching something bad can make us enjoy it sometime.

But there were parts of the movie that were slightly competent (kind of like a soap opera level performance) that ended up being boring kinda. But that was probably only about a fourth of the movie. The songs and performance were hilarious. Although I diddn't really need to see the main character's butt.

Some indication that this was supposed to have been a comedy, and the audience was just not in on the joke would at least have made this film tolerable.No, on second thought, it's just unwatchable.It's movies like this that make me wonder why Amazon won't allow a 'zero star' rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This movie is awful.

It's just bad. Bad acting (from every actor). Bad characterizations (from every character). Bad casting (all of 'em, but the mugger actor should be playing a preschool teacher).

Whoever said that LIED in hopes scraping up some dignity for this melodramatic calamity.I don't know which is funnier, the fact that the lead actor/director looks like the Hallmark Movies: Frankenstein monster, or the random peripheral characters who appear with no introduction or purpose, or the strange continuity that have the lead characters doing things like, going to the church in tuxedoes while discussing the big wedding day and then playing football in the next scene and asking about the wedding date.I watched this movie straight through and laughed so hard my stomach ached.

IT had quite possibly the worst story line, acting, and logical sequencing in any \\"professional\\" movie I have ever seen. But, what else can you expect from a movie starring, written, directed, and produced all by Tommy Wiseau? The thing that makes it so enjoyable though is that it is so bad, you can;t help but watch.

The sadness of the whole production is that it's somewhat professionally filmed. Not what you'd expect from such a steaming pile of brain cell destroying dung. I did say \\"somewhat\\", no more than that. The kind of production you might expect from soft core porn. Complete with the moaning.Perhaps watching this with a few friends after consuming great quantities of beer or a massive spliff might produce a few laughs. Wouldn't know.

Without the guys(Mike,Bill and Kevin) riffing on it,it would have been unbearably crappy.They made it worthwhile to sit through.Their riffs are a stitch.The \\"acting\\" is non-existant.

Next, you'll be treated to the longest opening credits that you will ever encounter... But, get past those two things, and you may find you enjoyed this one, if only compared to other B-Horror movies. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the aforementioned scenes that I started the movie with a negative outlook. I look forward to other reviews to see if it's just me, or if I was right on :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and symplistic","review":"I hate to disagree with the other reviews, but I purchased this book to read on my vacation and was very disappointed. I agree with others that it is a very breezy novel and was able to plow through it in two days. Unfortunately, this book fell well below my expectations. The characters were rather one-dimentional, the plot was predictable, and the conclusion flat. I'd recommend this as good adolescent fiction, but simplistic and formulaic for adult readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrifying","review":"Dr. Hollinsgworth embarassed me as a human, former teenager, and golf loadie.

Considering the intended audience, the premise of depicting a third world war from a Russian context will probably not draw much popularity but from the least jingoistic techno-thriller fan (if there are any to be had).If you adore Tom Clancy or revel in Larry Bond or Harold Coyle, this story should captivate your attention. Considering strictly the qualities I think the genre's hard core fans merit I give it a four star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Plausible in 1979 than 1989","review":"Good book, however, Peters overestimates the Soviets and underestimates NATO. In '79 the Army of Jimmy Carter could not have stopped the Warsaw Pact.

At one point the Russian officers in each AO are complaining about supplies. Firstly, after the initial Soviet thrust they could forget about getting any more supplies. NATO would have pounded their staging areas, denying them eqpt & ammo followed by a counterattack from south to Northeast, cutting them off a la the Demyansk pocket or Stalingrad, writ large. The second reason is we're talking about GERMANS, people with a propensity to fight until the last shell.

It lacks credibility because it deals only with mechanic war manuevers. It supplies no political background.

This is not bad, although I've heard a better version of \\"Swing Low\\". The last five songs are the problem. They're a Diz big band, recorded \\"throughout the late 50's\\". The sound quality on them is pretty poor. The worst is the song \\"Two Bass Hit\\". A few seconds into the song it sounds like the tape stretched (I know, it's a CD), so now you're listening to the same thing at a slower speed/wrong pitch. It continues at the slower speed for the rest of the song. What's silly is that this is only 3 minutes out of a 63 minute CD. They should have just left the song off the CD.The only reason for considering this CD is that you want some Dizzy at a bargain price. If that's what you want, you can do better.

The big advantage is that complicated matters are presented as simple as possible. The only disadvantage are the text-based Spice examples. Use of PSpice Version 8.0 would be more up to date.

The duration of each song (as noted in other reviews) was lengthy and at times even the tunes became somewhat boring to watch.While his limited recommendations were worthwhile he talked very little about his chord fragments, harmonies, arranging solo pieces, fills, comping, bass lines, intervals and chord inversions that he used, as promised in the write up.

On a lark, I ran a search on Escoffier here at Amazon.com. I was stunned to find this book for the low cost of $12 or so, knowing that every other copy I had seen cost $60 or $70. So I ordered it and paged through it. Well, it only prints 2300 or so of over 5000 recipes in Escoffier's treatise. Admittedly, probably more than the home cook actually *needs*, but nowhere does the book say that it has been abridged.But, like many Amazon.com customers, I found myself in the position of thinking \\"but it'll cost me half the price of the book to send it back.\\" So I wound up giving it to a friend who likes to cook, but doesn't need the \\"real thing.\\"Suffice it to say that if you want the real Esoffier, you're still going to have to drop the $60+ for the Van Nostrand Reinhold edition.

As i read through the book, i somehow found myself loosing my way from one category to the other, not to mention that there are lists and indexes that are lacking basic data - which certainly Escoffier hadn't left out when he first wrote the book.However, as a first contact with this great Chef, it's a good start buying this if you do not want to spend more for the full version.

Two things to be aware of - the belly strap will work its way loose on a long hike and will need to be readjusted.

The picture here makes it look shinier than it really is, it's more of a matte (dull) silver, but it still looks nice. It doesn't have fancy features, just the standard buttons, fast forward/rewind, menu, zoom, and setup options.My only advice is to STOP the DVD before you eject it.

Bought this item at Best buy for $40 about a year ago. Bought it because it said \\"plays for sure\\" on the box. I play mostly dvd-r's so I wanted something that would play as many old, chewed up or discs burned on my computer.

But of course you don't exactly find many divx/xvid movies with DTS anyway. I have my XBOX 360 that handles that. This player is awesome. The videos looked great.

I just needed something to play DVDs, didn't care about high definition or any other features (I don't even know if it's capable of playing burned DVDs). If you too are looking for just the basics I would recommend this player. My only complaint: the first time I played a DVD I selected the main menu and the picture was cut in half. I turned off the player, turned it back on, and tried again. Everything was perfect. Haven't had a problem since but was weird for that to occur the first time used out of the box!

The player attempted to load for much longer than normal, then said \\"error\\" on the display, and the TV screen said \\"bad disc\\". I tried several different DVD's that were working fine previously, same results for all, so it's the player. The owners manual says not to use any cleaning discs, but I've ordered a Philips DVD lens cleaning disc to try. The Philips USA support website is less than helpful.

When it was time to eject the DVD the player refused to. It would make a noise and then continue to load the DVD. I had to take apart the player to get my dvd back. I requested an exchange from Philips since Amazon would not allow me to exchange it for this particular item.Another complaint, the box arrived in horrible condition which might have affected the player. It looked like someone was playing soccer with it before it arrived at my house. Amazon could have delivered it in a brown cardboard box. The item wasn't large at all.

He has little prose and even less flowery description - everything is to the point, which further reinforces the terror of all he sees. At certain points of the story, it can also be incredibly sad as well. Not an easy story to read.The description of his bayonett being stuck in a live german boy while his brother watches on in terror is one of the most candid and sad experiences ever read. As well, when Charles is wounded, it is written almost in a surreal fashion, as he hallucinates and falls in and out of consciousness.Pick this one up. It's a true account from the writer (meaning he was there), and it's a story that isn't easily put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A STRANGE, HAUNTING WORK OF SURREALISM","review":"The Orange Tree is a book of unusual beauty. Fuentes, once again playing the historian, presents a reiteration of Latin American history which is utterly convincing as a piece of pure mythology. This perhaps lies in Fuentes' uncanny ability to assign either perfect charm or horrifying ugliness to so much of what he describes: the spectacular fall of the Aztec Empire; the complex seige of a Spanish city by the Romans; the dreamlike arrival of Columbus to a ambivilant paradise.The five novellas of The Orange Tree offer the reader voices which seem to speak from beyond life and history. We are presented tales of death and suffering in a context so huge, so ambitious, that Fuentes has destroyed the barriers of history and constructed a reality all his own. The lavishness of his vision is hypnotic.Read this book with abandon; allow its mythology to consume you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic memento of the 2005 World Champion White Sox!","review":"The Chicago Tribune hit a home run with their tribute to the 2005 Chicago White Sox, BELIEVE IT!

The authors make the mistake of teaching the language in its romanized form, rather than introducing the Korean alphabet--Hangul--from the start. The Hangul alphabet is very easy to learn, and trying to teach Korean without introducing the words in Korean script is a serious, if not fatal flaw. The lack of a cassette guide is equally troublesome. Instead, I would recommend \\"College Korean\\" by Michael Rogers, Clare You, and Kyungnun Richards; published by the University of California at Berkeley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended and useful","review":"Of the 4 or 5 books I have on the Korean language, this is the best. This book goes beyond simple travel phrases, etc. and teaches you to build some basic sentences quickly. I did find the romanization is poor (in my view). And the cassettes could be improved upon. Also, I wish the Korean script was included in the dictionay in the back. Once you get familiar with the script, you begin to rely on it to understand correct pronunciation, since this doesn't take too long and most romanizations are erroneous. I don't have College Korean or Active Korean, two books I've seen often recommended, so I can't compare against them. But this book will give you a good introduction to the Korean language.

I think that our generation needs to learn how they can make things themselves instead of relying on others to make them. However, I am very disappointed in almost every single recipe that I have tried to make from the Martha Stewart cookbooks. This particular book calls for some hard-to-find ingredients with no options for the people who can't find or obtain them.I realize that the people who bake these pies and tarts for the book are professionals and have had a lot of food styling done to them but what the average person is capable of making at home is no where near what you see in the book.It seems this book was printed as another tool to promote the Martha Stewart organization. It was not done to help the average consumer, like it seems the MS organization is portraying itself to be. This is a very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful, awful!","review":"My roommate (the baker of the household) owns this book. After making three different pies using Ms. Stewart's recipes, he has sworn off of this book forever. Sure the stuff looks great, but if it tastes like nothing, then what good is that? Her recipes use hard-to-find ingredients, and are not very well seasoned; one squash pie called for ground ginger as the only spice, and it was horrible - kind of like bland soap!

Sure, \\"Black Woman\\" and \\"Monkey-Pockie-Boo\\" have all the fire and fury that made Sonny's name, but the electric pianos and off-kilter funk grooves here are so bizarre, so unexpected, that they become incredibly compelling. His guitar alternates between plucking and screaming, until it seems like he's inventing No Wave and post-punk on the spot. Plus, chalk me up as a determined Linda Sharrock fan. If Yoko Ono made a record with Keiji Haino, backed by Medeski, Martin & Wood, it might sound something like this, and that would be a damn cool thing indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Man, this is one STRANGE album. And I don't say that because of its avant guarde elements. I have listened to so much \\"out\\" music, it is second nature.On Paraidise, Sonny and Linda Sherrock play guitar and sing, respectively, over slick, funky grooves. The couple's work is defiantely going way outside the chord changes.Nothing wrong with this intrinsically, but this sounds more like they took their favortate groove album and played over it. The mixing of styles feels forced, not organic.I have listened to Sonny, and Linda, for years, and they have made some great music. Both could make a great R&B; album, or a great avant jazz wallpaper shreader, at will. I am sure they could have made a great album combigning both. This just is not it.Still, the playing is excellent. The grooves are chunky, and I really do respect the impulse at work here.

I am interested in football, coaching, success, and ways to motivate and educate. Unfortunately, this book falls short of the mark. It reads more like a fan's guide to a coach's family background than it does an examination of Bill Belichick's unique methods of achieving victories on the football field. Indeed, Belichick's apparent limitations in the personality/charisma department would seem to lend themselves to detailed exploration of how he has done what he's done with the New England Patriots. But if that's what you're looking for, you'll have to wait for another author to take up this subject. Halberstam's work disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"In the past I've really enjoyed Halberstam's books, but I found this one to be surprisingly uninteresting.

I certainly recommend it to football fans and others who may be interested in leadership tactics and pitfalls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall a very boring book","review":"The first half of the books reads like Genesis. The book starts out with Belichick's father and takes us through every job he ever had and introduces us to every other coach or scout he worked with or knew. The process is then repeated with Bill himself. Once all the begats are over, the author finally starts to talk about Belichick's ideas and philosophies. Here is where the author really misses.

Maybe it's because the subject is just not a very interesting person, but this book is just terrible. He tells us material that contributes nothing; who cares about about his grandparents and his wife family? He also gushes about the subject and his family. Is everything really so great? It's as if he chose an average person at random and wrote a biography about him. The average person doesn't lead a particularly fascinating life and the resulting biography would be dull. Just because he is a success as a coach doesn't necessarily make him a good candidate for a biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education of a Football Fan","review":"I usually read football books because I like to read about the X's and O's of the sport, but this book was more about the human and business side of the sport. I gained an insight and appreciation for a football coach's life and the struggle to survive in the coaching business. This book \\"The Education of a Coach\\" is the story of a coach who did survive and succeded at the highest level of the sport--winning three Super Bowls in 4 years. This book gives more than a biography of the coach's life but it also teaches many usefull life lessons. Who better to learn from than someone who knows what it takes to be successful and a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puff Piece","review":"I hate to pile on a fine author when the time has passed when he can redeem himself but I concur with all the negative reviews with one exception--I don't think the book's lack of appeal can be written off as due to the fact that Belichik is a boring oaf. He is that on the outside, but there's a lot more than that inside and the author just did not dig that out. The problem with the book is that there is minimal \\"inside\\" information - a little more detail about Tom Brady's development than maybe you know, and a good explanation of just how feared a player Marshall Faulk was, but that's about it. The title suggests that the subject matter is limited to the sort of background biographical stuff so maybe we should have seen this coming, but this is really little more than an expansion of the bio you might find on the Patriots website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wire is wire","review":"I'm only writing this to completely review all of the products that I bought to install a radio in my jeep.

It also advertised that it would never lose suction. The primary reason we bought it was because we have two labs and picking up dog hair is trully a problem.At first the unit work great. We were pretty impressed and happy with the unit. But, the pet attachment stopped working shortly after the warrant ran out. And after about two and half years, the vacuum is no long picking up dog hair like it use to. We now have to go over the same spot three or four times and we are still left with streaks of hair. We've taken good care of this vacuum too; cleaning the filters and the canister regularly. I would not recommend this vacuum. We are currently trying to decide between an Oreck or Dyson.

When you want to clean it you have to wash it. The problem is that you cannot use the machine if that part is wet and it does not dry for days once you wash it. The reason is that it is so tightly built the water left inside evaporates very very slowly. Basically, this is a high maintainance machine. It says on its ad \\"Advanced cyclonic no loss of suction technology\\". Well, I am willing to trade this technology with emptying the dust cup more frequently if it requires that much maintainance.Second, it is very heavy. I do not mind it but my girlfriend really hate to use it and everytime she complains about it.Third, I don't think that its suction is very good, especially for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money, poor quality","review":"I will never buy one of these again. It worked for about 3 months then the extender tube latch broke, so the tube didn't lock in place. When I ordered a new tube, it didn't even fit the vacuum as the new tube design was slightly different than the original.The drive belt breaks very frequently, and replacements are hard to find. Don't try to use another type of belt though, because the beater bar will overheat, even to the point of melting.The dust bin is so small that you need to empty it every room.The only nice thing I can say about this is it does pick up pet hair pretty well.

I got this vacuum since it has Dyson technology at half the price, but I should have saved my money.

I didn't even change the almost full filter bag first. Then I vacuumed with the Infinity. It did get some more carpet fiber and pet hair out of the carpet, but not a significant amount. From what I have read about the Dyson, people are truly impressed and couldn't believe their carpets were that dirty.

You can not get a belt for this vacuum from any website I have been able to find either including the comany's website.

Extremely scary, suspensful, exciting, and interesting, this book is a great read! This book is about an expedition to reach Discovery and, if possible, to bring it back to Earth. Discovery is the spaceship that David Bowman and Frank Poole used in 2001: A Space Odyssey. This ship was controlled by a super-computer, named HAL 9000. Read 2001:A Space Odyssey for more details. On this expedition, they fix HAL 9000 and he is now functional. There are lots of weird things that happen like contact with the Japanese spaceship Tsien, and DAVID BOWMAN RETURNS!!!!! If you want to read more, read 2010:Odyssey Two!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sequel for 2001","review":"If you enjoyed 2001, then you will probably like this book as well.

Many times during the book, which I've read twice, I was amased by how unpredictable it was. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"2010 is a great book; I couldn't put it down. It leaves you thirsty for more, and you just can't enough. If you have seen the movie then you will have a very good idea what is going on, but don't let that stop you from reading the book, because it is still even better then the movie. The movie to me was better then 2001 and so the book 2010 is just outstanding. I suggest that you read 2010 and get it for your collection because it is a classic in the SciFi genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this!!!","review":"2001 is one of the greatest novels written by Arthur C. Clarke but 2010 is even greater. It is perhaps the best of them all! Before I read this book I had strongly suspected that it would be a weak attempt to follow up on one the greatest sci-fi stories ever written but I was mistaken. Fortunately, because this novel explains much of the stuff from 2001 which weren't that clear in the first place all the while it expands the odyssey universe to an extend that is even greater in scope than in the first novel. The only negative thing there is to say is that the first half of the novel is a bit technical. Some of the things going on can be a bit tedious I think but this is entirely made up for in the second half which, for my part, is probably the best work of fiction I have ever read! Clarke's imagination is apparently infinite and it is no wonder that he has recieved the status of both guru and prophet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy sequel of 2001","review":"Frankly, this book is not as great as 2001: A Space Odyssey. In fact, I wonder if anybook can match 2001. Still, I loved this book as a fiction, and I read it several times. This book has almost everything that one can ask. ps: you may read 2061, but NEVER read 3001! I think Arthur C. Clarke was blackmailed to write this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say? AMAZING!!!","review":"2010, which is in my opinion the best of the Odyssey series, is an amazing book in every sense. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this masterpiece is Clarke's wonderful descriptions of Jupiter and its moons...his words make you think \\"WOW! I can't believe this stuff is actually OUT THERE!\\".

This shoe was made from China all right. Cheap glue, juice stain on the outside, deteriorating mold on the inside, and the sign that says Western looked like they pasted it on with a bubble gum strip. I ain't lying!! I'm CONVINCED that a 5 year old made this shoe. The sign that says Chief should really say CHEAP! Child Labor is cruelty!!! AND I want my money back!!! I really want to rate these a negative nothing, but that was not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Was Looking For","review":"These boots where exactly what I was looking for.

Every time I go back through it I feel like an idiot for not having thought of some of the simple and (once pointed out) obvious techniques she describes. Whatever sort of embellishment you are planning, chances are there is something in this book to make the process easier and more effective. And when you are not sewing, the book is fun to read! Her explanations are clear and easy to envision. I have never actually made one of the projects in the book, but have used the techniques on countless projects. She even says that's fine with her! A truly useful book brimming with GOOD ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for parents and kids","review":"This book has been a favorite in our home since we got it over 8 years ago. The pictures are beautiful and fun. The rhymes are great. It is one of the few books that I do not tire of reading over and over and over again to the kiddos.Only draw-back is that it is permanately stuck in my head.

It gives us an oppurtunity to understand how we connect to the environment and also shows us the steps to meet up with a higher plane of reality and consciousness. If you want to get to know who and what you are in a deeper way this book is for you. The knowledge is timeless and overcomes many boundaries that we place upon ourselves during are day to day struggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"I read all the reviews on this book, and was really looking forward to reading it. With all due respect to the author, the book is hardly referenced, speculative, and relies on highly circumstantial evidence in support of its thesis: namely, that Lincoln was the victim of a Confederate plot. Also, the writing style is dull and unimaginative, hardly provoking much desire to turn the next page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great band, great album, terrible rip","review":"Don't bother with the mp3 version. 192k at a low quality.Why Amazon does this with classics is baffling. 256k CBR should be the minimum."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best psychedelic LP of the best psychedelic group","review":"The fourth LP of the Elevators.

However they do not include enough of the coloring sheets, and the pens just don't seem to blend as well or look as nice on regular paper. Besides, that the metallic pens are more like paint than markers. I do enjoy using them to write on other things, but that isn't the point.The whole concept seems like it would be frustrating for most small children. My four year old cousin had these but quickly lost interest in trying to blend them and just used them as regular markers for a while. She's really into arts and crafts but is not interested in these at all. They are mixed in with her other markers but probably do not even get as much use as them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Bought for my daughter and she disliked them.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced markers","review":"I bought these for my 5 yr old who loves drawing. I can't believe I paid $10 for 4 markers.

The biggest disappointment was he sang a Pentecostal Ambassador hit, \\"Hold On,\\" and had the original lead vocalist of the song, Elder Donald L. Golder of the Pentecostal Ambassadors, singing in the background. I didn't hear Elder Allen at any time share the lead with Elder Golder. My personal opinion, that was terribly inappropriate. He even used Elder Golder's church choir in the background. Nevertheless, I suppose we can still enjoy the soulful sounds of Elder Rance Allen."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 1/2 year old doesn't want to turn it off!","review":"We picked this DVD up at a local charity used book sale, and my 2 1/2 year old won't stop watching it.

The songs are all classic songs I learned in Sunday School, many I had forgotten over the years.

It is currently out of print (also not currently available through willowcreek.com) so keep your eyes open for a reasonably priced copy, or borrow from a friend.

If the reader is a liberal Episcopalian, the reader will probably love the book. However, Heart Wisperers isn't for everyone and might be a disapointment or even offensive for some readers.The book is fairly well written, but not for the general audience of Benedictines. Roman Catholic Oblates would find there are many pages with theological and moral unsoundess.Frankly, what is disapointing, is it wouldn't have taken that much effort to strip out the snipe at the Fundimentalists and tone down the social re-engineering comments. Perhaps in the future Canham will write books that have a broader appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"SDM-HS95P - Xtra Brite and Xtra Clear!","review":"Pros: Big, Beautiful display is very bright, sharp and clear, great for Photoshop sessions. Distinctive style. Apparently well-made.Cons: Unique stand is wider than many monitor risers. The adjustable \\"rear leg\\" is too easy to adjust, meaning the leg could shift quite easily and cause the monitor to fall. The Power switch is in an awkward place. The shiny finish of the screen show dust and figerprints and is tricky to clean well.After using this monitor for several months it is my favorite to date. Only 1 competitor is in the same class, an NEC. I've found that a microfiber glass cleaning cloth cleans the screen well with no smearing.

The reasonable 1280x1024 res is great for straining graphics cards and PC's two or more years old. most older games will be blurry in a 800x600 res though.

But he is by no means an idiot or a dimwit. He is simply a quiet man who mistakenly is given just a short time to live, and who wants to have a wonderful time in the short time he has left. Thank God my Mom brought me up dragging me kicking & screaming to Alec Guinness & Peter Sellers movies.And of course, this is yet another great British film ripped off by Hollyweird, likeThe Ladykillers.....I believe Mike Meyers might be doing a remake of Holy Grail.

Real life events of the time are woven into the story such as the Kansas City Massacre which occurred in 1933.It is an old fashioned cops n' robbers movie from the 1930's with the stock characters, classic old cars, chases, gunfights & crashes.

Then, on my return trip, I set my cruise to about 13 over to get myself home, watching the detector and praying for one little flash or beep, but magically the highy patrol lights filled the background of my car, and the radar DETECTOR did not even DETECT the RADAR when it was parked 10 FEET behind me. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost no reaction when I met police cars","review":"It kept quiet when I met at least 10 police cars in the past few days. so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks big time!","review":"don't buy....I bought for 34 bucks on buy.com and it is not worth a penny!! I have seen several cops on the street and this thing rarely beeps with a cop around....although it is sure to beep when I apprach a toll plaza!! what good is that? what a waste of my money....don't know what the other reviewers who gave this 4-5 stars are smoking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Within a week or 10 days the detector quit working, and I don't know how or where to send it for replacement.

The only concern was that it got extremely hot on the dash of the car. Other than that it was a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The name is COBRA","review":"This is my first radar, and after all bands that this unit can detect, I say many times save several tickets. Usually I take the highway and unfortunately the limit is 60. Should be 70 or 75, so I go faster to save time. Anyways, this radar detect cops far away, so it gives me time to slow down and no problems so far. On city, the same thing, on constructions roads, it beeps alert half block away. And when cops are in the city it beeps too, not all the times because most cops don't use their radar guns when they are driving.Good price for a good radar detector, and I love the VG-2 technology built in it.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radar Detector","review":"Great product for the price, but doesn't always catch everything, and sometimes picks up things that are not valid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product....","review":"I have been using this radar detector for quite some time now...and i just bought another one for someone else. This detector has saved me from tickets and has also warned me in case of an emergency vehicle. I recommend this product to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cobra detectors suck","review":"Do not purchase a Cobra radar detector...their product does work at first with warnings as they promise. But, after only a few week, the detector does NOT even detect automatic door openers at Walmart and other radar \\"detecting\\" objects. Simply put, this product did not work for me and very disappointed...radar detectors are made to detect - arent they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Penthouse","review":"When I put this on the cage the hamster started using it as his Penthouse!Put some bedding in and he loved it. He likes being able to look out at the cats and dogs and wiggle his whiskers at them knowing he is safe from them. Like the fact that the top \\"locks\\" down (there is a small ridge to push it past) so other animals can't remove the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"I purchased from Ozbo here on Amazon (what a deal!)","review":"This is a nice little look-out for your critters.

Definitely worth the price I paid at Ozbo through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid opens too easily","review":"This looked great at first, but the lid kept popping open on it's own.I would hear a loud crashing sound and the lid would be open. I really don't know if my hamster learned to twist the lid open since the lid is very easily twisted to open.I only had this for 2 days and I regret buying it.The lid flew open again in the middle of the night which lead to my hamster's tragic death. My dog found the hamster before I did!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this!!!","review":"My hamster died because of this!!! he was trying to get down from the tube and he fell head first down the tube and hit his head and died!DONT buy this unless you want your hamster to die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered for Ferrets and it was too small","review":"I completed a search for ferret tubes and this item came up and I got it, when I recieved it, it was TOO SMALL for ferrets to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for larger hamsters!","review":"This product is good quality and fits in the Crittertrail cages very well. However! My hamster is a boy and a bit on the larger side and NEVER went up in the lookout tower. There's not much area in the little dome for them to sleep. Perhaps if I had a smaller hamster, he would have enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a spaceship","review":"We call it a spaceship. Assembly was easy. We have the hard plastic lid on our cage. It does a good job holding the tube upright. The joints do not fit through the opening, so I had to assemble the tubes through the top. The joint of the tube is actually what keeps the ship in place.This would be ideal for young kids on a low table. We have ours on a kitchen table, and when our gerbil goes up in it, only the oldest can see him in there (using a chair). The yellow part does come off with a quarter turn.Our gerbil loves to chew. But he has not been able to chew the tube. I have seen him try to chew it in several places, but he gives up after a few seconds.We used to put his food in it, but he would not eat it all, and we dumped it out.If you use the right technque, the tubes separate easily. Grip your hands on either side of the tube, and push them out away from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I bought this to add to a basic Crittertrail cage and the only place to attach it is the sides of the cage. Well, it's top heavy and swings over. Plus my dwarf hamster was too scared to go down the long section of tubing once she got up to the lookout on top. I was able to take out one section and then it became a little more stable plus Mochi could climb down. However, there is no room in the lookout for bedding and my hammie just huddles up there and stays when I attach it. Not sure if she's happy up there or not, so most of the time, it's detached. I think if the little room had and entrance and exit and tubes that went over top or side of cage,this would be a better addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I bought this to add on to my crittertrail cage, it was a disaster!! It doesn't stand up by itself when attached to the cage and so i have to prop it against a wall! Also the lid comes off easily and my hamster has escaped from it several times luckily i caught him in time !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it","review":"I bought this lookout on tuesday hoping to connect it to my hamster cage. When I got it, I tried to attach it from the top. First, it wouldnt slide into the whole from the top so i had to open the whole top on the cage and put it in like that. Second, the lookout wouldnt stand up! the hole was bigger then the lookout so the lookout would slide everywhere. I hated this fun-nel! Its very annoying! I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone because I ended up returning it and its really a bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless! all the bedding falls out of the hole on the bottom and my hamster hates it.","review":"Not designed well. My hamster hates it and all the bedding falls out the whole on the bottom. The green litter box that come with the other kit is designed way better and my hamster always sleeps in it. This one was not worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a classic album!","review":"U2's The Joshua Tree is at times, peaceful, moving, emotional, deep and rocking all at the same time. Some of the social themes are still felt today in U2's later albums such as All That You Can't Leave Behind from 2000. With or Without You, I Still Haven't Found, and Where The Streets Have No Name are still favorites. But other songs like Mothers of the Disappeared and One Tree Hill are very well done too. It is such a dynamic, creative and high point for the band and Bono and his band still perform songs from it in concerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, yet overrated.","review":"This is a good album, but it is not as \\"spectacular\\" as people say. It lacks the emotion of their earlier albums, but does manage to keep the listener interested. The songs are good, but their earlier stuff is much better. Pretty good overall, but not even close to War, U2's best album by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"No rock collection is truly complete without the tree","review":"All I can say, baby, is that it speaks to my soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Joshua Tree by U2 from Amazon - Medimops Company","review":"Purchased from 'Medimops'/ Amazon company.

Buyer beware"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC ALBUM","review":"AS A U2 FAN OF MANY YEARS STANDING, I STILL CONSIDER THIS NOT ONLY TO BE THEIR GREATEST ALBUM, BUT QUITE POSSIBLY- IN FACT DEFINETELY- THE GREATEST ALBUM I OWN (I HAVE 300+!) ALL THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE TERRIFIC. OF COURSE, EVERYONE KNOWS THE \\"RADIO HITS\\", BUT FOR DEDICATED FANS LIKE ME, MOST OF THE OTHER TRACKS HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM. APART FROM THE HITS, MY OTHER 2 FAVOURITE SONGS ARE \\"BULLET THE BLUE SKY\\" (P.S. WHEN U2 PLAYED THE BOTANIC GARDENS, BELFAST 1997, WHEN BONO SANG THE LINE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PLANES, A LOAD OF LIGHTS LIKE THE LIGHTS OF A PLANE SHONE INTO BONO'S FACE!) MY OTHER FAVOURITE SONG IS THE VERY LITTLE HEARD \\"IN GOD'S COUNTRY\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"it is not worth it!","review":"The bonus DVD (Paris concert) is the only appreciable thing of this bundle, not their best performance (Streets is missing!) but it is much better than what filmed in Rattle & Hum.\\"Outside it's America\\" is just complete and utter rubbish, really pathetic patchwork.Audio CDs are remastered but audio quality is as poor as in the original album."},{"rating":"1","title":"tripe","review":"An overrated adult/contemporary schlock-fest pretending to be alternative, the Joshua Tree is as one-dimensional as the rest of U2's catalogue. I have never found Bono a particularly soulful singer, and his lyrics are like the scribblings of a 10th grader who just learned to rhyme. Put me in prison and force me to hear this stuff, I would lose my mind. There was better music than this in 1987 (try Pixies). (Interestingly, this was the same year REM sold out with Document). Bono is not the Bob Dylan of his generation, nor even any sort of a poet at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so great??","review":"The first four songs alone would be worth 5stars. It's the other 5 and 6 that weigh it down. Being a music lover who isn't over the age of 40, there's not enough..mmphh on the album. You're better of getting How To Dismantle A Bomb, Achtung Baby or No Line On The Horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Not A 13 Year Old Kid","review":"I despise Johua Tree. I don't know why, maybe it's because it's the CD they sold out on. Every time I hear a song from the God awful CD on the radio it's like hearing someone run their nails down a chalk board.Needless to say I change the station fast.If you really like U2 listen to their earlier CD's like Boy, War, or The Unforgettable Fire. All That You Can't Leave Behind is pretty good. But if you want a really good U2 CD check out Achtung Baby. It's their best CD in years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get why they're so hyped","review":"They just do dreary brit pop they aren't even a propper rock band. they win awards for best rock band of the decade or whatever on all those dumb award programs and get voted by pop-listening douche's and people who like them because they think they should.

I don't get it. When I say \\"it,\\" I mean this fascination with U2. I've listened to the Joshua Tree since I was just a kid and even as a child I could tell the band was terrible. The Edge is an overrated guitarist and Bono's sappy lyrics and complaining voice are nore than I can handle. U2=most overrated band in history. I hear they are good live performers but I don't care because the music is ludicrous. Pick up something from the Velvet Underground, early Bowie, or the Band if you want some truly compelling rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2's worst album","review":"This album is nothing but overblown, pseudo-spiritual baby food. Most everything in U2's catalog before this album is groundbreaking and intensely interesting (even if uneven). This is where Bono and the boys stopped being a rock and roll band and started to become second-rate preachers. This album is nearly unlistenable, failing utterly to rock in any way whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do people see in these guys?","review":"Ya know, i don't get it. What do people see in this band of garralous babbling morons? sure there albums reflect the politics of blah blah blah, but the music is so repetitive and dull, it puts me into a hypnotic trans which probably everyone else has been droned into. Bono and his gang are severly overatted and dull to the ear. Not to mention that there hit singles \\"still haven't found what i'm looking for\\" and \\"In the name of love\\" sound exactly the same. If I write anymore I'll get a headache thinking about why these guys are so popular"},{"rating":"2","title":"a gift of Americana from Bono and company","review":"In November 1987, my roommate and I made our way from the Rocky Mountains to the San Francisco Bay Area and, more specifically, the Oakland Colliseum to see U2, The Pretenders, and the BoDeans. It was an incredible weekend. Bono spray painted on the fountain at Embarcadero, and the Bay Bridge traffic came to a stop at lunch as people jammed the roads trying to get there. A friend slept in line and so we were at the front wall throughout the concert. It was one of those rare occasions where they let you in with cameras, too, so I have some great shots. W also got to play Uno with Bill Graham who was riding around on his golf cart, and hung out for a bit.This is one of the most memorable albums of all time. Huge singles, and a beauty and richness around the theme of America that ingrained U2 as a household name, and made this album a part of all of us. This is about as close to a perfect album as you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This album, to me, is really really slow. I really love the first three songs. I love the whole cd, but it can get a little boring. It's a slow album compared to most of their other ones, and some points feel like there should just be more there. It is amazing for a slower album, and U2 masters the slow songs beautifully, but it's not, nor has it ever been, my favorite U2 album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like all the other reviews...","review":"I first bought this tape when it came out in 1987. Something about the essence of the music applied it's self to me. Being in college and looking for new music I approached the music with some hesitation and skepticisim, as a the time it was 'pop music' (still a metalhead).Upon listening to the music (many times over), I began to realize that U2 was addressing the issues of world politics that few had decided to address, and in the hit song, the sadness of of the how far some people go to NOT accept reality.Is this a CD that you would not buy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"They've finally found what they've been looking for","review":"U2 finally found what they've been looking for. Grammys for their THE JOSHUA TREE album. The album sold seven million copies in 1987,the year it was released. A worldwide tour followed the release of this album inspiring RATTLE AND HUM,both the movie and the follow-up album. Live versions of I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR(with a gospel choir) and BULLET THE BLUE SKY appeared on RATTLE AND HUM. The band dedicated THE JOSHUA TREE to their friend Greg Carroll,who died in 1986 at only age 25 or 26. The album notes give his birth year as 1960."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is truly the best album ever written. You may be hooked in originally by Where the Streets Have No Name, or With or Without you. But you will soon discover gems such as Mothers of the Disappeared and One Tree Hill. Rolling Stone recently named it the 26th greatest album of all time, and though U2 has come out with many more, they will never be able to outdo the brilliantness of the Joshua Tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"complete and amazing","review":"rather than write some boring dissertation on this album that i've loved for years, i'll just say this:listen to the song \\"running to stand still\\". it is one of the most moving songs i've ever heard, and it's so well crafted that it's one of the strongest ballads i've ever listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2's First Truly Great Album.","review":"This is one of those CDs that seems to get better with age. U2 had put out some good albums before. The earlier ones had some great songs surrounded by filler. I feel this is the first complete album they released. We all know the hits from this release \\"With of Without You\\", \\"Where the STreets Have No Name\\", and \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" but there are some really great songs hidden in here. The chorus to \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" still gives me chills. \\"One Tree Hill\\" and \\"Gods Country\\" are songs that just make you feel really good. \\"Running To Stand Still\\" should have been a hit single, don't know what happened there. \\"Bullett the Blue Sky\\" just rocks. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the way U2 makes GOOD music","review":"I won't go into too much detail over this album. I like it because it was made the year I was born, and I didn't discover it until just recently. It is the only real essential purchase if you want to get into U2. All of the songs are good, unlike later albums of their which have a lot of filler. Go check it out, most likely you will like it a lot. Most people do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I got this as a gift for my husband - I loved every aspect of this, including the way it was packaged!

They will open up their arms and you can come on in, a magic kingdom waits for you! This is average stuff really.For a real piece of 'Celtica' go up to search and type in, DONT STAND ME DOWN.

The people who say that they sold out however are wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated to say the least","review":"\\"The Joshua Tree\\" starts off good with its best three songs in a row, and the excellent \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\" is of course the albums highlight. After this great introduction things go downhill and at the end of the album I'm pretty bored. I think (like at least some others) that this album is over rated - it's far from THAT good. But if people actually believe that albums like Jay Farrer's \\"Sebastopol\\", Beth Orton's \\"Daybreaker\\", and Coldplay's \\"A rush of blood to the head\\" is worth 5 stars I guess the same goes for this one.Take my word, a \\"best of\\" U2 will be enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I never understood the acclaim this album received. It isn't a bad album; just inferior to all of U2's previous work and most of their later work.U2 deserves a great deal of credit for their passionate songwriting, and for developing a unique sound and then evolving in new directions. This cd is at the mid-point: it has the pure early sound, for the most part, but does nothing new with it. The songs have a sameness, and run together.I suppose the critics note that this album was a shift from the political to the personal, if not an evolution in other ways. But U2 had done songs on the personal level before, and done them much better. Listen to \\"Bad\\" on Unforgettable Fire. That single song contains twice the passion of this entire album.The following are better U2 cds: War, The Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby, Zooropa, October, and Boy. The Joshua Tree, I suppose, is better than Rattle and Hum and Pop. It rates pretty low in the scale of \\"must have\\" U2 cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first 3 songs are classic....then...","review":"The album falters...Occupied by \\"Running to stand still\\" and other rubbish garbage. Buy this album but expect to hit your SKIP button after the first 3 tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUT","review":"All this album does is mark the beginning of U2's commercial era and puts them into the \\"sell out\\" category. I'm so glad The Smiths/Depeche Mode/even The Police didn't follow the same path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too commercial.","review":"The beginning of the end for U2. This release marks their decent into selling out. If you want a real U2 cd, go get Boy or War, youll thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of U2's Finest","review":"If \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" put U2 on the map, and it did, then \\"Joshua Tree\\" catapulted them into the stratosphere. Not merely one of U2's best, or even one of the eighties best, but more important one of the best albums ever made. The real gems on this album are not the singles, but the cuts that never made it to mainstream radio -- \\"In God's Country\\" -- \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" -- \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" -- and the remarkable, extraordinary and incomparable \\"One Tree Hill,\\" a masterwork, a masterpiece of songcraft -- one of the finest songs ever (cf. \\"Scene of the Crime,\\" Brent Bourgeois), by U2 or anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd Buy It","review":"I would definitely pick this up the day it is released if in fact this listing is accurate. If it is a mistake, amazon needs to pay closer attention to what they are doing. Currently, the only way to hear this digitally is either the CD that came out in '87 or the long out of print and now expensive MFSL gold disc. I don't know what the band or Island records are up to by not remastering this in one way or another, other than using the original as a cash cow after 18 years, but this is a recording that would benefit greatly if released on SACD or DVD-Audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This is one of my favorites.

Period. There is nothing better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted and Classic U2","review":"I remember when I first listened to this album in my younger days. Something in the words stopped me in my tracks, made me listen. I forgot until recently why this band is the only one I'd stand three hours in line just to get into a concert or wake up at midnight to buy the latest album.I purchased this album as a 180g LP, I can hear what I've missed all these years. An awesome way to experience this classic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply breathtaking.","review":"Where do I begin? This is U2 AT THEIR PEAK. This may be one of the best albums EVER, along with The Beatles' Revolver. The Joshua Tree just blows my mind and takes me into another world as Bono sings at his greatest of darkness and cruelty of this world. The theme of this album is mourning for friends who have passed away, and being isolated in a dark state of mind with no release, apparently. It seems that every U2 album has a theme, like War, Boy, and Achtung, Baby. Anyway, the best two on this album are I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With or Without You. They are both, as with the rest of the album, lyrically ASTOUNDING. This is an example of U2, rock and music at its best in DECADES. A must have for anybody who's anybody and whoever has good taste in music. I can't say in words what a brilliant, mindblowing, beautiful masterpiece this is. *****PS. Did I mention this album is great?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Journey","review":"The Joshua Tree was the album to own in 1987. It still sounds great. It starts off with \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". The classic video for that song had the band jamming on top of a building in California reminiscent of The Beatles rooftop concert. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"With or Without You\\" are wonderful tracks I never get tired of. \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\",\\"In God's Country\\" and \\"One Tree Hill\\" are some of the other songs you'll find here in this classic album. Maybe they'll tack on the b-sides in the future, some of which were: \\"Spanish Eyes\\", \\"Luminous Times\\" and \\"Sweetest Thing\\". Thanks U2, for sharing this inspired group effort with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, but slightly over-rated","review":"This is of course a great CD.

This album is where U2 finally brought enough focus to the raw emotion of their previous work to create an album of epic impact, depth, and proportion.This has to be considered the best album of the 1980's, and one of the five or so best albums in the history of rock music. My grandkids will be listening to this one, just like today's kids still listen to The Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great one from U2","review":"This album went platinum in 48 hours when it was released in 1987, making it the fastest-selling UK album ever. It reached number 1 in twenty-two countries selling 15 million worldwide. U2 also received the Grammy for 'Album Of The Year' for it.This kind of success is quite understandable with songs like Where The Streets Have No Name and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.

The whole album flows together as Bono and the boys take the listener on a musical roller coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 are playing CHESS, eveyone else is still playing checkers","review":"I get sickened at the fact that people refer to U2 as sellouts. They are just so far ahead of everyone else in the business, that no one else can fathem what they are doing.They are so ahead of time, that people are still trying to figure out \\"Joshua Tree\\", and forget the fact that the album is 12 years old. I suspect Bono has a time machine, thats how far ahead of everyone else in the industry he is. How can you blame U2 for trying something new, they are just trying to challenge themselves. A real sellout is someone who writes the same old stuff, because they are afraid of change, or even crossing that so called line everyone keeps refering to. Bono writes from within, thats what everyone is missing.Name one other group that even resembles U2 in the slightest. DIDN'T THINK SO!

I only know of a few albums with as many songs on them that I love. All of the hits(\\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", \\"Still Haven't Found...\\", and \\"With or Without You\\") are amazing and instantly mindblowing. A couple more listens into this, you realize that there are at least 6 more great songs, and maybe all 8 of the rest. My favorites, even more than the hits, are \\"Running to Stand Still\\", \\"One Tree Hill\\"(the highlight of Joshua Tree with extremely powerful lyrics as well...If this song were only to be found on a $25 Hanson album, I'd still buy that to get this song),\\"Exit\\", \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\", and \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\". It's a tragedy not to own this. Get it now.

All the fancy packaging and additional music will never change that fact that it's still low-resolution, old, 16 bit/44.1kHz technology. Even if it's remaster in DSD, what comes from your player is STILL low-resolution 16 bit/44.1kHz.CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to it or WHO does the mastering/mixing.I don't see why they don't release a TRUE \\"Deluxe Edition\\" and give us an SACD as they did with the release of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery, or Rush's Moving Pictures (on Blu-Ray and also DVD-Audio). They're phenomenal and a TRUE \\"Deluxe Editions\\".Until the music companies get onboard and learn about audio, this is what we will see more of, trash recordings dressed up in fancy packaging then laughingly called \\"Deluxe Editions\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one out there","review":"I must say after looking at the rating of 4.5 i had to jump on and give this irish band a 5 star rating!!

Among the extra tracks there's a single edit of \\"Streets\\". Fair enough but it's not as if it's a 10 minute song edited to 3 minutes like \\"Light My Fire\\" or something. If my memory serves me well \\"Hallelujah (Here She Comes)\\" is the b-side to \\"With or Without You\\". I have it on 45. It's worth the inclusion AND Billy Preston played the organ on it! Also, are there no completely or sort of different versions of any of the tunes on the original release? That might be pretty interesting.....Ah....I'm getting this anyway so i'm not really complaining....Killer album indeed. I hold my vinyl copy up to the light and can see my hand thru it.

I own all of them, and this is quite simply the light on the hill. As far as U2's recordings go, it is an acheivement unapproachable in its carry of texture and mood. From the opening track to the final note on the last, one feels invited to listen. It is a complete work in the truest sense. In short, enough simply cannot be said. 5 stars? There are not enough stars in the sky. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Rock Album of All Time","review":"Really. This is the best. And I know what I'm talking about. The first three tracks are the big hits...but listen carefully...because the songs that follow are even better. EVERY song is a masterpiece.

I study the brain and how to optimize brain function. When my wife carried my daughter we were playing Joshua Tree incessantly in our apartment in Baltimore. My daughter is now 12 and a very accomplished singer and budding young actress. She has a very innate sense of rhythm that I wonder if is in-part due to this very early exposure. Unborn infants do respond to sounds. That has been proven. She even says the music on the album seems strangely soothing and \\"familiar\\" to her. No scientific proof I admit, but an interesting speculation at worst...All the best to Bono, Larry, Adam, and Edge!...Kenneth Giuffre MD, Author of \\"The Care and Feeding of Your Brain\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy, are these due for remastering!!","review":"I mean, great album, but it sounds truly muddy and awful in this 1990 disc. \\"One Tree Hill\\": one of the most underrated songs in the catalogue.

Every artist at that time wished they could have sounded like this and many bands afterwards have tried.The enhanced sound of the gold cd is noticeable, but I would have to say that just owning the \\"regular\\" cd in your collection would complete it.

A true masterpiece which people will talk about 100 years from now. In my opinion, their best work to date. If you were stranded in an island with 5 CDs, this would be one of 'em!

Like many modern recordings, everything sounds compressed as hell. In short, far too often, it sounds like I am listening with blankets thrown over my speakers; too many little nuances are either muffled or lost in the compressed mix. The original sounded fabulous, but I guess the idea of a big money grab by remastering a classic was way too much to resist, and I guessed it work with me since I bought it, but to others who have not bought it yet and are thinking about it:DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Stick with your copy of the original. Since I still own my original copy, I know I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Loudness War continues...","review":"Once again, a classic album falls victim to the idiotic modern trend of maxing everything out in the mix to create a muddled, lifeless sound.

Stick with the original album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the fuss all about.?","review":"I know there were a zillion copies of this album sold over the years, but I just can't get into it.

It isn't clear which one they're selling!I got the original one from the library and, allowing for, yes, offensive stereotypes it is a good book with a fast-moving plot. The new one seems to be an entirely different storyline, starting off with a libel suit.

This book helps the aspiring jazz musician to be well on their way to creating good music on their instrument. Mr. Ligon uses three types of linear harmonic outlines that creates and can develop a jazz solo. I think this book is good for a beginner just starting out in learning how to improvise. It is very sound in its knowledge and presentation of it. Mr. Ligon cites many excerpts from improvised solos of very great jazz musicians to support his outlines. And there are exercises to go with it. This is important stuff for all jazz musicians to know and, I believe, it is a book that should be in any college or university teaching jazz music.Books like this and many others prove that jazz music is NOT a mystery. Jazz is music that anyone can enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Didn't I Have This 35 Years Ago?","review":"I honestly believe that if I had had this book on my bookcase when I was cutting my teeth on chord-changes I would be a better musician today. It would have streamlined the process and allowed me time to practise other things.I learned to play changes the way most of us do: running scales & arpeggios over the progression and then 8th note, continuous lines, then finally improvising.A tried and true method, but long and labour intensive.This book presents a formula of sorts, and, without getting bogged down in theory, gets the job done quicker, just as thoroughly.If for you, like for me, making the changes is one of your biggest jazz challenges, then you will never regret buying this book. It has helped me enormously. And my students.Buying this book was one of my better decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much jet, not enough love.","review":"first of all, this product does not look like it does in the picture as it does in person.

It is very difficult to set up onto a shower head and once it is set up, the stream is so small and strong it's like a power washer! thus hurting more than pleasuring.Also, it has an option to switch from your regular shower head to the love jet so you don't have to take it off and put it back on every time you use it, which sounds like a good idea, but who wants that unsightly thing hanging from your shower head every day... what if your mother comes to visit!?This product is a good idea, that just wasn't well thought out, and definitely not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes are bland","review":"I own this book and the recipes are bland.

I didn't feel like the case was going to break or anything even though I was using it for about 30 min, going up and down on it many times.This case came with the padded dividers instead of the pick and pluck foam.

The production is stellar. The music is upbeat and yet very soothing. It's a ten. Across the board one of the best albums of the year in my opinion. I can't say enough. I have \\"liked\\" past Shins albums, however, this album is a little different. Overall, it seems the arrangement of the songs is more dynamic. It seemed to me on past Shins albums that some of the songs were a bit mundane and lacked real punch. Here the songwriting really stands out. This album is, in other words, \\"well crafted\\".

I was rather upset with myself for having took so long. Several really catchy songs that really leave you wanting more. Tracks 1, 4, and 11 are the most commercial, and also the best, in my opinion. When listening to them I am taken back to the moody pop/alternative bands of the 1980s, they especially sound like The Church, from Australia.

I resisted them largely because of the awful film Garden State. I finally bit on this cd and am glad I did. I now have several of their albums, and think this one is the most enjoyable. It's the most polished and varied. Critics of it may dislike the more mainstream pop sounds in it, but I think the Shins do well in that style. I find myself listening to songs from this album frequently many months later, and finally \\"get\\" why people like the Shins (though still have no idea why anyone likes Garden State)."},{"rating":"2","title":"dynamite third album","review":"At first listens, agreed with the critics it may not be their finest, but multiple listens starting to reveal pure gold, and if not their best, then simply a brilliant third album reflecting interesting evolution and great use of new sounds and styles. References to Smiths/Morissey on point, particularly the uncannily aping Australia (and a fine pop song too). English pop fiends will go nuts over Turn on Me, a brilliant Mersey-ish pop gem with an awesome Wedding Present-style guitar solo (and I never really found out exactly what this Merseybeat stuff is.) I hear the Cure in Spilt Needles. I'm noting younger fans seeming to go immediately for the more ethereal stuff of Sea Legs, Red Rabbits (great songs), while us older pop maniacs (Mercer is my age) still go straight to his astounding ability to craft the perfect pop melody. A great album with lots on there for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Progression?","review":"Not sure. I can't help but wonder if this record would have sounded much more similar to the first two if the approach to the post production had been more atmospheric. A terrific album, but it takes a little longer to grab hold because it doesn't have that moodiness to give it a ready-made vibe. Probably my least favorite of the three, but still head and shoulders above the average band. If you like these guys but don't already listen to Spoon, you should give them a listen as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a depature, but kept me listening","review":"I first heard about the shins back in 2002, so I was indoctrinated into the sounds of Oh Inverted World and Chutes Too Narrow. There remains echoes of the previous sound, Phantom Limb being the most obvious, but other songs are definitely a depature. Then, after a couple more listens straight through, I realized, hey, the Shins are still there, they have just grown and expanded! I continue to hope that their newfound success (the Seattle mainstream press has definitely noticed them) will only make them grow more, instead of make them stagnate, as too many other bands have done. Like Australia and Sealegs, though the album can hit you different ways, depending on your mood. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and satisfying","review":"Where to begin?

And to Amazon's credit, you can listen to 30 seconds of EVERY track on lots of albums. This gives you a great feel for a whole album before you plunk your money down, and you can do this all in your jammies.Anyway, that's how I discovered this album by The Shins. Actually, this is also how I discovered The Shins. And SpoonGimme Fiction. And The New PornographersTwin Cinema...It's forever refreshing to hear new music by contemporary groups that are making fun, tuneful pop, a la The Beatles and XTC.No painful \\"Downward Spiral\\" or pompous preaching here.

In real life, the frame (which is said to be wood, and may well be) looks like cheap plastic. In fact, I've seen cheap plastic that looked more like wood than this so-called 'solid wood' frame. On the web, the frame has subtle shadows of almost black along the scroll work which makes it look understated, dark and elegant. In person, the frame does have the scroll work but the entire thing is a flat brown color - no shading, no subtle black shadows. Stupidly, I tried to add the shading with an artist's pen.

Doesn't provide much teaching of what you need to know in certain sections (eg the math section doesn't cover some of the more complex rules of geometry etc that you need to answer the questions). Advice on how to take the test is pretty basic too. I would say this is a good book if you are reasonably confident that you will do well and it really is just a review book to remind you of a few things you may have forgotten; the answers are clear and well written, and so are helpful for 'brushing up' on what you may have forgotten, although at least one is wrong (or not fully right), and there are quite a few typos, but if you know your stuff this won't really through you off (beyond the fear that there could be mistakes on the GMAT itself!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I have just started preparing for GMAT.

And that explains why you see such a similarity between problems/questions in this book and the real GMAT ones.Having said that, just this book alone will not be sufficient for most of the people as there is a very less emphasis on explaining the basic concepts.

How will people be truly prepared, if that's the case?!The math review is helpful, but there is little to no advice when it comes to the sections regarding data sufficiency and sentence correction. One of the tips for sentence correction just tells you to read! Books, newspaper, whatever, because they generally use correct grammar. What?!

Althought it is not suitable for everyone taking the GMAT - as everyone is not on the same educational level, it does relate to the test at hand, it will help you increase your skill level - if you use it, and it will teach information regarding the test to help you score better.

Clearly the answer here is the value that reduces the denominator to zero since no value can be derived from an equation with a zero denominator, however, this book lists ZERO as the answer instead of 1!Now, this was a simple problem with the wrong answer in the back... I'm curious how many hard questions had wrong answers listed that I didn't catch.Don't get me wrong, the context provided before the sample example is VERY useful. A great review for everyone who hasn't had algebra in a couple of years, but if this is the OFFICIAL guide... am I going to need to answer incorrectly on the exam too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better","review":"This book will give you a lot of the questions you should be familiar with to take the GMAT but it does not give you a great background on how to get the knowledge you need. If you're planning on taking the GMAT, this book is definitely the one you want. But if you need help in the math area, you really ought to consider taking an algebra/geometry class at a community college or at least taking a review course. Of course this depends on the type of program you're trying to get in to.I used this book in addition to taking the Veritas ($1200 for 3 months) review course and checking out all the other GMAT books from the library. Overall, this is the best of the group and the one you should buy first but you'll probably want to use a few others in addition.By the way, my score was in the 89th Percentile, although my math was in the 53rd.

I've found 7 in 20 pages. Come on.The errors go beyond having \\"x2\\" instead of x^2. The errors go to basic concepts that if a trusting reader were to follow, the test-taker would be in trouble. Sometimes the diagrams don't match the word descriptions. In the review of coordinate geometry, the equations given and the graph representation are way off. If you don't have your high school notes handy or are a little more than rusty, this could hurt you.While I'm sure the rest of the book is helpful, I am giving this 1-star because it smacks of laziness and it's kind of insulting. It's troubling to think that these mistakes are acceptable for an organization that administers a major graduate admissions test.

Upon taking the GMAT for my PhD program, the test had nothing even remotely similar to what this book prepared me for. Certainly, there are basic math principles involved, but the overall format and question types in this book didn't at all resemble what I was tested over on the actual GMAT. Outside of that, I was amazed at the number of grammatical errors in the book, especially as it is an 11th edition.

Maybe that was a little exagerated but they are seriously bad live which means they really need work in the studio, thats where they get the videos and make it sound so good. These guys also stole riffs from Tool and Limp Bizkit. Im not sure which tracks, maybe 4 and 5. These guys are unorignal and all around horrible band. I can see little 10 year olds liking this but they simply sicken me. Avoid this CD if you enjoy original hard rock beats. These guys are too mainstream to cater to the hard rock fan.

It's pretty mediocre..","review":"I first heard of Papa Roach at a free Stone Temple Pilots gig in a San Diego parking lot, where a guy from a record label was passing out promo CDs. He said they were kind of like Korn, but much better. I went home, popped in the CD, and heard... Therapy, an Irish rock band that never sold well in the US (their best album Troublegum, is out of print here.). This is good, I don't like Korn anyway. But being an STP fan, I like more exciting, intelligent music, and I emphasize music instead of lyrics because too many people think in terms of that instead of the underlying musical base. Papa Roach is simply conventional and trendy.

Then, at a party, I heard \\"Between Angels and Insects\\" and I knew I wanted the CD. Let me tell you that I hadn't ever heard \\"Last Resort\\" before, and the CD is worth buying for that one song. It has been my favorite song for about 3 months now, and it never gets old.Here are the songs that really stand out:#1 Infest-4/5#2 Last Resort-100/5#3 Broken Home-4/5#4 Dead Cell-4/5#5 Between Angels and Insects-5/5#6 Blood Brothers-5/5#7 Revenge-4/5#9 Never Enough-4.5/5#10 Binge-3.5/5Thats 9/11 songs on this CD that are good!I'm not a fan of rap, but Papa Raoch is such an amazing band that I don't even notice. If you don't have this CD, then you absolutly have too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an insult to heavy metal","review":"This album is, as I have noted above, an insult to heavy metal. Papa Roach is your typical rap metal band. They are what I, and the rest of the legitimate metal community, refer to as posers. They act hardcore, but in reality are not hardcore at all. I would have to say the worst song on here is \\"Broken Home.\\" Like all (c)Rap metal songs it talks about how the persons life [is awful] and wahh wahh wahh. Another song on this album that [I don't like]... is \\"Last Resort.\\" What made everyone think it was so great, If I wanna hear some second rate little fairy whining about suicide I'll listen to those posers KoRn. In reference to agentboy's review: if this is the best CD you own, I pitty you. I wish people would stop buying ...[CD's] like Papa Roach and Korn so (c)Rap Metal would die out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Really Sucks........","review":"Papa Roach is really just part of the rock/rap/metal trend that has been popularized by such bands as Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Crazytown, and many others. This CD was really bad. Most of the songs were really bad and really disappointing. I bought the CD after I heard \\"Last Resort\\" on MTV, and I thought that the rest of the CD might be worth a try. Boy, I'm really glad that I bought this CD on sale.....Don't waste your time or your money on this cd...it's just like all those other trendy poser rock/rap bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"When I first heard of \\"Papa Roach\\" I thought they may be good. My friends said the song 'Last Resort' was stuck in their heads, so I decided to sample the song. What I heard was Limp Bizkit style music with guitar and rap, and singing (rapping) stuff like 'My family doesn't care about me, do you care if I cut myself and bleed and die? My life is depressing and it started when I lost my mother'. I pressed 'stop' immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"best new band so far","review":"where do you start with papa roach.the cd has all the energy and groove of all their rivals in the nu metal scene but it is the blending that makes this so special.the agression and modern influences are all present and correct but it is the addition ,on songs such as last resort, of the more classic metal influences that make this cd different.in theory blending riffs worthy of iron maiden with the often pop accessability of blink 182 and the intensity of any of the top rap core bands should not work.in practise it does.this is the best cd of 2000.miss it at your peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my last resort...","review":"Papa Roach's first major label CD INFEST is a great metal album with sweet rap by Mr. Dick.

In the song infest papa roach says \\"we are goin to infest\\". hopefully they get exterminated"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one original millesecond of music here...","review":"Very Simply...this band bites hard. Papa Roach is completely symptomatic of the lack of talent and basic music writing ability of this new bread of very forgetful nu-metal. How many bad spinoffs of Rage and Limp do we need. Rap-metal is gonna go the way of 80s metal, except that as an artform it wont be remembered in 20 years where 80s metal probably will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"So unbelievably repetitive...","review":"Oh dear - what a corny load of rubbish this is.Does every record have to sound the same?!Papa Roach make one record that (allegedly) takes the rock world by storm (\\"Last Resort\\") and then make every other record sound the same. My girlfriend liked this band at first, but even she admits to them being a one-trick pony...And the videos they make to go with the singles - can they get any more cornier, too?! God, if I see one more depressed teenager staring at the camera in a Papa Roach video, I'll probably end up kicking the tv in!A word of advice to the Papa Roachers:You can only go so far with \\"teen angst\\" and you've already gone way beyond that point within 3 singles... Try something new!I'll stick to the Bloodhound Gang - they're far more entertaining and a lot less depressing than this barrel of ****!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Alot better than I would have thought.","review":"Well first of all let me just say that all of you saying that Papa Roach is just another rap/rock band are wrong 1:they have been around for years on the indy circuit and 2: they have a sound quite their own. Now back to the album the best tracks are Last Resort, Broken Home, Dead Cell,Between angels and insects, Blood Brothers, Revenge, Never Enough, And Binge. I think the main problem with Papa Roach is that they went mainstream at the wrong time, and were clumped together with all of these other rap/rock bands. The overall structure of the album is very good,it easily has 8 strong tracks including 3 singles.Do yourself a favor and pick this up, if your still skeptical buy a used copy for 5 bucks. I did. My only complaint is that pretty much all of their old material is out-of-print and isn't available any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editing is really good!","review":"This CD is cool, I wish I had gotten the regular version, but Oh well. The music is awsome! The singing is great! The editing: the best I have ever heard. There is only 1 part in the whole CD where the editing cuts into the next word, but thats it! You hear the words before the curse and the words after the curse, but none of the swear itself, it's amazing! The music in this CD is the best, and track 2, Last Resort, is my current favorite song. There is nothing like it! Coby was a genius when he thought up that one. Also, tracks 1, 5 and 3 are really good, but the rest of the CD isn't that great. There are some other catchy songs, but I'll leave it to you to determine what songs you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, save your soul from Coby Dick.","review":"Please, don't listen to Papa Roach. Their lyrics really suck. They don't mean anything. Last resort doesn't have an English sentence anywhere in the song. Broken Home sounds like some kid whose blaming his \\"mommy\\" and \\"daddy\\" for not having a great enviroment in which he could live. Please, I beg of you, don't waste your money on this CD. Get \\"Make Yourself\\" by Incubus. That has meaningful lyrics. (Essentially, what I mean is that is doesn't contain lyrics like: \\"cut my arm bleeding.\\" Some people just shouldn't be lyricists. Coby Dick is one of them. This is the second time I have posted a review for this CD. Last time it didn't get posted. It's too bad there isn't free speech anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad they \\"ditched\\" the whole rap/NuMetal Thing","review":"When Papa Roach first hit the scene, I was standing in a bar, and one of their songs came on the radio. I asked my friend, what is this crap that they are playing, he replied, \\"Papa Roach\\" Ughh, I thought stinking NuMetal Rap/Rock whatever you wanna call it band. Then in 2002 I saw the video (dont ask me why I was watchin MTV) for \\"She loves me Not\\" and I was suprised that it was Papa Roach. I liked the song so much I picked up \\"lovehatetragedy\\" and even though not perfect, it was a nice for them to shift over to a more straight up rock vibe. As I got into them more, I decided to pick this up. It's still pretty bad, even though I like the band now, there are two or three good songs here, the most is just throw away garbage. The band has made much progress since this album. If you prefer them as a rock/rap act, this album is for you. If you like them just as a rock band, then you will probely think this is pretty mediocre like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band must be stopped...","review":"...I know there is nothing wrong with the Roach, they keep it real y'know, they make a lot of kids happy, etc. But they're really really bad. And maybe Coby Dick had an awful life, but the whining quality of his lyrics and vocals deprive you of any sympathy... unless, of course, you're feeling, like, down, man, cos life's a real bummer. This irrational dislike may be entirely due to 2 things; the horrific overplaying of \\"Last Resort\\" on [a] 7-tracks-over-and-over-again-all-day playlist. And Coby Dick's stupid dancing on the \\"Between Angels and Insects\\" video (shallow, me?!). Good things? Um, the last 20 seconds of Broken Home are great - no no don't buy the CD for that alone. God, please please don't. Papa Roach are marketed as a mix of metal, punk and rap. If you want metal, try Amen. Punk? The Clash. Rap? Don't know. Sorry. But just avoid this like a ferocious pitbull. Or, for that matter, an unferocious whinging guy called Coby Dick."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much smut that it's worse than \\"not for children's eyes\\"s","review":"Jeers to papa roach for being a major unoriginal and copying bunch of untalented failing rip-off artists. That's the only artist they are: ripoff artists. Everything they do has been done a zillion times before. In their music, only if you have an extremely open mind could you call it that, they lift parts of songs off of bands from the 70s 80s and 90s. Even the 40s 50s and 60s if they had metal-rap crap back then. For originality check out never-before-done ideas like nsync or lfo or 98 degrees. Ya, thats right 'cause I'm a total nerd.

The main riff to \\"last resort\\" is a rip off of a riff in \\"genghis khan\\" by iron maiden from the \\"killers\\" album and the chorus vocal melody for \\"between angels and insects\\" is a rip off of the lead guitar part on the intro to \\"prowler\\" from the self-titled maiden album"},{"rating":"2","title":"My \\"Infest\\" Review...","review":"First off, I will admit that I never heard one of the greatest bands in the world Papa Roach, until on TRL they debuted \\"Last Resort\\". That moment changed my views on music. The entire cd is not stop pure, hard music that you can tell the band members truly feel this way, and are not just using a persona.From Infest to Thrown Away, It was spectacular sound and rhymes. I can not wait to see Papa Roach's new video, Broken Home, I hope it is as good as Last Resort.As I have said before, if it makes me a mark for becoming a fan of a group, after I see it on tv and then get deeper into the culture, THEN SO BE IT!M-A-R-KHave A Nice LiFE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Infest","review":"What a great Album, flat out one of the best. If u like Rock and Hip Hop mixed in together you'll like this Album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well.......","review":"Where do i start ???Papa Roach are a quartet of lousy so called musicians,who have hit the pop charts by ripping off an iron maiden riff.The singer - an arrogant pompous prententious excuse for a front man who seems as political as an onion, with his bold statements of \\"F**K The Presidant\\", which by the way come from his rejection of a visit to the white house, due to him wearing jeans.He can't sing or shout, and frankly belongs in macdonalds...Maybe he should sing in tune next time..alternatively they could release a karaoke version of the album,which i expect wouldsell betterGuitarist - must have watched 'how to play rock guitar' before recording the album. Next time lets hope he takes some lessons.Bassist - struggles to keepup with the guitarist,need i say more??Drummer- need to get in shape so he can drum,he must get tired during the songs.If tasteless distortion, with simple drum beats and a drunk fool wailing over the top is your thing,this is for you.Highly recomended for a laugh"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is my last resort!","review":"There are not enough words to describe just how amazing this cd, let alone this band is. Coby dick, great singer, lyrics are great and band can jam. Every song is worth a listen. Stand out tracks are: broken home, thrown away, last resort, and most of all, between anagels and insects.

They are overshadowed, however, by the HUGELY impressive \\"Last Resort\\", the emotional \\"Broken Home\\", the heavy and relentless \\"Dead Cell\\", and the complex \\"Revenge\\" (You've gotta love the guitars in this one, folks.)Overall, This album is a big hit with me, except for the fact that some of the songs are obviously below what this artist is capable of performing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This is the best CD ever! Although a lot of people are starting to hate rap rock because of Limp Bizkit this brings it back to life. The guitar riffs are melodic and catchy and the lyrics are good. Coby Dick also can sing, unlike Fred Durst and his voice brings so much emotion to the songs. Also, this CD is a lot more than rap rock. It has a lot of punk/metal riffs in it and there is not one song that is just pure rap so it should satisfy mosh pit fans everywere. The best songs are \\"Deadcell,\\" \\"Between Angels And Insects,\\" \\"Blood Brothers,\\" \\"Binch,\\" \\"Broken Home\\" and maybe \\"Last Resort\\" although it's got old thanks to radio and MTV. Overall though this CD is very good and all the tracks are good the ones I metioned just appeal to me most.

This is not metal, distorted guitars does not make it metal, and metal never had rapping in it. The lyrics are some of the suckiest I have ever heard. You want good lyrics, listen to Metallica's Fade to Black. Real Metal is Slayer, Mercyful Fate, Iced Earth, Testament, Exodus, Celtic Frost, Judas Priest, Megadeth, Blind Guardian, Hammerfall, Old Metallica, old Sepultra, and a HELL OF A LOT MORE TALENTED STUFF.

Their lyrics are contrived, cliche, and stereotypical for this type of music, and their guitarist is enbarrasingly bad.

I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little sick of hearing the same old BS about some whiny kid. It's gotten so out of hand, it's hard to tell who's sincere and who's just faking to sell records.

Expecting at the very minimum a decent CD I was very disappointed. This CD offers nothing new to any fan of rap/metal. If this is what the record industry has to offer, shoot me. Songs 4 and 7 are decent but that is about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad music, this is what we called bad music","review":"One of the worst CD's existed.I have listened to hundreds of bands better than this PAPA ROACH (Stupidest band name).

Then, after the incredibly moronic second single, \\"Broken Home\\", a third single has appeared, \\"Between Angels and Insects\\" I believe is the title. This riff? Straight from Iron Maiden's \\"Prowler\\". I read in an interview that these guys claim they don't listen to Maiden, but listening to their sophmoric lyrics, I doubt that they were smart enough to come up with the classical progressions by themselves. I haven't even heard the whole CD, but I don't have to. These guys are totally unoriginal and way too trendy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good enough to be in your garbage, burn it","review":"Why is it when a genre is created tons of Xerox bands must surface? Think of how many bands were just bad carbon copies of the Beatles, the Clash, Nirvana, and now Faith No More/Rage Against the Machine/Korn. Don't get me wrong, I hate Korn too but I don't deny they were one of the forefathers of \\"rap-metal\\". I don't even know what to say about these guys because I can't believe their faults aren't obvious to everyone: they make a living ripping off the ideas presented by past artists, their songwriting is completely worthless (just take a look at Broken Home's lyrics, it sounds like something a 7th grader wrote), and none of them are particularly great musicians.

Therapy, an Irish rock band that never sold well in the US (their best CD, Troublegum, is out of print in the US but available from foreign sources. . . This is good, I don't like Korn anyway.

There's some rap, some rock, and even some reggae on this debut. P-Roach has also added a new idea of deeper lyrics (absent in Limp). True, there is some angst, but P-Roach doesn't go over the top with it. The guitars on this cd are remarkable. \\"Last Resort\\" is awesome. Other highlights are \\"broken home,\\" \\"binge\\",\\"revenge\\", and \\"between angels and insects.\\" The secret song is cool as well since it lightens up on the angst and kicks a more positive vibe. The only track I skip over is \\"dead cell\\" which is far below the consistency which pervades the rest of this album. In summation, P-roach is lyrically conscious rap-metal with heavy riffs for the masses. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: WOW!","review":"When I first listened to the song \\"infest\\" I was blown away by the heavy guitar riffs the explosive lyrics and the catchy hook line and chourus I thought it couldn't get any better than that.

The characters were a little flat. (Although, I haven't had much experience with One Piece...) So, I'm sure looking back on earlier works would give some insight.I was very much reminded on many video role playing games I've experienced. The characters moved from place to place...

Mudhoney did this better 15 years ago.","review":"The best song on this album is \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\" because it's the only thing that smacks of a new direction for the Queens while maintaining their originality and more importantly, their heavy sound. Other than that, it's really hard to figure out why these guys are picked to lead the parade of real modern hard (some call it \\"stoner') rock when there are MUCH better and more powerful bands out there (High on Fire and Electric Wizard come to mind) that write more memorable riffs than these guys do. Sorry, but this stuff doesn't even come CLOSE to any Kyuss album I've heard. It just sounds like second-rate Mudhoney/Green River re-hashes. Not exactly what I would pick to define a genre. Of course, with Interscope, Rolling Stone and Spin overdriving the hype machine for QOTSA, who can stop them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"QOTSA had better thank the gods of rock for LANEGAN","review":"This cd is bad folks. It has two bright spots, both are songs that have Mark Lanegan on vocals. Another song he sings on, not even he could save. I really enjoy the song Into the FADE, but as for the rest of the cd, the only cd I have bought that I liked less was MONSTER by REM. The only thing that made that worse, was the band is so good, that the expectations were higher for REM. Queens of the Stone Age have recruited Mark Lanegan as a contributing force, and I will buy the cd to hear his voice, but as big of a fan as I am, if it's as bad as RATED R, I will be back here and trying to keep you from buying it too! Buy his solo cds, and his CDs with Screaming Trees, but stay away from Rated R. Into the Fade is not worth the 12 dollars the cd will cost you.

Yeah everyone has heard \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" but admit it, that has to be one of the best song titles you've ever heard considering the subjects which it adresses. The rest of the album is a grab bag of straight forward rock (\\"Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\\"), psychadelic rock (\\"Better living through Chemistry\\", \\"Lightning Song\\"), punk fused rock (\\"Quick and to the Pointless\\") and classic Kyuss-esque stoner rock (\\"Monsters in the Parasol\\").Will not dissapoint those who enjoyed the first album and newbies alike.

They will open you up and let themselves inside. I can prove it.Infectious, unafraid to employ any conceivable sound, unwillingly in defiance of any musical construct, Queens of the Stone Age is a constantly evolving group of mutually respectful musicians who at the core are two of the most humble souls rock and roll has ever known.That being said, listen straight through to \\"R\\".

But, I'm left with mixed feelings about this album. Most of the album I just can't get enough of. It's a very good album. The band is very experimental in nature. That is one of the things that makes this band great. But, I think there's just a little too much of that on this album. Sure, it's interesting the first time but it quickly turns monotonous and irritating. Half of the album is excellent and definitely worth buying. That's not my major gripe though. If you are a stoner rock fan or a Kyuss fan, you may find a major flaw in the album - it doesn't rock. It has it's moments, but if you compare this to Kyuss, Unida, or the first QOTSA, it sounds like stoner pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Ok, i know that Kyuss is no more, and I don't really even expect Josh and Nick to carry on in that direction. And I did quite like the first QOTSA album. But I just don't understand what all the fuss is about this album. To me it sounds like lots of half-baked ideas and an overall pretty generic guitar rock album. I bought an advance promo of this used on the recommendations of reviews and hype, and sat back waiting to be blown away. I was not! I've given it a few listens now, and there are 3 or 4 good songs on it, but nothing memorable that would draw you in again and again.

It's just rock that rocks, just people having a good time and not taking themselves too seriously, this is very apparent on songs like Quick and To The Pointless. This album rocks in a unique way with great songs like In the Fade, Better Living Through Chemistry, Auto-Pilot and Lost Art of Keeping A Secret.

That doesn't make it bad, it is just different for Queens of the Stone Age. They still have their typical up and down faster riffs, and Josh Homme's great vocals, but otherwise, it recalls bands like Screaming Trees. This CD seems to be to me the missing link between grunge and stoner rock, because it is way faster than any stoner music I have ever heard, but way more fuzzy than any grunge I've heard. The drums are still very good as well as the guitars, and this CD proved Queens of the Stone Age as some of the most talented stoner rock I have ever listened to. My two favorite songs are Leg of Lamb and In the Fade.

The characters are fascinating and even though they're wicked, we still care about what happens to them and hold our breath to find out if they'll get away with murder. I've read a lot of murder mysteries but very few compare to the craftsmanship of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK LEAVES NOTHING TO THE IMAGINATION!!","review":"THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IVE READ THIS YEAR.CAIN REALLY DOES NO HOW TO HOOK AN AUDIENCE WITH HIS VERY VIVID IMAGINATION. THIS BOOK REALLY DID KEEP MY EYES GLUED AND I CANT WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE. SO I WOULD ADVISE THIS BOOK TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ABOVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential noir","review":"A drifter takes what he intends to be a temporary job at a roadside diner but is soon involved in an affair with the owner's wife, which leads to a plan to bump the husband off.James M. Cain had an engaging story and stripped his prose down to the essentials, producing one of the greatest sustained examples of narrative momentum I can recall. With scarcely any interior dialogue (despite the use of a first person narrator), he paints a penetrating psychological portrait of the conspirators as their relationship evolves from their initial attraction, through their attempts at murder, until their post-crime mutual mistrust and reconciliation. The end is shattering, completing Cain's bleak portrayal of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book That Launched a Genre","review":"This book is a quick read. The plot moved swiftly and there are enough twists and turns to keep anyone interested. The two main characters actually seem believable. Believable enough that some parts of the book actually made me uncomfortable. The ending was a surprise to top it all off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly entertaining","review":"When the young vagabond Frank Cambers lays his eye on a shapely ex-whore Cora Papadakis, reader knows that Nick Papadakis - Cora's old gullible Greek husband - is the odd one out. The only question is how? Little discrepancies arise along the way: Frank just wants Cora, running away together is his plan. But, Cora, the tricky Cora, wants Frank and the money of Nick Papadakis. The perfectly staged accident is carried through (on the second attempt), Papadakis is dead and the notorious couple gets away with murder. Only the postman rings twice, and when the pay time comes, Cora dies in a random car accident, and Frank ends up charged and sentenced with murder that he didn't commit, which is the murder of his darling Cora."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It's bad to be true\\"","review":"Can anyone really take this album seriously? There are so many wonderful singers, (and not just the dead ones) out there who can move you to laughter and tears with these same songs. Rod moves you to throw your CD player out the window and lock it behind you quickly. It's nice to see a revival of swing/standards music lately with new artists like Norah Jones etc on the scene, but Rod Stewart? I guess if he introduces these songs to a \\"new\\" audience, then that's great, but otherwise it's an embarressment to the genre. The less of these CDs in circulation, the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, no.","review":"If you like Rod Stewart because of this wretched record, you most likely have never heard him before. This is a terrible waste of a voice, which is ill-suited to the material. Horrid arrangements too. The simple fact he's selling this thing on TV as if it was a juicer or a boflex proves this a \\"Rod Needs Cash\\" grab. Avoid this. I mean, when Frank Sinatra cd's are still in print, why would anyone else be stupid enough to record this material?Rod, reform the Faces and rock. Thats why you were put on this earth.BTW, if you want to hear why some people love Rod (and they should) pick up the new complilation \\"Reason to Believe\\". Incredible stuff..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I feared","review":"When I first learned Stewart was going to record these tunes I cringed. Turn out, its was worse than I feared.Quite simply, Rod Stewart lacks the style and heart to make these songs his own. What made performers like Sinatra great was they truly emboldened the songs they sang with a depth and character. They made them their own. Rod Stewart is just a stand in who doesn't contribute anything new to the performance of this music and his signature raspy voice simply kills legendary hits like \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\".This album isn't about bringing a new vision to the performance of these classics. It's about Rod Stewart trying to milk one last cent out of a fading career. If you want to enjoy a modern restyling of great jazz and vocal favorites, pickup any CD from Diana Krall. She delivers soulful, extraordinary performances in the tradition of Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Nancy Wilson, Ertha Kitt, and Frank Sinatra. That's how it's supposed to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic....","review":"This CD is pathetic beyond words. Rod's \\"whiskey tinged\\" voice is not at all suited for this style of music.....you'll need several whiskies just to get through this CD a second time. The music accompanying Rod was much better than his singing. I actually felt embarrassed for him at some points. Just glad I borrowed it before I bought it. Now I can use the money I saved to buy a CD by a performer who knows how to sing these songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, but not the right voice for them!","review":"Being someone who grew up through rock, disco, R&B;, etc., I have always been madly in love with the great American standards from the past; however, these great songs require the kind of vocal prowess needed to truly interpret them (think of Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Jo Stafford, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Steve and Eydie, and so on).Unfortunately, there are singers who should stay far away from this material. The song selection and arrangements on this CD are fine, but Rod Stewart's somewhat raspy voice does not do these songs the kind of justice they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Rod - what fool talked you into making this album","review":"It is very sad when a person who does something quite well decides he can do everything well. This is the case with this album. Rod cannot sing these type of songs. The album should be destroyed before everyone learns the truth - he has a terrible voice. When he sang rock and roll songs it wasn't important. When he sings these old classics, it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod Stewart is not Sting!!!!","review":"After listening to a few tracks at a big chain bookstore I wanted to tell the staff to please take this garbage off the shelves. Rod Stewart is not Sting. He does not have the tone, phrasing, or style to pull off these beautiful standards. If you want to hear a pop icon singing great standards check out the soundtrack to \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" with Sting and Don Henley."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is something that will be forgotten very quickly -","review":"During the course of the eightees and nineties, Rod Stewart somehow became the entertainer/pop star who kept making a lot of money by pandering to baby boomers who are so gullible, they'll buy anything.This CD is nothing more than an attempt to revive a waning career. Since the members of his earlier audience are a lot less interested in hearing Stewart warble pop tunes, some A&R guy apparently decided the same audience could be milked in a different way.The only problem is, Stewart has no vocal presence. The only thing I'd be able to compare this CD to is if someone got hold of a digital copy of \\"Casablanca\\" and morphed Pauly Shore into Humphrey Bogart's persona.It's not that I don't like Pauly Shore; It's just that Pauly Shore standing in for Bogart would be too much of a stretch. Using Stewart to sing these standards is way too much of a stretch.Some things are better left alone. This CD is a very good example of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassing, pathetic grab at his demographic","review":"When I first saw this CD advertised, I thought it was a joke (one of the fake ads on SNL), but sadly it's a real release. The songs covered are true classics, and hold up on their own merit, no thanks to Stewart, whose interpretations are dull and uninspired.I understand that Rod's fans are inclined to gush unobjectively about whatever their favorite star releases, but I would encorage them to listen to the classic versions of these songs (Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peggy Lee and others) to hear them at their true best.Rod *really* strikes out with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-pirating mechanism","review":"They've finally done it! RIAA has developed an uncrackable anti-pirating technology and it is comprised of filling this disc with a cacophony of painful sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod should so more albums like this...","review":"It's a really refreshing CD, very enjoyable. I'd like to hear him do more like this, as he really has the voice for the Standards. Good stuff, and well worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod Stewart is a guy?!!","review":"I grew up in the forties, and heard a lot of big band music, but I never heard of Rod Stewart. So one day I hear \\"Just the way you look\\" on this commercial on TV. It sounds like Annette Palmer, this girl I used to know who liked to sing in one of the lounges I used to go to. But the wife tells me this is someone named Rod Stewart. I go to Best Buy and start looking through female vocalists. After an hour, I'm getting nowhere, so I ask the clerk about a female jazz singer by the name of 'Rod Stewart' and he takes me over to where all the CD's are. Rod Stewart turns out to be some guy! What do you know about that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because I couldn't give it zero stars....","review":"This CD is such utter garbage! Stewart does not have the voice to pull off these songs. I recently purchased a Frank Sinatra CD and Amazon recommended this trash. What an insult to Sinatra fans everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Send him to an Assisted Living Home","review":"This is what happens when senior citizen rock stars try and legitimize a fruitful but wasted life. Don't waste your money. Buy some Sinatra or Bennett albums and listen to real crooners. In The Great American Songbook Series Stewart sounds like he needs a quart of oil. Rod stick to what you know. You are no Michael Buble' or Peter Cincatti. Spare us, just go and enjoy your retirement. Or, better yet go back to when you used to wear spandex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"I'm a big American standard fan and a big Rod Stewart fan.

His flat voice just couldn't carry these rich and melodic songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven Help Us!","review":"One of the reviewers said \\"It's said that Stewart has been vocalizing many of these songs in private for years\\".

Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just too phoney","review":"If you want to hear these songs try real singers like Bennett and Sinatra. Come on!

He's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the Standards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Had to Be You....The Great American Songbook","review":"I love Rod Stewart's new CD - It Had to Be You. It is an absolutely dreamy mix of old songs made new by Rod Stewart who adds more than a little to their magic. Everyone that I have shared the CD with has loved it. This CD goes along with the Rod Stewart concert that is being shown often on A&E. I recommend this concert because it shows a classy Rod Stewart performing his magic. Tune in. You won't regret it. Whatever you do, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Pleasant Surprise!","review":"I've never been a fan of Rod Stewart, but when I heard a cut from this new album on the radio, I had to pick it up. As a huge fan of the \\"old standards\\" I wasn't sure how much damage Rod Stewart could do to them...what a nice surprise to find that Stewart does a wonderful job! The music is incredibly smooth and Stewart's gravelly voice counters that perfectly. It makes for interesting listening and a wonderfully romantic cd that you'll play again and again. My only complaint is with the choices of songs -- some of them sound too much alike, but that's more a criticism of the songwriters of that era as opposed to Stewart's handling of them. Stewart will never be Dean Martin or Sinatra with their effortless vocal style, but he's done a terrific job and I hope he chooses to do a follow-up to this cd.Overall this is a wonderful cd and has made me a fan of Stewart's...sort of!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"These songs sound like what a Billie Holiday fan would be forced to hear day after day in Hell. The arrangements are squarer than the worst of Mitch Miller. Rod can't swing to save his life or anyone else's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ! Great songs - terrible voice","review":"These are the greatest songs ever written. They're good arrangements, with a good (not great) orchestra behind him. But his voice is terrible - Rough, hoarse. When all is said and done, it's still Rod Stewart! What was anyone thinking? Why did anyone ever buy this CD?I wrote this in 2004. Since then I changed my mind. I love these CDs. I have all 4. I was mistaken. I apologize!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...Please","review":"Please do us a favor, Rod and never never attempt to sing a classic again.

God forbid! Somebody pass me earplugs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"Rod Stewart is a great rocker. The quality of his voice just can't carry these beautiful old ballads. The selection of songs is what attracted me to the CD in the first place. Unfortunately this sounds like your dad singing kareoke at a wedding after he's had a little too much champagne. He should have kept it for his personal home collection and I shouldn't have paid to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd was great!!!","review":"When I heard that Rod Stewart was singing old standards, I was not too interested, but yet had to buy it! Love Rod and love the old standards. As soon as I heard him singing, I HAD to dance! I just loved the way he did them in his own way. Made me think of the saying \\"dance like there is nobody watching\\", and that is exactly how I felt when I heard him sing these old standards. I'm still listening a lot, and when I hear him, I'm dancing too. I'm glad you made this cd, Rod. It's one of my favorites!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Had To Be You... who'd ruin the Great American songbook","review":"The Great American Songbook. Yeah, right.You mean, \\"The Great American Farcebook\\", Mr. Stewart? So after years of singing rock trash, you turn back to the great body of songs that were recorded by the great ones before you, and you think you can do just as good a job as they did? WRONG, Mr. Stewart. And so are those musical morons who exclaim, \\"awesome!\\", \\"smooth\\", \\"way to go\\".I say to you, stuff it! Geez, go back to school and finish your Music 101, you bunch of imbeciles! You are all beyond musical redemption.And so are you, Rod Stewart. To hell with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Commercial?","review":"Yes, You've heard Just The Way You Look a trillion times for a car company. But, IT IS GREAT. The title cut, oddly, is a little weak, but tempo or fancy voice coaching aside, Rod makes us old-timers happy on this one. Arturo Sandoval, while a great musician isn't even needed here. The orchestrations are classic 50's/60's LUSH. Take his voice out and you Jackie Gleason lovers are at home. Let me give all of you one more very timely tip. Recently deceased classic rocker Robert Palmer tops this CD with Rid'n High. These rockers grew up with us on this stuff, and thank God they have not done with this music, what our parent's idols like Percy faith and Montovani did with our music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dreamy Evening","review":"This CD mesmorises me. I am taken back to another time and place. This IS the only Rod Stewart CD I have ever bought. Itwas well worrth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Spin on Old Standards","review":"At first, I wasn't sure if I should buy it. Rod's raspy voice and \\"It Had to be You\\"? However, the selections on the new CD included some of my favorite classic love songs...so bought it I did. I am SO pleased that I made the investment. To hear Stewart's spin on the wonderful selection of old standards is absolutely refreshing. Truly comfortable, easy listening. Thanks for taking the chance, Rod."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Rod Stewart is simply the Best how can anyone say this isn't good or it isn't music. Rod has always had his own style which is what makes him so good and has kept him going for many years.He sings from the Heart and whats not to love about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shell of Rod","review":"Listening to this album made me think back to when I was a kid and the N.Y Mets were playing in the World Series against the Oakland A'S. The great Willie Mays, perhaps the greatest centerfielder in the history of the game, was out there dropping balls and even falling on his face while chasing a fly ball. My dad was crying! He had grown up watching Willie in his glory days doing it like no one else, he loved Mays so much and it broke his heart to see him struggle with only a whisp of his once great talents. As a longtime Rod Stewart fan I felt the same way listening to this album. It's like a Hall of Famer batting .200 and falling on his face on a routine fly ball when he used to be an MVP, batting champion, Gold Glove, slugger. It's time to fade away now, Rod, and let us exalt you for your glorious past. Don't be like Mike, out there blowing what used to be slam dunks."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we need right now","review":"I recently bought this album and I LOVE IT. We are living in difficult times and I often feel tense and worried. The first time I listened to it I realized that this was exactly the kind of album we NEED right now....I love Rod's husky, sincere, distinctive voice. I've seen him live in concert many years ago and he is just as great or even better now. Buy it...You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAAWN!","review":"The songs are great, but they don't suit Stewart's voice. Check out Steve Tyrell or Curt Stigers for quirky but excellent musical interpretations of all these wonderful standards. I give this cd 2 stars only because I credit Stewart for bringing great songs to the attention of some people who may have really never appreciated them before. Hopefully they'll love the music enough to go hunt down some artists whose styles are more suited to give these tunes their due."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must remember this...","review":"How many of you would prepare a choice cut of beef in a easy bakeoven? This is what has happened here with one of the worst albums ever. This guy has recorded GREAT songs,with his horrible out of tune voice. A Baboon could sound good singing these tunes, because these songs are CLASSICS. People that are raving over this are confusing the quality of the great material with the quality of Rod's renditions.Try Shirley Horn,Bennett,Ella,Billie or Frank for the talent,phrasing and interpetations these songs deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the real crooners..................","review":"I bought this with great expectations but there is so much to dislike about this album, sorry I paid for it, first the arrangement is not good, sounds like Rod is singing along with a Karaoke machine or worse the octogenarian quartet at the airport Hotel lounge, He should have gone with a big Orchestra for back up. His voice is o.k but not suited to this genre of music and he speeds through each song and it seems like his heart ain't into this type of music, no phrasing and romancing like Sinatra or Connick do. Hopefully,the follow ups to this CD will be an improvement or he should just go back to his old stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"good oldies, reborn","review":"As an old lady, I am so delighted to hear old songs anew.

His voice is too raspy and rough to do stuff like this. The man's got no soul into his music. Where's Stachmo or Ol' Blue Eyes when you need them the most? If you want a Great American Songbook, listen to them. Forget this album! You call this the Great American Songbook?

BEEGLE"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great cd!","review":"When I purchased this cd, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I wasn't at all disappointed. Rod's voice goes with these classic songs perfectly and the music is extremely soothing and relaxing, while at the same time managing to be both sad and cheery, evoking thoughts of a past era. In the inside of the cd cover, you'll read that Rod has used most of these songs to warm up his voice at concerts for years. He grew up with these songs and has a great love for them, and his passion shows through clearly. While I've always enjoyed Rod Stewart's music, I've never had more respect for his vocal talent than I do now after listing to this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRING BACK THE OLDIES AND LET ROD SING THEM","review":"IT HAD TO BE ROD.

All of the songs sound the same, they're all the same tempo, and his distinctive voice is simply unsuited to the genre and distracts from the simple beauty of the songs.

There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. Its time. This is great music if I am in an elevator on the way to the 40th floor. But to actually sit and listen too it, is nauseating. I am not a big Stewart fan and haven't listened to his stuff in years. When a friend tried to force this down my throat I almost barfed. His music is tired, his vocals are boring and quite frankly the album just sucks. You would have to be a real Stewart fan to like this CD... or in a coma. I can't wait until his greatest hits come out with repetitious boring elevator music he has produced in the last decade. Isn't that what old washed-up artists do when they have totally lost their creativity?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back! Go Back!","review":"I bought this CD at a local Target Store.

The man lost the edge to his voice before most of his new fans were even born, and has been sloffing from style to style since Reagan was President in search of something to call his own.Despite the wildly optimistic comments of some reviewers, Stewart does not do a particularly good rendition of a single song on this CD. To be perfectly blunt, IT HAD TO BE YOU sounds like nothing so much as your neighborhood party animal waxing sentimental on Karaoke night at the strip-mall pub.Nobody would like to see another great record from Rod Stewart more than I would but, much as I hate to say it, this (once again) is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's become of the Great American Songbook?","review":"This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness.

To say that this CD makes a mess of the \\"Great American Songbook\\" would be overly kind. Not that Rod ever could sing, but this album is mainly a rather ridiculous joke. Walk into any piano bar in the country, and you'll probably hear much better renditions of these timeless tunes, by some great local performers. Comparing this to Frank, Ella, Nat, Tony,etc. or even current performers like Diana Krall or Harry Connick is ridiculous, to say the least. The only elder statesman big name male pop/folk singer (who I've heard) who does any justice to these tunes is Willie Nelson, though there are a few aging ex-rocker ladies who do a good job...This album is the definitive proof that bad rock, and bad rock singers, simply cannot touch the greats of yesteryear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly THE Greatest American Artist Ever","review":"Has anyone been as innovative and intelligent about the music they produce then Rod Stewart throughout his career.

Gad, even the Beatles didn't try to emulate them...and they could sing anything...it just sounds too much like 'gotta make a buck' on anybody's back...and it's bad taste...ugh...too much of a ... muchness, tacky... Give me \\"Susie Arioli\\" and her swing band for oldies like these any day, she's got the right idea!......I don't think she could so ruin a beautiful classic that we all know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Had to Happen!","review":"Finally, a 60s rocker has grown up. Rod Stewart still has the best rock voice in the history of rock and roll (my personal bias) and he uses his own style to update these wonderful songs. He is very wise to go in this direction. He has proven he can grow up, still be sexy, and still give an exciting performance. Bravo, Rod! Keep this series of albums coming!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT STEWARTS BEST","review":"This cd is horrible. Rod Stewart should not be singing this type of song, he's more of a rocker not a romancer. He can't pull any of them off. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is He Trying To Be Manilow?","review":"After listening to this album, I have to wonder a couple of things. First of all, is Rod Stewart trying to be Barry Manilow on this CD and what was Clive Davis thinking? The songs on this CD are classic, but Stewart's voice just isn't right for these songs. In addition, some of the songs on this new Stewart CD were previously recorded by many other artists (including Barry Manilow on his {\\"Showstoppers\\" CD\\") while Manilow was with Arista. It seems that Mr. Davis is now trying to turn Mr. Stewart into J Records \\"Barry Manilow\\", especially by using Dave Koz (who appeared on Manilow's \\"Here At The Mayflower\\" CD) last year. Perhaps Mr. Davis needs some original ideas these days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinatra, Darin, Martin, must be spinning in their graves!","review":"Save your money! You want to hear 1930s and 40s tin pan alley classics sung by vocalists who truly possess fine voices, then purchase Sinatra, Darin, Bennett, Damone, Fitzgerald, or Peggy Lee. This Rooster with a voioce like sandpaper with strep throat should remain relegated to that one musical genre where such a less-than-medicre performer can still be considered a \\"star,-----simply arranged, unilaterally structered Rock and Roll\\" gibberish. That's the league he belongs in...along with other such stellar vocalists as Kim Carnes and Joe Cocker. But let's be serious, Ol Rooster Head had no business trying to foray into territory long-claimed by the brilliant vocal tonality, phrasing, and styles of such truly brilliant sigers like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitgerald, Bobby Darin, Mel Torme, Peggy Lee, and Matt Monro (just to name a few). The Rooster tried, but it was a futile attempt..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Songs, Wrong Voice!","review":"I admit I bought this album mostly out of curiousity because I am a big fan of the great standards on this album. However, I have enjoyed many of Rod Stewart's albums and songs over the years, and I wanted to hear how Rod sounded singing these songs. The songs on this album are classic songs written by some of America's best composers. However, I was very disappointed after listening to this CD because Rod's voice just doesn't compliment these songs at all! The songs on this CD demand a voice that is strong, clear and soothing. Unfortunately, Rod's coarse voice just doesn't work with these songs. My advice is don't waste your money or your time on this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave the crooning to Tony Bennett","review":"Rod Stewart goes Harry Connick Jr. on a set of big band standards from the 40's and 50's. What's next, Rod Stewart sings a tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber? An album of duets with Andrea Bocelli? A man once so self-conscious about his voice he stood with his back to the audience now feels compelled to lend his unique vocal stylings to the \\"Great American Songbook\\"? The world needs another version of \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" like Michael Jackson needs another nose job. Congratulations, Rod, you are officially irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one that started it all (unfortunately)","review":"I really wish there was a way to go back in time and convince Mr. Stewart not to make this album. Or perhaps to convince people not to buy it. Since this mutilation-of-standards CD came out and with its popularity, there has been an increasing trend of bad singers (like Rod) doing standards in an attempt to resurrect their careers. The whole thing is just sad... As for those who buy it, pick your slogan -- perhaps \\"there's a sucker born every minute?\\" or \\"there's no accounting for bad taste?\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Idea Wrong Artist","review":"The tragedy of this magnificent compliation is that it is so corrupted by Rod Stewart's poor voice....a man who sings like he's garggling aquarium rocks...he butchers some of America's finest song standards, and regretably, for many this will be their only exposure to this wonderful library of American romance through music.Each generation , it seems, pays homage to this genre...in fact many consider Willie Nelson's \\"Stardust\\" his finest effort musically..and while I find Nelson's nasally voice barely acceptable, it has a certain \\"out-on-the-range \\" masculine appeal.Stewart's raspy voice is God-awful. Its been 220+ years since we fought the British, but I think i am ready to pick up a sword and pick up where Washington left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those over 80 and deaf","review":"When you are past your prime and off the charts the way in is to go back and sing the tunes of yesteryear. Brian Ferry, Barry Manilow, George Michael, Diana Ross et al.... This was far and away the worst effort of the bunch. It is clear that Rod has difficulty with the vocal range needed and is off key throughout. Maybe this is rum boogie for 80 year olds, but I can't imagine they could favor these renditions over the classic versions they were raised on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod as Kate","review":"The older Rod gets the more he sounds like Kate Smith.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Dying artists of the 80's ballad era, in search of a few quick dollars and a last grasp at fame should not be allowed to damage beautiful old classics. Rod never wrote his own material, and now that his buddies in the 80's saw the end and threw in the towel- refusing to write new material he has had to \\"go jazz\\". Not only is it embarrassing to him, and those who actually think this over singing, raspy voice of the 80's has talent, but his \\"remake\\" of these songs slapped together with what sounds like a high school jazz band as a background prevents singers with actual talent (Michael Buble etc.) from recording these songs. Rod- the ballad eras over, do us all a favour,toss in the towel, you've managed to run away with enough money, give up. please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble gum jazz","review":"No doubt about it, Rod Stewart has a sexy voice. However it takes more than just a voice to make jazz, he lacks heart and soul on these songs made worse by the musical accompaniments that sound like they're taken straight off a karaoke track.A great selection of songs, but to hear how they're supposed to sound listen to Billie Holiday, Chet Baker, Anita O'Day, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had to be Rod!","review":"Only someone like Rod Stewart who was a fabulous rocker in his prime and now a smooth mellow interpreter of the sounds that cannot be replaced, can show how it is done in this wonderful C.D. No one will ever replace Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, Rosemary Clooney, the list goes on, but he gives a golly good go at it and it works!Somewhat reminiscent of Linda Ronstadt's old rendition of her C.D, \\"What's New.\\" Maybe we can look forward to Mick Jagger singing, \\"My Way,\\" in the not too distant future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not normally a fan of his, but this is GREAT","review":"I have NEVER been a fan of his---I don't even have any of his other CD's. I bought this one for the song selection, most of them favorites of mine though I'm \\"only\\" 50. These were songs from my parents' generation. Though not a smooth and conventional voice, his phrasing and evident respect for the beauty of these songs make them wonderful to listen to and brought tears to my eyes. I am going to buy a CD for my dad who is 80. I'm sure he will appreciate it though he will say, \\"Rod WHO?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Volume II instead","review":"I bought this CD after I bought As Time Goes By...The Great American Songbook: Volume II and I prefer Volume II because it is richer and smoother and actually GREAT.Personally I think It Had to Be You...

Rod Stewart's coarse voice just doesn't do anything for the classic American songs on this album. The kind of melodies on this CD need a soft, soothing voice to compliment them, which Rod Stewart definitely does not have!

It's sitting in front of me as I type this and I have no desire to ever play it again, that's how bad it is. On the other hand, his \\"As Time Goes By\\" disk is fabulous! But if I had bought \\"It Had to Be You\\" first it would have ended there. Unfortutely, I can't get my money back.

Finally reaching the nadir that began with \\"Do ya Think I'm Sexy\\", Stewart wheezes through this sickening dead-horse repertoire with all the soul and passion of a doorstop, accompanied by \\"Smooth jazz\\" hacks like Dave Koz (what, Kenny G was busy?). Anybody who likes to think they're listening to \\"sophisticated\\", \\"romantic\\" and \\"timeless\\" music is welcome to this dreck. I'll be listening to \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" with the volume cranked."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Bland Than Cream Potatoes","review":"If you're idea of excitement is staring at the floor, this album's for you. Put this CD on and you may find yourself so overwhelmed with adventure that you'll be staring at the walls as well.If you enjoy Rod Stewart's voice, or hard rock and roll, Rod's first four solo albums and his four with the Faces are pretty much essential.If you enjoy the kind of songs presented here, you'd be far better off listening to the greats, like Crosby, Sinatra, Cole, Holliday, Streisand , etc., etc., etc. Louis Armstrong may not have been a great singer, but he had more character in his little toe than this recording.Hey, most small town orchestras are more adventureous than this. Dentist office music is less obtrusive.Hope I'm not being too harsh, but I just can't find any reason whatsoever to recommend this album (or any of it's five follow-ups). Wait a minute - these albums are professionally performed, recorded, produced, and marketed. That's positive - right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was it you?","review":"This is possibly the worst cd in my collection. Rod Stewart does a terrible job of trying to sing these great standards. His register, tone, and phrasing are awful. He simply doesn't have the voice to sing these songs.

Well, I wish I had waited to review the cd on amazon before I purchased it. I find the whole thing a let down. One of the best things about Stewart has always been \\"his style\\", you always knew it was him from the first note. This cd has nothing to do with Stewart, except his voice projecting some lyrics. Too bad, the classics done \\"his way\\" sounded like a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me let you in on a little secret","review":"The only reason why Rod is doing this album is because he can't sing rock anymore because his throat surgery ruined his voice.

I was pulled in by Jack Campbell's realistic, non-religious viewpoint and I thought it would run throughout the book as they faced the awful dilemma of losing their son. But the religious preaching overwhelmed the story and Jack proved to be weak and simple-minded. The book is cheap propaganda. Stating that \\"all children need to go to church\\" is pathetic. The story is implausible and undeveloped, with a blatant implication that a god saved them all. And the scene in the movie trailer which caused me to buy the book never occurred.

I am not too impressed at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic issues involving adoption","review":"As a parent of an adopted child, I did think that the book was realistically presented. (Glad I didn't read this book when my son was small!) I love all of Karen Kingsbury's books. This one had some heavy issues, but many of her books do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't get the audio version!!!!","review":"I am listening to the audio version of Like Dandelion Dust and it's truly horrible.The narrator is atleast 100 and he's talking in multiple voices (voices for women, a five year old, and a tough guy just getting out of prison)!I tried to get over the narration, but the story line is weak. I mean the concept is interesting but I feel like the author is just not pulling it off.When I read the back cover of the disc I was really excited, but upon listening I am really bored...I don't have a problem with the Christianity, the book just isn't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"Another example of the excellent story lines Karen is capable of writing. While I do tend to think her writing can be a bit extra nice, I commend her for not using certain language just to be main stream. I read this book a few years back when it first came out and really connected with it more than some of her other books because it touched a nerve of the reality of adoption. It is true that situations can arise where a child is returned to the biological parents due to loop holes and errors - what a horrible experience for all parties. What I genuinely thought was unique about this storyline was that as a reader you end up rooting for both sets of parents in different ways. I am glad it ended the way it did but I was left a little sorry for the parents who he did not end up with because either way there was pain and suffering. I am excited that they made this book into a movie because I think it touches many people's hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Karen Kingsbury is one of my favorite authors. I have to admit that this story is a bit over the top.

I knew what was going to happen at the end of the book from the very beginning, which really ruined it for me. i think the author over-explained and repeated the characters thoughts too much as well. overall it was not a good book, i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"This was an interesting book. Karen Kingsbury writes sad things that happen to people but you want to finish her books to see what the outcome is. This book was made into a movie also.

On a whole this was a well written but sad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A philosophical and elaborate study of love","review":"Love by Stendhal is a classic, but the marvel about this book is that you get to experience the thoughts of this Nineteenth Century genius, whose love and obsession for a woman - Metilde - drives him to write this detailed and extremely insightful explanation about the passions and obsessions involved in romantic love. Without the assistance of Modern Psychology, Stendhal is able to explain with surprising precision and insight the feelings we experience when we are in love and the causes for such feelings.

Except for Patsy Montana and The Carter Family, most of the songs here are from obscure artists. The booklet is informative and goes over the history and struggle of these women, each artist in the disc is discussed. A lot of the songs featured on the cd are rare. The most creative group here is the DeZurik Sisters, who incorporated the sounds of their barn animals into their yodeling. They're not only original but they have great harmony. Another song that stood out was Louisiana Lou's bluesy With my Bango on my Knee Blues. The music here may have come from a long while ago but much of the material here is inventive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic material, excellent compilation","review":"This album turned me on to some fabulous folk and gospel singers I'd never heard before - like the Dezurik Sisters, whose synchronized chirps and yodels are pitch-perfect as well as entertaining, and the Chuck Wagon Gang, who seem to have taken a jar of happy pills before launching into \\"We Are Climbing.\\" Other favorites: the Aaron Sisters, Patsy Montana, and the sometimes frightening Roba Stanley. Other songs are hit-or-miss, but the 8 or 9 gems make this a disc worth having for any early country or bluegrass fan. Liner notes are excellent as well. -AR"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful way to start a classical collection","review":"These five discs are the first in a series of ten CDs that have what are considered to be the most famous and best known classical masterpieces of all times. It has most of those songs that everybody knows, and here and there a song that's familiar, but you didn't know who was the composer. It's a great collection to use to start your classical collection, because from these occasionally shortened clips you can move on to the \\"real deal\\" and discover lots of great music along the way.My only issue with this was that there was an entire disc devoted to Mozart, and thus other less-known composers, who are just as good, got no mention at all. Everyone knows who Mozart is, but few know of Telemann, Spohr, etc. I feel that there should have been a few more pieces by less known composers in place of an entire disc of Mozarts music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best set I've ever seen","review":"Buy it and you will get 10 hours of heaven's pleasure.

The film looks good in daylight scenes but any scenes set at night or with grey skies looks grainy and specs of dirt are evident throughout.It's great to have \\"Tess\\" on DVD, and the featurettes are a nice bonus since there is not a lot of information about the making of \\"Tess\\", but if this is supposed to be a \\"Special Edition\\" a two-disc set would have been more appopriate.Even the cover of the DVD makes Nastassja Kinski look anorexic.Talk about a DVD sacrificing quality for $$$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatal Beauty","review":"This film is about a young women who is used by her very poor family with delusions of grander to basicly gives then sells herself to a rich man and then marries a man who is in love with the idea of being inlove with her.

Overall, it was quite dull, and even plot elements from the book that kept my attention left me tired of the 3 hour film. I will admit that the movie followed the storyline of the book faithfully, however some key portions were left out. It could be said that reading Hardy's original novel is a prerequisite for viewing the film, because some of the movie could be quite confusing without knowledge of the book. One major redeeming quality that I noted was this: There was one important element that was retained between the book and the film, and that was how out-of-touch Victorian people seem to have been with their emotions. Many characters, Tess especially, seem quite passive, which, while it IS a period characteristic, works to dull the movie. In summation, this film is an accurate, but uninspiring rendition of a historically important piece of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloow","review":"I read and liked the novel, but the movie was so slow. I'm amazed it got the attention it did. Kinski is beautiful in it (and she still is. I just saw her today in person, filming a movie in Newport Beach. And she is a beauty), but the pace of this movie is slug-like. Read the novel instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinski is stunning though parts are missing","review":"The story of Tess is brought to life by Polanski who does an excellent job of creating Hardy's England. Kinski stands out as a vuluptous Tess. The story however leaves out some of the important details such as the death of Prince, the Durbeyfiled horse, which leads to Tess going to the home of the sham-D'Urbervilles. Though not quite up to par with the 1998 A&E version of the novel, Natasha Kinski remains as a striking image in the viewers mind well after the video is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a big lie","review":"On a scale of 1 to 5, I wanted to rate this book as zero. On page 423, this book says \\"Complete code can be found on the accompanying disk.\\" This is a big lie. The author only gives partial listing in the accompanying disk, which completely makes you beserk. You can never understanding this book, when the codes are given incomplete. He is like giving a final exam to his students, where he is requiring his students to complete his codes. It may be OK if he hides some of his codes, but he should not lie. It is this advertisement that he is providing the complete code that induced me to buy his book.Since he is holding some of the codes, the source codes provided in the disk will never build."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book delivers what the title says.","review":"In contrast with many other books on AI and neural networks this book DOES give the following:* limited amount of topics that are explained well.* good examples.* well written.* useful tips and guidelines.* source code.I my opinion this book does a good job of giving an excellent explanation of the selected topics.

It presents a cookbook of neural network recipes for the C++ programmer. I have used this book often, as I have developed a number of C++ and Java based Neural Network applications. The books is readable(at least as far as AI books go), it does not read like a mathematics text book, as many other AI books do.The chapters are logically broken into the major neural network tasks: classification (identifying something), autoassociation (identifying a pattern by returning the same pattern), Time-Series Prediction (this is commonly applied to predicting the stock market, etc), Function Approximation.As the author introduces these topics, various network architectures are discussed, such as feed-forward, multi-layer, backpropagation, and probalistic networks. Network optimization methods such as eluding local minima are tackled through the use of genetic algorism and simulated annealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real bad one","review":"This is the wrong book for any student or practioner of neural nets. It does not go into the theory of neural networks enough, though it does explain back-propagation methods (superficially though) it doesn't even provide any helpful codes beyond the very rudimentry, so whether you are looking for a sold foundation on NNs or a quick fix (read code), this book provides neither. For a solid foundation, I would recommend Simon Haykin's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic introduction to neural networks.","review":"The author does a great job with this book. He presents the complex material of neural networks in a very simple manner making it understandable to anyone interested in: (1) finding out more about neural networks, (2) using neural networks in any field, (3) applying neural networks in any field of research (ie: medicine, biology, finance, etc...). The author goes over everything that one needs to know about neural networks -- from the basics to how to implement your own network. Not only does he present the material in a concise manner, but he also gives C++ code to implement a neural network both in the book and on disk. Overall, I think that this is an excellent book to begin with if you are interested in neural networks and their applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong book to get for NN study!","review":"I do not recommend this book.

The second story, 'Dream Studs of Kama Loka', features a student, Ted, that voulunteers for a dream research experiment for the professor, Dr. Wunder. We are taken through several adventurous dreams in Kama Loka. This story is a bit more on the S&M side. If you enjoy erotic porn with a story, then this is not a bad short read.

Perhaps it's me, but when the body fluids you're describing are vomit and blood, I don't see how that's a turn on. In my opinion, John Preston's work might be preferable or for gay science fiction, perhaps consider Kyle Stone's The Initiation of PB 500 and it's sequel The Citadel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Local tutor thinks this is the BEST BOOK for SAT & Critical Thinking Skills","review":"Hello, I am a local tutor and think this is the best book for the SAT and I even use this for students trying to learn critical thinking skills.

Fishing. Battling \\"pirates\\". Do kids these days still do things like this? I'm especially curious about whether kids would like this book.All I know is that I did. Don't give up on it too soon.

He never talks down; he explains. He is a master of suspense and the carefully-crafted plot. The four Walker children and the Blackett twins meet in the English Lake District, and with imagination and the help of co-operative adults their world becomes a world of pirates, explorers and naturalists. The reader is left with the feeling that if only you had the right brothers and sisters and friends, he too could have the same experiences as those children, if only he looked hard enough. I first read S & A when I was nine years old. That was over 50 years ago, and I still reread it every few years. Some books never lose their magic.

It is difficult to attach the hoses, and they do not stay on. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money - difficult to use","review":"I bought this expensive vacuum and it is very diffucult to use. You must have the vacuum higher than the pond and the exhaust hose is too short. I don't want the exhaust water to drain back into the pond so the hose could be longer. It would be nice to have a standard hose size so you could possibley extend it by adding your shop vac hose to it but it does not fit.

I only have memory stick and smartmedia media so I can't vouch for the other media types, but the adapter was able to read them just fine. My Windows 2000 laptop didn't require any new drivers and the adapter doesn't come with any. Having one card to read both media I use will be very convenient and it costs basically the same as a single media type adapter. The only tradeoff is that my smartmedia only adapter comes with an eject button and the 4 in 1 doesn't - you have to eject the adapter to be able to remove the media, but given the different form factor media it accepts, an eject button would probably have been a minor miracle of engineering.

Also, it's not very well balanced: it's quite easy to tip over forward... my dog can bump into it and knock it down.It's ok, but definitely NOT worth the $100 I paid for it.

He has forgotten that this was a play written during the Peloponnesian Wars, and was a direct response to that conflict. If he had not, then why the references to Hamlet and other plays?

Songs such as Woodgrain And Leather Wit A Hole has annoying skits at the beginning that you do not want to listen to. Listening to Nelly trying to rap is bad enought let alone hearing him talking.One good song is \\"She Dont Know My Name\\" largely because Snoop Dogg saved the song from another \\"Pimp Juice\\".

On his newly released album, Suit, Nelly combines his St. Louie hip hop slang with many different genres including soul in \\"Nobody Knows,\\" feturing Anthony Hamilton, one of the best up-and-coming soul artists today, pop, and even a little country in \\"Over and Over,\\" featuring Tim McGraw. This combination has really made Suit a very enjoyable listen. Suit shows a much softer side of Nelly with its more compelling lyrics and softer beats. For those of you looking for a good alternative to the often-sickening hard-core rap, you should give Suit a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keiki Grow Plus is not working.","review":"I bought this product and started to apply the product on all of my orchids node on 01/26.

So this product doesn't work as it said, I disappointed with how much I paid for this product. Also, incase someone doesn't know how much is 3ml, you should find out first before order it.

The book provides a permanent record of a vanished town, and it is an important foundation for contemporary interest in rural black communities. The book includes interesting discussions of ways to use oral sources when doing historical research, and the author provides useful ways to ascertain the validity and usefulness of these types of resources. His methodology includes ways to assess the historical accuracy of various stories, and the book also demonstrates how to interpret less verifiable stories to gain an understanding of social attitudes and cultural values that emerge in storytelling traditions. This is an especially interesting resource for discovering ways to integrate oral history with folklore study.

Creed was enough of a joke already. Creed stole their song titles from Pearl Jam songs, and the band had to be a**es to everyone and say that they were better than Pearl Jam. Give me a break. Pearl Jam was a band that actually cared about music and had variety in each of their albums. Creed just copied off Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots just like every other corporate radio rock band.This album is nothing other than a joke. Stapp's voice sounds worse than before, and it's pretty much a more poppier Creed. I seriously hope that this is just a one-time run for Stapp. He is NOT a talented vocalist. He sounds like he has to clear his throat while singing.If you want GOOD mainstream music, go for System of a Down. They actually use variety in their music. Queens of the Stone Age is another band that actually rocks and doesn't necessarily care about popularity.

I enjoyed the passionate lyrics as well as the music. I assumed that most of the talent in the group came from Scott Stapp. I just listened to the Alter Bridge CD and could hear the distinctive guitar riffs and the beats that were so much of what I loved about Creed.

I would love to see those stellar music collections they must have. But then again, the sounds they are used to hearing are the cries and whales of the farm animals as they are getting robbed of their innocence. This music and that riduculous poser rock pose are about as unique as an A--hole. And he is an A hole if he thinks he can insult us with this garbage. I formerly apologize to Alter Bridge for saying they made the worst album of all time, because I hadn't heard this trash yet. I can't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merry Christmas, hope you like crap!","review":"This record is total GARBAGE. Tremonti's influence and riffs are obviously not there, so people who say it's another Creed record are off a bit. Lyrically, it IS Creed, for obvious reasons, but musically, it's crap. CRAP. The song \\"Fight Song\\" is a prime example of just how diluted and generic a band Stapp 'hired' to play on the record. Well, ALL of the songs seem to be the same way, but this one in particular makes me want to dissect my ear drums with a rusty ice pick.Stapp can't sing any more. Even though Stapp is the antithesis of congeniality, he - at one time - could really belt out some songs. Not anymore. His voice sounds horrible, and if he tried to rumble out his R's anymore I fear he may cough up his pancreas. He needs to stay out of the studio and get into another profession, like writing children's poetry or something, I'm sure he'd be good at that.Bottom line, don't buy this record. Save your money and buy some new underwear or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album clears up the past!","review":"After just a few listenings of this CD, it becomes abundantly clear that Scott Stapp's contribution to Creed was much less than he would have had us believe. This album is shallow, OBVIOUS, and contrived. His \\"lyrics\\" are very simple and predictable, and the overall tone of the album is really a poorly executed clone of earlier Creed. What this album lacks is originality and imagination....well......that and a SONGWRITER.Oddly enough, I read an interview today with Scott Stapp saying that he WAS basically the whole Creed sound. I couldn't disagree more.......although the throaty voice that bores you to tears is here in this new effort, the songwiriting here is just very immature.. He said in the interview that similar to when Sting left the Police......HIS new sound would remain what Creed was.......Stapp should NEVER put himself in the same league with Sting......nor should he presume he has a clue as to how to write a hit song."},{"rating":"2","title":"It left me speechless","review":"I used to listen to Creed and always likes Scott Stapp because whenever something knocks him down he dusts himself off and gets right back up. There is no doubt that he has had some rough times especially with the breakup of Creed. But not only did he get through that, he made some inspiring music that could help other people. This whole cd is beautiful, the song \\"broken\\" is my favorite because it relates to things i've personally gone through. Scott, if you ever read this stuff, I just want to say thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great Disc","review":"This is as good or better than Creed. If you like Creed get this one.

The leather pants are still there, and so is the wannabe Eddie Vedder baritone and the Jesus Christ poses as well.

After all...what do God and Creed's good songs have in common? NEITHER ONE EXIST!!! Listen up Scott, you'd be better off recording an audio of you being strangled to death. I know I'd buy that. If your a smart person you won't buy this crap. Hell, if your a smart person, you won't even THINK about buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scott Stapp was not creed !","review":"I used to love Creed and used to defend Scott against almost everybody that was around me until I realized that he is a real jerk. I remembered that Scott said that he didn't want to play heavy rock and that it was Tremonti's thing but I wonder why he is using so much the style that Mark created for Creed. Anyway theres only three or four songs worth listening in this record, most of the other stuff is boring or too slow. Broken is one of the worst songs I ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"EDDIE VEDDER'S DEBUT ALBUM","review":"Eddie Vedder's first album, 'The Great Divide' is pretty bad.. he sounds like a wannabe of his former self when he made the first few Pearl Jam albumsAfter Pearl Jam broke up a couple years ago, the members went on to form 'Alter Bridge', which is a terrible band, then Eddie Vedder went solo.. unfourtantely this is one of the worst albums of the year.. the singing is a joke & sounds completely forced & phony, & the lyrics are horrible.. nothing compared to how great Eddies lyrics were in Pearl JamI hope Pearl Jam get back together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring like those creed Albums","review":"a Hair Band superstar is putting out a solo album oh boy! scott Stapp from the get go followed the Peal Jam,Stone Temple Pilot formula to a letter \\"T\\". it worked because the albums sold a Bunch of records meanwhile the material was rather very 3rd tierish. pretty much a Lucky Bar band act that struck with the right sound that was on radio&got over with it.as a solo Artist Scott Stapp doesn't offer much whatsoever to my ears.this album sounds like Creed reject tracks on a whole which ain't saying much.scott stapp&Creed belong to the 80's Hair bands big time with the 90's formula for Radio play."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"I should be able to put 0 stars . I have heard songs off this album I must say Scott is right when her says it sounds just like creed. This album is awful like all the creed material. I just read an interview where he compared his leaving Creed to when Sting left the police. Come On! That was the problem Creed had in the first place they are horrible but believe themselves to be some kind of great artists. This guy is the farthest thing from an original artist I have seen since Milli Vanilli. This record is awful!!! Scoot Stapp is awful and anyone who bought a creed album should buy this because they have absolutely no sense of being a creative artist. He will probably be played on Clear Channel radio stations alot which is appropriate since they are awful too. I would write more but that would mean I care. I don't I have hated this guy from the beginning and for him to compare himself to Sting just went over the line. I mean creed was nothing compared to the artistry of the police."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I loved Creed so much that I got this CD with much anitcipation. It was a let down.

He needs to get the boys back together."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I just watched Scott on SPKE TV and he was completely drunk and probably set a new record for being bleeped for obscenities. This guy is absolutely not a Christian and you should know this before you buy this CD. He is a non-christian who is trying to cash into Christian dollars by faking Christian sounding messages into a heathen lifestyle.

I like Alter Bridge but never got into them like I did Creed.Wasn't expecting too much from Scott Stapp, I didn't think he would do too well away from Tremontti. But when I heard the last 60 seconds of the single \\"The Great Divide\\" on the radio, I was intrigued. It sure sounded good.So I went ahead and bought it and man was I shocked. What a solid debut album. The lyrics are incredible - the lyrics are what is missing from Alter Bridge's stuff. Tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and my favorites. Track 5 is probably the only one I could do without, and probably why I won't give the album a 5. Great vocals - Stapp still has it. Great music, I am stunned how good the band is.Stapp stands on his own and I hope this band can stick together for at least a couple more albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"I am very pleased with this transaction... good deal, fast delivery, quality product...

Why shouldn't they be? They had some of the most prolific and hysterically-funny lines ever written for a TV series. It is also a cast that falls into the \\"ensemble genious\\" category. They play off each other like an active ball in a pinball machine and score every single time. Even the characters designed for an audience to hate...you just can't do it.

As a general assessory kit, this was fine but this was listed as a complete care and cleaning kit which it is DEFINITELY not. There is one tiny half pipe cleaner and a brush (2 in 1) and that's the extent. I needed something to clean between the keys and joints and this is definitely, definitely not it. However, it does come with a bunch of cloths and leather like pieces for buffing. It does not include a user pamphlet as stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What it Should","review":"I'm happy with the product. It does what it should, and the price was right.Thanks for making a product that contains everything I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Decent flute care kit. The items included are pretty nice, but as a previous review pointed out, you never use cork grease on a flute, so I don't know why this is included, I plan to take it out and replace it with chapstick or something useful.

It is three books: The Silent Blade, The Spine of the World and Sea of Swords. This duplicates 3 of the books in the Paths of Darkness gift set which I already have.If you have enjoyed Drizzt Dourden, this continues the story from Passage to Dawn. This series would be confusing if the reader has not read the earlier stories. Wulfgar is back to the material plane but emotionally scared from his time as Errtu's prisoner. The other friends are on a quest to permanently destroy the Chrenshinibon crystal. This moves the life story along of Drizzt, his friends, and the Forgotten Realms fantasy created by Robert Salvatore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Actually thought I ordered the paperback version.

Final book in the epic story of Drizzt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Amazing Book","review":"This is just another great book, in a long line of the great Forgotten Realms series. I am fairly new to the whole Drizzt series, and I've been reading it in order. I am totally entwined with everything about it!!

The model is no longer being made by Breville.","review":"It came with a huge crack in the pulp container. Breville sent a new one and all was well. Now the part where the spiget has the juice flow out broke so it won't work. Breville said they no longer make this model, there no warranty, so it's useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wo!nderful product","review":"For anyone serious in juicing, Breville is a great product with very fair pricing. The major strengths of this product are 1) the power of the machine (it can juice anything without problem) and 2) the ease in cleaning.

I strongly recommend this brand for those serious in improving their health through juicing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-On Service Ideas","review":"This book was not quite what I was looking/hoping for, however; it does have some great ideas to be used with children older than I work with.

It's divided into three sections. The first is a sort of guide to raw. I really liked this section because it had an in depth explanation of how to sprout things. There was also a good dehydration chart and a wonderful explanation of the various appliances needed. I didn't like the juicing overkill...but that's personal. That said, all of this info can be found on the web. The second part is full of recipes. They are, for the most part, awful. The ingredient lists are a mile long and the prep and lead times are beyond hellish. The last part wasn't needed. Anyone with access to the internet could find this info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, usable recipes","review":"There are some great, usable recipes. I serve them to my family and they love them.

Connoseurs of that which is Hentai will be gratified to know that after watching this, its be unlikely that they will be able to remember more than sixty minutes--in the full half-hour episode--in which the main characters *weren't* involved in something erotic. --The main character, you see, is a girl who's experiencing an unbelievable amount of difficulty reaching climax... ..and the stubborn refusal of her and her helper to give up on finding a cure isn't just hilarious.. --it's very gratifying. This film is practically devoid of scenes of violence, drama or scenes appropriate for non-ecchi mundanes. This is a good thing, however, and the concentration on just humor and erotica makes it one of the absolute best films in its category. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a keeper!

Brett is the ultimate hero - caring, sensitive and most of all devoted.I found this book sometimes difficult to read just because of the emotions that it evoked in me but I could not wait to get to the end to find out what happened.I will recommend this to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read to take on holiday","review":"Not the most exciting book in the world but I enjoyed it all the same, and Sharon Sala is a great prose writer. Some of her characters are little too sugary at times but mostly they are believable.The plot centres around Tory, real name Victoria who has been shunted from foster home to foster home since the disappearance of her mother when she was barely seven years old.As hard as she tried Tory is unable to push the past out of her mind and even with a wonderful lover in the form of ruggedly handsome Brett she is emotionally stunted, and distant with a man she so obviously loves.Forced to confront the past before it tears her apart, Tory must be strong as she searches for the truth about her mother's disappearance, for the past is a dangerous country and some secrets are easier to cope with than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've ever read.","review":"This is an exceptional book. I've read it a half a dozen times since I bought it and loaned it to friends. Everyone has loved it! The love story is poignant and the charactors are spectacular! You are on an emotional roller coaster when you read this book, and you'll enjoy every minute of it. Sharon Sala (Dinah McCall) just gets better and better with every book. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from her other books","review":"I love Sharon Sala, she is one of my favorite authors. This book is a bit different from most of her books because the main couple have already been in a relationship for 4 years. They live together and are very much in love, but Tori tends to take off at random and never tells Brett where she is or how long she will be gone. This book deals with Tori and Brett figuring out their relationship, finding out about her childhood (she does not remember anything before the second grade and she grew up in foster homes) and her coming to peace with who she is, what happened to her, and feeling secure and safe in Brett's love for her. The thing I loved best about this book is that Brett REALLY loves her. He is frustrated with her random disappearances, but when Tori starts to have nightmares prompted by a photo she took, he is always there for her. He helps her search out her past and confront what happened to her, constantly letting her know how much he loves her."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"I love how Sharon Sala pulls you into the story.

This chick takes the cake, licks the plate and throws it at you. Not one lyric she has \\"spit\\" has shown any intelligence, any class, or respect for herself, her children, or her audience. Okay, I'll make it plain. Khia: Thug Misses = Garbage. It's funny how habitual offenders (.....Check how many times this Thug Miss got bagged by the fuzz!) feel like they need to explain their side of the story. She'll die for her ..... Yeah?

It's this kind of garbage that truly embeds the stereotypes that black women are brainless sexual nymphomaniacs which is not true at all. Khia is a disgrace to women all over the country and with such hateful, sexually offensive sounds which is basically what this CD is. The reason why I call this sound is because what is on this CD is NOT music. Khia should just go away because even when I was drunk once I couldn't bare to listen to this piece of material.

It is soft and super comfy. I agree with others that in needs a full ziper. Even a bottom zipper would help when hanging this out to dry. It's made in China. I had to tie the rolled bag up with 2 strong bungee cords to get it in the bag. It takes time. Maybe it will be less fluffy after washing. It is too big for my household front load washer.

Bullets or Ballots gets a 7 out of 10, Each Dawn I Die gets a 6 along with G Men and A Slight Case of Murder. San Quentin was good except the ending was the down fall. I only give it a 4, a one time watching flick. However, City for Conquest gets no less than a 10. This movie alone is worth the pack, with Ann Sheridan and Cagney as the big names. It plays kind of like a Roman play with a homeless man playing a narrator that is in the scene. Cagney will leave speechless, and I who don't get choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Shindler list get that feeling with this. Not that its sadder, but its understable and pure. Its slow at times, but it holds together well. This is the movie I thought the least of when I bought and the one I loved the most.

I was excited about a book that explores this racial mix. After reading this book I was really insulted. The female character is a stereotype even though she is a doctor. She has attitude for days and explodes for no reason. The more insulting part is that the character is only seen as beautiful because of her white heritage. This is expected coming from a white author. It is impossible for a non black author to write about a Black women's experiences and feeling (fiction and non) because they can and will never understand.Don't waste your time and money on this book or the other one she wrote (Ebony Eyes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and candid","review":"With \\"From Trials To Triumph,\\" Connie Cenac has emerged as a fresh voice for dealing with the pains of life, whether caused by others or ourselves. Most authors are not as open about their own foibles and the way others have injured them as Cenac is. At first, her candor is a bit startling--but soon I realized that she could not help others without being completely truthful about how she brought herself out of trouble and into a life that basks in the love of Christ. Cenac addresses the mistakes and sins that can either tear us down or grow us closer to God, as we realize how much we need Him, how far we fall from His glory, and how sufficient His grace is to restore us and make us better people. I highly recommend this book, for its honesty and the many practical suggestions Cenac offers to help us do just what the title says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Kindle version","review":"I have no problem with the content with this book but the Kindle version is horrible.

Crampton can never be accused of hypocrosy, as this book takes brevity to an extreme. Concepts are intimated, but go undeveloped. Themes are introduced, repeatedly referred to, but never fully explained. Another reviewer stated the book fails to sufficiently elaborate on the Macedonian question, and I couldn't agree more.My background is in Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, etc). As a speaker of Bulgarian, I was very excited to read this book and to learn more about the country. I ended up being very disappointed because the author's text is too concise. It ends up being vague. The book leaves unanswered as many questions as it answers.Of all the history books I have read, this is the easily the least satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich History of Bulgaria Covered Brilliantly","review":"It is not easy to write a concise history of a nation that is over 1300 years old but this account takes that time frame and boils it into an easy to follow account of the Bulgarians. One of the most important, yet unheralded, countries in Europe is dealt with in a manner that would make the Bulgarians proud of its history. Although embroiled in wars, external occupations and internal strife for much of its history; a rich and diverse cultural heritage has remained intact throughout Bulgaria. This history of Bulgaria should be read by any student of European history as it tends to unlock the rich vault of Eastern European history and its influence throughout the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid review of Bulgarian history","review":"This book provides a nice review of Bulgarian history, though at times it gets bogged down in a sea of place and people names, losing, for me the reader, the main thesis. I would like to have seen more time spent on ancient history, which was skimmed over quickly. And sadly, this book was written about ten years ago, just when change was rapidly occurring in Bulgaria. On the other hand, the information presented is generally quite accessible and presented in a balanced fashion focusing on important topics.Steven Mlodinow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Bought this because I also bought a non-stick sauté pan and didn't want to scratch up the non-stick coating. For some reason I expected the Nylon turner to not only not scratch the pan, but also be able to separate and flip eggs. Wrong. Everything -- especially eggs -- sticks to this turner. The edges are naturally a tad dull so they won't scratch, but my bamboo turner isn't sharp, either, and I can separate one easy-over egg from another with it. By the time I slither the eggs away from each other with this it's too gummed up to get it under the eggs to flip them. Cleaning it's no piece of cake either -- the eggs stick to it so badly I have to scrape them off with another turner. Truly the most useless piece of kitchenware I've purchased in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far very pleased !!","review":"After suffering with heart palpitations every day for almost a month (brought on by stress and anxiety), I began to research online and came across this product after reading about the benefits of magnesium.

After only 24 hours, my heart palpitations were cut in half ! After 48 hours, I am having a few here and there. Hopefully soon they will be completely gone.

This is the first magnesium supplementation I have tried so I can't compare to other forms. When I have trouble falling asleep, having bowel movements(tight bowels/constipation), or feeling more anxious these provide some relief within an hour or so. I typically take 3 at a time and find that I can poop the next day and I can turn my brain off easier at night.Unfortunately they work so good that I ran out and now I am getting my magnesium from food sources. If you absolutely need magnesium now, then these work great. I would suggest eating foods like almonds and dark leafy greens for your magnesium, however, because it really does work better over the long term and magnesium is not the only important nutrient of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"PANIC ATTACKS GONE AWAY!","review":"I began taking this product 3 weeks ago for Panic Attacks and Anxiety.

As their Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, is being burned to death, he curses the king and his future generations, thus providing the title for this series of 6 books (of which this is the first) 'The Accursed Kings'.The other main incident that features in this book is the adultery of 2 of his daughters-in-law (and the connivance of the third).

I don't listen to this one as much. The album tends to shy away from the mostly dance pop of the other one for the show's characters being in college. But the ballads are surprisingly bland and there's not a continuous balance on the album when you hear it. So I suggest you pass on this one and stick with the '92 album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"Like the plot segment of the prime time soap this soundtrack is named after, the material contained on this CD is simply lackluster and an attempt to cash in on the earlier (more successful) soundtrack for the series High School beginings.The selections do not even reflect artists that would be popular on a major metropolitan college campus (indie artists), and the sound eventually blends together in an inchoherent but iritating mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works For Me!","review":"I needed a power stripe behind our small bookcase, and this one works fine. I liked its closed plug hole feature... not sure what it is really called, but where the blades of a plug would go into the unit, it has a dust cover built inside it. I thought that was a good feature since many times a stripe will lay on the floor with the sockets exposed to dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is an excellent book with the real GMAT questions.

It contains questions with explanations. The questions is very close to the real GMAT test. However....if you have OG 10 aor Official Guide Review 11 ed. you don't need this book, because the content is the same (this book is not as complete as the OG 10 or 11). If you want to learn verbal from basic, this book contain only minimum instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same os OG10","review":"The book is good and provides additional actual exam questions.

While the questions in the Quantitative Review book are somewhat easier than in the Official Guide, that isn't the case (to the same degree, anyway) with the verbal, so I can recommend this to just about anybody.Further, the difference between authentic questions and inauthentic ones (i.e., those generated by writers at test-prep companies) is much greater in verbal material than in math. I should know: I've written hundreds of practice verbal questions, and matching the voice, structure, and objectives of the original is a daunting task. Some inauthentic practice materials are better than others, but you should take advantage of all the \\"real\\" questions that the testmaker has made available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not All New, But Not Bad Either","review":"Contrary to the information at some MBA chat sites, the questions in the two supplements, The Official Guide for GMAT Verbal Review and The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review, and the main volume, The Official Guide for GMAT Review, are largely carried over from the 10th edition and the PDFs of retired exams sold by MBA.com. So if you have the 10th, you won't get as much as you might hope from spending for the new main volume, or $17 a pop for the supplements. You will get what GMAT calls \\"improved\\" explanations. Improved? Maybe. They're still pretty circular at times (eg, D is correct because it's uh....correct), but they do seem more detailed and better organized. These books are good study tools, just not as new as the GMAT folks would like us to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful material but it duplicates the verbal section of the complete guide..","review":"This book contains exactly the same material contained in the verbal section of the complete version of the Official Guide for GMAT Review (by the way I've checked only the reading comp section).

The illustrations are extraordinary, and the creative uses Little Bear's friends make of his trousers are inventive and practical! The story has a joyful ending wherein all the friends can celebrate not only the return of Little Bear's trousers but some time together enjoying a bit of cake. The ONLY complaint I would make about this book (and which was actually pointed out to me by my six 1/2 year old daughter) is that of the nine characters, only two are female. We, however, have rectified this situation by granting them a new sexual status virtually everytime we read this book. Both of my kids (one boy, one girl) adore this book and have for years. Highly recommeded!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Story","review":"Jane hissey has a great way of bringing humor and feeling into this book. I found myself laughing more than once.

The front wheel locks are sized better so that you don't have to bend down and fiddle with a small piece to lock the tires.4. There is a larger bar at the bottom of the bar sized to hold a toddler riding on the back. I don't know that it was the intended purpose.5. There is no pocket in the hood of the 2005 model. I'm not sure why they took it out.6. There is a parent cup holder on the 2005 model.Just my observations - there could be others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advice on debt-proofing your marriage","review":"I downloaded this audio CD to my MP3, and have listened to several times over on walks.

Unfortunately, as the budget has improved, the show has added high-quality guest stars like Wil Wheaton and Simon Helberg. This only emphasizes the low level of talent in some of the original cast, most notably Robin Thorsen. Her lines are still wonderfully funny, but her delivery still sounds like she has to pause to remember her line, then spit it out as fast as she can before she forgets, then giggle and roll her eyes and wait her turn to go again. The character is still great for moving the drama, but if the show is going to keep improving along the trend of its popularity and budget, the writer needs to start applying some of the obvious talent toward finding a way to address an actress who is loveable but out of her league. Overall, another great season for this show and well worth the investment of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love you guys, but PLEASE fix commentaries!","review":"For whatever reason, the commentaries recorded on every season of The Guild's dvds are terrible in terms of the audio. You simply cannot hear half the people's commentaries on any of them - this one included.Look, I give The Guild as a series 5 stars - every single season is hilarious and biting and so, so much fun. But I buy the dvds for the extras, especially the commentaries! I want to hear what ALL of them are saying, and you just can't. It's so frustrating.Like I wrote in a review of the first 2 seasons, it's a damn shame that we are missing out on what these people are saying because with this group of talented actors, writers and directors, you just KNOW they are being hilarious.Felicia!

Of my extensive bead book collection, I rate this one at the bottom! The cover is very nice, which drew me in, in addition to the fact that there are few good books on bead embroidery. I hoped this book would fill the gap, but the content is seriously lacking. Not only is it not innovative,as advertised, but the instructions leave large holes. I'd say, go back to the drawing board. An illustration of a process really does require clear words to go with it. The problem begins in chapter one and does not get much better as the author continues on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feast for the Eyes","review":"This is an incredible book with fabulous pictures and inspiration.

It is painfully funny, and its widely-cast net of satire spares no one. It is an equal opportunity parody, having fun at the expense of all the characters who inhabit that overheated little part of the Middle East. You would think that someone who locates all the hot button topics afflicting Jews and Muslims and then plays a concerto on them would offend, but the undertone of love and sympathy that runs through this comedy insures that bitterness never trumps laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Money","review":"The characters are either thieves or idiots and the story lines of this series are ridiculous.

It is in both Hebrew and Arabic language with English sub captions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatifully written","review":"I feel conflicted when describing this book. The words are beautifully pieced together yet the story moved like a loose dingy caught in choppy waters, which made it difficult for me as the reader, to feel any attachment to the characters. This book has to be cradled to enjoy, meaning it requires attention like a needy relationship. I would have enjoyed the book as much if I had opened a page and read a random paragraph. Wideman has the ability to translate words into emotion. I was so moved by some of his random thoughts, which to me, were as moving and powerful as Bataille or Nietzsche. For example, \\"Light struck dumb since the moment it witnessed sin.\\" Overall, I do recommend it, maybe as a bed stand companion for brief inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"RESEARCH ON THE MAIN THEMES","review":"Iam looking for help to study the main themes (death, African influence,..) of The Cattle Killing. please help me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Power Metal","review":"I discovered this band by mistake and i'm glad i did.Nice power on the songs. great riffs and solos.great lyrics and great voice behind it.power metal fans should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Italian readers","review":"This magazines is excellent if you want to explore Abruzzo.

A good food regimen, and this book can help for full recovery by removing this tempting substitution."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for the exam","review":"This book is more of a guide to consulating than a coursebook. Very little of the contents are applicable to the exam - look at the braindump sites and then compare the information presented in the book with that asked in the exam - there is NO correlation. If you want a VERY high level VERY general guide to design, this is the book for you. If you want any chance of passing the exam, forget this book, look elsewhere. The relevant material (no more than 10% of the total contents), is discussed in SO little detail as to be pretty much, (but not completly) useless. If you have done a course or used other material to revise from, this may add some value, but otherwise it is not going to get you through the exams. First Osborne book I've bought, think it may well be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute fluff...do NOT waste your time","review":"This is a 700 page book of absolute junk.I'm very experienced with AD and had hoped that this book would focus on the specifics of the design aspects and prepare me for the test.

I want my money back.If you're looking for a serious study guide, ditch this and go with examcram or heck...go with anything else besides this. In contrast the Exam Cram 2 book was VERY helpful and gave me many details that definately helped on the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Buy and study a book for the Installing and Administering Active Directory 70-215 exam. (That book of this series isn't bad.) This book provides a superficial overview of business practices and attempts to teach you how to apply them to AD Design. It fails miserably. The book, in my opinion, is a waste of effort. Just study for the 70-215 exam, and maybe try a practice test to get familiar with the question format for the 70-219 exam. If there is anything special you have to do to study for this exam, this book doesn't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for passionate Trekkers","review":"This book is indeed, long and lenghty! To my amazement, it has \\"behind the scenes\\" of EACH episode of the Next Generation and Original Series. When the book was published, Voyager just came out and it talks about it for a chapter or so. Deep Space Nine also got a litte recognition from the writers, but don't expect too much. A BIG plus is the many, many pictures it has. Mostly from conventions and such. Unfortunately, the author might have fallen asleep while writing some sections because a few pages were repeated right after each other. All-in-all, it's pretty good, I'm thinking about getting the sequel, Captain's Logs Supplemental."},{"rating":"1","title":"A giant fanzine","review":"This book is cut and paste writing at its worst. Transcripts from previous interviews and pictures from conventions and old movies are the basis of this book; which translates into a giant fan magazine with all the problems associated with that label. By trumpeting \\"Unauthorized\\" you get the feeling the authors have some behind the scenes info, but after looking at a picture of Deforest Kelly in a western in the middle of a synopsis of season one; you realize \\"unauthorized\\" means unprofessional. If you need an episode guide, this is complete, but you can probably find the same info a million other places."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the BikieDiva","review":"Her expressions were almost as if she were in pain. It made me think that she was somewhat of a bad dancer but I have seen other videos of her on you tube and she dances quite well sometimes.But in this, she danced very sloppily as if she were a beginner trying to do advanced moves. She was not always on beat and she sometimes struggled to give accurate instructions. I don't know what was going on here but I wish I never spent money on this DVD. I threw it away after I watched it the whole way through. She HAS to look back at this DVD and regret it. It should be taken off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"there's got to be more rating options besides stars -- because this is a bomb. It deserves not even one star. Miss Rania is mighty stiff for a dancer. I don't know anything about the Egyptian style or any particular style except for jazz fusion, but after seeing the professionalism in Gothic Belly Dance, you'd think she's a novice. Her costume is just as bad, and her arm movements remind me of John Trovolta in Saturday Night Fever. Someone who may be limited in mobility will be pleased with this DVD / dancer; for anyone who can move without a walker, this is excruciating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.

I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinch hazard","review":"Do not buy this seat!!! I was using it tonight and my son put his thumb on the edge by the hinge. When I swung the tray closed I caught his thumb between the tray and the seat. With all the leverage of the tray you can imagine how hard he got pinched and how hard he screamed. He cried so hard he threw up. At least the tray was good for catching that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chair","review":"My son has been using this seat since he was able to sit unassisted. The chair is very easy to assemble and disassemble. It is also dishwasher safe, which is helpful for those really messy situations. The removable tray is great for getting the mess away from him, so I can clean him up without him getting messy again. He is now almost 20 months old, and we still use it (now as a booster). He is tall for his age, but it still fits him well (with plenty of room to grow). As for the complaints about it not fitting larger babies, I don't really know. My son is very slender, but there is quite of bit of \\"breathing room\\" for him. We make frequent trips to grandma's house and to friends' houses and this seat is very travel friendly. All in all, this is a great product at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but...","review":"This seat is a great concept, it just doesn't stay together very well. I took it back to the store and they marked it as \\"defective\\". For a few dollars more, I got the \\"Healthy Care Booster Seat\\" from Fisher Price. I've had much better luck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tray is worthless","review":"I purchased this chair for use at the grandparent's house when we travel, and it does fine for that purpose. I don't use the tray anymore though, because it falls off when my toddler leans on it, and she is small for her age. It works fine to push her up to the table though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected treat","review":"I have Warts 2 and Warts 3, but I think this one tops them both. The sound quality is great and so are the performances. I love the set list. And the show closes with an 11 minute version of Godzilla that recalls Blue Oyster Cult while still being unmistakenly Moe. I highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get what you pay for","review":"I really like no-frills keyboards, without the many uneeded buttons across the top, so I picked this black Belkin keyboard for it's simplicity. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! Like other reviews, the wake, sleep, and power buttons are placed up where the scroll lock usually is, and are very easy to bump when reaching for a pencil for example, instantly shutting down your computer! Most annoyingly though, certain key combinations create 'ghost keys' - random letters appearing - usually when typing fast. I could go on and on... just don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, and wonderful to see Edward G. Robinson in this kind of role","review":"Very funny, sometimes silly, with a great Edward G. Robinson performanceas a gangster tries to go straight at the end of prohibition, turning his brewery(which happens to make awful tasting beer) legit.Edward G. Robinson seems to be having the time of his life,and a lot of the supporting cast are very strong.Full of very funny lines, and clever twists. Based on a Damon Runyon play.Very worth a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-Paced Fun","review":"Totally enjoyable, fast-paced farce with colorful characters. The print is excellent as well. Edward G Robinson spoofs himself brilliantly. His egotistical, clueless persona, Remy Marko, even refers to himself in the third person. The screenplay is well-written and hilarious. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not ALL about fall","review":"Although it's a stretcher to say this is \\"all about fall,\\" I liked this DVD very much. It was an intro to Jack's Big Music Show, which I love, and Wonder Pets, both new to me--I probably would not have given either of them a chance without this sampler DVD.The surreal, freaky Yo Gabba Gabba always satisfies me and my child--and it's the only real \\"fall\\" one, and it is a very good intro to Halloween. The Wonder Pets is about starting preschool; o, that is sort of about fall.The Blues Clues is Joe playing soccer. Around here, soccer is spring, summer, AND fall, but, OK. One note on the soccer episode. The incredibly handsome Joe seems to have gone too quickly through the costume department. His sweat pants are, uhm, snug, and there seems to be nothing beneath them.

In the first couple of chapters, the authors review some basic concepts through the lens of baseball before getting into some deeper analyses. To be honest, there's nothing in here that you can't get in Baseball Between the Numbers (although to the authors' credit, this book predates BBTN by 6 years) but it's a decent starter's guide. Worth the read, although those with a background in Sabermetrics will probably want to pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cd all around","review":"I recently purchased this cd as I am a fan of most SPV releases i.e luca turilli, rhapsody, adagio..etc. However as I began to listen to it I realized that it is like no other SPV release that I have ever heard, its much better. The song structure is crisp and melodic with alot of drive and intensity. Musically the cd is brilliant, especially the guitar-work. The cd is nicely varied unlike some power metal which can be a little flat and free of variation, but not here. This cd is certainly worth buying especially if you are a fan of other SPV releases. Great Stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the greatest","review":"30 years later, this is still some of the best contemporary Christian music ever.

Keith Green was a true champion for Christ. He shared the Gospel message with unreserved enthusiasm, speaking out against complacency in the church, lacsidaisical servitude and obedience, and mediocrity. More than anything the world needs forward-thinking about the return of Christ and what we should be doing to prepare. In a world where modern Christian music has reverted to a marketing mode of mercenary money-making, this CD is refreshing, uncompromising in its message, and let's face it, this man was incredibly talented. The quality of the audio is fabulous - Keith Green fans will appreciate the remastering."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"While the music itself(by modern standards) may be considered easy listening,the lyrics are hard hitting meat and potatoes.

I remember His fire, dedication and immense love for the Lord. His music is timeless. His commitment was convicting to those who loved to compromise. I highly recommend this cd.

A born performer, Keith Green has captivated Christian music-lovers like no other over the last 20+ years. A testament to the greatness and inspiration of his music, he is enjoyed by perhaps more people today than when he was alive.

Unlike much of modern songs of worship which tend to sounds a lot like slightly modified secular love songs, Keith's lyrics are much more Davidesque. He has songs which reflect the struggle of day to day Christians much better than many songs you would hear at your average Pentecostal church meeting. For example songs sung from the point of view of Lucifer, songs filled with anguish over the state of the world and church and so on. You won't find any \\"I promise I'll be a nice person from now on God\\" type songs.One caveat is that all his music was written in the 70s and so has that 70s feel to it. Seems to have a lot of Super-Tramp influence in the music department. Don't let this stop you from listening and enjoying the songs. It's the lyrics which make this a great worship CD. It is a shame Keith's life was cut so short."},{"rating":"2","title":"This boy could write a song...","review":"...I am not a veteran of CCM so to me Keith Green was something I simply missed. But I took a chance based on a store clerk's recommendation and ,'Wow, this boy could really write a song' In places, Green out does Elton John at his own game. 'You Can Run to the End of the Highway' comes to mind - this song has been in my head for a week! It is clear God was all over his ministry. I now have the '80-'82 double cd as well. Keith Green really deserves the royal treatment although, if alive, he would surely refuse it. Still, these four CD's should be offered together is a box set to honor him and his(our)God.-rptc4"},{"rating":"2","title":"The purest and most unadulterated Christian artist","review":"Keith Green's music is the purest music I've ever heard. It is the most genuine - and by that I mean that it is evident that what he says, he truly means. It is the most passionate. It is the most uplifting. It is also the most child-like. In a day when most Christian artists are running after the world's latest trends, we forget where Christian music got its start.

They're actually three unrelated disks formerly available at nationally known discount stores at six dollars or less, one of which I had returned previously. One is on love themes, another on sci-fi, and one on westerns. The last is the best, though the sci-fi does a fair Blade Runner imitation. The vocalist singing \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\" is poor to the extreme. I have been unable to push myself through that album any further. None of these are by the original artists, though their names are achknowledged in the credits. What they appear to be are basement studio recreations of the originals.

Now I do. This book is GREAT! Simple, down-to-earth, intelligent coverage of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, XML-RPC, web services, .NET, competing technologies, and some more. Lots of code samples and complete explanation of the code. It focuses on what precisely SOAP is, how it works, where and when to use it.I read Livingston's Essential XML book, and I hoped this book would be as good. It is.

It covers all the small details of life that most history books never get into. I was fascinated by all the \\"mundane\\" aspects of life that the author does a great job of describing in detail. You really get a good sense of what life was like during this time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bringing history to life","review":"History is more than the story of big, important men making important decisions. Any worthy historical account needs to give insight into how the masses lived during a given time. This book accomplishes just that and tells the reader how day to day life was, for most Americans, from 1920-1940. For example, in 1920 less than half of Americans had electricity or running water and the situation only gradually improved. Important facts like that are left out from most other accounts, which is why this is a must-read for anyone who wants to know about the subject. To understand the World War II generation, this book should be mandatory. I used this book as a reference when I wrote my own book. See:Alcohol, Boat Chases, and Shootouts! How the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs Fought Rum Smugglers and Pirates (Part I: 1919-1924)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Textbook","review":"Although this book is undeniably thoroughly researched, I must agree with some of the other reviewers on here in that this a dry, dull overview of what was a fascinating time. By the end of the book you will have very little idea of what life was like, on a personal level, for people living during these days. Having grown up with grandparents who were young adults during the 30s, I can categorically state that there are many fascinating tales to tell of these decades - this book provides none of them, and most frustrating of all provides no material not readily available elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily Life review","review":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great DepressionThis is a well-done book.

And perhaps it was. But everything in a movie (or TV show) must first serve the story. Being accurate to history sits lower on the priority list. So it's always good to have reliable sources, like books such as this one, to tell us what life was really like. This book is readable and informative, without being glib or overly scholarly and serves as a fine introduction for anyone who wants to know more about this endlessly fascinating time. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but not essential","review":"This movie guide covers a lot of ground, unfortunately not very well. While it is better than the first edition (in which Stanley felt compelled to make a bad joke about EVERY SINGLE FILM) and the entries often lack essential information (running time, director, cast), I keep this around because it sometimes lists some REALLY obscure films no one else mentions.

My greatest concern, however, was how the updated music would compare. In all honesty, to a die-hard fan, the difference is noticeable. One of the great things about the show was the soundtrack; however, the wit and intelligence of the script makes you forget. The music feels appropriate and does not detract from the story.

All in all, I am thrilled with the release and would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, even with the new soundtrack","review":"I loved this show when it was airing, so I'm enjoying watching all the episodes again!

That being said, if you are a fan of cookie cutter shows like \\"The Hills, Jersey Shore,\\" or even \\"Twilight\\" (that horribly awful movie that is ironically being advertised with this as a bundle), then you probably will not like Daria. And I normally don't support MTV, but for the re-release of this series to DVD I want to say thanks to the network.

I have had a home made DVD collection for a while now and was so excited when I heard that it was being released in DVD quality. I was disappointed though when I read that the fantastic music of the 90's would not be included. Why would the artists not want their songs to live on through one of the most beloved clever series of our generation? Although I would love to own this box set I would rather it be in its entirety.

I guess having Morals isn't popular anymore. At least I can say I experienced the greatest show. However, despite the music being taken off, I didn't notice it too much, just particularly one scene where the replaced song didn't fit well, but anyways...Daria will always be amazing, I'm so happy it came out on DVD.

There's a note explaining this in the case. In most cases, I don't even miss the songs that had been used in the series, but when the joke is about the music playing, it's a little noticeable. The only example I can think of is that in one episode, they are waiting in traffic and they're spoofing the \\"Everybody Hurts\\" video, but some generic music is playing. Other than that instance, however, it's not really a big deal. If you love (and miss) Daria, you'll enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing show","review":"Since I first starting watching Daria on MTV, I have always loved this show, and was sooo excited when I got the email about it coming to dvd!I received this product in the mail nicely and securely wrapped, with my free tshirt nestled right with it. The dvd case is sturdy and thick, so there's less of a chance of me walking over the box and crushing the contents. Upon opening the box, each dvd is snapped in securely, clearly labelled as to what season each contains. I've tested out all of the dvds in the package, and they all play very well.Of course because I love this show so much, I will obviously recommend to this product to any fan of Daria. The money is well spent, to have the series in its entirety all together, ready to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It!~","review":"If you liked the TV show, this is well worth the money.

Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I expected","review":"I know other reviewers complained about the original music not being included in the series, but I honestly didn't notice nor did I remember what the original music was anyway. Great price for an entire series and 2 movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick review.","review":"The DVD box is really well put together, and seems like it won't fall apart when you touch it. The episodes are clear and are a nice change from the crappy youtube quality that we have been forced to watch until now. After a few minutes into the first episode i began to notice the music is different, after 2 episodes it is very obvious and a little annoying. (Amazing how greed almost stopped this show from coming to DVD, but with a little change in music the series is finnaly here.) As a daria fan i want to give it 5 stars but due to the music changes and the episodes not being fully intact i leave it with 4. If your new to Daria you won't notice. But if you watched the show when it aired then you'll know what i mean. Still it's better to have something rather then nothing. Long live Daria!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the purchase","review":"Even though the episodes had most of their original music stripped from them,it probably makes the set more timeless and easier for newer audiences to relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Great Shipping, Great Service","review":"Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product. It was exactly what I expected it to be, it was in perfect condition, and it arrived quite quickly. I would definitely recommend this company/product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daria rocks","review":"I got a huge kick out of this video. The show is funny, wry and clever. I did not follow the show in its original run, nor am I at all in the original target demographic, but i still enjoyed it. It is slightly cynical and jaded but without the mean spirited tone of so many of the reality tv shows airing now. Interestingly, the one \\"flaw\\" cited by other reviewers did not bother me. Many mentioned the lack of music from the show as a minus. Since i did not see the originals, this did not seem to be a problem. I only wish there were more Daria videos to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I am so happy I own the complete series of Daria. This a great funny show. When I watched Daria on tv back in the day I just enjoyed it. Watching it now, years later, and being friends with Cecilia, I feel like I am watching us. We are two close opinionated friends. Who don't make many friend because people think we are mean or grumpy. They just don't get us."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA LA LA, LA LA...","review":"PERFECTION!

Guery! Though I wasn't a teen when Daria came out, my daughter watched it, and I LOVED this cartoon! One of the best they've come out with, and I miss it too! Funny how I will compair the personalities of people I know with the characters on Daria!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How come Daria is not yet on DVD???","review":"Daria was THE animation of my late adolescence. Utterly smart and critical, it reflected pretty much how I felt about school and life in general. I am pretty sure that many people felt just like me, or simply enjoyed the series because of its smart quotes and lovely characters.It's been many years since Daria was last aired on TV-as a Brazilian girl, I had to resort to MTV Latino to watch it, since it left our MTV very early. In this era, when we can find TV series of the sixties and seventies in nice boxed sets full of extras, I can't help but wonder: when will Daria fans have the pleasure of revisiting their beloved series on DVD???I think it's about time MTV released a boxed set of one of its best creations ever-if even Beavis and Butthead got one...I'll keep wishing, and hoping, and praying from Brazil-don't take too long, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daria Deserves to be on DVD","review":"Daria was my reason for watching MTV. No other representation has ever come so close to my outlook on life. In fact I was fine tuned and improved by the wit of Daria. As frightening as that is I am far from alone in my humor, pc incorrectness and yet lofty demand for intelligent thought and expression. Please put the entire series on DVD once and for all. You might be surprised just how many of us there are and how successful we have become. We are a limited group, but we make enough and are loyal enough to Daria to put out the money for the series.Do we have to live in a contrite world that accepts dark events with guilty pleasure; while rejecting the humor, wit and the finger that points right back at us as having a role in the lunacies of life? Daria takes us to task like no other before or since with an endearing arrogance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daria Rocks","review":"What can I say? Daria is just the best! Can't go wrong with the complete series! Just wish they had been able to get the rights to the original music used."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG","review":"OMG I can finally be truly happy.

Watching this DVD is equivalent to opening a time capsule from the best decade of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll keep this simple","review":"Daria is one of the best, cleverest shows Mtv ever put out. Now this DVD set contains every episode, some good bonus features and the two movies. What's missing is the licensed music. Back in the late 90s/early 00s TV shows did not have the same licensing since they normally were not released to DVD/Video, especially Mtv shows. [\\"The Simpsons\\" first season came out on DVD late 2001, \\"Friends\\" in 2002.] That is one reason they had to get rid of most of the original music because it would have been expensive to get it back.Other than that everything looks great, and any fan of Daria or animation should own this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best dvd set","review":"I loved watching Daria on MTV and was excited when the series was available for purchase. Getting a t shirt with the dvd set was an added bonus and I loved that it had a saying from the first episode printed on it. I was disappointed that the dvds do not display the titles of each episode. You only know what episodes are on each dvd after you put the dvd in and go to main menu. Most t.v. dvd sets like The Simpsons or Family Guy feature the title and brief summary of each episode in a booklet or on the back of the dvd container. The Daria set does not. Also there is a techincal error on my last dvd where the screen is black and it sounds like a scene from a movie was recorded on it but that lasts about 30 seconds. I love Daria but I think more thought could've gone into a better quality dvd set for the show's longtime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary","review":"If you love Ben Franklin you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD. It's much shorter than the PBS version, but I think thats an advantage because it allows people who aren't interested in Franklin to get an understanding of just how important he was in American independence.I've showed it to friends who aren't at all interested in Franklin or History and they all were impressed not only with the DVD, but surprised that Franklin did so much in his lifetimeI highly recommed this DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done.","review":"This was a well done documentary and it keeps my juniors interested--that says a lot nowadays.

Dr. Cat's chapters are short and to the point. Her basic message is be compassionate with yourself and to take good care of yourself. She shows us how to do exactly that. A wide variety of topics make this handbook a treasure. Included are an emergency plan for anger overload, the gratitude cleanup list, relating with respect, and many others. I especially like her collection of the brilliant quotes she has scattered throughout the book.

It was hard for me to believe that this type of practice still exists and it makes me sick that we allow this to continue within any state inside the U.S. I recommend this book to people interested in this subject. I read this book after reading, \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" and would recommend that book to anyone who hasn't read it yet - it explains the history of this religion and how the polygamy came to exist within it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid","review":"This book, even if partially true was clearly written with the intent to sensationalize and entertain. Most polygamists are simply consenting adults with a different lifestyle. There are more polygamists in every society than there are in mormonism, even today. With this book clearly intended to entertain others in a lewd exposition should it be any wonder that it is mostly composed of exaggerations and fabrications? If you want a sick tabloid of abuse to read go ahead and buy it, but if you are looking for the facts of a minority lifestyle look somewhere else. look at principle voices, or tapestry against polygamy, and you may get an accurate picture of what is really going on. Of course there is some abuse in every community in America, but this book attempts to paint an entire faith with the satin of a few sensationalized vignettes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased agenda skews reality and truth","review":"Though I ache for those individuals who are in any way abused, and indeed appreciate this forum, which allows them to share their story (in a hopefully therapeutic manner), I caution readers to read with an open mind, recognizing that it is not the culture, but the individual members, who abuse. Abuse in any form must be stopped. But to say that polygamy is abuse (between consenting adults) is to abrogating freedom. I would encourage the readers to also read the book \\"Voices in Harmony,\\" which presents the stories of women who live in plural marriage. There are two sides to every issues. In some way, plural marriage was indeed approved by the God of the Old Testament. But I agree that it's a life which is only for those who choose it. There were a few typos in the book. It was a quick read, and I would recommend it as long as it is read in conjunction with the book above."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Taliban in America","review":"The subject matter is highly disturbing and a must read for anyone who thinks that this sort of horror only goes on in backwards third world countries. The writing is uneven but the content makes up for it's faults.

I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticks are fine, but dip tears off in pieces and becomes uncomfortable","review":"In general, the sticks are fine, and when the rubberized dip is new, it feels good and definitely improves your grip.However, when the dip starts breaking down, it starts tearing off in multiple places, which makes the sticks very uncomfortable to hold. I'm an amateur player, and I play between one to two hours a week with these, tops. They broke down after six months, which works out to somewhere between 25 and 50 hours of play.I only use these sticks to play on an electronic Roland kit, so the sticks have never come into contact with a metal rim.I would recommend any number of other sticks that have a \\"tack\\" grip instead of a rubberized grip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone -- I returned it.","review":"I was disappointed, after reading all the 5-star reviews, to discover that these recipes are full of Dr. Atkins Bake Mix and Sugar Twin (both of which I find inedible), and crushed pork rinds (which she uses frequently as a seasoning and filler). There is a nasty-sounding recipe for Sweet and Sour Chicken that's made with Sugar Twin -- aren't there enough low- or no-carb ways to prepare chicken without resorting to this?

Nancy has sauces, desserts, breads, soups, appetizers.....anything you could imagine and many can be made in advance to save time during the busy work week. Nancy truly has a gift for making all of my favorite foods into low-carb recipes. I have tried so many of the other low-carb recipes from other cookbooks and NOTHING COMPARES to Nancy's recipes. We have even served these meals to our friends and family who aren't on Low-Carb diets, and they think they are dining at a gourmet restaurant!

I haven't tried them all because I don't have as much time as some them would take me to cook. It has really opened my mind about a lot of foods that I never thought I'd eat. I know others have complained about using pork rinds or Sugar Twin, but you can't even taste the pork rinds (they're used in place of crackers in meatloaf and salmon patties), and you can substitute Splenda for the Sugar Twin. I'm really pleased with the results of everything I've cooked using these recipes and recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read before you buy this book!!!!","review":"This book should have been titled, \\"Eat Yourself Thin, by Eating Tons of Pork Rinds\\".

That's not right. Fat does not make you fat. Carbohydrates used with fats is what hurt you. Stir up all that sugar in your system. My dad has lost a lot doing the low carb way as well. Low fat diets don't work. In fact, you get fatter. Just look around you. Everyone has big fat bellies etc. Go the low carb way. Get off that notion that fat is the bad thing.

I have been pleased with every purchase I've made from Amazon until now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"The wireless print server works very well and I have no complaints.There are a couple of issues, however, which could stand improvements:1. The installation is tricky, requiring that the instructions be followed precisely. I had no problem installing it but I have heard horror stories from others who just skimmed the manual and proceeded on their own.2. In order to print through the wireless server, the printer software (drivers) must be installed on the client computer. This is not a problem on my machines, but when visitors want to print from their laptops, they can't unless they are willing to install my software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linksys print server support.....BAD!!","review":"A real b---- to set up...don't buy!!!!

You have no choice; if you change the default printer, the software will change it back to the one connected to this device.The only way around it is to RENAME the connected printer.

Even though the printer I hooked it up to was listed as a supported printer, it would not work properly as a scanner on the remote computer. Plus you need to \\"connect\\" to the print server manually in order to scan even if you do get it working.

It's INCREDIBLY slow when printing (reduced my printer's output rates by about 75%). Worse yet, sometimes it just won't allow one of the computers accessing it to print. No reason, it just won't connect to that computer. It's often better in the morning (who knows why). I've become very handy at unplugging the USB cable from the printserver and plugging it directly into the front of my computer when it does this. I've tried troubleshooting--it appears not to be releasing from the last computer that accessed it. Later this week I'll post a YouTube video of me lighting it on fire in my backyard.

While it might be tempting to want to save a few dollars (your old multifunction works great, but you want to share it), this device will cause you more frustration than it's worth. I set it up and successfully configured my Canon MP830 to use it, but sharing it with several computers requires you to take control of the device to initiate any action.

Not only was it poorly edited and organized, but while it did open my mind to the concept of beauty as a biological adaptation, I found that it jumped to conclusions from minimal evidence. Much of the material that Etcoff cited to prove the biology of beauty seemed to clearly indicate that beauty is significantly influenced by culture. Despite these studies, the idea of beauty being at least partially constructed by culture was for the most part denied or ignored. Furthermore, the book often contradicted itself, asserting vastly different ideas from paragraph to paragraph, with no explanation for these conflicting messages. Lastly, some of Efcoff's assertions were just down-right wrong. For example, presumably to illustrate the instinctual power of beauty, she writes that, \\"we do not introspect about beauty or think about other things in it's presence.\\" Really??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvard Science?","review":"Consider this an engaging piece of fiction from a Harvard professor usually known for writing dry science grants. In _Survival of the Prettiest_, Etcoff has created a vividly imaginary world in which \\"beauty\\" seems obvious and universal to her characters: what people call \\"pretty\\" always seems the same and what appears beautiful never really varies because us male breeders always look for the same attributes in our women. Lesser imaginative readers might want to contest some of her claims on the basis that not all of us are straight, white, bourgeois unitedstatesians living in the late 20th century. Others may be tempted to ask Etcoff where a myriad of different counterexamples -- from non-European cultures and different historical periods -- might fit into her \\"study.\\" But in the face of the many comforting certainties Etcoff provides, it should be easier to simply go along for the ride. This is an incredibly naive book, too bad public money probably went into funding the research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice theory but what about people of color","review":"Some of her \\"scientifically proven\\" ideas do not include the majority of people in the world. By her estimations, white people would be evolutionary (on a beauty scale) surpassing every other race. I like the fact that scientist are studing these ideas but they need to be inclusive in their research. Also a lot of the cultural norms for beauty are cultural norms, not just biological. Why don't men were certain devices to show off their fertility? Other cultures do(exaggerated cod pieces).

It is Darwinian - it is the survival of the prettiest and most handsome. The author, Nancy Etcoff, proposes that valuing beauty is an essential and ineradicable part of human nature and that it is revered and ferociously pursued at enormous cost in nearly every civilization.This book from 1999 shows how outside the realm of ideas, beauty rules the day. According to the author, in the United States more money is spent on beauty than on education or social services. In fact, according to the author, 1484 tubes of lipstick are sold every minute of every day. There is tremendous power in a young woman's beauty.Also, the facts show that people are less likely to ask good-looking people for help. Our efforts to please good-looking people with no expectation of immediate reward are one way we reinforce beauty as a form of status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science it is","review":"Overall a good, informative read.

Its content seems to consist largely of slick color advertisements from a wide variety of manufacturers.

But as the little one has been just learning to eat and can be very messy, we were getting more and more tired of constantly cleaning it and our dining table. We read somewhere a recommendation for a $25 high chair at Ikea. We bought that chair, and it's been a night and day difference! The Ikea chair is easy to clean, comfortable, and easy to strap.We know that we'll eventually go back to the tripp trapp, and that it will have utility for a much longer period of time, but I just can't recommend it for those with babies.

Instead of a second one of those, they throw in a male-female piece. I don't really know why they do that; it's kind of a waste of money in my case, since I got a ton of those smaller pieces in a bulk track set I bought. But this is still worth it; I just have to make sure I only have one instance where I'll have to use the male-male piece. Not too big of an issue.

The end battles between antagonists were simply poetry in motion (the sights, sounds, movement of characters, clever tactics, just beautiful to watch). Anyone that has seen any of the past episodes (and those that haven't) must not miss Book 3 Vol. 4. Aside from the visuals and sounds there are so many messages (some hidden, some obvious) that you must view it a few times so as not to miss them all.I too am worried that a live action Avatar in the \\"wrong hands\\" would be a disaster. I cannot wait for a comprehensive Blue Ray box set of the entire series.

You have a guy who escaped, knew a few people involved, and whose only personal involvement is from the outside. He had no balls, and never dared risk himself. Sure, he knows the figureheads, the history, and can write about what happened as if was there. But he was hiding in his room, making himself out to be a hero.

While CAMINHOS is not an 'acoustic' recording (as is O PRIMEIRO CANTO, her newest), Dulce's sense of style and taste never allow the arrangements to overpower her material. When the listener has the opportunity to experience her work as a whole, it's easy to see the progression she has made -- she has become over the course of her brilliant but short career a much more assured artist, constantly pushing her own envelope to wonderful effects.This is a stunningly beautiful recording -- and one that shines as a whole, not just on the occasional track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing wildernes stories and a message of utmost importance","review":"There is a message of utmost importance in this book that is told through amusing stories of adventure into the wilderness: Only if we carefully preserve the trouts extended habitat can we continue to pursue wild trout.

To my suprise I read the book from cover to cover being drawn in by the incidents revealing the challenges accepted by this family which were dealt with with good humor and love for each other. They seemed to leave their egos behind them as they experienced the wilderness and the people they met there.

Their first CD was so raw and had such a great balance of Bert's singing/screaming. I was always amazed how in the same line he could go from melodic singing to screaming and then back to the melodic singing in the same breath, while at the same time staying catchy. He doesn't seem to do that anymore. This CD feels like he is trying to rip-off MCR's sound, but failing. Maybe they will come back and rawk, but for now, I will stick to 30 Seconds To Mars and MCR for my fill of catchy, hard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not used to The Used","review":"I thought this CD needed a review from someone who had never heard The Used before and wasn't comparing it to their previous albums. That would be me.The weak tracks on this album are the slower ones, \\"Find a Way\\" and \\"Smother Me.\\" A few of the other tracks may be a bit poppy for some tastes (\\"With Me Tonight\\" springs to mind), but they're musically solid.I have to agree it sounds a little overproduced, but I still enjoy it immensely and listen to it nearly every day. \\"Pretty Handsome Awkward\\" is particularly good when you're stuck in traffic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have both the previous The Used cds and this one is way downhill.

It is not much like the previous albums from The Used, but it is good all the way through. The bonus tracks are great, too. (I do believe they will be released sometime on an EP). I do wish it was a bit more hardcore (kind of like their self-titled 2002 release), but if this is the way the band is going, so-be-it. I like the new sound, too. Listen to some of the tracks and decide for yourself. If you don't enjoy the new sound, then you don't enjoy it. If this is the case, don't bash the band or album by saying it sucks, etc.I think all the songs are pretty awesome toe-tappers, and the ballads are great sing-a-longs.Support music.

My friend really likes The Used and when this cd came out, we listened to it on the way home from school. At first I thought they would be way too screamo for me but I actually like them.

Trust me, you won't regret buying this. =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun band, nothing more nothing less","review":"Fun band, nothing more nothing less. Let's face it. Thats what they are.

Don't get me wrong their past albums were great to but this is my favorite. They keep getting better and better with every CD. I like every song which is really rare for me to say.

I don't know why I did though I should have just downloaded the 2 good songs off of the internet. Seriously, I was very disappointed. While its not a bad cd there's just nothing there. I do really like Smother me and Find A Way because I've been waiting for The Used to put out a few more slower songs, but those are the only good ones. And there's a lot of repetition. The song writing isn't very creative on this cd and the lyrics tend to repeat an awful lot. Don't even get me started on Liar Liar. That is the worst song ever and it sucks to even say that because I love the Used so much, but its a really sucky song."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this album rocks. i've been a fan ever since my friend maria introduced it to me. this album tops their previous ones for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Judge Based on Reviewers","review":"If you liked both of the previous The Used cds, I would recommend checking out this one. To me it sounds like a bit different than their previous CD's, but it still sounds like The Used.Everyone's musical taste is different. So you simply can't buy on a review alone. I'd recommend sampling some of the songs online (I know they have a bunch on Myspace). But don't let a review sway you one way or another. It could be your next favorite album or it could be crap (to you).Also, I bought mine at Best Buy. Mine includes 13 tracks, instead of the listed 11. I think its a \\"Best Buy exclusive\\". So you minute want to shop around to make sure you are getting the most for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Used, Lies for the Liars","review":"This is a fantastic CD, it is original and in my opinion the best CD that the Used has produced in their music career. I know that I sound like a silly obsessed fan, but it is very true. My personal favorite is track number 6, Paralyzed. I rated this CD 5 stars because it is original and their sound is completly their own. I apreciate how The Used do not sing the kind of music people want them to, rather they sing the kind of music that they like to hear. You will not regret buying this truly great piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This album is just horrible. Im sorry. Like someone else said on here.

It is just a return of the hard rocking sound of the band, and almost complete 360 from the previous release (which I really liked as well). They are back doing what they do best. I don't think they have a song that is more epic than The Bird and the Worm. Even if you don't like that song, you can't really deny the magnitude of it and the record. I don't really know how you cannot like Lies for the Liars. It is full of adrenaline inducing music that just makes you want to thrash and trash any room you may be in at the time.

The story isn't worth paying attention to. Even if you were just looking for the erotic stuff, there is not quite enough to make you feel like it was worth paying the money for.

A wounded veteran from Vietnam, Coco obviously has a few lingering issues to work out, but he should have done so with his therapist and not in the pages of this book. One wonders why if he is so anti-war he writes about the Civil War at all. Perhaps he feels guilty about his own morbid fascination with the most gruesome aspects of Gettysburg. After a while the reader wishes that the author would get off his soapbox and just report the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful History","review":"For anyone interested in the Civil War I highly reccomend this book. There are literally thousands of books on the Civil War but most of them focus on the political or military side. This book focuses on the aftermath of the battle, something that is overlooked by many historians. The reader will get a whole new perspective on the impact the War had on areas where armies clashed. Anyone even remotely interested in the Civil War should pick this book up. For those of you who have weak stomachs, do not read the book after a meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK!","review":"Changes for Samantha, is a wonderful adventure story.

It was certainly not \\"funk-a-lish\\" as Cloe said. The car accident scene scared her and she thought the gang was seriously hurt. And tell me who misakes a skunk for a cat! Really People! And how are they wearing sun glasses with no noses! Also the clothes were extreamly inappropriate! And poor Jade got insulted for picking out an appropriate outfit! Also one of the Bratz semi betrays her frends and they take her back! Making children believe that you can betray your friends and they'll just forgive you.

I consider myself a well traveled individual, and unless one has personal knowledge of each city to be ranked, they can not provide a valid ranking of any one city as it compares to all the other ranked cities.

The quality is OK (not the greatest but it'll do) BUT...the opening and closing theme music is replaced with an AWFUL version that sounds NOTHING like the original. The only reason I can figure for them doing this is that perhaps they were unable to obtain rights to air the theme song (for one reason or another).

Although certainly not of this genre's first tier (O'Brien, Kent and Forrester), I would place what I've read so far (read the first book in a day and I'm impatiently awaiting the delivery of the next 3 in the series) solidly in the second tier amidst writers such as Lambdin, Bond, Russell and Stockwin.Some have criticized the pace of the novel during the court-martial scenes. I would counter by saying O'Brien also had a somewhat slow court-martial scene that in no way diminished the overall story. So did Kent. In fact, I would say that, in this genre, a court-martial is obligatory. And in many ways, this court-martial is very different from all the others I have read.A rousing good bit of naval action and entertainment. 1 down, 17 to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"The third time I wore these earrings one of the stones fell out so now I can't wear them anymore.

He takes us from Louisiana to San Francisco to Alaska to Russia and back to Alaska in a relatively short book. In doing all this traveling with his character, Jean Labarge, we do not get the typical Louis L'Amour descriptions. We do not get a good description of Sitka, Alaska or its inhabitants. We do not even get a good adventure. When Labarge's warehouse with his very valuable wheat is set ablaze by the bad guys, he does not even go after them. Instead, he sends his ship to Alaska on schedule while he heads overland, on a miraculously fast journey, to Oregon where a sufficient quantity of wheat just happens to be available. In my opinion, the whole story is too far-fetched with too many scenes and not enough of the kind of action and adventure Mr. L'Amour has always delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sitka","review":"Book had been recommended by a friend .

In sequential order, we get the full history of DC from its humble beginnings to its status as one of the premier companies in its field. Marvel may have overtaken it in the 60's with its more \\"adult\\" characters, DC still reigns as the originator of the comic book and the book supremely showcases that status."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Two days after I got it stopped working.

Also, I expected the stopper to be tapered and fit snugly into the bottle, and have a \\"dabber\\" at the end for applying the perfume.

The dabber was about half the diameter of the opening of the bottle and so short that the bottle would have to be filled almost to the top to reach the perfume.Quality was another issue. OK, this isn't such an expensive bottle to expect perfection, but the bottle that I received had a very obvious (and not so pretty) bubble in it, as well as a small chip on one of the four flat surfaces.I don't usually write such negative reviews but this item was so disappointing on so many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and bitter","review":"This is one of the most poorly written pieces of \\"literature\\" I have come across since I was required to read my schoolmate's creative writing journal in high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"The book starts off as a decent read, not great.

EG, if your family were gassed with ether and left in an abandoned railway depot, would you just keep following the advice of this one CIA guy who was your only contact? I think not. And in the end, none of it makes any sense at all.3. Ludlum is no master dialog writer.

If you are out of shape you will not be able to keep up. Furthermore, the movements go by too fast. By the time you start to get one move down, the next has come up and you are scrambling to keep up. Then there is the fact that many of the moves are combinations, expecting you to move forward and back, up and down, while shaking your hips and adding arm movements. Many of the moves aren't clearly shown in the video, making it even harder to follow along.I am sure that with a lot of practice I could eventually get the moves of this video down, but as someone just starting to get in shape again, I found that it was too frustrating to try. I will move on to another exercise dance dvd instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"shouldn't be your first intro to belly dancing","review":"I really enjoy the workout I get with this video, but I'm just beginning to learn belly dancing and can't keep up with the choreographed section yet.This DVD is NOT INTRODUCTORY LEVEL. There is very little instruction given, but the moves are all beginner level. It's a great addition to any other beginning classes or videos you may have, but I wouldn't buy this one first.If you have formal dance training, it'll come in handy here, but isn't necessary.

I've been belly dancing for 6 months and have been a jazz dancer for 5 years. The jazz moves were easier for me to catch on to then constantly doing my hips.She doesn't explain anything. She just introduces the movement and starts doing it. Definitely not good if you don't know jazz or ballet. The warm-up is fine and then it's right in to hips which you do through out the whole work out.My biggest gripe: This is NOT Jazz.I'm not sure what she thinks Jazz dance is, but it sure isn't this. It's more disco. I was very frustrated because I thought we'd be moving around a lot and getting a good workout. I'm sorry a \\"3-point turn\\" is not a good workout. She really needs to re-think the Jazz concept.The best beginner video I've found is Rachel Brice's Tribal Fusion. If you want a good isolation work out try that.

No sweating, no hurting, no panting, no feeling like I'm gonna die any minute! The movements is sooooo natural, feminine, relaxing. Then the bellydancing parts come and man! it's not as easy as I thought! But it's so fun. I try and practice one move every day to regular music and I get better and better everytime with the combination moves. Then when I'm done, my heart is actually racing, and I'm sweating and it didn't even feel like a workout! I was just having fun dancing!! You gotta get this if you hate to exercise but just love to dance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"To be fair, I must admit I did not finish watching this video. It opens with some standard stretching, and then moves on to the \\"exotic fusion of jazz and bellydance moves\\" - calf raises. Finally, it moves to a recognizable dance move, hip shimmies. But it lingers on the many variations: half time, at tempo, on one leg, add a clap. Maybe it gets better, but I'll never know.

I've tried rechargeable and new alkaline batteries and it's just plain dead, no lights, nothing. With shipping, I think this controller was about $27, which was a pretty good deal at the time, but not for lasting only about 4 months of very little use. I recently contacted ECOSHOPPING who finally replied only to say that I should have contacted them within \\"half a month\\" of the purchase for them to help, otherwise they would do nothing. Of course, the controller was still working after \\"half a month\\". Anyway, my advice to Amazon shoppers is to keep ECOSHOPPING in mind and ask yourself if you want to take the chance spending your hard-earned money on extremely poor quality, but cheap products. I know I won't. Remember, you usually get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flea Market item?","review":"Epic? Does it work? I don't even know. I don't own a Wii system.

It was hauntingly beautiful and the background music is a little reminiscent of Dido. \\"Fisherman's Woman\\" however, is a far cry from her first cd. When I listened to it, it literally put me in a trance, that's how bored I was. Every song sounds exactly the same! It's pretty much one big long song with her singing quietly. Add some guitar in the backround and vua\` la\` instant nap. The one redeeming song on the cd is \\"Sunny Road\\", but it's not worth the wasted time just to get to it. So my advice would be to just skip this one and go straight for her \\"Love in the Time of Science.\\" Unless of course you're an insomniac and you need to get some sleep, because this might help.

The movie is an explosion of nightmarish killings and perverted sex!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not more","review":"Some will say it's only a remake of DrJekyll and Mister Hyde. But there is a twist added to this classic. Mr Hyde is named Jack and his killings are attributed to Jack the Ripper, a completely different story. The beginning is also a second twist because it gives some traumatic experience Dr Jekyll, named Henry, had when he was a child and when he witnessed some sexual act he did not understand and was punished for it with a good spanking in a big volley of derisive laughter. Apart from that Mr Hyde is not in anyway distorted or looking like a monster. In fact it is Doctor Jekyll who uses a stick to walk because he limps. The best part of it is the very convincing acting of Anthony Perkins. One more exploration of insanity, here as the result of the past and the use of a drug.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perkins in good form. Pity he's wasted in this mess.","review":"Anthony Perkins plays Dr Jekyl in a film very thinly based on the famous story. Experimenting with drugs which bring out animals' more unpleasant characteristics he accidentally inhales the vapour of said drugs knocked over by a monkey in his lab (a scene 'borrowed' from Monkey Shines?) He then turns into what seems to be some distant relative of Barbara Cartland and, before you can say Hyde, he is roaming the streets as Jack the Ripper.Though Perkins is in fine form, it has to be said that this film seems to be no more than an excuse for one example of sexual depravity after another. The constant sexual scenes before long demonstrate a complete lack of ideas on the part of the script-writers and the 'surprise' ending is just laughable. There is the occasional briefer-than-brief appearance of one or two characters from the Jekyl and Hyde novel, but they certainly can't save this film from being anything but a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"And Shockingly No...That Wasn't Alice Cooper.","review":"Viewed: 1/13Rate: 21/13: Pardon me, is it literally Edge of Sanity or...Edge of Insanity for Anthony Perkins? Whichever it is, it is clear that he had lost his mind when he decided to do the film. Again, it is also abundantly clear that he wasn't even thinking. And I am not even sure if he was atempting to mimic the look of Alice Cooper. It could be the complications of AIDS that eventually did him in a few years afterwards. Back to Edge of Sanity, it displays a repetitive pattern akin a broken record, and I keep seeing the same cycle over and over for like fifteen times. Finally, the anachronism-filled film ends without any original thought. Meanwhile, it's just impossible for these prostitutes to be so good-looking. And what the film is: one bad cocaine trip after another. All in all, watching and trying to complete Edge of Sanity was a struggle for me for few nights, but I did get a good sleep thereafter each night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film!","review":"Anthony Perkins is at his best, still a \\"psycho\\" and running around London as Jack the Ripper by night, a prominent London doctor by day.

First, the music is so loud that it is sometimes very difficult to hear what the persons say (especially if English is not your mother tongue or if you have hearing difficulties), and second, the interviews are too short, too fast and very shallow... No time to ponder and integrate their messages.Conversely to \\"The Secret\\", the names are not indicated, which is very frustrating, as either you try to recognize the famous ones (and you don't focus on what they say) or you just wonder who are the others. There is a kind of directory on the DVD (separate from the movie) but again it goes very fast and just gives the website of the speakers.I totally agree with Ronald : it's a bunch of clips just thrown together with no real direction. I regret my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality DVD","review":"This video seemed like a bunch of clips just thrown together with no real direction.

(See OReilly.com for an excellent example.) Unfortunately, I cannot find them online, and the publisher has not responded to either e-mail or telephone messages. That's pretty disappointing.Due to production pressures and frequently issued new editions, availability of errata should be an important criterion in evaluating test preparation books. I ask other reviewers to consider this in their comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best hip-hop dj's out today","review":"I bought this cd in dec. 97 and I still listen to it all the time. It has alot of well-known artists featured and some really phat freestyles. It is a great cd in play at a party and you don't have to worry about changing cd's. He scratches and mixes through many of today's popular hip-hop song's. There is also a dj battle between him and two old school beat boxers. It's a must have for any hip-hop or dj lover. In my opinion, I think it better than Funkmaster Flex I and II, but no disrespect to Flex. It makes me wish I lived in NY so I could listen to Scribble on HOT97 fm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamu 3 makes Karajan proud","review":"Kamu and Karajan, an odd coupling, perhaps. The Karajan are extremely well known and deservedly praised - you should have heaps of sibelius records of course, with berglund, barbirolli, maazel and lots of others, but you should not miss these timeless Karajan recordings. Unfair to put Kamu in the same box to invite comparison? Perhaps, so judge them individually. Myself I can't think of any Sibelius 3rd I love better than the Kamu. For some reason other conductors are self-conscious with the simple folksong-like slow movement and never make it right; here is the version to go for. Nothing wrong with Kamu's 1st and 2nd, although the competition is of course overwhelming in these late romantic pieces in a much easier-to-grasp idiom. Don't go without these recordings including Kamu's 3rd. Sound is of the excellent 60s and early 70s variety, a good period for DG, and there is no glossiness or superficiality with this Karajan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Symphonies Squeezed onto 3 CDs","review":"This set is essential for any Sibelius or Karajan fan. However, if you do not want the Kamu conducted symphonies to make a complete set, I would recommend the smaller Karajan set. Synphony 4 is a centerpiece of this work, and here it is split between two discs. I solved it by putting Symphony 4 and 5 as a playlist on the iPod. But the other set is easier to play as CDs.Compare to:Jean Sibelius: Symphonies No. 4-7, Tapiola etc.The 3rd and 2nd done by Okko Kamu are fine, especially the 3rd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst keyboard ever","review":"I bought one of these at a local retail store. The keys scrape against the casing as you press them, so you have to press harder which strains the fingers and wrists. The enter key is especially difficult, as I have to jam my pinky finger down real hard in the center of the key.A lot of keyboards have issues with detecting multiple keys being held at the same time. But this is the only keyboard I've ever seen that can't detect more than one arrow key being held at the same time, making some games unplayable. No diagonal scrolling in Starcraft, for example. I found a workaround, though: turn off numlock and diagonals will work. Better yet, just throw away this garbage.Quite possibly the worst Belkin product, and that's saying something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"strangely idiomatic faust from Russia","review":"If you're not put off by Faust in Russian, this isn't a bad performance.It might help explain why Faust was so popular a hundred years ago and nowstrikes us as a bit of a bore. Kozlovksy is one of the best Fausts on discbut he is not as subtle as in some of his other performances. Shumskaya is alsonot as good as on her Traviata -- she seemed to develop something of a slavicspinto after 1947 so she is edgier here and has no trill. Reizen is a goodmephistopheles but overacts. Still, it is a lively performance, well conductedby Nelboussine and even includes some of the ballet music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointing","review":"After having waited over a month to receive this video I was so dissappointed in the type of words they chose to teach which were mostly animals, the quality of the video was poorly done, very choppy demonstrations which gave me a headache after I was done watching and the plain fact that I did not learn the alphabet which I would think is the first thing a beginner should learn. I guess I will have to take the class in college after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"moderately good","review":"My views are somewhere between the other two reviews on this page. I think the reason they introduced the signs for so many animals is because they were obvious and easy to learn. It would be fun for kids to start learning such easy signs. I also wish they had showed the signs more closely so you could be sure you were doing them correctly. Each sign was only done 2 or 3 times, but I used the pause and rewind button on my VCR to go back over them. Plus they were pretty obvious so it was easy to pick them up (e.g. the monkey, bear, tiger, giraffe signs, etc. were pretty obvious). It was better than other videos I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk Rock, Southern flavor!","review":"A great mix of tight grooves and mellower tunes from 7th Wonder -- a group who share some of the righteous roots of the Earth Wind & Fire generation (as you might guess from their imagery here), but who come across with a sound that's much more straightforward! The album was recorded in Miami, Muscle Shoals, and Georgia -- and it's got slight southern soul undercurrent on some of the cuts, especially the mellower ones -- which are actually some of my favorites here. Those numbers glide along with a style that's got that modern/southern vibe that was showing up a bit at the time -- and the more uptempo numbers have a style that's more in keeping with the ensemble funk mode of the period. Titles include the catchy track \\"Absence\\", plus \\"People In Love\\", \\"We Are So In Love\\", \\"Back Track\\", \\"Words Don't Say Enough\\", and \\"Love Makes You Act Like That\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life of Sevareid","review":"Well, yes, Eric Sevareid's autobiography to the year 1946 is a good read by a seasoned world observer. He grew up in the same North Dakota milieu as my father.

Then again, he was a product of his time. Sevareid ends his book with, I guess, a plea for niceness and not bad war. As has been said, however, men love war.

When the stock connector is disconnected from the climate control/radio unit there isn't much space to add the Scosche connector. The lead wires between the connectors simply isn't long enough to connect between the stock climate control/radio and the detached connection. Had to modify this to extend the lead wires between connectors but this really wasn't easy considering there is so little wire between the connectors to work with. There is a comparable part from American International that appears to have longer lead wires between connectors.

I used to drive all day and didn't have room to take my laptop and didn't want to risk damage on it, just for a half hour of use at lunch and maybe another 15 minutes during the day. This is much more compact and starts quickly. I should have bought it several years ago - before I retired! But I couldn't resist at $5 plus $5 s/h. Definately worth the price - A great value.

Needful things is as creepy-crawly scary as they get and King has, again, excelled himself with flawless writing that has you suspending belief right from the first page. It's a poweful story of a junk shop that seems to sell exactly what the customer wants. But all is not as it seems (and why should it be in a Stephen King novel?).King's descriptions and narratives are absolutely 100% right. The story never seems to falter or lack pace, despite the sometimes long internal conflicts of the main characters.I'm slowly piecing together a list of ten books to take to my desert island with me. Needful Things is on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much","review":"I have been through a string of King's books and have enjoyed them a lot. Needless Things, however, was too disturbing to finish. wanted to see Leland Gaunt get in the end, but didn't make it. perhaps King did too good of a job on this.. Still want to explore other King books. He's an extremely good author. I'll leave this one alone. Donald"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to read...","review":"...but the ending left me hanging.

It is one of the most boring books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth your money.","review":"I got this book from a friend who really loved King and he thought that i might like this book too. Well, that was a big mistake! I have never read a book which was so boring as this one, it couldn't keep my attention and I forced myself to read it till the end as so many people think King is brilliant and I wanted to know why. I still don't know why after reading this book and I don't think I will ever know why because this was the last book of King I will ever touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic King","review":"This is King at his best. Even if you have seen the movie, still read this book it has significant differences. The best part of this book is the best part of King's early work, no character is safe. For the most part you will not see many of the plot twists coming but they all work very well. Leland Gaunt is a great villian. Highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King is the king!!!","review":"Well the book was a trip it was cool but also pretty scary to go along with everything else. Killing a kid to get a baseball card is screwed up, don't you think. It's a good thing that man stopped it all. Facing a mass murderer like that takes guts. They get into a big scruffle then the man throws the mass murderer into the big fire place. That's awsome. To be honest, I kind of felt bad for the guy but at the same time I didn't. So with a mass murderer dead, the town goes back to normal. But I don't think the guy who killed the mass murder will have a normal life from the drama. But I don't think he'll have guilt following him. Castle Rock, the small town in Maine, was the perfect place for a mass murderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good One","review":"This one is great.Once again much more involved and interesting than the movie even though the movie was pretty good. Be sure and read it even if and maybe especially if you saw the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think about it!","review":"This is certainly one of King's most original books and the idea is very, very interesting. The book is not as dynamic as some other SK books but certainly hits deep into your mind. It makes you think and it shocks. So if you're a passive non-thinking potato don't read this book, it will be too hard for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent read, but a bit weak","review":"I've always liked Stephen King's books, but this one didn't quite do it for me. The story premise was interesting, but I just didn't get into the heads of most of the characters. Those I did identify with in most cases didn't survive to the end of the book. King does evoke a strong sense of setting, and Castle Rock is definitely a town I'll be happy to visit in other books. Since it's the last of the Castle Rock books, and not very strong, I wouldn't recommend it as a good place to start when reading King's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average for SK","review":"Over ten years ago I picked this hardcover up in a bargain bin. I started it but laid it down and didn't return to it until just recently. Now I remember why I laid it down. Long and boring. This book would have made a wonderful short story. SK was really stretching things by making an epic novel out of it. His editor was asleep at the wheel, it seems.Skip it.

And I've read CELL.We have a story full of lots of characters -- too many to keep straight -- and the wonderful horror that sweeps over their town. Good work.Then we have the ending. Out of left field, we get all these extra \\"facts\\" that weren't introduced at all, just silly deus ex devices to fake us into feeling some symmetry when our hero and villain face off.SO CONTRIVED! UGH!Was very disappointed in the ending of this novel and would not recommend it.Also, very strong sexual content, not really appropriate for anyone under whatever age you think is old enough to learn about how lewd people can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"READS LIKE A BAD SOAP OPERA. NOT A WORTHY KING PRODUCT!!","review":"Well, let's just say this is not one of Stephen King's greatest hits!! I certainly like the premise but I think a Novella would have been enough compared to this overly wordy behemoth. I am a Stephen King fan from the first release of \\"Carrie\\"...a book I read and reread so much I had to buy a second copy! \\"Needful Things\\" would be a great Television Series..sort of in the manner of \\"Friday, the Thirteenth.\\" Many other presentations from King are much much better. If you are a Stephen King fan, you must read this story, just to finish \\"The Castle Rock\\" series of titles. But again, this is not top-notch King writing from the king of horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King Rips Off Richard Matheson Yet Again","review":"The idea for this story came several years earlier, in an excellent, far-superior short story called \\"The Distributor\\" by the true horror master: Richard Matheson. King has made a career of stealing ideas from Matheson. He just took The Distributor and made it longer, but took out it's life and imagination. There's one good scene, but it doesn't justify reading the whole book. Read \\"The Distributor\\" and get the story better and faster.

Stroby put it. It is an intelligently written big book, throwing dozens of tiny sub-plots here and there and tying them all up neatly. I was a bit fearful that the conclusion wouldn't amount to so much..and I was right. That was what made the book, an otherwise great read, into one of the most unfortunate let-downs of King's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though it is not King's best cannot be as low as 4 stars","review":"I found this novel to be beautifully put together. It surprised me to see so many plots put together so well. However, what truly amazed me was that within these many plots, he was able to put in even more themes. And he put everyone of them in better than most authors can include even one.This book is exremely entertaining, stunningly suspensefully, but neither of these can compare to how beautifully it was brought to a conclusion in the end of the story.If you read a Stephen King novel, and do not feel that he has much to his stories beside the horror, do not judge his quality as a writer until having read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Read.","review":"I had always assumed that Stephen King wrote only horror books... I guess I was wrong. Right from the beginning I liked this book. You meet a man named Leland Gaunt. Somehow, he can provide for you the things you've always wanted. However, there's always a small price to pay. Not everything is as it seems. It may not be a horror book, but it's still really good.The only downside to this book was that there are so many different characters that it's hard to keep them all straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read!","review":"This book kept me interested for all 700 pages. I must say there were a lot characters which kept it a tiny bit hard to keep track. Yet, I've read about 12 other novels of King's and this is up there on the list. I thought some parts would be drawn out considering the length of the book but this did not happen. I must admit that I did not find this novel scary and up at night because of it, but it did have some suspenseful scenes. If you like King definetly read this and if you haven't read any of his works then start with this. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there a few other of King's works that I enjoyed more, but this was definetly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a sheriff, either.","review":"This one was just a little too weak for me, although the premise was interesting enough. Most of the characters were never developed to the extent that I was able to care about what happened to them. I also found it hard to believe that any town would be able to hold as many homicidal people as Castle Rock, and I found Ace Merrill's car to be more interesting than most of them. The ending was pure \\"Deus ex machina\\",with King creating a supernatural band aid to close up all the plot threads. Not one of King's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best.","review":"I had to make my self read to the middle of the book and then I lost interest.

Even the movie was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars...on the KING scale","review":"This book may be better than just 2 stars...but the problem is how do you give it more than that, when books like Salem's Lot, The Shinning, Pet Semetary can only get 5? I have been reading King's books for 15 years...and this one didnt do it for me. I liked the story line building around people's paranoia and insecurities...but in the end, the book fell short."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horror for need","review":"I just got finished read a book, and I realized what is SK's horror. Someday I will read every book of SK. Because his story is grotesque and plot is fast and discription is cruel.The whole situation was weird...and getting weirder all the time. As time went by Needful Thing is a poison place, and Mr. Gaunt is a poison man. Only he's really not a man.-Who is HE? Maybe devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever think of what YOU need?","review":"As one of King's so-called 'Constant Readers', this book of his has always stood out to me. Not in the last place because it's movie actually did the book credit (in my opinion third in-line after the prison tales The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile)The basic idea was the most gripping to me. What if there is a store, where you could get the one thing you need most? And it can be anything from a baseball-card, Elvis' glasses to a money-winning horserace game....And for the final trick, you just have to 'perform a little prank' in return. And before you know it you lit a fuse and an entire village is at war, including the local father and vicar.Brilliant. Read it and get swept away by King's version of selling your soul to the devil. Beautifully played by Max von Sydow in the movie. Ancient, likeable, gentlemanlike, seemingly concerned, but through and through evil.Excellent story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, chilling novel","review":"Among Stephen King's many talents is his ability to showcase the depths of his characters; i.e., how low they can be simply to justify their needs and desires. In this novel, Leland Gaunt, a small-town shop owner, barters with the townspeople of Castle Rock, but the price that they pay for their most desired items leads to terror. King is a master at writing this types of stories, and his fans love that he does it so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temptations Ltd.","review":"To put it bluntly, this is one of Stephen King's worst novels. As a big admirer of King, my major criticism has always been that he has a poor \\"end game\\". His ability to create and make you envision people and whole communities as if they were real, is second to none. However come the end of a story, he doesn't seem to know how to finish in a way that would do his stories justice... And for me, Needful Things is by far the worst example. Annie Wilkes would not be pleased!On a final note, this story is obviously influenced by an old Peter Cushing movie called Temptations Ltd, made in 1973, which is about an antique dealer with supernatural powers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful book, but.....","review":"The one star is to attract atttention. I actually thought this book was original in prose and content until...I read 'Need', a short story in a book called Beyond, author Theodore Sturgeon circa 1960. The plot and idea of this book, while excellent, as well as the outstanding prose of King combine to make this a Five-Star book. Nonetheless, the credit for this story goes to Sturgeon. For those of you who don't know, Sturgeon was an outstanding SF writer of the 50's and 60's who Stephen King obviously read. If you like King, you'll love Sturgeon who can do the same thing in thirty-five pages that King takes five-hundred for. And if you think King can write, well let me tell you, you'd better read Sturgeon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SK DOES IT AGAIN","review":"I loved this book and believe it to be the best SK to date.

If you have ever read anything by Stephen King, and liked it, or just like an involved story this is the book for you. The way King works every last character into the story is amazing. And there is still room for his expertise in describing things to real life. If I was writing a book like this it would probably be boring, but Stephen King has a way of putting life into his books. From the beginning when Brian is riding his bike to the end where Alan, Norris and Polly are watching the car leave there is a certain sent of emotion and life. In all of his books he puts emotion and thought but this is as if you are really there in the big fight at the end or in the pricipal office seeing his secret. No matter what you will love this book.

The quality of writing is exceptional in Needful Things. The tension is maintained throughout, with multiple threads.

There's way too much of this idiotic trend in film making of this intentional hand held \\"effect\\" by continually moving the camera around, up and down, zoom in-out, shake, shake shake. It's sad to see this tawdry television fad finding its way into big screen movies. I would have really liked to see this film but I couldn't even finish the movie. It gave me a headache. Too bad, I suspect it had subject content that I would have found to be very interesting. I certainly hope this camera shake fad doesn't go much further.

I have both the small and large size. This product will save you time when applying glue because you don't have to wait 5-10 seconds for the glue to run back to the tip every time you pick up the bottle. Those seconds can add up to a lot of frustration and stress when you're trying to get your assembly put together. Also, like the other reviewers have said, it's nice to be able to work at any angle. The seal on the red cap may not be perfect, but I keep Titebond 2 in there all the time and I haven't had a problem with it. I frequently go months without using it, so you can leave glue in there long-term. Also, you can purchase the large bottles and save some money if you use a lot of glue. For $8, it's well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"Thought I'd love this because I do a lot of woodworking, mostly cabinet making. But the red cap doesn't seal out air as well as a regular glue bottle, and your product will begin too dry out.It dispenses well, maybe I don't do enough woodworking or go through enough glue.Ended up throughing it out and am sticking with the factory bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bland","review":"This product is not any better than the bottle that the wood glue comes in in the first place. It has the same slotted cap so what's special about that? It does keep glue fresh, so does the original bottle if you close the cap. It clogs up big time if you don't maintain it a bit, so does the original bottle. It's not just the nozzel that you have to maintain. That delivery canal on the side feeds from the bottom. Wood glue is thick. I threw mine away after it got to where I needed a grip like the Incredible Hulk to get the glue out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love her writing","review":"Every time I read \\"Still I Rise\\" I start crying.

Bad...just bad.Secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp. It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement. After twisting on it twice I stripped it out. Now the thing is worthless.

There are times when the vacuousness rises to a level of eerie perfection, but these are passing moments interspersed amid long stretches of tedium.

The perspective was lost with countless examples that were perfect cure for when I was in desperate need of sleep.

To be clear-- I enjoyed it; I laughed out loud; I was interested the whole time to see what would happen next as the book continued.It is unfortunate for me that the book suffered a little bit by comparison to Gaiman's other work. When I compared it to Neverwhere and American Gods, the enjoyment got just a little bit paler. I liked it, but I did not love it. It somehow felt like much more of a toss off than either of those two great books.This said, I would still recommend the book to Gaiman fans and non-Gaiman fans alike. You should be aware that it is not a sequel to American Gods, just sort of set in the same universe. Even if I do not like it quite as much as is other books, it has a really nice Tim Powers flavor to it which gives it some punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition overpriced","review":"I loved this book.

And as the novel progresses, it gets better. Fat Charlie finds himself and his true nature, Spider realizes that he's not immune to love, and even Anansi himself, Daisy (the policewoman), Rosie (Charlie's girlfriend), and the truly evil, cliche-spouting Grahame Coats get what's deserved for better or worse.Add the liberal use of creative similes, metaphors and imagery, and you have a fantasy winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Gaiman what else do you need to say?","review":"If you are a fan you will love it.

Gaimen is never disappointing. His story of gods and brothers is scary, strange and hilarious and if you are at all interested in myths, tall tales or folk wisdom as I am, it is simply a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Amercian Gods","review":"I will admit that maybe I bought this book with high expectations. I had just finished \\"American Gods\\" and thought it to be one of the better books I've ever read.Anansi Boys just doesn't stack up. The story is much more modest in scope, and the story isn't especially compelling. The character development is on par with an average sitcom. Considering the other works of Neil Gaiman that I've read, this was a major disappointment.This might have made a good - if predictable - episode of the Twilight Zone, but the quality here is way, way below Neil Gaiman's previous work.I sense that someone at the publishing company waved a lot of money under Neils nose while saying \\"Give me a sequel to American Gods and make it snappy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DIsappointing","review":"Haven't read all his books, but this one was a big let down from Neverwhere. Everything seemed to fit together too neatly. Explanations for events weren't believable or were non-existant.

Personally, I suggest skipping it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor for Gaiman","review":"American Gods was a fun take on gods. With that in mind, I looked forward to Anansi Boys. Oooops. The book was about as predictable as could be. Nothing original existed in the book and it often seemed its purpose was to piece together a few shticks that came to the mind of the author. True, some of the shticks and jokes were cute, but that doesn't make a novel. I was fairly certain how it would end from very early on, and the righting wasn't exciting enough to let me get past that.If you want a really funny, well written book about ancient gods and modern people wandering around together, getCoyote Blue: A Novel. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start, but it gets better.","review":"Heck yeah, lime. The true star of the novel is the lime. Without question or doubt.

The mingling of the macabre and the funny isn't quite up to the level of \\"Neverwhere,\\" but that deficit is counterbalanced by the themes of family and self-discovery in \\"Anansi Boys.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good--very enjoyable--but not Great","review":"Perhaps my expectations are too high, as I've followed Gaiman's work for years and feel he's the one of the brightest stars to rise, but I've not been blown away by his past two books, and find them somehow less than Neverwhere and his collection of short stories, Smoke and Mirrors, both of which I thought were some of the finest examples of fantasy literature of the past two centuries (easy to say since it's only 2005!). Primarily, I found it hard to root for the protagonist, as he lacks energy. The reader finds out he's like that because he lost something, which he eventually regains, so to speak, but all that aside, it's still hard to root for the guy. As such, one never really becomes enthralled by the book.Still, I read it in about three days, which isn't typical of me these days, and I enjoyed it.And, Neil, we want to go to Faery more, in whatever form you care to provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent narrative fun of humor","review":"In this book Gaiman picks up Mr. Nancy's character from American Gods and sets a wonderful story woven around his two sons, Fat Charly and Spider, the good brother and the bad one. Charly is completely unaware that he has a brother and when his father dies an old friend tells him about it. He then calls his brother into his life only to realize that it was a huge mistake and that he wants him out! But Spider refuses to leave and Charly resorts to divine intervention that will place the two of them, and the woman they both love in danger.I highly recommend this book to anyone that loved the action of American Gods and the humor of Good Omens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Charlie Fat Chalie Fat Charlie Fat Charlie","review":"The Good: If you can't sleep, read this.The Bad: Fat Charlie, Fat Charlie, Fat Charlie, that seems redundant right? Well that's what the narration was like. Neil beats you over the head, with his obvious points, (Fat Charlie is an average Joe, Spider is just too cool) which makes reading not enjoyable when you feel like Neil's wasting your time, with repetition. There were a few scenes that have a nice touch of imagination, like how Spider was able to magically transform Charlie's spare room into having a waterfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful characters","review":"Gaiman has succeeded in writing one of the least likeable protagonists in the world in Anansi Boys. There are no redeemable qualities about Fat Charlie, and after hearing about how much of a loser he was for 200 pages I returned this book to the library. The other characters aren't much better: the wife who does pretty much nothing except be charmed by the handsome men, and Charlie's brother who has no negative qualities at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long story that never really starts","review":"Being a fan of Gaiman, and having read all his novels, I am sorry to say that this is (in my opinion) his worst work. It's definitely too long, the story, althogh filled with characters and situations, never starts, and all the situations are predictable.My suggestion, if you're interested anyway, is at least to wait for the paperback edition"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Judging from some of the reviews on here, I must be the minority who didn't enjoy this book. I am very hesitant to write a review unless it is positive, but I was suprised that this one didn't live up to my expectations. I've been wanting to try Neil Gaiman for some time, so I picked this. I really really liked the first several chapters. The writer interested me in his characters, and the writing was top notch. After a while, I was completely lost and had no idea what was going on. I had a vague idea, but I no longer cared. I happened to buy the audiobook, which is probably the best reading I've ever heard, but I admit I fastforwarded all the way to the end after hitting the half-way point of the book and no longer being able to tolerate it. Not that this author is untalented, I just don't know what the point of this story is. I have enough faith that I'd recoomend to you, and to myself, trying another of his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this...","review":"Neil is my favorite author, so I read this twice to make sure I wasn't missing something the first time around. This book has none of the mystery+humor that makes his other books worth reading. The plot reads like it was conceived as it was written (or like a Dean Koonz novel, you pick which is worse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it.","review":"I have read many of Gaiman's other books and liked them, a lot. Anansi Boys was a huge disappointment for me, twice. I tried to read it years ago and put it down due to lack of interest. Picked it back up and started over recently and got halfway through before I couldn't take it anymore. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bucking That Tide","review":"I probably should not be writing a review for a book I did not even finish, but I want to spare other readers the agony and the money. Generally, writers get better as their careers progress, but Neil Gaiman is bravely bucking that tide by getting worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaimen is a gifted writer","review":"This was my first Neil Gaimen novel and I can appreciate why he is so well loved. His prose is elegant and imaginative. The characters draw you in, and his description of fantastical worlds come alive in my mind.Anansi Boys is the story of two brothers. One, named Spider, is a pseudo-god who has no trouble living like he's above mere mortal concerns. Which he is, of course, for the most part. The other, named Fat Charlie, is a seemingly timid average joe who has never heard of his brother Spider nor his godly ancestry.My reading experience was that the story began slowly, intrigued me by the middle and then everything came together for a strong finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late to the Gaiman party but I'm glad I came","review":"I'll preface this review by saying I've made a habit of avoiding Neil Gaiman. I'm the kind of person who instantly hates things that everybody thinks is awesome and having worked the better part of a decade in a comic book store Neil Gaiman has always been at the top of everyone's slurp it down list.It was only the sheer power of the library that made me even put my hand on this book. (I don't know what it is about that place.) Long story short this is one of the best reads of my life. I don't know how Gaiman manages to write such over the top circumstances in such a cool real way. (Sorry, but I couldn't find a more literary way to say that.) I loved all of the characters. I want to play the Bird Woman in the movie and I want to go see that movie in the Ritz. I love this book in the same way that I love the No.1 Ladies Detective DVD. It's the kind of experience I've been waiting for my whole life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story, great Reader","review":"I listened to this on CD. Awesome reader, great story. The reader was so good, that at some points, I thought that there might have been two or more readers. I didn't start suspecting who Spider really was until nearly the very end.For some reason, this book seems to lend itself to being read aloud. I almost can't imagine reading it without the narrator voicing the characters for me. The blend of mythology and modern life was an amazing ride, like riding a gandola on the moon.Don't miss this. I highly recommend listening to it on CD instead of reading it. The narrator adds so much to the story, that it's a shame to miss out on his outstanding, lyrical talent in bringing the characters and the story to life.Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read","review":"I read the kindle version of this book. It was funny and had great charactors. This nis one of my favorite Neil Gaiman books, and I have read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a \\"sequel\\"","review":"Anansi Boys is touted as a \\"sequel\\" to the Neil Gaiman best-seller American Gods, but it is so much more than that. It takes the fantasy-based-in-reality model of its predecessor and adds an emotional thrill ride about the relationships between two twin brothers who are anything but similar, a son coming to grips with his estranged father and a man trying to win back his fiance. An absolute must-have for any fan of Neil Gaiman, American Gods or fantasy in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods meets Good Omens","review":"After the relatively poor, in my opinion, American Gods, Neil Gaiman finds his voice again in Anansi Boys. We have the general idea of American Gods crossed with the humor of Good Omens in Gaiman's own undiluted voice.Gaiman is a storyteller, and often a teller of old tales that aren't always his and that is where he excels. In plundering the lore of Anansi he has found the inspiration and impetus for a wholly enjoyable read that is not only humorous, but also touching and suspenseful as well.If I had a complaint, it would be that it is a rather lightweight book. There are some issues of dysfunctional family relationships touched on, both with Spider/Fat Charlie and with their fiancee and her mother, but all done in a most humorous almost shallow way. That's ok though, because it is a very fine entertaining book on it's own. A pure story to while away a few hours and take you somewhere else. Which is what Gaiman does best, tell stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"Like most Gaiman books, this a awesome. A must read. Neil Gaiman is one of the best story tellers of this age. The stories that he comes up with !!! whew! man... this guy is something."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only.....","review":"If only this novel was a good as all the hype I'd of been very happy. I myself hoped after reading Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\" that his follow up novel would be an improvement upon it. As it so happens I find it's not even as good as \\"Gods\\", which I rated as a 3 star read. This in my view only get's a 2 star award. Nothing wrong with the writing and the story has a few funny passages that made me laugh. The problem is the story for me, It just didn't grip me and I've held back from posting a review for a few weeks so as to resist diving in with a bad review. I wanted to reflect about the story and I'm afraid that I still feel dissapointed with \\"Anansi Boys\\". I'm hoping I find Gaiman's collection of stories ,\\"Fragile Thing's\\", the 5 star Gaiman book I'm waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"This book was a bit of a let down to me as originaly I had heard it was to be a sequel to American Gods, however it is not.The book is good though, once I got past my dissapointment. Gaiman is a great author and I love both this and American Gods as they have gods living on earth along side us. The characters are interesting in both books and I highly recommend them to anyone and everyone.-Ryan Mercer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've very much enjoyed most of Mr. Gaiman's other books, but have to admit I found this difficult to get through and not much worth the effort. What separated Gaiman from other writers, I feel, is his ability to create and describer an atmosphere in which the characters live. This seemed stunted and rushed and, as others have said the characters themselves were not compelling. Hopefully this is an aberration and not a sign of diminished works going forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Gaiman manages to blend both humor and suspense in his loose sequel to American Gods. Using the familiar notion that people are often not who we think they are- even those close to us- Gaiman re-introduces Gods and magic in a suspenseful story with whimsical moments that held my interest start to finish. With a unique sibling rivalry (to say the least,) this is a story of a family unlike any you've ever encountered. The main character's attempts to settle the score with his greedy brother results in unintended, dangerous consequences, which only serves to show how revenge can backfire badly, doing far more damage than good. Well-written and with the hint that there's more to come, Anansi Boys is a worthwhile story. Also try: An Audience for Einstein and Feed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighter than usual, though not necessarily a bad thing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anansi Boys. It was clearly a change in tone for Gaiman, though not really in content. He retained his allusiveness, his sense of detail and plotting that made his other works so rewarding. And while I breezed through Anansi Boys much more quickly than any comparably sized chunk from American Gods or The Sandman, I don't think that reflects poorly on this novel. Gaiman has written a highly entertaining comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative Fantasy","review":"Mr. Gaiman possesses the knack of creating multiple interesting characters from all walks of life, stringing them along on a wild journey of a fairytale, and bringing them all together for the conclusion. He is not afraid to kill off a character because even as a ghost the personality plays a great role in the story. It is a tale of a person - son of a cunning African god, to be exact - discovering his true self as he ambles through life's many stumbles. His ordinary calm life turns chaotic when the father dies and a previously unknown brother refuses to leave him be. Mr. Gaiman's language is compelling while his wit and perceptive writing entertaining. The fiction may be lengthy but each page is filled with undeniably immense happenings thus making the book a pleasurable read. The ending is a little bit sentimental but it is narrated with a nimbleness of an adept raconteur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighter than American Gods, but in the same vein","review":"This was a lovely, quick read, full of Gaiman's intelligent humor and few of his darker angles. I consider this a good \\"starter Gaiman\\" story for adults. Also good for anyone with a sibling that they love and hate and don't understand and completely want to be, all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wondrous Web of Narrative","review":"Anansi is Coyote's African brother, a trickster who is also creator. Anansi Boys lives up to its mythological task, but like all true myths, it is also about love and life and healing in the here and now. Its enchantment and delight are so irresistable that this novel might just heal the reader as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick comment about Nooks and Kindles","review":"The Kindle version price and the Nook version price for this book are the same.

I very rarely, if ever, do that with books but this one just DRAGGED on and on.The character development also was a bit lackluster since there really was no depth to the characters other being super ordinary people thrown into a crazy magical situation that was trying to weakly tie it to African mythology.I might give Gaiman the benefit of the doubt and try another one of his books, but this one was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and Wonky","review":"Always witty and a bit wonky, Gaiman's Anansi Boys offers great escapist fantasy. A follow-up to 2002's American Gods, Anansi Boys picks up with Londoner \\"Fat Charlie\\" Nancy, who learns that his recently deceased father was the human form of Anansi, the African trickster god. After acquiring this knowledge at his father's funeral, Fat Charlie's life spins into disarray as he becomes reacquainted with his brother, Spider. Unfortunately for Fat Charlie, Spider seems to have inherited much of their father's trickster ways and begins to wreak havoc in Fat Charlie's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic Classic","review":"Has a weird sounding summary but this book on more then one occasion has moved me like a beautiful piece of music.

As literarily perfect as can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higher Standards","review":"I've come to appreciate Neil Gaiman's use of dark British humour together with insatiably touching Moments ever since I first read Neverwhere several years ago.Being a story about an African trickster god and his bloodline, Anansi Boys can't be the dark epic that American Gods -- focusing largely on the Norse All-Father, Odin -- was; I missed a certain level of interwoven coherence that Gaiman's led me to expect. Regardless, it's still a very entertaining read, and had any other author made me cry \\"only\\" once in a book, they'd have earned a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"This is a very nice addition to Gaiman's book \\"American Gods\\"--one of my favorites.

Many years later Fat Charlie is living an unremarkable life, with a crappy job and a girlfriend who insists on making him \\"wait until marriage\\". When Charlie's dad dies he learns some amazingly unbelieveable things and his boring life is forever changed.This one has a lot of wit and was just offbeat enough to hold my attention. Charlie is an every-guy sort of character who is easy to like as he bumbles his way through some very odd changes in his life. The book is populated with interesting people and takes a lot of twists and turns that aren't expected. Gaiman wrote it and it reads like a twisted fairy-tale so how can you go wrong with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal Brevity","review":"It takes a little time to adjust to Russian writing. Babel writes in short, choppy and sharp sentences that score point after point with the reader. He paints pictures that are clear and vivid and he opens the reader to feel the scene. This is very interesting stuff because he doesn't tell you how to feel, you just will feel.I believe this work is important because it gives a good look at the early Soviet psyche. This is like seeing a teenage thug before he becomes the gangster.Read and savor.

Their timing, wit, and character development is impeccable. If you're looking for peccable comedy, go elsewhere.

Also works great on removing pet stains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great British Comedy!","review":"A friend of mine told about this show and I borrowed his DVD. After I had to buy my own. The sketches are a bit dated by now but they are still funny. Stephen Fry is an underrated comedy writer. I didn't know that Hugh Laurie was such a good comedian after seeing him in House. I especially loved the Control sketches. Laurie's song Mystery is a hilariously genius comedic song.

He sights quite a few studies that according to the author do nothing to raise your tes level. Other books on this subject find studies that do do things for your tes level and it seems this author IS talking about the same studies as the other books. His favorite saying about these studies is \\"no conclusive proof\\".Personally, I didn't read this book to basically have the only recommendation to do three types of workout and that will cure my problem. Fact is that I already do two types of his recommended workouts and really don't feel that adding the third will do that much.There is other much more positive reads out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Being an engineer who has designed dams and is quite familiar with the story of Hoover Dam, I didn't expect to gain much from this video, but figured I'd give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did, because they did an excellent job with this!You can only cover so much in ~45 minutes, and I would have liked more attention paid to the design of the dam, but they still made excellent use of the time and went into enough depth to meet the needs of everyone other than dam engineers and specialized historians. And even the latter two audiences will benefit, because the historical footage of the dam construction is excellent and irreplaceable.Highly recommended to all audiences, young and old, generalist and specialist.

As I ride a recumbent I can't see the monitor if it is mounted on my wrist. This probably will work for you in the gym or for short rides, but don't buy it if you are a serious cyclist.

Then I got locked out of my copy by Ultraviolet and despite emailing both Ultraviolet and Flikster, I still cannot access my digital copy. I WILL NOT be purchasing another movie that comes with an Ultraviolet digital copy. The movie execs are driving my business away.

There has to be some legal concern there.To those rating the actual film, this is not a movie site; it's a product site.

Once these different sites all have your personal info and email address, then you are presented with several options to stream or \\"download\\" the video. I quote \\"download\\" because in order to get the movie onto your computer, you have to install a bunch of applications in order to watch the video, and once the video file is downloaded it's less than half the file size of what you would get from iTunes - translation: it's less than half the image quality.

Ultraviolet doesn't let you 'own' a copy of the movie, rather you're allowed to stream it, if your devices support that. After I've already put in apple TV's throughout my house that's not an option. What a waste of money. I guess I won't be buying anymore 3d blu rays with digital copy. From here on out I'll just make my buys straight from the ITunes store and not worry about the 3d/Blu-ray/DVD copies.

So I installed them both manually. An hour of looking later, I found no way to download the movie. Even had I been successful, you have to load flixster on your device to play the movie, it won't be with you other movies. That's a bit annoying too.I emailed customer service with no response.

It is down to 1 hour, and lots of minutes, which appear to be waveringup and down. But it still says 0.0/2.0GB(4) I doubt I will be able to watch this on my nice HDTV the way I can watch my other movies using my AppleTV.Overall, a very unhappy surprise, a waste of time, and a big disappointment.P.S.

It is very apparent that it was filmed for 3D and a lot of effort was spent on 3D gimmicks. While this worked in the theaters, I found that it greatly decreases the watchability of the film once you have it at home.

And wasn't she nasty to her on the train platform?- during the same flashback, didn't Lily confront Snape about his dark friendships? and didn't we see Voldemort also kill James before he killed Lily?I'm so confused.

At least they closed out the story lines and let you see who ended up with who and that the magical world went on to the next generation; perhaps to open a new line, who knows.

It seems like a way for the movie companies to force you to buy two products, Blu Ray in time for Christmas and then Blu Ray 3D when it's released in the US in a few months. I think they're doing the same thing with Kung Fu Panda 2. I followed the advice of another review, and bought the Harry Potter 3D Blu Ray (it says it's region free - so it sounds like it will play on any Blu Ray machine)from Amazon.co.uk.

There has to be a \\"consumer watchdog,\\" who takes care of something like this.The wording on the packaging is ambiguous. If you are fortunate enough to talk to someone representing these people, who will meet someone arrogant enough to believe that they will use this system, regardless what buyers want.There is only one answer, and it is not to buy a product like this.

I don't recall seeing UltraViolet mentioned and I don't recall any mention of the process necessary to actually download the movie when I ordered. Maybe they did, but I think Amazon should have a clear warning since this is SO different from what most people think of as a digital copy.

It is so dark that the actors' faces are barely discernible in most scenes, and the entire screen goes pitch black in several others. In many scenes you can barely tell what is going on, if at all.

In addition, I travel between the east and west coast quite often and use those flights to catch up on movies on my iPad ... until now. Ultraviolet is a moronic concept where you stream what is supposedly yours over wi-fi for three years. Well, I canceled my pre-order as soon as they indicated it was ultraviolet (stupid name too). I will not support such nonsense. I instead will order the movie only blu-ray and I will rip the blu-ray to the HD 264 codec for the iPad and watch it whenever and wherever I want.

Forget it. Want it to work in iTunes? Forget it. Want to avoid creating new accounts with web services you could care less about? Forget it (you have to create two different accounts to get Ultraviolet to work - couldn't even make that easy for you).

And probably my last, unless I hear that they overhaul the player. $3.99 is a little steep in the age of Netflix, but when you're in the mood for Harry Potter... When I stream things at home from Hulu, Netflix or other sites the quality is great. As the film opened the quality was terrible, pixelated to the point that we could barely see what was happening. We stopped it, exited out and restarted, which helped a great deal. With about a half hour left, the movie froze up. We waited for 5 minutes or so and ended up having to re-start it again and find our place, wait for it to load. And then it would not allow us to use full screen! It just wouldn't! I like Amazon for many things, streaming video is not one of them. My advice - buy movies on DVD from Amazon, stream from Netflix.

Downloading a 2GB file took 3.5 hours. in comparison the same size file through itune to about 2 minutes. Loading the Flixster software is slow awkward, and sems to be very invasive, (read the things it requires you to share to load the software) I plan on deleting it here.If the download were merely the MPEG4 movie that it's extension claims it is, I would be willing to put up with the terrible download, and crappy software interface, but it isn't. It has proprietary copy protection built in, so you can only play it in the flixster window.If you are looking for the digital copy, don't waster your money on the blue ray bundle, just download the itunes version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet = do not want","review":"One of the best Harry Potters (my personal favorite is still The Prisoner of Azkaban).

I do not have a Blu-ray player, and as a poor student with no television and only a laptop to watch DVDs, I will not be getting one in the near future. So the fact that the special features on one of my favorite movies are ONLY available on a Blu-ray disc is simply unacceptable. A 2-disc DVD copy of this film does exist, but it only has half of the special features and is not even sold by Amazon anymore, as far as I can tell. This pushing of a technology whose benefit is questionable in the first place and the consequent disenfranchisement of potential customers is profoundly infuriating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo for UltraViolet","review":"I wish I could give two ratings.The movie itself would be a 5 while the Ultraviolet would be a negative 5.Ultraviolet is no fun.

I watch digital copies on my iPad when I'm on the road--like on long flights across the Pacific. I'm sure I'm not alone. Furthermore, why would I want to waste like an entire month's worth of 3G bandwidth to watch a movie? It's asinine.Even more awesome is that HP1 came with a real digital copy. Guess I can free up a few GB on my iPad and hard drive by deleting that file.

Congratulations to her.My big disappointment is with the studio not the movie itself. WB released another form of UltraViolet years ago - a downloadable movie that stayed on your computer...if I'm home why would I watch a movie on my computer? If I can't put it on my iPod classic what's the point? The web-site is difficult; I am still having problems with my account which they have failed to help me resolve.

The actors really blossomed in this film and the special effects were nothing short of fantastic... even Daniel Radcliffe could (almost) be classed as an actor. The supporting characters were incredible and the film really finished off the series in a good light.I hope that my children will love Harry Potter as much as I have during these last few years.

Too many scenes seemed unfinished or unexplained, or simply not brought to a reasonable conclusion. The Gringott's scene seemed to have quite a bit of action just \\"finishing\\" to soon and without the ordinary detail one has come to expect with this series. Who was it in the Weasley family that Ron was crying so desperately over? All Weasleys seemed to be accounted for and right there mourning the death of some unknown redheaded person. Far too many other instances to name.

After watching Deathly Hallows my opinion hasn't changed. Hallows looked and felt like a movie trying to find an end, and it finally did. Acting and special effects were excellent, but the Steve Kloves' screenplay left me wanting.It's hard to believe that both JK Rowling and Warner Bros. Pictures would let such a successful franchise die, so I see a bright future for Harry Potter adventures, no doubt with a completely new slate of actors and characters. Perhaps Harry becomes the headmaster at Hogwarts and stumbles onto another Tom Riddle, or we skip a generation and pick up with the adventures of Albus Potter. It's impossible to predict, but I'm sure Harry will be back in one form or another.

We have loaded other digital movies onto our boys' iPod Touch and iPad devices and they can take the movies with them wherever they go, including car rides to relatives in others states. You cannot do this with Ultraviolet because it requires a continuous internet connection (via streaming). Save your money and get the Bluray and/or DVD without the Ultraviolet. If this is the future of digital media, it stinks. We will never buy another movie with prepackaged Ultraviolet again. Warner Brothers, I hope you're listening.

UltraViolet Digital Copy???","review":"This is a fantastic movie.As for the ultaviolet copy, Im actually liking it.Its like netflix, but maybe better. I buy the combo packs so that I have the bluray and the dvd in case I have a family member or friend who wants to watch it. I like to have a digital copy, but if I really want one I can buy one at iTunes. The beauty of ultraviolet is that I can buy a film for myself, and share it with family and friends who I let into the account. It like sharing my Netflix. Thats what I care about, sharing it. And the ultraviolet make that easier. and I think this is going to be fantastic. I will buy a movie and I can share it for free with my family and friends! How is that not good?:-)___________________________________I finally found the site to download it---took a while.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A smidgen disappointed","review":"Not with the movie - the movie was great, but I bought this in the widescreen format and it still played letterbox on my Sharp HD TV widescreen. I figured it would play using the full screen but it didn't. It may be something in the setting on the TV or DVD player but it was only a minor distraction because I quickly got lost in the movie.I bought the non Blu-ray format because my Blu-ray player has issues but that's nothing to do with this. My recommendation: buy the movie in whatever format works for your system and enjoy the end of the series. The digital download is a plus too...we were able to finish watching the X-files (the reunion movie) for free. Nice bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital copy....NOT","review":"WB has made something so simple, loading a digital copy into iTunes, impossible.To use this digital copy, you have to install WB's own buggy app on your device.

The film is great however, this release is inferior The \\"Ultra Violet\\" does not work and the regular DVD copy does not have a chapter menu/index. Your only choice is to play the entire feature and skip through the scenes manually. The blu-ray copy does not work in any of my players so I feel like I received less product for more money.

The iTunes digital copy or Windows Media Copy is the standard of what a digital copy is. It can only be used on the devices registered to the original redeemer and therefore is a safe and reasonable way for the movie industry to limit pirating. This Ultra Violet crap is ridiculous.

Tonight I wasted four hours creating accounts for Sony, Universal, UltraViolet, and Flixster. Lots, and lots, and lots of aggravation. If am stunned that this product every made it through beta testing. I wrote Flixster and still am waiting to hear back. If I don't get anything by the end of the week, I will ditch Flixster and UltraViolet... never to be tried again.If anyone from Flixster or UltraViolet read this, I would encourage you to look at Amazon or iTunes.

To my taste, he relied a little too much on Star Wars-esque flashiness and spell-shooting.

Do yourself a favor and pass this version/release up and wait for one that isn't a slap in the face to the consumers.Also, I must wonder why 3D isn't out as well. They have truly made this a great release to: A, stop the 3D crowd from an automatic purchase to B, looking into the reasons surrounding this release.

I threw the redemtion paperwork in the garbage!!!! This is another example of hollywood making more CGI movies with 3D garbage, trending further with poor screenplays and a rip off mentality.

First of all, the digital copy is \\"unavailable\\" from ultraviolet flixster scamware, and the special features aren't included on there anyway.

Not anymore. The Ultraviolet process could not be more offensive and disgusting if they tried. This may be the last digital copy I purchase. I really have no words.Still haven't watched the movie yet as I've been messing around with this digital copy all night. Awful.Oh - and by the way, the Ultraviolet Digital Copy does NOT work with iTunes. So if you are purchasing this copy to use with iTunes, you are SOL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is good, UltraViolet is a joke","review":"I knowingly purchased this set for the Blu-Ray and DVD, and I enjoyed the film. However, this Flixster/Ultraviolet stuff is a joke. To access the \\"digital copy,\\" you're totally forced into a poorly implemented, locked-down streaming or downloading \\"service,\\" for which you have to give information like your complete birthdate to register (I just went through the process, which failed several times due to their site hanging up my browser), and then install software that who knows what it will get into on your computer (remember the Sony rootkits?). However, anyone with any degree of facility with computers can make a drm-free copy of a disc to put onto a portable device, so this attempt to lock people into a proprietary streaming format will only encourage more people to use \\"illegal\\" (if you actually consider DMCA a valid law) means to put usable copies of their legitimately purchased movies on their portable devices. Will the industry never learn?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Nice to finally see the conclusion to the story.The artwork (?) on the CD is plain black, not much to look at.I was collecting the special edition of these movies, but \\"Deathly Hallows\\" parts 1 and 2 Special Edition (DVD, NOT Blue-Ray) were issued for a VERY short time and now the scalpers are selling them for a really high price, so I was unable to get either of them in Special Edition, what a shame..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray vs. DVD","review":"Would have loved it, if I could have found a good Wide-screen two disk DVD set.

The price was right, and the condition superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, and Good 3d","review":"I loved the movie. It was, by far, the best of the series. And the 3d was really good too. Of course, its still a 2d to 3d conversion, so its not the best. I give the film 5/5 and the 3d 4/5. Its worth buying, of course you will want to get it from Best Buy.Also, this movies 3d is MUCH better than part 1's 3d. I don't know what it was so bad. If I had to guess, the producers got part 2 ready for the theaters, taking time to make it the best it could be, and then rushed part 1 just to make money on bluray release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet/Flixster = Easy Decision Not to Buy!","review":"After purchasing two titles listed as having a digital copy (Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern) was was thrilled to have those in my hot little hands. That excitement quickly turned to dismay when I found this new service called Ultraviolet using Flixster Movie Collections. You do NOT get a digital copy to store on your iPad/iPhone or any other portable digital medium. It requires WiFi and it is a streaming only digital copy. So don't plan on taking any long car rides or flights expecting to watch this installment of Harry Potter!I'll be watching the labels a little more carefully in the future. Those showing a digital copy linked to this farce of a service will get dropped like a bad habit..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the Ultraviolet Digital Copy","review":"This DVD does not come with a real Digital Copy of the movie. It provides access to a Cloud version of the movie which requires you to be connected to a Wi-Fi network. In other words, it is not compatible with Macs, iTunes nor an iPad / iPhone when you are in the car, bus, plane, etc. For more information, I recommend you view some of the comments from the Green Lantern DVD release [...]. In my opinion, Ultraviolet Digital Copy is blatantly misleading and I refuse to purchase any more DVDs that don't come with a standard Digital Copy version."},{"rating":"2","title":"i want the dvd so badly","review":"=)i am big fan of harry potter of the movies since beginning when i first saw it years ago =D"},{"rating":"1","title":"UltraViolet Digital Copy Does not work with iTunes!","review":"Recently purchased this copy with the Digital copy included. They now have something called Ultraviolet Digital copy. This will ONLY work with Flixster and you have to download Adobe apps to run this!! What a joke! It will only work with a WiFi connection and not in itunes! What is the point??? The main reason I purchase these digital downloads is so that I can watch movies on plane flights. This is now not possible! Flixster is aware of this, will do nothing, and there is no itunes option. STAY AWAY FROM ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL DOWNLOADS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad it's a ripoff","review":"I was eagerly awaiting this movie to come out on DVD. I saw it twice in 3D in the theater. To my disgust, it didn't come out with a two disc DVD version, but one DVD and Ultraviolet Copy. I don't plan on buying such a waste of money. I can rent it from Blockbuster and Netflix to my heart's content and watch it here on Amazon Video.Warner Bros should be very ashamed of themselves for this.I don't have a Blu Ray player nor am I planning on purchasing one in the near future. In fact, I would say there are many movie viewers who don't have Blu Ray Players.To make us purchase one, so that we can see the \\"extras\\" is selfish and greedy, typical of Warner Bros.Stay away from the ultraviolet copy as the other reviewers have said. It's not worth they money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie ok, Ultraviolet Digital Copy bad","review":"I've always trusted Amazon to do the right choice for me. Not anymore. When choosing this movie, I could have selected the blu-ray only format, and that would have been ok. I chose the blu-ray + dvd + digital copy instead. Now I realize this digital copy is unusable for me, I won't be able to put in in my carefully built iTunes library, contrary to what I've done with all my previous purchases... Now I realize I'll have to be careful when choosing digital copies, as now there are more options that I don't really care about. Yes, I know I should be the one doing the research before buying, but it is a case of innocence lost. Stay away from this Ultraviolet digital version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and Ultraviolet","review":"Ultraviolet and Flixster both suck. Attempting to create an ultraviolet account and then linking the movie to it, well I've seen buggier programming, I just don't remember when. With Ultraviolet you can't tell if you've been successful or not. When you log in, it takes you to your account page. Now, you have a problem because when you attempt to leave this page, it wants you to update your info including changing your password which you did last time you were stuck on this page. It just stubbornly refuses to let you leave gracefully, but tries to trap you in an endless loop. Flixster gets to the part about having you log into your ultraviolet account to link the movie and then once you do, it just locks up on an empty box and refuses to let you continue. And you have to have Flixster to link the movie to ultraviolet. Terrible, just absolutely terrible! The only good news is that the movie was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd movie","review":"the DVD was just as described and good movie to watch over and over I saw it in the theater its a keeper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love","review":"I love the whole Harry Potter series. It started with viewing the first movie with my daughter at the start, and we have had to go to the last 3 with other fans to the midnight showings! No sex scenes and very little uncomfortable language. Good verses evil is well portrayed, where a parent's love and the loyalty of friends are the best and strongest magic! These movies are not about the dark ungodly practices of magic, but focus on doing what is right verses what is easy. They lift up honesty and integrity, chivalry and loyalty, the need for each other's support and the mutual sharing of each's talents for the greater good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the movie","review":"My wife and I enjoyed it and it help fill out the collection.

Avoid this product due to the digital copy with Flixster. No way to get this into iTunes and very difficult to get over to iPad. 2/3 of the time I can't even access my account because of the deal they have with ultra-violet and how the login process works. Because of how awful Flixster is I am going to have to repurchase the movie throug iTunes so that I can get a digital version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet is a joke. Don't pay for it.","review":"I have recently purchased the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, Part 2 and have no problems with the movie. The digital copy is not a digital copy, but a service to load the movie as requested from the internet. The web site to register for the movie has been no operational for over 1 week! I will no longer pay for a digital copy, when in fact it is not a copy and in this case should be illegal as false advertising.

If we're paying extra for the digital copy version, give us the one we want - the same one you've been giving us all along: iTunes.And, while I'm complaining, don't make us wait forever for the extended versions of all the movies in one blu-ray box set. I'm buying the cheapest available version of this movie (only so I can still watch it while I wait - previous ones I just have on DVD) and you're not getting another penny from me until the blu-ray box set we really want has been released. I don't have a lot of extra money to waste on anything less than the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Ulta-Violet!","review":"Ill boycott the ultra-violet. not digital copy!! why do we have to buy the real digital copy thru itunes, when you are paying for this item that says it has \\"one\\".itunes DC > Ultra-Violet^100 , ultra-violet = rubbish, ultra-violet=not dc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital \\"copy\\" doesn't work","review":"Doesn't actually contain a digital copy as they claim.

I have purchase all previous HP movies in Blu-ray with Digital copies and have never had a problem. However with this version it is not longer an iTunes download code for the Digital Copy redemption. You have to sign up for both Flixster and UltraViolet AND download an app to be able to view it. Not to mention the irritation when the app wants to access your Facebook information.I really loved this movie and am very disappointed with Warner Brothers for this 'new' Digital Copy method. I will no longer be purchasing ANY Blu-Ray from them that utilizes this Flixster service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet will make you Ultraviolent","review":"Do yourself and all of us a favor. Don't buy anything with Ultraviolet on it. Don't do it. This service is a complete joke, I am not even kidding when I say there is not one part of this whole process that works as advertised. I actually had my digital copy downloaded to my phone for one day, then POOF. Gone. And so far I've had zero luck getting it back. Who do you go to with problems? Ultraviolet? Warner? Flixter? Well I've tried them all and still have a service that doesn't work, and a \\"digital copy\\" that I PAID for still MIA.As for this movie? 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Terrible Digital Copy","review":"First of all, this was a phenomenal movie. This review is for the Ultraviolet digital copy. Why are we taking a step backwards? The whole idea behind getting a digital copy is that you own it and can watch it in places without internet access like an airplane on your portable device. Why do we have to stream a video we've supposedly purchased the rights to own? Sorry WB. It's too late for backsies on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Digital Copy\\" is worthless","review":"I bought this version specifically so I could watch the movie on my iPod Touch. However, the \\"digital copy\\" that is included isn't what we have all come to know as a digital copy. You have to install a \\"Flixster app\\" which allows you to stream the movie from a server.If you don't have the latest generation iPod touch (like me); you're out of luck. The app won't run.If you don't have an active internet link -- on an airplane or in an airport for instance; you're out of luck again.If you don't have an unlimited data smart phone account; you guessed out of luck again.What bonehead thought this Ultraviolet concept was a good idea?Well, fool me once, I will *not* be buying any further Ultraviolet products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't watch it on the ipod","review":"So disappointed!

So if you wanted to watch it on your laptop while on a long flight you are out of luck. I though the point of a digital copy was to make viewing it easier to watch. Want to go on a drive and let your wife or whoever watch it off the laptop? Well you cant with out a connection to the internet I am planning a trip to Denver over Thanksgiving, I was hoping to let my wife watch it during the drive. If we want to pack along the DVD that is fine. However I like to pack light and this is just one more thing to pack up. I was hoping for a digital copy that I could put on my iTunes list and well you can't so The movie is great. The \\"Digital copy\\" (yes I just put it in quotes) is a sham."},{"rating":"1","title":"UltraViolet needs to provide refunds!","review":"The economy is tough enough without companies like this giving false advertisment.

This is a terrible scam!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bait and Switch is at play here","review":"The DVD cover advertises a digital copy- not a streaming service that will let you \\"own\\" a digital copy on their servers. When I buy a digital copy, it'd better be on my computer's hard drive and accessible in your iTunes. Warner Brothers, after releasing the last 2 Harry Potter movies that were actual digital copies, why did you have to change something that would make your customers mad? Didn't you use a consumer focus group as a part of your marketing strategy? Didn't think that consumers might view this DVD cover as a bait and switch tactic?That said, this movie was a good end to the Harry Potter series, although I wished that the movie had followed the book on a couple of points like having Harry using the elder wand to repair his old wand and then saying that the elder wand would return to Dumbledore's grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra Violet is a joke","review":"I really enjoy the movie I would probably give it at least 4 stars.

No, no, no...UltraViolet is Ultra annoying and impractical. Honestly, you can use it on your mobile phone but only if you are connected to WiFi...if I were at home I would watch on my TV.This is nothing but a deceptive business practice being used by WB to try and lock in people to a service that doesn't really work. These people jsut don't get their consumers and more importantly don't care!Horribly disappointed with this purchase...if I had know they would drop the ball on this when I originally ordered I would have just purchased via iTunes.Save the couple bucks and just buy the standard 3D version if you want the discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!!!!

I'm not paying $24-$25 for just the Blu-Ray and DVD. I've known of too many issues with UltraViolet downloads.

However, you don't have the physical disc or your computer with you. Solution: You can stream it! If you don't want to stream it, Solution: download it and save it on your hard drive.

This review does not reflect the film, which is easily 5 stars, but rather this version of it. If you are the sort of person who pays a little extra for the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy, you are going to find Ultraviolet to be severely lacking. Warner Bros had a great thing going with the Windows Media/iTunes digital copy; it was something everyone could use because everyone already has one of those two platforms. No one has Flixster as a digital movie repository, let's be realistic. All this does is fragment the idea of a digital movie collection, no longer can you just go to your computer and pick out the movie you want, you have to remember what service it is stored under, what password you use to get to that service, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed..... believed to have ordered Blue Ray","review":"The movie was good but, again, I was under the impression I ordered the Blue Ray..... guess I should have read more and not just depended on the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another ploy from greedy Holly Execs to punish legitimate buyers","review":"While I absolutely loved this movie, I am utterly disgusted that the so-called \\"digital copy\\" that is \\"included\\" with this purchase is actually a subscription to Ultra Violet, a streaming service; instead of a digital copy that resides in my iTunes, to be used on the device of my choice.

The reason for the missing segment is proprietary rights to the Lon Chaney character being withheld from AMC. The people who own the character outright were not willing to allow that character to be represented on this DVD collection. As far as picture quality, this is wonderful. Far better than any VCR copy I've had in the past. Even the sound has been enhanced to remove much of the popping and clicking of the early fifties sound recordings. 6 Hours of wonderful entertainment with all of the original commercials and all.The best episode, in my opinion, is the one with Victor Borge (1953).

The concept was good (that's why I bought the book) & it's the frist Japrisot I've read, but it was lacking in suspense.

Anyone with science or Harry Potter in his/her heart will love this book. Sit back and relax and enjoy the tid bits of information the author offers.

How do you use this Harry Potter obsession to maybe get them to learn some 'almost real' science (some of the science discussed in this book is very much in the realm of 'under research' - but a lot of it is associated with existing prototypes/applications - even if in a very limited form...)I think the concept of the book is original - it tries to leverage the natural curiousity of the vast majority of HP readers - and use it to convey some cutting-edge discoveries of science. Note that most kids will have a hard time understanding a lot of the science topics in this book - without the help of parents. Quantum physics, relativity, psychology of time etc. - are not exactly middle school subjects...Still - it is a good book for adults and children - who have a natural curiosity for all scientific things (and who are, obviously, HP fans)."},{"rating":"2","title":"science writing the way it should be!","review":"I got this book for Christmas and thought, oh please, some cash-in on the Harry Potter books. By Boxing Day evening I'd finished it, having read late into the night and all the next day.It rocks!As JK Rowling wouldn't know an atom from her armpit, Highfield really uses the Harry Potter books as a platform for great scientific storytelling, asking the question: could scientists make these \\"magic\\" things really happen? The answers, often supplied by real authorities in the field, are usually yes - flue powder, genetically mutating monsters, even getting brooms to fly.The scientists he interviews really get into the spirit of the books, and show us that there really are places like Hogworts, full of impossible seeming wonders and wildly eccentric characters --They're called laboratories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tougher than you'd think","review":"I've had my eye on this for a while and finally bought it for a relative. I've looked through it pretty extensively and concluded that this is not a book for the non-scientists (including myself) among us.Perhaps the first sign of trouble should have been the international scientific A-team that the author thanks in the introduction. This is exquisitely researched and really very interesting, but if you're expecting a cheeky offering with medium-hard scientific explanations, this might not be quite what you're looking for. For though it is fascinating, there's some complicated physics in there. If you don't have some significant college background in this, at least half of it will probably go over your head.If you're wanting fairly hard-core scientific explanations, this is a great choice. It's well-done and (I assume) pretty accurate. However, if you're looking for something a bit lighter, you might want to to look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Harry's Magic....","review":"I was disappointed with the subject and the content of this book. I was expecting to read about how magic can be like an exoteric branch in science. I wanted to read a scientific understanding of how magic can be like muggle science! Instead the book is full of explication on how \\"muggle\\" science is a magic in and of itself! While that can be interesting, it is not really pertient to Harry's magical world! This book centers on traditional science and is not about magic!But if you are looking for a book about muggle science as a \\"magic\\", then this book is okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of The Science of Harry Potter","review":"Woah- This book was obviously very well researched and thought out.

He is a sympathetic character but he does kill people which is not socially acceptable even if there is good reason. As a result we watch his work with his old friend Matt Egan and his strange relationship with Karen Manning with interest. How can it end. We hope for a happy ending.

The title comes from the main character in the book named Fade. He is a sad, dejected, somewhat scary main character.He is asked to \\"help save his country\\" after this same country basically left him for dead. Needless to say, he is more than a little mad.While this would have been an excellent storyline, the main character is so flawed - and the other characters so little in touch with these flaws that the whole thing just falls apart for me.Usually Mills writes explosive stuff. This one does not even get a mild flicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't pick it up...

As we've seen with many authors -- have some success and the editor pays you less attention. Shame. Fade is poorly written with a story that is just contrived. Not up to Mills' earlier efforts. Won't be bad for a summer escapist piece, but if you're like me and crave a good read every time you invest in a book, then Fade will let you down. I finally had enough of the poor writing and gave up about 10 chapters in. Sorry, Kyle.

Yes, because these two old British stuffies set off on this journey just the way most \\"inexperienced\\" travelers would -- by the seat of their pants.

Of course they get into all sorts of problems and handle them with dry wit. But they also give stunning and lyrical descriptions of the people and the places they visited.This was a living travel adventure without a tour-guide in sight.Best of all, our intrepid souls showed respect and genuine affection for the native peoples they met. I didn't see any bigotry in this book -- except that which they found in themselves and discarded with ease.Readers should be warned that many of the descriptions of the cultures they visited are very vivid and weak stomachs may not enjoy the unflintching pictures the story evokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"I had to read this for a class. I usually enjoy most readings assigned but this book was drab and dull. It read like the author was trying to write his version of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I didn't even finish the book, it was that bad. I later discovered that the author wrote this book years (perhaps decades?) after leaving Borneo. He wrote too many detailed things from random days and nights that any person would be hard pressed to remember. Not worth the time to reading when you think it's non-fiction.

As soon as i heard pay to play i knew they wouldnt be repeating the success of \\"btc\\". Most of this album is dull, the title is fitting and aarons droning becomes frankly annoying after a while. songs like intro and fill me up raise the eyebrow slightly and falling down sounds like it should be on btc. the album doesnt quite grab you and its quite disturbing that a man of this age is so angry and depressed.

But this album is not worth the money you might want to spend.I will only give this album 2 stars because it still does have about 2-3 songs that are good. The one song that i do think has the most kick is of course the new single, Price to Play. Almost everyone has heard this song and i wish the other songs would be just like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Staind album","review":"13 tracks from Staind and only 3 are any good, huge disappointment from a great band.

In particuar I like having intervals timed for me and cadence spelled out. Instead of staring at my computer, zoning out, and losing track of time, the DVD helps me stay focused. The trainer shares healthy bits of cycling technique along the way - and in the case of this DVD - helps build skills and strength in pedal technique. The only thing that would make it better would be scenery or race footage instead of 5 people sweating on stationary trainers.

This is the best book for explaining what that structure is and how Blake will come to an element and illuminate sometimes inconsistent characteristics of that element if viewed in a limited selection. And yet when Blake's work is examined as a whole an encompassing structure is revealed where each part has been carefully delineated and accurately described throughout. Since Blake's collected works are rather massive it is very helpful to have an overview of Blake's view of man when examining how any one particular image is dealt with in a poem. Else, one might think that Blake's portrayals are incongruent from poem to poem, while his vision is actually quite cohesive. Frye wrote another excellent essay on Blake, the title has something to do with the Fourfold Key. It shows the structural similarity between Blake, Marx and Freud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for all customer service employees!","review":"I've been in customer service roles for over 30 years, from retail and restaurant to high tech and consulting.

To do this, the manager must be able to be a supporter, a cheerleader and a corrector of problems in an atmosphere that is positive.

It's a book about a Big TV Star. Tim Russert. But because he calls himself a journalist, he disguises this autobiography as a biography about his dad, borrowing heavily from the ideas of NBC colleague Tom Brokaw's \\"greatest generation\\" story. Only Brokaw already did it. And like Brokaw before him, Russert has at his disposal, an enormous media network, including tv, cable, radio and countless friends in the world of newspapers and magazines at his disposal, to market the book.

Semi-autobiographical, it has the feeling of a hurried effort whose real goal was to make money. While the adoration of his father is laudable, it was twisted into a self-serving enumeration of author's many virtues and how he acquired them.Maybe all autobiographies require a certain tolerance from the reader, but my supply was quickly exhausted. Russert throws in multiple vignettes per page - some related, some not - lumping platitude upon platitude, as if quantity were better than quality.Worse, it's full of errors that should have been caught by a half-decent editor. A glaring example: everyone knows the prayer before a meal (\\"Bless us oh Lord...\\"), but he gets it wrong, saying \\"...THROUGH thy bounty, through Christ our Lord...\\" instead of \\"...FROM thy bounty, through Christ our Lord...\\" Clangers like that plus his transparent motive reduce this book to the level of a B movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S BAD & SAD THAT WRITING & PUBLISHING COMES TO THIS","review":"BEING A BIG FAN OF TIM RUSSERT, ABOUT HIS AGE, & HAVING BEEN BORN IN NEW YORK, I PICKED UP THIS BOOK WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS.UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

A father who worked two, sometimes three jobs, and made sure that his family was fed, and cared for.Tim's stories about his education in the Catholic schools, and his mischievous teenage years brought tears to my eyes, because I laughed so hard.His success has been well-earned, and very much deserved.Thanks for an inspiring story.

Specifically, he strays from really getting into a honest analysis of his own deficiencies as a reporter.For example, he clearly had little to do with providing insight into the ongoing problems of Iraq. In fact, in weeks before the prison scandal Russert was grilling Kerry on why he threw his ribbons away while at the same time the huge scandal was about to go public.The book fails on several levels and comes across as empty in depth. To me, if you want to really understand the media read Bob Woodward or Sy Hersh but avoid the Russert drivel.Tim Russert is a millionaire Washington insider who has little connection to the real world despite his thin efforts to say otherwise. His reporting is out of sinc with other better journalists and, as a result, his book is not worth reading.There are far better journalists to read about.

How about a guy who is Dick Cheney's personal Mr. Potato Head, wears \\"Bush/Cheney for President\\" buttons on the underside of his suit lapels, and then flashes the buttons at Washington cocktail parties like he WAS the dancing girl in the pasties???

From 2001--2003, when Vice President Dick Cheney was avoiding television interviews, he granted Russert a series of exclusive interviews, in which he said that Iraq had nuclear capabilities and represented an imminent threat to the United States. In subsequent interviews with Russert, he told Americans that our troops would be met by Iraquis as liberators and that oil revenue would finance Iraq's reconstruction. Russert accepted these false assertions at face value and failed to challenge Cheney on the truth of these claims.Washington Insiders sell Russert as someone who rigorously cross examines his interviewers. But in Cheney's case, no cross examination took place.NBC and Russert have done an excellent job selling Russert and his book--too bad they did such a poor job in questioning the government's dishonest sale of the Iraqui war to the American people."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bills will never win a Super Bowl.........","review":"Russert likes to start his promotional interviews for Big Russ And Me, by recalling how the first two people to read this book were his father and his son.

Since everything is broken down into \\"tool\\" sections, it's easy to flip through the book to find what you want to know. Multiple appendices in the rear section of the book will help you outline your story, break down chapters, and assist you in writing cover letters.

But I don't think so; I believe that once again, this book demonstrates that a book can do a better job of character development than the screen can; the screen can give us visual impact that even the best written description can't, but a book will win when it comes to character development every time.Although I WILL admit that, had I not seen John Delancy's portrayal of Q, I might not have truly appreciated just how obnoxious he was merely from the book; his superciliousness seemed a bit understated."},{"rating":"1","title":"too broad ranging, tries too hard to make its points","review":"Still on a quest to find good books for my newly bereaved children, I stumbled upon this 1990 well-meaning treastise that unfortunately feels like it's been written by a committee, with way too many topics trying to cover every possible death-related question from \\"What is it like to die\\" to \\"How can you prepare yourself to die\\" and everything in between including euthanasia, organ donation and the (alleged) Five Stages of Grief.

She is at first overwhelmed by the great love Napoleon is feeling for her, but soon learns to love him too. However, one sad thing is missing from her life: another child.The book closes when Bonaparte is declared first Director and they have to move to the Tuileries Palace.Once again this book is so entertaining and brings to us, readers, the whole history of the era and at the same time, knowing how it unfolds, we follow Josephine through her incredible historical journey.Wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really compelling story of Josephine","review":"Whether this piece of historical fiction sticks to the facts or not, I don't know, but the drama and empathy one feels in reading it makes you want to have known Josephine first hand. A delightful and compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"tales of passion, tales of woe","review":"I was unable to tear myself away from the pages.

The story is fascinating, and it is a quick read. The drama of real life is much more captivating than fiction.The one thing that detracts from the story is the many errors, mostly spelling typos. While reading the first book in the series, I didn't notice any mistakes, but this book is riddled with them. The most glaring was in one of the dates at the beginning of a journal entry - 1978? I was born that year and I'm pretty sure Josephine wasn't still writing in her journal at that time.I'm not sure if this is a problem with the Kindle edition only or if it is something carried over from the hard copy.The writer is obviously very talented and prolific and deserves a better editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I've been watching these episodes with my dad and Larry Hagman is still amazing. I don't know anyone how could have played J.R. Ewing better than Hagman. Jim Davis is very believable as the one and only man J.R. fears, his daddy. Unfortunately Jim Davis died during Season 5 and the show was never the same, because the one man who could always put the fear of God into J.R. was gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dallas-The 4th Year","review":"What is really the 4th season is a great year, probably my favorite of the entire show, although it ties with 11 several years later. It is exciting for fans because a lot of long running stories get started, with new characters who will play a big part coming into their own after the last year, including Afton, Clayton, and Rebecca. Jim Davis is of course lost, and an episode pays tribute to him, but Susan Howard who had guest starred to this point then joins the main title. Other than that, it is continued goodness as the death of Jock and the divorce of JR and Sue Ellen add more drama than usual. It is great drama, and I hope it sells gangbusters so we can get the rest as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible shipment","review":"I received season 5 of Dallas that I ordered from Amazon.com. I paid the new price, but received a used one from another company. Not only did it look bad from the package, it skipped all throughout the episodes. The last disc would not even play. The disc was so scratched up that the dvd player could not read it. Of course Amazon.com will not replace it, because they had someone else ship it. Amazon.com found this person selling it, but will not make it right with the defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie.","review":"This was a really poorly made movie.

Not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting, Disjointed, Disappointing","review":"I have an open mind & a very fertile, active imagination. None of that helped me understand Elena or her boss. Book I was mildy interesting, felt more like a hodgepodge of titillation than an actual developing story of a woman learning about her sexual needs. Book II was ridiculous; after allowing herself to be loaned out to all & sundry at her place of \\"work\\", Elena balks at being used to pay off her court-appointed psychiatrist's gambling debts? And this is a woman who chooses to remain the office \\"in-Box\\" after putting out to clients, coworkers, etc for over a year. Overall, a bit of a letdown for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters going through the motions","review":"This sterile narrative is about what people do, not what they feel. There is no depth, no emotion, no human response. It is fantasy, but fantasy fit for the lower half of the bell curve.The writer never bothers to enter the minds of the characters. He merely narrates action safely from afar, much as the director of a claymation film supervises his blobs of clay. One move follows another as his mannequins engage in sexual calisthenics, but never for a moment do we believe his characters are human.One reviewer suggests this is male erotica. Not so. It is non-erotica.Should one seek truly erotic writing, one might do worse than to try Anais Nin'sDelta of Venus."},{"rating":"2","title":"EROTIC,STIMULATING","review":"MY WIFE AND I FOUND THIS TO BE AN EXCELLENT BOOK.

Be careful doing her muscle-burning series of endless tiny squats: she does these bent over, back parallel with legs in a \\"straddle position\\": I wasn't sure how safe that was for my knees. She also teaches rib slides and circles in the straddle position, which I find rather odd. The odd segue to an interview with her about post-partum body blues is a little weird but touching and the performances are typical of her work. No solos though, except in the dance circle at the end, which I liked. Mostly a good, challenging addition to a serious dancer's toolbox of drills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work, might not","review":"I had an older version of this (1.0) which worked just fine to switch between a Mac (USB) and a PC (PS/2). I got a second one which was 1.1. I've never been able to get the 1.1 unit to work reliably on a PS/2 system, although the USB system seems okay. The mouse becomes very erratic after switching with no way to recover other than a reboot. Working with Belkin technical support, I heard that they'd changed a IC in the 1.1 version which caused the behavior differences. After the usual grasping at straws (change mouse, change mouse drivers, etc.), they admitted that they couldn't get it to work for me. Their only suggestion was that I should change my computer to use USB. Well, if you have two USB-only computers, I think you can get a cheaper unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"Even putting aside the fact that it's ridiculously overpriced and doesn't come with the required cables (which you get to furnish yourself at extra cost), it is unusably slow.When switching between inputs, the video input switches after only a second, but it takes, on average, OVER TEN SECONDS before you can use the keyboard or mouse.

The back cover of the book calls it \\"A masterpiece of vampiric passion\\". The novel isn't about vampires, but shares characteristics. It kinda reminded me of a certain Stephen King screenplay. The story predominantly was told through conversation between the main character and a detective. The story was told a lot in past tense. This is the third Andrew Neiderman novel I've read (Child's Play, Surrogate Child). This was the most edgy out of the three which caught me by surprise. There were homosexual and heterosexual situations. I didn't expect this from Andrew Neiderman just by what I've read in the previous two novels. I thought the story started off a little slow, but once the story started to develop, I found it very interesting. I breezed through it fairly quickly.

I have trouble finding one that is straight like this. I did buy a cheap $3.00 Ecko turner with a straight edge but it is really to flimsy to stir and lift food well. This has a nice edge on it, does not scratch my pans, and is very firm. Worth every penny! I wish they sold one that is not slotted also but I haven't been able to find a mini turner without the slots.

I still gave it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mini Turner\\"","review":"Don't be fooled by the \\"Mini\\" turner title. This is just a regular size spatula. It is a full 3 1/2 inches wide.

It is an absorbing, imaginative book with a very satisfying ending. The only drawbacks are somewhat long length and repeating subplots. Most readers will find it difficult to tie the loose ends of the story. The most memorable part of the story is the discussions with Ummon, an artificial intelligence. The are elements that will satisfy both the philosophical, thoughtful and the suspense-oriented readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick review","review":"Whereas Hyperion was a study in character development, this was a study in... unraveling a story?I can't really recommend reading this, but if you read Hyperion and are looking for answers, then go ahead.

Other reviews have rightly put it with the best of Sci-Fi literature, and I put it with the best of epic sagas ever written. I never wanted the stories to end. Awesome!The downside and a word of warning to those considering buying the e-versions. Reconsider it, and stick with the paper versions if you can. This is the worst conversion to an ebook I've seen yet. There are glaring errors of punctuation, grammar and, spelling throughout. They are almost constant, and kept pulling me out of the story. Kindle's version is very badly executed. In my frustration, I also tried another e-version through Apple, and it ended up being the same. Horrible mixups and errors throughout.Again, great book, great series of books, but avoid the Kindle version if possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We want more!","review":"The Fall of Hyperion by Dan Simmons is the second book in the Hyperion series. I won't say this one is as good as the first one, as it isn't, but it comes close, real close. Simmons again captivated me with the story revolving around the planet Hyperion. Like the first book this one was full of surprises and unexpected plots. I have to say though that I am easy surprised. For one I didn't see the end of Sixth Sense coming until Bruce discovered himself. This time our heroes meet the Shrike one by one. For each the outcome is different, but satisfying. At least for the reader it is. The Hegemony finds out who the real enemy is. No big surprise there. Surprising for me was the way they attacked it though and the big consequences it has for mankind. Anyways, great book, will read the next one for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A more convetional story structure is to be found here, as the pilgrims try and deal with an invasion, a Hegemony political leader, and an android avatar reincarnation of Keats.They discover that the TechnoCore itself is fighting its own battles, and the spillover affects them in a very serious way.Oh, and throw in some highly entertaining Catholic satire, to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up to a classic","review":"The second book of the Hyperion series did not read like I had anticipated after reading the first installment. This is not a problem, was just not what I was expecting. To be honest I had no idea what to expect, but I was very pleased.

Fall of Hyperion is not really a sequal, it is more like a continuation. Chapter 1 takes up as if you were still reading Hyperion.

Horrid","review":"If I could unread any book, it may well be this one. \\"Hyperion\\", book 1, was awesome. Book 2 fell apart with stupid endings and simple minded conclusions to book 1's complex ideology. Either the author needed cash \\"right now\\" for this book, or else all the drama, intrigue, and complexity of book 1 were just pure luck.DO NOT READ THIS SECOND BOOK IS YOU LIKED BOOK 1. That's my best advice I can give. Book 1 left me thinking hard. This tore down the curtain, showing the flames and voice of the wizard to be a small, petty thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition Quality","review":"For those wondering about the quality of the Kindle edition, it appears that it comes from a similar source as the first book's Kindle edition. There are typos here and there, but not nearly as common as in the first book. Whereas the first book had a few issues per page, this book has something maybe every five pages or so. Also, fewer words are misspelled (\\"tne\\" instead of \\"the,\\" for example) and the errors that tend to crop up are a missing period or comma here and there. Still slightly distracting, but nowhere near as bad as the job done to the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as \\"Hyperion\\"","review":"This sequel to \\"Hyperion\\" does a good job of tying up the loose ends from \\"Hyperion\\" however without the Chaucerian conceit, it reads just like an adventure tale. That's not bad if that's what you're after, but I like my sci-fi to have a bit more meat on its bones.The world is still superb and even more worked out. The Shrike is even more in evidence and still cool.The resolution, however, is a bit too mamby pamby for me. Simmons tries to switch so many genres in the first book that in the second one he ends on too triumphant a note. Too long to go for such little emotional/intellectual payoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"where has the magic gone?","review":"Hyperion transported me into another world; The Fall of Hyperion left me looking at my watch. Boring. Half-baked ideas...the narrative is not gripping, not in the same league, the same universe, as the classically plotted Hyperion. However, Endymion picks up where Hyperion leaves off (the third book is a gripping read). As for The Fall...leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Even better than the first of the series. The characters are fascinating. Some of the plot twists are predictable, but in a way that leaves you feeling satisfied for having predicted them. The treatment of loyalty, morality, and mortality are some of the highlights of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing series","review":"If you have read Hyperion then this is a must read. After reading the first book I was extremely satisfied even though it felt like the series needed a more complete ending. This book delivers the ending and it paints such an interesting picture of what the future of humanity could look like. This alongside Hyperion might possibly be my favorite sci fi book ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fall of Hyperion","review":"I finished reading Hyperion and was overwhelmed at what I thought was the best SF book I have ever read, but last night in the early hours I finished The fall of Hyperion and never before have I found a second instalment equal or better than the first (Unlike 'The Nights Dawn Trilogy'), the characters continue their individual quest to find and face the Shrike, whilst the fate of mankind is being fought and decided by the politicians and the Ousters. However both collide in one of the most amazing and somewhat disturbing endings I have ever read. These 2 books are esential reading to both non SF fans and SF fans, and I cannot wait to start Endyminion as well as read up on Keats's work. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good ending to the story of hyperion","review":"Although it is true that these two volumescan be thought of as two parts of a longbook, the style of the two parts is verydifferent. The storytelling in this second partis not completely linear, however it follows asingle style. While the recounting of the pilgrims'stories in the first book showcased Dan Simmons'mastery of a number of different fiction genres,the complexity of the story lay in the interplaybetween the tales, rather than the individual tales.The writing in the \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" is a bit morecomplex, and the story a bit more difficult to follow.The book ends with many questions unanswered,but is still a very satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This book is book 2 in an incredible series of four. The story draws you in and doesn't let got even after the book is done. If you like sci-fi or even if you just like a good book you should pick this up. But in order for it to make sense besure and pick up Hyperion first. Hyperion lays the ground work for the next three books.Although I think that The Rise of Endymion is the best in the series, all of the books are incredible storyies well worth the time to read. GO READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, a tour-de-force","review":"Each of the characters introduced in Hyperion goes through their own harrowing adventure in the Time Tombs.

(Just what the book jacket says!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperion was great; Fall of Hyperion not so","review":"I couldn't finish it. I made it a third of the way through, and then couldn't bear it anymore, so I skipped and read the last few chapters, hoping to find some resolution. I was disappointed: the last few chapters were murky, bordering on incomprehensible.Look, just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean you can dispense with internal story logic, Dan Simmons.I think he [Simmons] was inspired when he wrote Hyperion. Fall of Hyperion, on the other hand, was a hack, slapped together and padded-out to a couple hundred pages to satisfy his editors.The irony is that the two books are a sort of homage to John Keats, who never padded out anything and never wrote sequels. But if Dan Simmons had written \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\", he would have definitely followed it up with \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn Part II: the Grecian Urn kicks the Persian Jug's Ass!\\" (now available in paperback at fine bookstores everywhere)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Unanswered Questions","review":"This series has been invaded by strange creatures from another genre. This book (and it's predecessor) have many elements which are creepy and grotesque but don't have much in the way of explanation. For example, it's not clear why the shrike kills person X and not person Y. Or why the shrike is invincible in some scenes and vulnerable in others. Or why the \\"cruciform\\" is shaped like a cross. Or how the human sacrafice fits in to the big picture. In a science fiction book, everything should pretty much happen for a reason and fit together.I bought \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" hoping that these questions would get answered and tied together. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Pure junk.","review":"Let's get things straight: I enjoyed Hyperion. It's an odd mixture of terrible & brilliant writing and I absolutely understand those that found the brilliance overwhelming & so gave it such rave reviews. On the other hand, this book is plain old terrible. Pure junk. The only connection with art is that it alludes to Keats. The SF ideas are not original, and the treatment of them is remarkably shallow. Naturally, an SF book from a good writer like Simmons, contains 10 times more originality and imagination than an average mainstream book. I guess that's why newcomers to SF, or people that like Star Trek, Power Rangers and the likes, might find no fault with this book. But for most SF readers, especially if you haven't gone totally gaga over Hyperion, don't make the effort. Really, you can compose a better sequel in your sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have never been written","review":"This book should never have been written as the ending to Hyperion was perfect in my opinion. This story feels rushed and Simmons completely changed the writing style of Hyperion to force this book out. One piece of advice, read this really fast so you won't notice all the plot loopholes. The only reason that it is not a one star book is that the setting of Hyperion is impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad I Couldn't Finish","review":"Like my title states, so bad.
