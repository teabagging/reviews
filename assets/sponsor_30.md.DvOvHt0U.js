I should have gotten something else right away, but did not.My biggest gripe is that if your voice gets a little loud, the ear piece seems to cut out and you think the phone has gone dead, thus in the beginning I was doing a lot of \\"are you still there?\\" Now I know it's just a bad feature of the phone.I also have, as another reviewer has mentioned, that out of nowhere, you get a beep beep beep and your call is gone. You haven't done anything different but it happens. ????At other times it won't show a caller ID. It will say incoming call and that's it.Other times when the phone is ringing, I get one continuous ring for about 45 seconds straight.

This book has a nice choice of things that we can use both for that, and also for later 'just for fun' or other activities.

Since there are few facts available regarding this saint's ultimate death in a concentration camp, the director took a lot of liberty with the storyline, of necessity. This provided the opportunity for great artistic license.Ms. Morgenstern's portrayal of this Jewish/Catholic/Carmelite nun's life and death is intriguing, touching...even inspiring. Will have to wait until the next life to find out what really took place for her, and for her sister, Rosa Stein. I have never seen a film that is so \\"artistic\\", with multiple flashback scenarios, dramatic/traumatic relationships with her mother, as well as with her professional rival. The first year in Carmel is daunting for anyone, but the unique challenges it posed for a Jewish convert were handled with style and great fairness. There is no white-washing present in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed. I thought the film was definitely beautiful and deeply meaningful with respect to the cinematography. However, I was looking for more of a biographic film that depicted her life and writings and thought. I didn't get this.

It took Philips 3 days to get me an RMA # with me calling them twice a day. I overnighted it to them and they took 2 more days before they started to look at it, 3 days later, they still have it. All the while their customer service people give wildly contradictory stories about the repair process and its time frame. It seems that they are in a contest to dupe the most customers. I sent the 510 back. To compare, I had an HP Jornada with a software glitch, got an RMA from HP on the first call, sent it to them overnight that day. They fixed it the next day and overnighted it back. Philips has the absolute worst customer service department I have ever dealt with. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nino - No wonder they quit making it","review":"Dealing with Philips customer service is like pulling teeth...and since I just had a tooth pulled, I know what I'm talking about. The docking system for the Nino 510 is terrible-50% operational rate. A crack formed on my touch screen and grew all the way accross it. Of course it had to be my fault (even though Nino is always in my hand or in its case). When I ask if 100% of the Ninos coming of the Korean assembly line had no cracks form in the touch screen, the answer was no. But anyway, $177 to fix a $300 unit.

However, when we received it, the box indicated that it was a \\"Light-Duty\\" professional tile cutter. This would have been way too 'light-duty' to cut even the thinest ceramic tiles that we install and it is way lighter than the one we are wanting to replace. I doubt this would hold up through an entire kitchen floor of cutting. It might be okay for wall tiles but with a heavier tool, it would be unnecessary to have one for walls and one for flooring.Please do future customers a favor by describing it correctly so that they won't have to return it as we are doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great supplement","review":"Ive taken other beta- alanine supplements before and i liked their effect but this one worked the best.

A tiny screw. A tiny, incredibly tightly screwed in screw. A tiny (did I mention that yet) screw you won't have a screwdriver small enough to open. A tiny, easily strippable non-standard, tightly screwed screw that makes the product useless, unless, as another user wrote, you simply break the thing and hold it together with tape.

It's about a young woman who has been abandoned by everyone and is now held in a basement by some man. That's all plot there is except for some flashback sequences of her childhood. The movie relies heavily one first person narration and the pace is extremely slow and nothing much happens in the movie. The sound and picturequality is as bad as Lommel's other recent movies, that is about as cheap as it gets. The soundtrack combines random noises and annoying piano music.Dungeon Girl doesn't work as a drama nor as a horror movie. It's just plain bad and doesn't deserve your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because Amazon Forces You To Provide A Star","review":"Twenty word minimum.

You repeatedly are shown a scene where the kidnapper is masturbating with a baby doll and he keeps repeating the same annoying phrase over and over \\"Are you a witch? All women are witches, Are you a witch?\\"The musical score is also terrible. Its just a mixture of random sounds and piano keys.The only reason why this movie gets one star is because the actress who portrays the \\"dungeon girl\\" is very beautiful and she is the only reason how anyone can bare to watch this movie.Overall, the movie is horrible, the acting is horrible and the music is terrible. Dont buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so bad","review":"Cheap-looking. Poorly written \\"narration\\" delivered in monotone by the \\"heroine\\" will make you cringe.

I've never come across any housecleaning book, no matter how useful and sensible, that has as realistic tips as some of the ones in found in this little paperback.

I have spent over two hours on hold for them, to finally get an agent that speaks limited English. I have emailed them, asking an english speaking representative to call me to no avail. They don't seem responsive, are almost scornful to the average person with limited GPS capability.

This product continually freezes making it unusable. As previously stated buy another reviewer the unit goes to checking media every 5 seconds and then after, the unit will freeze. I thought adding the SD card would help with its problems but, it didn't. Also trying to add any map software just makes the problem worse.

Using this GPS in the field is a pleasure. Uploading the detail maps are a total pain. Not intuitive at all.

Therefore I cannot charge the battery and cannot use the gps.

Short and sweet XP Pro doesn't recognize the driver even if you say it's ok. Installs it but, won't use it. That means the GPS will not communicate with the computer. MapSend Direct is also imcompatable with XP Pro so it doesn't matter if it talks to the computer or not. I've sent off my e-mails to Magellan but, I hear their support is sad. I hope my credit card company can help me recover some of my money. The GPS seems to be quite fast, accurate and sensitive...compared to my 8 year old ColorTrak which has no problem with XP Pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"$450 of junk","review":"After three months of using this unit my frustration has caused me to buy another unit. Very little about this unit is functional or intuative. Downloading maps from a computer has resulted in the unit permenantly freezing up. The temp gauge is totally inaccurate, the altitude is rarely correct and the unit takes up to 15 minutes to lock in on the satellites. I have kept the unit and will carry it with me in case I encounter a bear....in which case I will throw it at him, with little regret of lossing something valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy a Magellan","review":"I will never buy another Magellan product. I have sent my Magellan eXplorist 600 back for repairs three times. Twice because it burned out as soon as I plugged it into my car charger (using the appropriate Magellan car adapter). My husband and I have spent half our lives on hold with technical support. When they say they'll call back, they don't. Two months ago was the last time I sent my unit back for repairs. We finally got ahold of them and they are replacing the unit with another Magellan product. I'm not excited. I guess they would have just ignored the repair order and blown us off, had we not perservered in trying to contact them. I rarely am this dissatisfied with a product. If I am, good customer service usually rectifies the problem. In this case, the product stinks, as does the customer service. Never again Magellan.

The support is terrible without question.Now lets talk about the product. My two month old Magellan eXplorist 500 has died. First it lost it BaseMap which was a pain to replace. I had to pull the battery, replace the batter, reboot the unit and go into reformat mode. Then copy the BaseMap back into the unit and life was good for about a week. Now it cuts off on it's own requiring the battery to be pulled to reset and turn the unit back on.

The basic premise is that once a business has a raison d'etre, or a 'main thing', that profits are maximized by the alignment of four key business areas: Strategy, Processes, People, and Customers. Built on this premise are actionalbe ways to build a self-aligning organization. I got the sense of discovering truth while I read this book. Leadership isn't really about power, it is about responsibility. This book shows a manager at any level how to align his area to the overall strategy of the company and to the end products of the company. It shows how processes should be designed and what factors should be used to reward, recognize and evaluate employees.

Blood is a bizarre but mesmerizing collection of strange short stories, unsettling almost-plays, and uncomfortable snapshots of human nature. Her words walk that sharp line between brilliance and madness, and you are never quite sure what side you have landed until it's much too late. These stories are clever and brutal. Twisted things happen to a menagerie of misfits. Simple, everyday events are carefully braided together into something with which you will end up flagellating themself after a few pages.

I studied in Hanoi for four months during college and it was a real trip back for me while reading this, especially when the author speaks of her visit to Hanoi. I stayed in Bach Khoa while I was there and lived in that very neighborhood for four months and it made me very nostaligic. However, the author tended to irritate me at times with what I saw as an attitude towards the culture and traditionalism of the northern region.

Some segments are absolutely lovely, but the movie is disjointed above and beyond the intended feel of vignettes. The stereotypes of 19th century rebel-without-a-cause butch/femme roles make the characters painfully predictable and the lack of plot a given.

Sincerity is great, but it doesn't mean that something created sincerely is any good.If you ignore the silly 'romantica' label, 'Cynara' is basically lesbian soft-porn. For fifteen minutes two women walk around a variety of olde-worlde settings (with a cod-classical soundtrack which appears to have been composed on a General MIDI synth) looking misty-eyed; for the next fifteen minutes they roll around naked on a bed.It's shot on video and looks it, there isn't really any acting, and it's roughly on the level of a Penthouse video (with less rude). The 'romantica' label appears to be an attempt to make it seem artier than it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite and Erotic","review":"I had never encountered the concept of \\"Romantica\\" before but in this video the director has created what is one of the most lyrical visual experiences I've ever had. It is highly erotic, but what makes it so, is that there is a romantic build -- the element that is missing in all the erotica out there. It's beautifully shot and the music is haunting and beautiful. When I discovered there was a CD of the music I ordered it from Wolfe Video in San Jose, CA. Highly Recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicole misses again.","review":"Nicole Conn has \\"outdone herself\\" on this one? Maybe that's part of the problem. She should stick to documentary work, these movies (Claire of the Moon also) are lacking. She has yet to cast anyone who could \\"act\\", I mean really ACT, worth a nickel. The women in this movie were attractive, but they had no chemistry since they were just \\"models\\" posing and showed no hint of emotion that seemed real. The sound quality is poor, just like in Claire. There isn't much of a story, this is just a film of period costumes, glances, sexual tension and then \\"the act\\" itself.

It's not interesting enough to be a drama and it's very definitely not an action film, since half of the movie is taken up with poetry that can only make one wonder what this movie is all about. In the end you'll be sadly disappointed when it ends and that question has never been answered. It has no plot, no character development and seemingly no reason for ever being made.

I would have said the author was a man with serious problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All that","review":"The book is defiently not the best book I have ever read, matter of fact while my friends in some weird way seemed to had enjoyed the crap ot of it I seem total dumbfounded by the constant rapes and the worst of all the freaking verbal abuse!!!! It got on my freakin nerves I threw the book On several occasion. What really kept me semi going even though the male hero was obnoxious and rude and everything a hero shouldnt be the image she had set for him in my opinion was this darling sexy man sssooooo I kept reading. Curiosity killed the cat, well I'll be dead. To curious to know what had happen I had end up finishing it and semi-liking. It could have been much better thats certain and I'm glad I didnt judge the author on this one book I end up reading another book from her (my first time reading her work) and really LOVED THE BOOK! (Nobody's Angel) it was so beautiful.I Say save yourself the trouble on reading the book and read her other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only one","review":"I love Karen Robards' novels and don't let this one keep you from getting all the others but i must say this one was a disappointment. I kept waiting for him(jon) to actually make love to her but i reached halfway through but he never did i could not even finish it but i reccomend all the other karen Robards books, she is the only reason i am buying of the internet since i cannot find all her books elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Island Flame by Karen Robards","review":"I think this was a very sick book, there were kidnapping, rape, beating, and abuse, then Catherine fell in love with Jonathanshe was just is sick as he was, how could someone love being treated like that. It is an insult to all women."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Real Pirate","review":"Prepare yourself for a true pirate, or do not read this book.(*Rape scenes.)He is a nasty viscious cutthroat. I waited on the fleeting moments Cathy was able to wring a drop of kindness out of him.Jon was a neglected child who left home at sixteen to sail. Later, he became a pirate; committing robbery on the high seas! Not a licensed privateer, buccaneer, a sailor w/ a cause, or anything otherwise excused.Yes, there were the misunderstandings as other reviews noted, but compared to other writers ... the conflicts didn't drag out. The build-ups and anticipation kept it exciting without being frustrating.I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it 1 star because Zero isn't Available......","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a very long time. I was really looking forward to reading this because I had just finished a few really good Robard books, but this was tedious to say the least. Throughout the whole novel Jon Hale ( I can't say hero) is abusing the heroine. First he kidnaps her then he rapes her over and over again and she despises him, and then in a blink she falls in love with him. How do you do that when he never treats you with any respect or even kindness. So he beats her, rapes her, calls her names, then they get married and he calls her a bith and a whore and then ten pages before the book ends he is raping her again!! And the worst part is I found out she made a sequel to this novel, Hmmmmmmmm....I wonder how he is going to treat her in that one. Don't waste your time with this book, I regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correct me if I'm wrong!!!","review":"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the summaries failed to mention this book is about the rape of a 16 year old girl by a 30+ year old man. Girl is raped by pirate, within a couple of hours girl has sex with pirate, eventually girl falls in love with pirate. If you enjoy reading books along this theme, then Island Flame is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me too...","review":"This is the first time I've ever given a bad review for a book - this deserves it. I read some of Karen Robards other books and LOVED them, but was absolutely horrified by this book. Not only does the hero rape the girl early in the book as described by other reviews, he rapes her much later in the book when they have been married for some time, and she doesn't even have any desire to leave him! Hardly even cares, though the author CERTAINLY wrote the scene so there was no doubt it was out-and-out rape. Oh well, Karen Robards other books are good romances, but stay far from this one, it is a traumatic read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HERO IS AN ABUSIVE JERK","review":"IT'S TOO BAD THAT THE STAR SYSTEM DOESN'T GO BELOW A 1,BECAUSE I SURE WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE IT A 1.THE HERO IS A CHILD ABUSER OF 30+ WHO RAPES AND SLAPS AROUND A CHILD OF 17.I HATED IT.THIS IS THE FIRST AND LAST BOOK THAT I WILL EVER SPEND MY MONEY ON.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a quantum step backward for romantic relationships","review":"I should have listened to the reviewers on this one. It is toobrutal in its portrayal of rape & physical abuse. These characters are not people who belong in this genre, or perhaps in any form of literature. One cannot feel anything but disgustat the ersatz hero and his attitude towards women.Nor can anyfeelings of sympathy be truly garnered up for the spoiled bratheroine. I only hope that young readers don't pick this book upor, if they do, they see it for the travesty it is. Shame onyou, Ms.Robards"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of 'romance'....","review":"I fully understand that women were looked at much else besides bodies, ect, in this time period, but this book didn;t appeal to me. I don't usually get offended, actually its hard to offend me, but Jonathan (the pirate) is so abusive and careless with Catherine, it was hard to even believe he loved her at all. I tried so hard to look past his brutishness for the sake of it being 1845 and him having a rough childhood, but I just could'nt accept that he ever loved her or ever would. He seemed to be taking his aggressions and past aggressions and anger that had nothing to do with her out on her. It never stopped, not once. She loved him and did all she could for him selflessly and he still took things out on her. I could not warm up to him no matter how hard I tried. I was wishing she would've escaped and he would've been hanged, sorry, just being honest. The sequel to this is 'Sea Fire'...Tracy Talley~@"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was incredible I read it in one day.","review":"It showed that even opposites attract. The only thing I didn't like was the rape part other than that a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too brutal for romance ) :","review":"I like romantic tension between characters, when they argue, get mad at each other & then make up. However this book went beyond my comfort zone, Captain Jon rapes Cathy brutally, calls her bitch several times and a whore (minutes after giving birth to his son). Then Jon is tender to her. It's like he's bi-polar, cruel then tender. If you want an excellent book from Ms. Robards that successfuly captures romatic tension in a sexy & sweet way, read Whispers at Midnight, one of my favorite books. Definately skip Island Flame and read Whispers at Midnight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read!!!","review":"I have read a lot of books in my life, and this book was one of the worst! I can't believe people declare it as romantic!! The heroin is repeatedly and brutally raped throughout the whole book, and to make matters worse, she thinks she has asked for it and that it is actually enjoyable! This book is pretty twisted, and left me feeling just plain sick! I hope no young women read it and think this is ok! If you want good romance, don't read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret buying this book.","review":"I regret ever buying this book.For some reason, I thought the book would be kind of like \\"Flame and the Flower\\" by Kathleen Woodwiss. I was mistaken.There are really no real love scenes in the book. From the beginning to the end of the book, the hero is dominating, abusive, crude, and mean. He practically rapes the heroine the entire book and excuses himself by saying the heroine enjoyed and it was her fault. Whatever.I am completely baffled at how the heroine could have any feelings for the jerk of a hero. He had absolutely no redeeming characteristics.I can't imagine why Robards would write a sequel to this book. If I hadn't bought this online at Books a Million I would have returned it the next day to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"After reading some of the other reviews of this book I can only conclude that there are a lot of people who get turned on by the thought of a thirty-five year old man raping a seventeen year old girl and then spanking her until she's black and blue. I'm not upset because this book isn't PC,I'm upset because this book is glorifying the sad reality that some women face everyday. Ask any woman who has ever been raped or any woman who is involved in an abusive reationship and they'll tell you-there is nothing romantic about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting portrayal of \\"Love\\"..","review":"It amazes me that a woman could think this a \\"love\\" story much less a romance. It was bad enough that he RAPED her at the beginning, you could kinda get past that, but I have to say that the last RAPE would have been totally unforgivable. NO ONE falls inlove with there rapist! The age difference I could handle but the violence was pitiful. I think I would have liked it better had he been hanged in the end..."},{"rating":"2","title":"island flame","review":"another great piece of karen robards' repetoire. a worthwhile read with all the angst and passion and forgiveness nessescary for this fats paced pirate novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Th best book I ever read!!!","review":"I totally loved this book and I recommend it. I have to say, I read some reviews earlier and I have to agree, it is violent but totally worth it. Underneath it all, she makes the story very romatic and original, I just loved the characters.

We checked out Little Yoga from the library and ever since she had been doing poses. The first day we bought it she promptly pulled an entire page out by turning the page just a little aggressively. I didn't expect that the page would come out so easily so was disappointed in the quality. Otherwise it is a great read and entertaining for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddlers","review":"My two year old loves this book and quickly learned all the poses. The book has a few basic poses which are renamed for the animal they mimic. For example, \\"standing forward bend\\" is renamed \\"monkey\\" because the pose resembles a monkey bending over. The illustrations and text are simple and the back of the book has photos of actual children doing the poses along with some parental tips. It's a great book and I highly recommend it. It's also a great gift idea for a young child whose mom practices yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for toddlers","review":"This is such a great book for toddlers! We found it in the library, and have constantly renewed it since we got it. Our girls love trying out the poses. I would guess that they were about 2 years and 3 months when they really became able to do the poses. The pictures are really cute, and the book is adorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this trash. Not worth the CD it is pressed on!","review":"This CD is Trash. It is that simple. I bought this CD at Best Buy with rolled change, and this is the P.O.S I got for my money. They used to be my favorite band, but this CD discraces War Of Art. They need to spend more time in drug rehab writing better music, and they changed their distortion on this album. They sound about as heavy as Queens Of The Stone Age to me, so if you want some good chill music give it a chance. This band is like 90% of all the new metal bands. Each CD gets progressivly weaker and weaker until they are no longer metal at all, and this band is on that track. DONT BUY THIS IF YOU DO I HAVE NO PITTY FOR YOU! YOU MINE AS WELL WIPE YOUR BUTT WITH YOUR MONEY. YOU WILL GET MORE USE OUT OF IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another useless bland new metal album","review":"I dont know why so many people praise this band as \\"One of the best new metal bands out there.\\" There is nothing original about this band and I'm sure the same people that praise this band listen to Stone Sour and System of a Down and other so-called \\"amazing\\" bands. The singer when he sings melodic sounds like a rip-off of Chino from the Deftones....and if you have heard Chino you know I'm right! Plus the guitar work is sooo typical and boring. More of the same useless screaming about nothing. Dont get me wrong I like some new metal bands like Devildriver, Amen, early Slipknot(not the new album) but this band doesnt offer anything worth repeated listens...they are lucky enough to have been able to release this useless album. Good for them but I wont listen to this when there are a million better things to be listening to. I dont care what you people think....continue to pollute your ears with this jargon. I wont."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sophomore Slumps for AHC","review":"While I used to worship The War Of Art, I actually like this new cd alot better.

Buy it...you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"not war of art, but a good effort","review":"I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't just a little bit disappointed with this release. War of Art was one of my favorite CD's for a good long while and this album is a pretty radical departure from that album's style. Nonetheless, When not held up to the staggering awesomeness of the war of art, this CD does manage to hold it's own for the most part. There are a few songs that really just don't jive with me at all, but there are some that a person can at least bob their heads to if not mosh or whatever. There's more melody and the band is definitely going for a creepier feel with this album, rather than the blisteringly heavy approach on their debut, and it is an interesting sound if nothing else. Don't write it off altogether, but be wary when you give it an initial listen. It probably won't be what you expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Besides a couple of songs on here, this album was a dissapointment.

American Head Charge succumbs to the sophmore jinx and turns out a below-average album, even for the new/nu-metal genre. Save your money and pop for the new Priest, Soilwork and Black Label when they come out. This album should be dropped in the discount bin right off the bat.Not to say there aren't some decent songs... Loyalty, Ridicule and Take What I've taken are decent, but 3 out of 11 tracks is pretty shoddy work.

Okay, she doesn't drop her pants completely, but I cannot admire a woman who does this.The secondary female is almost naked in a V-string and little else--and she claims to be a virgin. She may be physically but she's a tease and being a virgin does not make her a moral person.As much as I wanted to like TZ (the heroine), I keep remembering the first pages about her.Please understand--I am not a prude.

This awful case book is such a POS, it's not worth the paper on which its written.The case book itself was poorly edited, and the authors' comments/explanations may as well have been written in Chinese.

A few quick clips of some shrill talking heads was all that was offered in rebuttal. Stone was clearly only there to promote Chavez et al. I did enjoy the one president tweaking the US empire by asking for a base in the US in return for a base in his country. The hollowness of the enterprise was shown in its worshipful attitude towards Chavez as well as bringing in Raul Castro as another example of an exemplary leader. He may yet be the inadvertent hangman of the disastrous communist interlude in Cuba. Perhaps Stone could have asked about the hideous disproportion between the lack of Afro-Cubans in the Cuban Communist party compared to the population.

Be warned, however, that most of the exotic instrumentation (ie., didgeridoo) has been downplayed here, appearing only briefly in some songs, in favor of the overpowering dance beat. I wish more of the world music influences of the original songs hadn't been lost in the mix. Overall, it's still a good Hi-NRG dance experience. One complaint, though: in songs 3 and 9, which otherwise are some of the best dance tunes on the album, there is an annoying male voice barking \\"one, two, one-two-three\\" in time to the beats which goes on forever. This vocalization is a complete distraction and makes me feel like I'm listening to a rude aerobics instructor intruding in on the songs. Let the beats speak for themselves! Because of this, I'm only giving 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"How can such a good author of non- fiction come up with this? I found the book dull, contrived and slow.

I emailed the author, inquiring as much. She quickly responded that the sequel is well under way...I can't wait!The book is divided into chapters, each being a family story which was no doubt passed down through the generations. It is very easy to imagine these stories being repeated at subsequent family gathering for years. From the early 1800's through the publishing of this book, these stories were essentially an oral history of a real family.Nancy Burchianti has captured the spirit and energy of an immigrant pioneer family. Her style creates a vivid picture of their lives and times, trials and tribulations. The characters connect.This one is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"SICCMADE RITUALS IS A WINNER!","review":"COS what can you say he is one of the best rappers with siccmade even though they are all sic.

However this cd was not the case infact, I was very pleased to hear some fresh new siccmade beats. there are even some dope new phonk beta beats and a sic beat by evil on track 10. This cd has a new millenium sound to it but it is as siccmade as ever.I also like the sophisticated gangster sound that cos has created. his lyrics are very complex and reality based yet easy to understand. he sort of pulls you in to a world when he is telling his storys.all in all this cd is worth it especialy if you like siccmade music.

Aside from her most accessible pop tunes, the other songs on this compilation range from eerie experimentation ('music from the film 'Axel') to outright slothy grind core ('hate on sight'). Just compare the sentimental chorale of 'when i was young' to the psychotic wall of noise on 'mongatron' and you get some idea of the diversity on this CD.

The other 70% of the time, the unit doesn't recognize that a CD is inserted--the digital track information shows - - instead of the number of tracks on the CD. When it DOES play a CD, it often stops reading the CD after a few songs... for no apparent reason.I should have return the unit the next day, but life got busy. If you plan to use this for its radio or MP3 functions, you'll be fine. The radio works, but I haven't tried the MP3/iPod function yet. Do NOT plan to play any CDs on this machine.

Still has over 50% left after 6 hours of constant use.GPS signal acquisition is good, holds a lock well. The magnetic compass makes honing in on a location nice at close range where GPS derived heading gets jumpy at low speeds. Color screen is amazing with backlight on. Direct sunlight reading is good without it, but expect to use the backlight a lot if there isn't sunlight to illuminate the screen.

I hate authors that feel the need to sound cool by always referring to bands and such by name when it really has nothing to do with the story. Third, her representation of the gay community is offensive. They are all depressed, nymphomaniacs drug addicts with AIDS devoid of any morals or ability to love. Apparently all gay men wander around just looking for one night stands and have sex with any person they find. Rubbish. Horrid rubbish. Fourth, please Brite, have a little creative thought.

Brite before, and was extremely disappointed in this. I just had this vision in my head of some goth girl sitting on her bed under her dyed-black mosquito net and thinking..\\"Oh, yeah, that's good..I'll make them gay, yeah, and I'll throw some club kids in,and some sharp knives, and while I'm at it, why don't I just mention a lot of really cool goth bands...\\" I think Poppy Z. Brite read \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and then Caleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\" and simply morphed the two ideas into this practically unreadable dross."},{"rating":"2","title":"0_o Two enthusiastic and demented thumbs up!","review":"I am a die-hard horror fan (the more effed up the better), and I loved Brite'sAre You Loathsome Tonight?: A Collection of Short Stories... All I have to say about this is that I was quite profoundly disturbed by reading this book. That VERY rarely happens to me and as a horror-hound I consider it the highest of compliments. What's not to love about gay, necrophiliac serial killers? Eh? That being said, if you're like me, you still may want to ease yourself in to Poppy's style with Are You Loathesome to get a feel for her special brand of crazy before jumping both feet into Exquisite Corpse. You've been warned..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brite continues to titillate her readers.","review":"This third novel was all and more of what I expected from Poppy Z. Brite. The crued details and sensual story lines keep me excited of works to come. Exquisite Corpse proves that Brite is only maturing as a writer. I look forward to new novels from this amazing auther."},{"rating":"2","title":"She gets it right","review":"Having been a professional mortician for the past seventeen years, I can testify that contrary to some readers' claims Ms. Brite's descriptions of human anatomy and dissection are very good, as well as poetic and often sexy. She obviously did her research."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decidedly rare love story...","review":"\\"Exquisite Corpse\\" is a love story set in contemporary New Orleans between a necrophile and a cannibal. Not for the faint of heart (or the weak of stomach). Ms. Brite, through the gore and perversion, is able to provide an insight into both a killer's mind and a killer's heart. Lifting slices from Jeffrey Dahmer's modus operandi, Poppy Z. Brite's \\"Exquisite Corpse\\" is more finely written than her first two novels. If you like true crime, you'll like this novel and all its gorey details."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNPLEASANT BUT BRILLIANT","review":"I'll admit I was a bit worried starting this book because I was so disappointed with the Crow novel the author wrote. But Exquisite Corpse was awesome! Mrs. Brite has a wonderful way of scaring the living daylights out of me, and she really went beyond anything I could've imagined with this book. I really enjoyed the amount of time she took to develop every character within the story without getting too drawn down into it. The other neat things was the book was just the right length. It wasn't too short or too long, plus the ending was perfect. For a reader who's constantly bored with serial killers and cannibals, etc., Mrs. Brite really has taken this kind of fiction to a whole new level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"Overwritten, overpraised. Why this has received so much praise from people who consider themselves intelligent is a mystery. Do any horror readers go to college anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poppy should just take up writing gay porn full time...","review":"...since it seems like that's what she's most interested in. DRAWING BLOOD started off promising till it turned into an endless series of sex adventures between the two main characters. Um, could we get back to the *story*, please?Well, EXQUISITE CORPSE is even worse. You can't go five pages without one of the characters fantasizing about how he'd love to do one of the others up the rear. Once again Poppy abandons her story for a lot of homoerotic fantasy that does nothing but bog the book down and take up space. Such tedium along with a cast of entirely unlikeable characters (another of the author's weaknesses) made the book nearly unreadable for me.I really liked LOST SOULS a lot and I thought I'd give Brite another chance after being disappointed by her second novel, but I think this is it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your so shocked, you cant put it down.","review":"Exquisite Corpse is a book about a serial killer andrew compton who enjoys cutting young boys after or durring death. He meets a photographer named Jay who he becomes campanions with while finding new victums to pursue. This book is very gruesome... im not gunna lie. It is very graphic and could haunt certain people. I read this book in one day, not because its short, because i was sooo hooked on the storyline. Although there are many graphic, disturbing scenes in the book, there is an underlying love story. There is a whole physcology behind the serial killers. Its a great book, but dont read it to your kids at night. I found myself making facial expressions alot in this book. Like opening my mouth. Because its sooo shocking and GRAPHIC. Some of the stuff is really disturbing. This book contains cannibalism, murders, necrofeliacism, homosexuality, alchohalism, and SEX. I thought it was a great read if your an open minded person."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Alright, I have read numerous books and stories by Poppy Z. Brite, but I was NEVER more disgusted. This book is terrible, tasteless, bland and just plain gross. I was really let down and it really was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and insulting to one's intelligence.","review":"I will start by saying that I could not put this book down. I am a lover of horror and gore, and the descriptions were revolting, stomach-churning, and multi-dimensional/sensorory overload. It was exciting (for a moment) to think that there is a writer out there that could really shock me and give me the creeps. HOWEVER..... I was offended and insulted that every gay character in this book was psychotic, depressed, and or suicidal. This is irresponsible writing, and truly only perpetuates negative and innacurrate stereotypes, that the uneduacted and religous zealots will only use as fuel for their dangerous mental rhetoric, behavior, and beliefs. I am sorry that my hard earned money went into this hateful author's pocket. You owe humanity a big ol' apology for such exploitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"haha","review":"hahahahadoesn't compare to Matthew Stokoe.if you liked this, check him out. he wrote COWS and HIGH LIFE.check it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hedonistic Murder","review":"Gory, chilling, shocking. A story about serial murderers who prey on the gay community of New Orleans and London. Violence isn't the only danger here, there is an underlying threat of a virus amongst the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"stand alone book","review":"this book is definatly not of the main steam type. any main stream, i mean. this includes other horrors. when reading this book one tends to get completely wrapped up in it. be warned that the content is highly shocking and that it is extremely watered down in most discriptions of the book. the only way to truely understand the extent and genius of the story is to read it. Brite does a wonderful job at letting the reader get inside the heads of the characters. you can almost understand the reasoning the people try to give for their actions and see what they are discribing. Brite is a wonderful author and having read some of her other books and stories i was not disappointed, although i must admit that at the end of the book i was a little blown away by the themes it covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one at all costs","review":"What is with Poppy Z. Brite? I read \\"Lost Souls\\" years ago and loved it... it's joined my shelf my very favorites. However, it seems that Brite is on a downward spiral. Where \\"Lost Souls\\" was origional, quirky, and eerie, this book is just gross. Do we really need detailed descriptions of a child being tortured? Book after book, Brite continues to obsess over gay men (always disfuntional ones, of course) and either leave women out completely or cast them in the most degrading roles. Perhaps she should just give us the pretense of being a real writer and switch to writing gay porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"the lowest lows","review":"Having read and loved Brite's other novels, I was grossly disappointed by Exquisite Corpse. And no, it was not the cannibalism or the wonderfully detailed scenes of violence--I actually have a very strong stomach. What bothered me was the the way AIDS was handled in the story, the way it turned its victims into monsters. Usually so loving in her portrayal of homosexuals, Brite stepped over the offensive edge in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"the literary equivalent of a snuff movie","review":"while i truly loved american psycho and thought it a good and worthy book, i never thought i'd ever read anything quite so upsetting or graphic or gruesome again. how wrong i was. while bret easton ellis succeeded in making me feel periodically nauseous at the horrific deeds being commited in his book, poppy z. brite managed to make me feel unclean and deeply disgusted too. the characters in this book struck me as so ugly and depraved, so morally bankrupt, that i found it impossible to derive even the merest hint of guilty pleasure or reward from reading it. which i can only guess was the author's intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling","review":"This book was unsettling in the way of making you go to bed as soon as possible because you couldn't handle all the pondering (the ending doesn't leave you hanging exactly, but sure does leave you hanging off a cliff just above a green mist of despair), and then waking up, immediately remembering, and being all disturbed again. Kind of in the way that the movie The Talented Mr. Ripley might. I won't speak about the plot, you can read that elsewhere. It does however, move quickly and keeps you rapt (and horrified, both at the actual plot and the fact that you can't stop reading the gory stuff) . . .and ends in a way that is perfect, but makes you wish for the cheap consolation of a happy, bright, all is well finale. So that's why I gave it four stars. I will treasure this book along with Lost Souls and Drawing Blood because it was just too good, but I think I'm too much of a pansy to really like it. If you're more than hardcore than me, you won't be disappointed at all. Give it a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, wish there are more stories like it out there.","review":"A real fascinating love story. Only she can turn a relationship between two serial killers into a romance. Enjoyed every moment of it, more so than Cooper's Frisk or any vampire stories I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I still say Lost Souls is best.","review":"Some say that Brite's work wasn't her's but truely Dahmer's. That doesn't bother me cause I find it makes it makes it more realistic and I'm into Dahmer-esque stuff myself anyway. I liked Andrew Compton the most, but the other characters didn't draw me in as characters in her other stories. If you really like Poppy's work or are into Jeffrey Dahmer, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is filthy, but, yes! I love it.","review":"Well.... I've read all poppy's books, they're all about beautiful homosexuals and murder. But this one is WORSE.Bodily fluids are really streaming of the pages this time.Still it is wonderfully written, you really experience it (and all her books) with ALL your senses.I think this is a very interesting book, but I don't think psychotic people should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark in a Bad Way","review":"Though I am a big fan of many dark films and movies, I usually like for them to have some sort of moral, lesson or hope to impart. Most of them do. This book is darkness for darkness sake, extremely gross and sadistic, and beyond disturbing. Though well written, I thought it was a waste of time and offered nothing but horrific visions and bleakness. I was so upset by this book, I wanted to write the author, but naturally, she has no public email or way of contacting. I really think she should be hanging her head in shame for contributing garbage like this to the world. I am no prude, extremely liberal and my favorite movie is The Crow, which is quite dark itself. But while that film is about love and redemption, this book is about terrible things. The world doesn't need this kind of darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious disappointment","review":"This book is vivid and incredibly descriptive. For an author that constantly refers herself to be a gay man, she certainly had no problem jumping on the stereotypical homosexual band wagon for this novel. Not only that, but every character is miserable, psychotic, and appears to be almost craving their own demise. The thing I love most about Brite's books is that by the time you get to the end of one, you feel like the characters are old friends. This one fits nowhere near that category. It seemed not only forced, but tastelessly graphic for the sake of pure shock value in most places."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"After reading and loving Lost Souls and Drawing Blood I thought I finally had another author to add to my list, but how wrong I was...The writing was fine, but I didn't care about the story or the characters, and page upon page of colorful decomposition I could have done well without!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well well.","review":"Yup. I should have listened to my gut instincts as soon as I read the ridiculous title, but noooooooo, I had to go ahead and read the whole damn book.A pointless novel loaded with forgettable characters, teen dream goth cliches and gratuitous \\"shocking\\" scenes of sex and gore. Don't get me wrong. I like sex and gore. But this is just shock value for its own sake. And it's not even written very well. I felt cheated. At least it wasn't very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy subject","review":"Brite writes beautifully. That said, the subject of this book is so ugly and depraved and its characters so loathsome, that I honestly can't see any reason for anyone to read this.I honestly have no issue with authors sexualizing violence to a degree, as this is part of the human experience for some people. But this book is just a bridge too far. If you are interested in grotesque violence as pornography, then this is your book. But my opinion is that the world can be an ugly and depraved enough place without literature that lovingly festishizes these elements. It's one thing to describe and try to understand the horrors of the human experience, but it's a whole other thing to hold them up and pay homage to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My one-line summary says everything. I had a general feeling that she was going in for shock-value, trying to get her readers to gag. It seemed that that was the single purpose of the book. Her ending to the story was a cop-out. She really should have developed her characters more, they were hollow and did not feel real. The way that Jay and Andrew met was...to be blunt...unbelievable. It was a \\"hello, I'm a psycho-killer.\\" type meeting. All I can say is that she needed to expand on her characters, cut back on surrounding descriptions, and make the plot more believable. Maybe then I would have gaged. :Sonja"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow how shocking(!)","review":"ho hum, yes Brite's book is very nasty. oh look! somebody's easting human flesh, how shocking(!). basically this book is not all that bad, gross yet nastily compelling. what spoils it is the fact you can almost hear Brite going 'wow how controversial and extreme i am'. she writes like a little girl trying to shock, full of cliches and cod-mysticism. readable, but you'd only ever want to read it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"EQ is a gut-wrenching but ultimately catharctic book.","review":"Exquisite Corpse challenges the reader in many ways, not the least of which is that the reader is drawn in to understand that serial killers are people too. Ms. Brite writes from the killers' perpective and one begins to comprehend that the serial killer's mind, though perhaps twisted aplenty, is not really illogical. Poppy takes the reader through vivid descriptions of horrible acts but this is not done in an indulgent manner. It's just of part of these peoples lives. EQ is highly recommended if one is prepared, perhaps, to face things about oneself that are beyond (way beyond) the realm of the ordinary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and grossly inaccurate","review":"It seems that ms Brite got stuck after the beauty and decay of her previous books. The only way to go was sicker, more graphic and more often. I found this book unpleasant and unpleasantly real but fortunately her descriptions of corpse dissection were so inaccurate that I was able to dismiss the entire composition. Anyone who thinks you can \\"lift out the intestines like a pile of warm sausages\\" or remove the heart and lungs through the diaphragm without batting an eyelid has obviously failed in her research......take it from one who knows....a postmortem/autopsy is strenuous and time consuming and...yes it makes a mess. Its all quite tightly bound together beneath the skin and fascia. So, this is a product of a sad mind...desperate to shock in any way she can, and shock she does but without literary merit and without credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore and More...","review":"'Exquisite Corpse' is a 'on-the-edge-of-your-seat' reading. Based around the mishaps and lifestyle of a wealthy, homosexual sadist, Poppy Z. Brite offers a book littered with such violent and detailed masochistic imagery, I was afraid to turn out the light at night, for fear I might meet one of the main characters in the darkness.A powerful story, many of the characters in the book are destined from the beginning to meet a grisly end - it is so interesting to find out how, though.I would definitely recommend this book to the darker half of literature-lovers, as I loved it from beginning to end and it continues to rate highly amongst my favourite pieces of 21st century writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proceed with extreme caution","review":"So you're a Poppy Z. Brite fan? Read Drawing Blood? Read Wormwood? Read Lost Souls? Consider yourself able to handle anything she could possible deal out? Think again. Do not read this book just because you loved her other work, and certainly don't read it if you've never read her other works. There are things in this book that you can never un-read; she makes you feel things you can never forget. Granted, all you hardcore fans out there won't head this warning- I certainly wouldn't have. So do go right ahead, and when you are done you will know what I'm refering to. All of which is not to say that this is not an incredible book- as always, Poppy Z. Brite is the master of descriptions so vivid that they make you feel, smell, or taste her words. And that is what makes this book so profoundly disturbing and so utterly unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, could be darker.","review":"These fit me very well and comfortably, and seem very sturdy. The arms have rubber coating so they shouldn't scratch the lenses while folded, like so many other pairs I've had. The polarization reflects glare well, but that is most of the protection these offer. I wish they were a little darker. Regardless, they protect my eyes well enough to drive to work. Would (probably will) buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the radar, Flying fisherman makes excellent sunglasses","review":"This is my 3rd pair/style from FF. I've spent upto $100 on sunglasses before, and I'm amazed that $20-30 sunglasses from FF are as good and better. Sporty, good fit, no slippage, light, no distortion, no awkward coloration looking out.These fit my face really well, although they seem narrow (width) on even my angular face. So if you have a thin face, or are female, these will be perfect. For mid to large faces, these look a little small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Green","review":"I have red/orange sunglasses and I have blue- so Green was really different-and in the picture they look really GREEN.

Considering I lost 12 lbs the first two weeks on South Beach and around 18 total for the first 6 weeks, I don't see where this product will do anything for you.

I've owned several ShopVac's and they lost suction after a short time and I constantly had to clean the filters (I bought three to save myself trips outside to clean them). I also needed a tank that wasn't too big and clumsy to empty and Ialso like that I can use a bag instead of the filter. We're renovating an old farmhouse and the dust and dirt are horrendous... this vacuum takes care of all of it.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it only comes with a cheap hose, no tools. I bought the tool kit, which is very sturdy and the hose is very flexible, but it's also expensive. The hose that came with the vacuum broke after a short time of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image quality","review":"The price is good, but the image quality is poor. The images are very dark under indoor light, and if the low-light option is clicked in the driver, then the images are bright but the camera suffers from extreme motion blur that makes it unusable. I compared this to the old 3com HomeConnect (only USB 1 and now discontinued) which was remarkably better under all lighting conditions.For outdoor use, this camera may be fine. The focus ring is hard to use, but only needs to be set once for outdoor use. The little tripod is nice.

There is an art to folding down soft tops, read through your car manual first and practice a few times. Just folding it down without pulling the sides while folding will result in the sides being too wide to fit the cover. When folding down as directed in the manual, the sides will fold in and the cover will fit. It takes a little practice wrapping the cover around the soft top in the middle and holding it tight enough so you can attach and use the zipper. I was able to do it by myself. This product will keep the soft top protected all summer long without worrying about damage.

A delightful little fantasy story, with a simple emotional line. It does have the novelty of bending the usual \\"boy and his dog\\" type story into a \\"boy and his sea monster\\" story. The production keeps things just realistic enough that it has a bit more realism and teeth than the classic Disney family type fare it can be compared to. The effects work for the Water Horse are quite good, and the creature is cute as a hatchling.I'd missed seeing this in the theater, and some of the sequences, particularly when the Water Horse is grown must have been very striking on the big screen. But they hold up well on a TV screen in the widescreen format, so I won't complain.I expect to enjoy watching this again, since it does have a nice level of emotional catharsis. I like that it's about joy found in unexpected ways and places."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep ( Blue-ray)","review":"Another great movie for the family The water horse is one of my sons favorite .

The Water Horse features a charming story that has been well told with the help of a smart director, fine production values, convincing CGI, an appealing soundtrack and a cast of stellar British pros (Emily Watson, Brian Cox, David Morrissey et all, and Alex Etel as the young lead, Angus). Also, the accompanying featurettes are quite informative. The Blu-ray version of the film does it justice.This mature adult and rather picky film buff recommends: Get The Water Horse for your collection, then share it with your favorite young people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watery and weak","review":"I didn't feel that Crusoe (the waterhorse) was the main character of this movie. He felt very incidental through a lot of it. Like he was there just to play a bit part so the real main characters could have epiphanies. Which is sad, because he and Churchill (the dog) had more personality than most of the human cast!I will say that this movie was far sadder and more depressing than I would have imagined. Those looking for feel-good Disney fluff should turn away now. There's not a whole lot of happy in this movie. It has a very dark, depressing feel to it despite some of the more lighthearted moments (mostly starring Crusoe and Churchill). The ending was oh so predictable, leaving me with a 'why did I bother' sort of feeling. In fact, the movie as a whole left me flat. The only highlight is that Crusoe really was adorable as a young creature (not so much when he grew up)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it better the first time...","review":"This movie was just okay the first time I watched it, when it was called Free Willy.

My kids were very excited to see it due to the trailers and cute advertisements on TV. It did have some cute parts that my kids loved but 1/4 of it was too much for toddlers. My 5 year old actually hid under the seat for a couple of parts. My 3 yr old was more tuff but I don't think she realized what really was happening to the water horse in the end. All in all, parents should read the reviews before you have your younger children watch. The cute parts were not worth the more traumatic for young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining - And Not Just For Kids","review":"I didn't see \\"The Water Horse\\" in the theater as not many children's movies appeal these days. So I was pleased to discover on DVD that \\"The Water Horse\\" was crafted with oldschool charm, story, and values as well as topnotch production. The story is simple enough for even young children (although some scenes may be too scary for the very young), but there are also nice touches of sophistication for adults. And when I say sophistication I don't mean thinly veiled dirty jokes, I mean actual drama, humor and story elements that will speak to adults. The special effects are first rate, as is the photography of the stunning Scottish countryside. A real family treat that will stand up to repeated viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very cute movie! highly recommended!","review":"I like this movie, very good for kids to watch especially for boys, it teaches friendship, courage, and the love of animal. Good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Soldiers Were Gone","review":"Have you ever been with someone else for so long that you don't know your real parents? It is based on a true story. It's about a boy named Henk who was hidden during the war. His real parents came to get him, but he doesn't remember them. When they got home they celebrated his return with cake. One day they went to the park, but Henk was afraid because he remembered when a Nazi soldier would come out of his position and try to hurt him. He remembers other things from his past, which help him adjust to his new life.I like this book because it's historical. It was after World War II. It also tells how Jewish people were treated. The soldiers didn't let the Jewish people do anything. After the war the Jewish people could have normal lives. I give it four stars, because it was good. It told what it was like while he was hiding during the war and went on with his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"When The Soldiers Were Gone","review":"I enjoyed reading, When the Soldiers Were Gone, by Vera Propp. The book focuses on the time period of 1945 when World War II was ending. The author writes about a boy who gets sent to a farm during the war to protect himself and his family. The boy, Henk, is really Jewish but he disguises himself as a Christian so the Nazi's won't come after him. This book is very interesting because it describes what was happening during the war from the eyes of a child that is about my age, 10 years old. Henk has wierd dreams about his past, and in the middle of the book he realizes that the dreams are real and that he has actually has a different family. The ending was a real surprise for me. This historical fiction is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"I had to read this book in lit circles at my home school in Montgomery, PA. Overall I really liked this book. The book starts out about a little eight year old boy. His name is Henk he lives on a farm with the staal family. Henks parents had to hide from the Nazi's because they were jewish. Henk was to young to come along so they gave Henk to the Staal family. After the war Henk's real parents come back for him. Henk doesn't want to live with them but later in the book Henk starts to like his real parents. While Henk is living with his real family he gets to do many things that he couldn't do before with the Staal family. Henk gets to go to school and meet a couple of new friends and some enemies. At school Henk finds out about his life and what happened to Jewish people and about Hitler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A great follow-up to the author's \\"The Sugar Cane Curtain.\\" Also available in Spanish as \\"Cartas son Cartas.\\"Less historical background than the first book, but it still gives you all the 60s nostalgia and sociological background.

With Ms. Stout's method of gardening, I will never go hungry. It is possible to plant a few plants (or harvest a few things) every day in the very early morning hours when I can stand to be outside. When my kids come see me, they lay a few bales of hay (or straw) around here and there so I can grab a handful and throw it on anything growing without permission.

It has cut my gardening work greatly--the mulching holds the moisture in the ground = LESS watering! and VERY FEW weeds!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, no work . . .","review":"I bought this book twenty years ago. I read it and didn't do it. Now I am on a farm and have a half acre garden. I re-read the book, and after three years of mulching a la Ruth Stout, and putting in the tomato fence that is described in one of the later chapters, I truly have my garden under control.It didn't happen over night. It took three gardening seasons for the mulching to become very effective, because each year the weeds are under a little better control. Last summer, I wasn't ashamed of my garden, not even in August, when it used to be a complete tangle of weeds. A nice side effect is that all of that mulch turns into wonderful compost, just lying there in the garden. No turning, no nothing, just mulch and let it do its thing.Buy it and try it - it will change the way you garden forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great concept","review":"An amazing lady with a fantastic approach to gardening. She was 50 years before her time. The book is a great addition in the library of anybody interested in growing vegetables without chemicals. I have a few reservations - for anybody gardening in a wet climate with lots of slugs and snails, I am not sure if coping with these in the mulch will be a big problem, I am looking forward to checking this out firsthand. My criticism of the book is that it is written around one topic, mulching, and while the topic is fascinating, it doesnt really need a whole book for the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a garden with less work? Mulch the crap out of it","review":"This is more or less the entire book. I'm saying this so as to save you the trouble of trying to find a copy should it not be available here. Ms. Stout was no doubt an excellent gardener in a large part because she used common sense when it came to gardening. Anyone who has ever lived in a semi-arid climate such as the Great Plains of this country understands the value of keeping the soil cool and moist during the growing season. If you mulch heavily, the ground will retain moisture and require less irrigation and will also inhibit weed growth. The decaying mulch is left on the surface of the soil and becomes a soil amendment in and of itself. There is really no need to turn the soil. Therefore the simple act of mulching heavily reduces the amount of work required in your garden. I wouldn't call it \\"no work\\", but it certainly does reduce the total amount of work required."},{"rating":"1","title":"no work garden","review":"Rather straight forward book, mulch with hay and no need to weed, somewhat rambling and there are much better garden books, I'm sure she was revolutionary at the time and this will remain a classic but there are better garden books.

It was a one time meeting of these improvisers who may come from different schools, yet have learned the art of musical communication and invention through years of working experience. European and American musical sensibilities merge suggesting more commonality than not. The different flavours are still there and in combination, a new one is formed. Everyone plays and listens well. Roy Campbell is particularly interesting in this setting. Both Maneri's and Barre Phillips are solid and sound most comfortable. Shipp and Peterson add their personal touches, sparse in places, dense in others. Overall, it's a very interesting listen and explores the infinite possibilities of ensemble sound. A unique disc by a unique group of musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE READ","review":"i enjoyed this book thoroughly. the characters are interesting, but they could have more to them. their actions are not always explained by way of characterization.

David Morrell, Tom Clancy, Frederick Forsyth, David Baldacci, and others. A few years ago I noticed that Gayle Lynds had cowritten a few books with the great Robert Ludlum (the \\"Bourne\\" series). Since then, she has started writing solo novels and this one is simply a masterpiece. Non-stop action, a gripping plot, writing that is well-structured but not over the top, and characters you can understand.As the storyline plays out, you often find yourself wondering where it will go next...and the unexpected turns just add to the thrill ride. A perfect read for a long weekend or a plane ride because you will not want to put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible....","review":"I look for suspense novels with female protagonists, so I was excited to find Masquerade. After reading it for a while I became increasingly disappointed. The writing was at best pedestrian, but that's often to be expected in a mass marketed book. More disappointing was the plot that was predictable from a mile away. I kept reading, hoping there would be a twist at some point that I wasn't expecting, but my hopes were crushed. The book was incredibly formulaic, right down to the requisite scene with the characters lustfully ripping each other's clothes off for a night of passion.The book was just plain dumb. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unbelievable!","review":"In Masquerade, Lynds' first thriller, she shows some potential and some similarity in style to Robert Ludlum. Overall, however, Masquerade is a book in which I was disappointed and would not recommend. While I am usually willing to suspend belief to a degree in international thrillers, Masquerade just goes out of the stratosphere in this dimension. It's plot, characters and ending are very unbelievable and the dialogue is too corny and unrealistic. On the plus side, Lynds manages to keep the story moving along at a brisk pace and made me want to finish the book to see how it ends. For this reason and her similarity in style to Ludlum, I plan to read at least one of Lynds' more recent works to see if she has grown in her writing skills. Although I did not enjoy Lynds' first attempt as a writer of international thrillers, she demonstates enough potential to warrant a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Read Worse","review":"Thankfully I bought this book in paperback because I would have been quite mad if i'd bought it in hardback. I was expecting a fast page turner and what i got was a book I'm only reading because I haven't anything else to read. The characters in the book are unbelievable as CIA spies, to say the least. Some of the ways they are caught by their enemies are downright laughable. I was starting to think they deserved to be caught. I found myself rolling my eyes many times while reading the book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unrealistic Plot","review":"In my opinion, a good spy thriller has to be believeable in order to be truly enjoyable. This is one of those books where you have to completely suspend disbelief in order to enjoy it. This is probably Lynds' intention -- pure escapist entertainment -- but it just didn't work for me at all, due to the rather fantastical nature of the plot.I also found that many of the characters in this book were two-dimensional, more like cartoons than real people. In the end, I didn't find myself caring about any of the main characters.I suspect your enjoyment of this book will depend on your literary tastes. If you like the work of Robert Ludlum, Iris Johansen and David Baldacci, then you may want to give this book a try. If you prefer John Le Carre, Daniel Silva and Michael Connelly, then I would definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant Stop Reading Gayle Lynds","review":"Whats funny is that while I was reading Masquerade I was telling my wife and kids about it..

The option to have subtitles in English is excellent, otherwise I would miss the meaning of a few things here and there. Otherwise, most things are obvious when relating them to the what's going on in the video. I also like that you see the written Japanese words (in Roman letters), so that you can understand the full pronunciation.

Being the focal point for the group La Bouche, did not hurt either. When Frank Farian found Melanie, he found a brand new star. I really and truly believe that Frank Farian wanted another Boney M when he found Melanie, but instead, he found a great solo artist. Melanie's death took me by surprise. One of the reasons that her death did not get as much coverage on the news, was because Aaliyah had just died in a plane crash. Being that Aaliyah's career was really starting to spark (movie with Jet Li and the movie Queen of the Damned didn't hurt), this is why not many people heard about Melanie's death.

I'm happy that I earned the credits for it but not much else. This is a dismal textbook, plain and simple. It starts in chapter 1 where the authors engage in a lofty praise of reengineering. The fact that many reengineering projects did not accomplish the desired results does not even get mentioned by the authors. So much for their research! The rest of the book chiefly focuses on the description of a database based upon the various business processes. The examples show a very complex database. However, the information provided in the book would not be sufficient to design a similar one from scratch. Overall, this book focuses way too much on an academic view of business with little relation to the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I have read a lot of texbooks over my college career and this book is the absolute worst.

I rounded it off even worse.

I was able to reset it, but since then it cannot effectively pick up satellite signals -- it will find, maybe, one signal even if standing in a clearing. Either the antenna or some other electronic component is defective. A reload of software did nothing.I contacted Thales customer support, and my email was ignored, other than a form email telling me I would receive a response in 24 hours. Maybe the email went to the Bizarro universe, but I'm still waiting for my reply.Any piece of electronic gear can be defective, but the poor integration with detailed maps and a total zero for customer support earns this product ZERO STARS.Buy the Trex instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and reliable","review":"I owned an explorist 100 before and wanted to upgrade.

That was my fault but I called customer service and they were willing to send me the new CDs. I know the customer service is not the best but if you are patient then you should have little problem.

I figured between the reviews, the brand, and the price, it must be a great vac. I was expecting a tornado in a shoe box. Unfortunately, this is the first Milwaukee product I've purchased and been notably unhappy with. Not that it doesn't vacum ok, it does, but for the price I expect it to suck a tennis ball through a 1/2\\" pipe...I plan to keep this vac., but only because returning it is more hassle than I have time for. I had hoped I could attach a longer hose and use it with my various sanders, and I'll still try to, but my guess is that the longer hose will fiurther lessen it's suction. As said, in the past I have had blind faith in Milwaukee's products. I'll be giving a second thought to purchases outside their primary product lines from this point forward.

There were parts of this book that intrigued me. I pick out books by reading the back cover, and then the first page, and that hooked me. But it was a let down as the book continued. I think Ray begins to delve into some real psychological issues here, but unless you plan to analyze the book from a psychiatric view point, you are most likely just going to feel frustrated. I read half the book, then skimmed through, hoping to find something interesting or redeeming, only to find the completely disappointing conclusion (if you can call it that) of the book.

What a waste of time. I also picked up this book because of the back cover's recommendations. I spent the whole time saying, 'Do British girls really grow up that differently than American ones? Would parents really let a supposedly 27 year old man take their 14 year old daughters virginity right upstairs while they watch tv? Do I really believe that some girl is going to cut herself up and let boys feel her up when her family life is not that bad?' (Her parents argue, but there is no mention of sexual abuse.)I just found everything so irritating and unbelievable. I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated that I wasted the time it took to get through this mess. Not once did the author generate any sympathy for the main character. Maybe that was her intent. How does a 16 year old come up with this ugliness? (I also really enjoyed She's Come Undone and I found no similarities between the two.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book I will only read once","review":"I bought this book about two years ago after reading the back of the cover and finding it mildly intrusting. It seemed to take me forever to read it and none of the plot or characters grabbed me. It seemed like the author was trying to fit everything she could(warning a odd description of oral sex, abusive boyfriend, sexual confusion, teenage pregnancy). The writing is a bit flat for a young adult. The main character came off stupid and superficial with her worries about everything. I was board about 50 pages in but forced myself to finish it. By the time I finished the book I hated everybody in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing Talent/Bad Character Development","review":"I thought Pure was going to be a touching coming of age story. It was not. Rebecca Ray seems to have talent as a writer-this was easy reading and I got good visuals of the characters, the setting and what was going on around them. However, the characters remain static throughout the entire book. Maybe that is why Rebecca Ray chose not to name the narrator/main character-we never really get to know her. All we see is her quirks-her apologizing and men abusing her, but we never get to see why. She cuts herself up, literally, but this is not explored any further. The family is dysfunctional from beginning to end, but all we end up with is a 400 page snapshot of examples of the dysfunctionality without any insight or resolution. The ending is abrubt and without conclusion, resolution or insight. I feel that Rebecca Ray is promising and capable of great things, but she needs a little development."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had higher hopes, but it's not the worst thing I ever read","review":"(That award goes to American Psycho). But for such a young author, Rebbecca Ray shows a considerable amount of promise. It would've been nice if the book had been broken up into chapters, instead of just running on and on. Also, I found it a little ridiculous that this 14 year old girls parents didnt seem to mind the fact that she was dating a 31 year old man.There were flashes of promise in this book, but those seemed to be left by the wayside as the plot seemed to stumble along at points, never really coming to any kind of closure at the end.All in all, like I said, it isn't the worst book I've ever read, but there are so many good books out there, I wouldn't spend time reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"was glad to finish this book","review":"I don't think the back cover description of this book really gets to the heart of what the book is about. I stayed up late to finish it, not because it was such compelling reading, but because I wanted these characters out of my life! Plus, I guess I was hoping for something redeeming to come at the end. I just couldn't help but wonder about the actions of the parents -- both towards each other, and towards the fact that their daughter was dating a man WAY too old. I shudder to think how much of this book could be autobiographical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"It's ludicrous to compare this novel to Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone, because the latter possesses a polishness and lyricism that Pure purely lacks. Pure comes off more like a teenage girl's rambling diary than a novel, and probably has less depth and poetry than a real diary. I usually love novels with adolescent protagonists, but this one is uninspired and amateurish and makes me wonder if the publisher published this novel on the basis on the author's youth, hoping to gain a lot of publicity. If you're a 12 to 14-year-old girl, you're better off reading any one of Judy Blumes novels, which portray adoloscent pain with more beauty and subtlety on one page than Pure does in all its 400 pages-- or better yet, if you're a more sophisticated reader, pick up The Virgin Suicides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

The characters never seemed to develope and the ending made me angry. I hated how it just ends.

The story was vulgar and certainly not typical of anybody's teenage years. As I read the story I wondered if Ray was crying for help from her own internal torment. I also was unimpressed by the direction of the story. It seemed more like several pages from a troubled girl's journal than a published story with a message, lesson, or depiction of something one could learn from. There were no hints of the depth of the characters in her family, in which to point to the dysfunction of the whole family system. Through the book Ray defends the father character and offers no glimpse into his private hell. The mother and brother are barely explored; the author herself never offers much more of her own character than the few tidbits of emotion coupled with pain, rape, or abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read, apart from the books I was forced to read in school. The first line was a catcher (\\"I was about thirteen when I started letting the boys feel me up\\"). The rest of the book wasn't about anything. The ending wasn't a conclusion to the nothing, the book just stopped. I am appalled that the book got a publishing deal. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"I saw this book and thought i would give it a try because the first page or so looked interesting, and it caught my attention that the author dropped out of school at 16 to write this book. Maybe she should have stayed in school, or at least, take a writing class. I don't know how things like this get published. She goes on for 3-400 pages about descriptions that aren't even important, she brings up subjects about how she likes to be pushed around or hit by her 31 year old boyfriend when she is 14 or how her best girl friend appears to be in love with her, but she doesn't reach any farther than that. its as if she got tired of writing and decided just to let things lie as if it would be more \\"mysterious\\" or something.

Too vague, too long, too bad. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge let-down, to say the least!","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that so much was left unexplored, although I did not find it to be an easy read. I had to talk myself into picking it back up just to get the thing over with. I also agree with the reviewer who posed the question of \\"who would allow their 14 year old daughter to spend the night with and continue to date a 31 year old?\\" So unrealistic! Highly unlikely turn of events. Huge issues here that were laid out too simplistic in platform, in other words, there were many issues that were left without reason or resolution. For example, why do the parents fight so much? The best friend's relationship with dad seemed really odd, yet 14 year old really didn't take issue with the relationship between her dad and friend--very highly unlikely! I remember when I was 14. I don't agree with the reviewer who draws comparison to \\"She's Come Undone,\\" for there is no comparison in my opinion. Waste of time and money--don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. I had hoped that it would at least be interesting because the writer was so young. I grew to hate the characters more and more as I read this book. I wanted to finish it just so I wouldn't have to deal with them and their absurity any more. I didn't even have sympathy for the main character even though I engaged in plenty of distructive behaviors as a teen, including cutting. Is it just me, or are all of the characters a little mentally delayed? Excuse me but is it not completely disturbing that her parents were letting her \\"date\\"-if you could call it that- a 27 or 31 yr old!

I'm not a big reader, but I couldn't put it down at all. There are some things in there that seem unrealistic, like a parent approving of an older man dating thier young daughter. But I think the author gave a great insight into this teenager's head. The girl in the story is growing up and is confused even though she thinks she knows it all. Like all teenage girls do when they are 14. They think they are all grown up.

A lot of other previous viewers has said that the author showed her youth, or that the novel was highly cliche-ish...this is all true, but isn't that what teenage adolescence is actually like? Other viewers also have said that they thought the author was merely writing about her fantasies and/or exploring sexuality, sorry but thats also what adolescence is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy book","review":"i was supper excited to read this book because i am a teenager myself, but the book has absoutly no point, all it is is about a 14 yr old girl who is a slut, and the book just randomly ends.

I am a fifteen year old girl and i could relate alot to the girl [with no name] in the story. I liked how it was written and it was one of those books that after reading it once, if you read it again then you wished for the plot to change. I would fully recommend this book to most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"I really though this book was going to be good.... then I read it. I was the biggest waste of time ever. I cant believe the author dropped out of school at 16 to write this junk. I really enjoy reading and if I start a book I cant stop until its finished, every moment of reading this was agony. Everytime I stopped reading i yelled out, \\"I HATE THIS BOOK.\\" when I finished it I threw it across the room and was truely dissapointed. Bad ending, bad stroy, bad everything. I'm sorry, but that's how I feel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting views, but obscured by prose","review":"Disturbing as it may be, the author certainly has a point. Life isn't always as beautiful as we may believe it to be, and this awakening is traumatic but necessary. The only problem with this moral is that it's nearly impossible to find.Ms. Ray does an excellent job of imparting the narrator's emotions though voice and mannerism, capturing the angst of a confused fourteen-year-old. The only problem with this is that it's nearly impossible to understand what's being said for lack of readable sentance structure and over-abundant cursing. More than once, I found myself re-reading pages to figure out what had just happened, and by that time, the action had been completely interrupted.In short, the novel was an excellent \\"snapshot\\" of a confused teen, but as a story, I found it somewhat lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"I like many of the other readers who read this book wanted to enjoy it. From the description on the back, i thought to myself She's Come Undone. This in no way could be further from the truth. There are many themes in this book but it just does not move. The first 100 pages was enjoyable but the next 300 pages says the sam thing ovr and over. In SCU you cared about the main character, here you don't. As for the ending, I thought someone ripped pages out of my book because this ending was nothing. I cannot recommend this book and advise people not to buy it. I think the biggest fault of the book was that the whole time the author wanted me to think \\"look how deep I am\\". The ironic thing is that she never went pass the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad use of talent","review":"While I will admit that the author has talent, I cannot grasp what made this book appealing to previous reviewers. The best I can say for it is that I felt compelled to finish it, but I don't know if that is due to the book, or my personality. I found the book depressing, pointless, cliche. I had hoped to read an intersting view of adolescence--or at least a good story--this book encompassed neither. Instead I had the impression of reading a text of a young woman's fantasy of neurosis and sexuality, complete with clueless and inept parents. I realize this happens in life; I don't want to read about it if the author has no depth or twist or basic interest to add to the mix. Don't waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes. Yeah. That bad.","review":"How bad was it? It was awful. The main character is alarmingly unintelligent and ignorant, living life through a fog. And 14 wasn't so long ago for me, and I recall being lightyears ahead of this girl in maturity and just common sense. It's odd that a young author would choose to portray the character as so niave. And unlikable - absolutely no redeeming value here as a person. None of the characters struck any chord or became real whatsoever. And the constant vulgarities and grimy descripties of acne and dirty nails and greasy hair is not great writing or some sort of stark realism. - It was just unattractive and unimaginative and uncompelling. Honestly, the entire book was a waste of money. I hate to be so brutal, but it really infuriated me the entire time I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"This book is completely pointless. There are no chapter breaks so it feels like a long run-on sentence. The characters are never fully described and seem two-dimensional at best. I honestly do not understand the glowing reviews this book has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I too was expecting a lot more from this book, but came away disappointed. I thought I might be able to relate to this book, as I was once a 15 year old involved with a 31 year old man. But this book is totally unrealistic (parent's don't really like their young daughters being preyed upon by old men). Character development was very poor, and not a single one of the characters was sympathetic in the least. It seems like this young writer was going for shock value more than anything else. If this book is indicative of her talent, I don't think she'll go far. If you want to read a good book about painful coming of age, try \\"She's Come Undone\\" by Wally Lamb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by its cover...","review":"I picked this book up based solely on its cover. The design was eye-catching and I thought this would be a great coming of age story, something I could relate to. I was so wrong. This is a very \\"out there\\" story. This story was almost painful to read. I wanted to grab the main character by the shoulders and shake some sense into her. I cannot imagine that growing up in the UK is all that different from the US; if so, I thank God I grew up in the states. I have a daughter myself, and it hurt me to read about this young girl's quest to be accepted. I gave this book two star because the content bothered me so much I kept reading in hopes of a happy ending. Unfortunately, there was none to be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books i've ever read","review":"This book interested me because it's written by a teenager, but it is horrible. It's poorly written and insulting to teenagers--the main character is a complete idiot, and I spent the majority of the book thinking about how stupid she is and how much I hated her. She repeatedly makes poor, self-hating decisions, and I found it impossible to sympathize with her. I'm so sick of these books that are supposed to \\"realistically\\" describe the teenage experience but that end up making teenagers look like a bunch of stupid jerks. Maybe my experience was just completely different from the author's, but I don't think it's realistic at all for a 14-year-old to date a 27-year-old or for her parents to accept it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure awful","review":"the worst thirteen dollars i ever spent. i was fooled by the interesting looking back and front cover and thought it would be a good, realistic book. the first hundred pages or so was pretty good but then it got old. i was tired of the girl saying, \\"im sorry, im sorry, im sorry\\" all the time and i hate the ending, it looks unfinished. i wish there was some sort of sequel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book...Horrible Characters...Horrible Ending","review":"This is an awful book. It has this happy cover with reviews such as \\"enchanting\\" and \\"coming of age\\". I don't know how many people would describe their \\"Coming of Age\\" with self mutilation, sex with 31 year old alcoholic men while their parents are downstairs, and enjoying being beaten and humiliated. I really wish I hadn't ever read this terrible book. It was pathetic. Now I understand why it was on the \\"free\\" pile at a book sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIVEL! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I am ashamed to say I did finish this book instead of putting my time to better use. I kept hoping this pathetic creature would somehow learn from her mistakes and overcome her miserable existance. No luck there, and it wasn't skilled enough writing to make me consider the meaningless existence we all share (if that was the point?). The writer dropped out of school to finish this book and I certainly hope she considers going back. If this book is an example, she has no future in fiction. If I could have given this book a negative star I would have. It is truly the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable and Undeveloped","review":"Generally, I don't write reviews but this book called me out to do so. I thought it was completely unbelievable that a 14 year old would be allowed to date a man in his 30's right under her parents nose. There was nothing in the story to make this believable in anyway. These weren't parents who were unenvolved in their childrens lives or consumned with work outside the home where this could go unnoticed. They were completely aware and even let the man stay overnight in their home. Why? This book gives the reader nothing to explain why this would happen in that home.The characters where underdeveloped and their was no redeeming factors in any of them. They weren't fully developed characters. I kept reading thinking at some point it's going to be explained or tied together. It never happened. When I finished the book I felt very disappointed and unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE CRAP","review":"This book was long and it wasn't in chapters, it's ending was no good either. It really wasn't an ending, the writer didn't really write about what happened next. And the girl in this book has no name, which got weird. I can not believe that (...) writer quit school to write this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I first heard about this book from a review. I recognized the author as being a classmate of mine from law school, and bought a copy, which was money well spent. Moth Smoke is a very good book, one which tells a fascinating story with wit and style. This book could have easily swerved into hipper-than-thou cliches or cheap exoticism. It didn't even come close to falling into either trap, and thankfully is a book by a newly minted attorney that isn't yet another long whine about the evils of law school or a John Grisham copycat.

There is at times a suggestively cinematic quality to the book's structure (e.g. the interludes, set in the present), though I don't think these work as well as the author would like them to. Ultimately, the book is emotionally \\"thin,\\" and doesn't begin to fill the grand historical trappings its author has laid out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual look at life in Pakistan","review":"My book club read this, and it was pretty much a universal rave. Not only does this novel detail upper-class, yuppie life in Pakistan, it also employs a mutliple voice narrative that works really well. These characters aren't neccessarily likeable people, but we end up caring about them despite their faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling first novel","review":"If you've ever wondered what Generation X is up to in Pakistan, this novel will provide some answers. It traces Daru -- a young professional fired from his job -- as he spirals from (outward) respectability to pitifulness. Like all good Generation X books, _Moth Smoke_ has angsty, drug-addled youngsters trying to find their ways in life and generally being disappointed. What separates this novel from others of the genre is that the author succeeds in making us feel so deeply the despair of his characters. I await his next novel eagerly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough debut","review":"I loved Hamid's second book \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\".Reading this book, I was amazed at the progress Hamid made between this novel and his second. The storytelling in this book is loose and unfocused. The characters are not well formed, and Lahore becomes an amorphous place, sort of like the Tokyo of \\"Lost In Translation\\".This book failed to hold my interest, which was disappointing. I am glad Hamid improved his skills and I will be looking forward to his third novel.Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A first novel about drugs...how original!","review":"This novel has been writen many, many times before. It's the same wannabe-Paul Bowles style that 80's never-heard-from-again first novelists like McInerney and Easton Ellis practiced, and that Alex Garland writes now. If the novel didn't take place in Pakistan, it would never have been published.So, is it so wonderfully evocative of Pakistan that you should overlook the obvious plot and writing? Not at all.

Welcome to Pakistan","review":"A slippery slope into cultural and moral relativity. Lahore is a typical big city in a developing country, with a few very wealthy people and lots of very poor people. Mothsmoke is a well-written story of the people betwixt and between, on their way down or up. The story is told in several different voices, narrating the downward slide of the protagonist.

I grew up in the US and never thought I could read a novel about growing up in Lahore, Pakistan and recognise so much: scrambling for petrol money, air conditioning, my father vs your father, traffic accidents, high security, nuclear war, a woman's ambivalence over motherhood, marriage and cheating.

I enjoyed learning about how Handford was set up to be all automated, most books you only hear about Oak Ridge. I thought their willingness to try every avenue to get to the enrichment process seemed desprate. They were afraid that Germany was so far ahead. They took what they knew and were constantly trying to improve on it.I like learning about the spys that he had under his command to see where Germany was and not to give up and complete his task when he found out there was not any progress in Germany.He was an interesting character who got the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST 911 ALBUM SO FAR!","review":"This album Doesnt show the boys true writing talents, but lets you into there taste of music.

I finally realized, after doing everything they said, that the phone wasn't making contact with the base, and when that happened it wouldnt give a dial tone when we picked it up. You had to slam it into the base as many as 7 or 8 times to get it to contact. Then it wouldn't charge, or hold a charge. There is a remote \\"locating\\" tone, but that doesn't work either, because it beeps more loudly at the base station than the phone does, so you can't hear the phone's sound if they are both within hearing range.

How about the entire racing game genre? How about the evolution of shooting games? She likes to repeat the same tired names, Missle Command, Pac-Man, yet neglects huge amounts of games that had wide distribution. Her timeline was incomplete. I guess I should have written this book. A lot of wordsmith, but lacking in substance. The ending is like driving off a cliff. Next thing you know, it's just over.

Its a shame that publishers don't feel that the topic deserves an accurate tome, because it certainly does. Read Game Over by David Sheff instead, there was also an excellent exhibit on the subject that was at the Franklin Institute in Philly, I beleive which can also provide you with an accurate and enjoyable exploration on the topic - or just search the web for \\"Video Game History\\" to get a more accurate view.

The content of the book is already well known my any video game scholar or enthusiast; she has no real new ideas or revelations. And there are other books, such as Kent's Ultimate History of Video Games, that are more suited for a person new to games. She is a gifted writer, however, and her use of metaphor is well done.

As does David Sheff in *Game Over*, Herz finds practically every game and piece of software she writes about to be brilliant and exciting, even decidedly B-grade titles like *FX Fighter*. In addition, the book is full of factual errors. These are not restricted to statements about videogames: while her most egregious error is to claim that George Lucas was involved with the *Wing Commander* series, which Herz also suggests is related to *Star Wars*, she also writes that the 1980s pop group A-Ha are Swedish, when they are in fact Norwegian. While Herz manages to make some interesting comments about videogames, she arrives at them by accident, and later chapters degenerate into undirected rambles.

Most people in the West tend to ignore the legacy the Soviet Union has left behind and this has led to many errors in the field of economy and diplomacy in the past decades. Charles van der Leeuw is much more aware of these historical factors and his description of the Karabakh conflict is a refreshing one. He is able to point to many, nowadays all but forgotten errors of judgement made by the UN and OSCE, but also by Russia and other powers involved in the South Caucasus. It is a shame this work was never followed up with more insightful books on Azerbaijan, because this is badly needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal Errors or Deliberate Political Propaganda?","review":"Mr. Van Der Leeuw's book is incredibly clear in one thing - his enviable ability to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. The worst breech of one's responsibility as a scholar is the inability to record objective reality, a failure that is in itself remarkable in the book. Aside from all the overt signs of successful braiwashing that the author has apparently undergone by his Azeri counterparts, he makes such glaring historical and political errors in the book that even a person with no background in history or political science (such as myself) will immediately pick up on them. The range of errors is almost anecdotal, I have never read a book that makes so many on such few pages.

You can use either the clip OR the ring at one time. Not both. With that said, the belt clip is solid and fits snug on the tool. It does not have the play or wobble of clip that I got for my Kick. Also, as previously mentioned, the clip/ring come off with a press on the unlocking lever.

Overall, a great addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 2 days","review":"I purchased this to go with my new Surge. At first I was impress with the clip but after wearing it for 2 days it began to stretch out. I tried to bend the metal back and one of the tips that anchors into the leatherman shattered almost instantly while applying slight pressure. I cannot exchange it because what I did is classified as abuse but it should have broken so easily. It still clips into the leatherman but swings loose laterally.

Mutli-tools are fantastic to have handy in a multitude of situations, but because of the bulkiness that comes with most belt holsters, many multi-tool owners don't end up carrying them on a regular basis.

I've always loved the leather holsters but recently the snap on the holster for my wave gave up the ghost. Fortunate for me, I thought, that I had bought the lanyard ring and pocket clip set! I like the lanyard ring quite a bit--the quick-release functionality works really well and is superior to the well hidden lanyard ring already on the Wave. After the holster died, I decided to switch to the pocket clip--it's a pocket knife after all. Not three days after switching to the pocket clip (which takes the space of the lanyard ring so they can't be used simultaneously) I sat down, heard a \\"Sproing!\\" noise and felt the sharp points of my now broken pocket clip digging into my hip. I'll be sure to make use of the fairly generous 25 year warranty on Leatherman products but I don't think I'd recommend anyone buy this unless they just want the quick-release ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool clip","review":"The clip is extremely easy to attach or detach so it can be used when you want it or not when it would be in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool but Dangerous","review":"I love my Wave and can't seem to go anywhere without it now. When I saw this product I figured it would give me more choices on how to carry it. The cilp is nice if you don't want to mess around with a sheath, buttons on the sheath, or even closing up a tool you're just going to use again in a few seconds. The lanyard is great if you want a quick release that you don't get from the built in lanyard ring. That having been said, the clip can be dangerous. If you follow the instructions for the knife to oil it, the knife blade can become loose enough that it falls partly open with jarring from walking, jumping, etc. There have been a few times that I've almost stapped myself in the gut. I've had less trouble since I removed any trace of oil from the knife, but I still need to be careful. It looks cool, but buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but temporary","review":"These clips are terribly useful. They keep my multitool from wandering around in side my pocket, and can be removed in seconds if I want to use a holster instead. Unfortunately, the construction of them is poor. I'm now ordering my 3rd one due to the previous 2 having snapped at the upper bends. This is not from hard use, but one from hitting the floor (dropped from waist height), and the other from bumping into furniture.For usefulness, a happy 5 stars. For durability, a measly 1 star.

I was. I enjoyed the first hundred pages, but the thin, predictable plot dragged on and on, until on page 290 I quit reading. Ugh. The characters were idiots. The author repeated details about them halfway through the book that the reader had been told at the beginning. The descriptions of clothes, jewelry and homes were repetitious, too. Yuck.I can't believe people enjoy these kinds of books. This one was not only mindless, but a giant cliche. John O'Hara does this kind of society thing much better. Read \\"Ten North Frederick\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another world","review":"If you're looking for a great vacation beach book or just something to curl up with for an afternoon, this is it.

Its style is hypnotic, compelling, and lush. The story is fascinating. However, the thinly veiled account of the life of Ann & Billy Woodward, and the accidental shooting of Billy Woodward by his wife, is a work of fiction. The true story is documented in \\"This Crazy Thing Called Love\\" by Susan Braudy. Ann Woodward (called Ann Grenville in this book) actually shot her husband when she heard vagrant Paul Wirths running across her roof. He had been prowling the area for weeks and admitting he had been watching her and was thinking of raping her. I advise reading both books, they are both very, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basil Plant knows all things seedy","review":"Boy with money meets a showgirl. He represents a glamorous way of existence she's always longed for, she represents an act of rebellion in a life that's been planned out in advance. They marry, years pass, then... shots are fired. Mr. Grenville is no more; Mrs. Grenville is the one holding the gun.If you're at all familiar with Dunne, then you know his whole schtick is society people + crime, and that's exactly what you get here. Shallow, empty lives, partygoing, closing ranks, getting away with murder--all narrated by a writer who has built his career on gossiping about the rich. Dunne plays the tune nice enough, but having heard it so many times before I find it hard to get excited. Not exactly boring, just too familiar to inspire an outpouring of praise. If this is all new to you, though, I'm sure you'll at least be a little bit impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterling Silver Band","review":"I returned this ring the very next day after receiving it.

I did reasonably like the earlier books in the series, but not this one. I think much of the problem was that the character's motivations seemed so unconvincing that I just could not find myself caring. They would take the most mundane of problems, like putting on a Christmas skit, play them up as of earth-shattering importance, and propose ridiculous ways of solving them, which then tended to have lots of complications. I suppose in some sense this was supposed to all be humorous, but instead, it just kept making me forget why I was supposed to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"This book was in excellent condition, professionally prepared for delivery and arrived sooner than expected.

His nasal whine was unlike any voice I have known...from Hattiesburg to Mobile, from New Orleans to Charleston...and I couldn't watch past the first act. Can we hope for a new disc with Adam Pascal currently performing on Broadway? Everything he touches is GOLD..and he had great reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great production - lousy lead","review":"This musical won Best Musical. Its a good production and a very good DVD with great sound and sharp picture. I really wanted to like this. But the subject matter was handled so much better and with humor in Hairspray. The songs are decent but unmemorable. But the REAL problem is the male lead who insists on talking like Deputy Dawg or James Cagney. I never got used to it. It is so incredibly annoying that you simply cannot buy the bi-racial relationship he gets into with a woman who offers so much, while he offers nothing but obnoxious exuberance and annoyance. If the lead actor were to cut out his speaking pauses while speaking his lines, the show would easily be a half-hour shorter--and sweeter. I love broadway musicals of all kinds but this guy does for Broadway what Jar Jar Binks did for the Star Wars Franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was damaged upon receipt","review":"I have seen this play live and thoroughly enjoyed it so I wanted my father to see it.

Incredible music and choreography, and one of the most talented casts ever on Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"production 5 - main male performance 0","review":"I love musical theatre - not all but most, Broadway, London, other European, unfortunately so very few are available on DVD. The production values of this show, the dancing, singing and most of the acting was excellent but what on earth was the actor portraying the main character \\"Huey\\" (or the director of the show) trying to do - a bad copy of Michael Crawford in the awful British TV series \\"Some mother do have 'em\\". This ridiculously over the top performance spoiled the show for me, apart from the fact that I could hardly understand a word he was saying or singing. I fully agree with the previous review - subtitles would have been helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memphis Rocks","review":"I just got the DVD of Memphis. I don't often write reviews, but had to for Memphis. I live a long way from Broadway now and don't get to see original productions anymore.

The kids spend hours creating elaborate patterns with the colored sticks and balls and make toys for themselves like spinning tops. They are pretty young, and I watched them learn about magnetic attraction and repulsion without being told. The grown-ups make really elaborate structures using the X pieces. Based on the reviews, we bought two big sets right off the bat, and I'm glad that we did. Even with two sets, we still run out of pieces pretty quickly when we're all playing with them together or trying to build something big. We're planning on buying a few more sets. The X pieces really help to make structures stable, and can be used to make many shapes other than just cubes.

I liked this DVD. The footage of the Band of Gypsy's concert is not high quality, and it is black & white, but it is a historic moment captured by the film camera. There are some songs that didn't make it on the concert album. The sound quality is very good.

It is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisting history for a sale","review":"I highly recommend that anyone thinking about purchasing this book read the excellent review \\"Wartime Lies?\\" in the New York Times Book review ofJune 26 by Ed Regis. His concluding sentence: \\"If theirs is the best case that can be made for American germ warfare activities in China and Korea, it amounts to a dismissal of the charges and an exoneration of the accused.\\" It would appear that some historians are confusing the standards of their profession with that of the legal profession. It is clear that a lawyer's services are for sale to the highest bidder--and often, in criminal justice situations, the more outrageous the theories propounded on behalf of the defendant, the more admired the legal counsel becomes. In this case, it would appear outrageousness sells.

This unit, as mentioned previously, ALWAYS requires the user to listen through all messages to get to the most recent. That's if the user has remembered to save them. If the user forgets to press the \\"stop/save\\" message button after listening to them, the next call will force erasure of ALL saved messages. No chance of retrieval.

As a reader years ago, the book I bought at a sale took me back to the time and place in my own imagination. It was a keeper for my library. It would be years later before I discovered my own Mayflower ancestors. Then Willison's work really brought home the 'personhood' of otherwise mere names on a family tree and introduced me to the background and character of a number of my ancestors. Priceless information I could not have found elsewhere.

Unfortunately, that is all there truly is to describe, as it functions merely as a chronology, never delves into the background of any event. Sentence structure is rote and repetative. Opportunities to delve into the more interesting aspects are consistently ignored, and the reader is left wondering whether anything at all truly had a cause. In short, a stereotypical bad history book that avoids all semblance of attention-holding structure. If you are planning to actually spend money on this book, do not.

The information gathered is informative, refresing, and above all (to my knowledge) never before put in print. The interviews with former cast members is a delight, and the behind the scenes look gives you and idea of how the then infact television industry operated.I recommend spending the $49.00 and take a trip back in time and re-live your youth with Buzz Corey, Cadet Happy, Carol Carlyle, Major Robinson, and Tonga... its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary","review":"What a great concept, to travel the nation visiting great microbreweries and talking about the process.

The magnet on the front wheel which is used to contact the \\"counter beacon\\" exhibits varied sensitivity resulting in inaccurate speed and distance readings. For example, my speed often jumped from an accurate 6 mph to 199 mph because the beacon slips and the magnetic signal is poor. The computer also reset the odometer when i took it off of the stage, losing all of my miles. The electrical contacts somehow got dislodged and the computer no longer functions at all. What a waste of money.i am surprised to see anybody giving this product any stars given that this speedometer failed so quickly and in so many different ways.

It does what it promises. I have aways trusted Leviton products, so when I was looking for a tabletop dimmer this brand stood out. We wanted a dimmer for the lamp in our nursery, which has a 3-way bulb. The other review on this dimmer says that they use it with a 3-way bulb, but the directions packaged with this dimmer specifically tell you NOT to use it with a 3-way bulb. Ugh. I wish that had been in the product description. I guess I will rewire the lamp now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, except you must use incandescent bulbs","review":"This was exactly what I wanted. The light dims to a near glow and has a nice gradual gliding switch that goes up to bright light. The big drawback is that you have to use an incandescent bulb, otherwise you don't get a good dim (only goes to what I call \\"less bright\\"), the transitions are jumpy from less bright to bright and the bulb hums. All of those problems go away with a traditional bulb. The tabletop control has a nice firm grip on the nightstand but doesn't stick or damage the table top. The cord is a good length and the green light that comes on when the switch is off is not obnoxious but is bright enough to help you find the light in the dark. I've been using this light daily for about a month and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST singer on the planet!","review":"Don't waste your money or your time!

Her only saving grace is her somewhat good looks. I have no idea why they keep playing her on the radio!

The story is more about Orson, an Elvis fan and socialist. Character development is disappointing, and the story line is implausible, particularly for this reader who has some familiarity with Elvis history. There are too many coincidences that conveniently appear when needed to move the story along. There are also annoying inconsistencies with reality, indicating a lack of homework. Important \\"real-life\\" characters are not accurately portrayed. Some are given short shrift or not mentioned. I really expected much more from Mr. Buckley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis In The Morning","review":"Elvis in the Morning is a chronicle, sort of a Reader's Digest condensed version of Elvis' life from 1958 on with large, large chunks left out. It adds the fictional friend, Orson Killare who, after meeting Elvis in Germany and introducing him to Priscilla, becomes his telephone buddy. He only meets Elvis a few times, on one occasion he advises him to stop making bad movies and get back to performing for his fans. Soon after, Elvis does the TV special. Orson becomes a silicon valley genius and a cocaine addict, kicks the habit and this sets him up to be the person Colonel picks to try to get Elvis into recovery. It doesn't work and Elvis dies.On the positive side, the book is factually accurate, particularly in the understanding of Elvis' addiction. It doesn't glamorize cries for attention such as giving away Cadillacs.It is a book which didn't need to be written, it shed no new light on the well known Elvis story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak writing from Buckley","review":"Since I was surprised to read such weak writing from such an experienced and knowledgeable author as William F. Buckley, I was even more surprised to read so many positive reviews at Amazon.com. Where am I missing the boat? Yes, it was rather clever of Buckley to follow Elvis's life from the unique perspective of Priscilla's childhood friend, Orson \\"Killer\\" Killare. But the facts of Orson's life were so contrived to relate to events of that era in a Forest-Gump-like copy cat fashion and so briefly and rotely dictated, that his character development was extremely weak leaving me feeling no attachment whatsoever to his character. Would I recommend this book to a friend?- -only if he/she was an avid Elvis fan like myself who might enjoy this unusual attempt at revealing the historical background surrounding Elvis's tragic life. I would certainly never recommend it as an example of good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Proven Classic","review":"I first used this product 24 years ago when I began teaching my oldest son to read.

I am now using Alph-Phonics to teach a 40 year old women how to read. I have found the book user friendly and effective in teaching basic reading skills.

I got this book free and if I hadn't already had the HOP set to go through, would have bought these books. They are good, but not as entertaining to children. Also they don't come with small companion readers or anything. It is a nice progression of difficulty, faster than HOP goes.

I find I can go a lot deeper into the Yoga postures without creating strain.There's an instructional Basics section prior to the Flow portion of the video which explains proper body positioning, breathing, weight bearing prinicipals - these are a good prep for the Flow.Overall, Tom McCook gives excellent instruction with a calming and pleasant voice.

The biggest thing is that I belive the author is trying to come to terms with her son's suicide by beliving he is still with her, that death is painless, that the afterlife is wonderful and that his death was not her fault.Grief and guilt will do strange things to a person.I do not reccomend this book as it depicts Stephen's death as a triumph- and seems to be geared for parents with depressed children as a book to pass on.That, I believe, would be a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book is ridiculous. Stephen is a dead child. What a tremedous loss. A suicide. His mother wrote this book after his death trying to convince the reader she communicates with her son after his death.The only thing she convinced me of is she is partly to blame for his suicide.This book should've been written from jail cell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwing this book away","review":"My boyfriend's son committed suicide this past year. We grieve and look for answers. There are none to be found here.You will grieve for Stephen whose mom did little to help him while he was alive.What's more disturbing is this woman's overarching sense of achievement. Although her son is dead, they \\"communicate and have written this book together\\". This woman did not attend a single teacher's meeting, nor engage any medical help, but somehow she's has won some kind of \\"afterlife jackpot\\". Hard stuff to swallow for those of us who fought more valiantly, lost a battle against clinical depression and miss our loved one dearly. Shame on Simon and Schuster for publishing this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid-like Trash","review":"Save your money...........I was actually looking forward to this book, but it's trash.It's about a young boy who off's himself. The boy's mother writes this book after communication with her son after he's dead.What a vile concept. The mother is a real work of art. She asks us to accept the notion tat her son can kill himself and still come back and visit.If this book were valid, I think I might prefer death to life. According to the book, death is pretty okay. You can sleep in, you become wiser...How is this going to prevent anyone from suicide? How about this- death is final- you will never see your loved ones again- it is over! Complete. That would scare me- not this version.The book's saving grace is it has a chapter on warning signs. Ive been there- this part is invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad news","review":"Okay- I've got some bad news. Stephen doesn't live. He's dead. He committed suicide.This book was written by Anne Puryear, pretending to be her dead son.Sick book, sick author.If I had a mother like Anne, I'd probably have offed myself too.This woman is a nut. She should be in jail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful in many respects re suicide","review":"The whole point about the book is to get over the idea that one can communicate with one's loved one beyond the grave - especially problematic allegedly if dealing with suicides. I am not sure if the author has been in contact or not since the messages which come through could easily stem from her noted wide reading on the more esoteric material concerning the after death state etc. nevertheless it will bring comfort even on this informational basis since it is well researched and helpful in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not to good to help someone overcome a lost loved one","review":"I thought the book was good. However I was getting it to overdome a lost one. The first half is not about that issue and the second half has some issues I wouldn't sujest for people with a lost one to read.. so it's a good boook to read, but not for someone who has lost a loved one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh No He Doesn't","review":"Stephen doesn't live anywhere except in the fanciful mind of his mother, the author.I had a son who tried to commit suicide- I bought this book in the hopes of helping him. After reading the book myself, I decided against ever letting near the book.Had my son succeeded in taking his own life, the LAST thing I would do is write a book like this one.In this book, we are explained that her son is ALIVE in the spirit world and talks to her regularly.They laugh, they cry, they're best buddies.Stephen Puryear- my heart goes out to you. You were good looking, had true talent, you had everything.This book breaks my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Believable","review":"This is new age tripe at it's worst.We are asked to believe that Stephen killed himself and then dictated this \\"book\\" to his mother.The book is written by Anne Puryear, the mother, without an ounce of irony.This is certainly not a good book to give a depressed person. Why not kill yourself if you're still \\"around\\" afterwards to write books, talk to your loved ones and spew goofy advice.I'm not very critical of books- I like most everything.I didn't like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having Problems With This One","review":"I hate to write a negative review, but I have real problems with this book.I'm sure I'm going to offend some people, but the very concept of this book offends ME.The book, which is meant to be taken seriously, is about a young boy who takes his own life by hanging himself from a tree. What a tragic end to a promising life. But that's not the end of the story- it's the beginning.According to the author, the boy's mother, the young man comes back to dictate most of this book from the afterlife.Sounds like a joke, but it isn't.I could say more, but I'll stop here. I'm sure overwhelming grief is responsible for some of the questionable judgement the author used.I'll end by saying I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and I would especially warn against giving this book to suicidal young men or women.They might just get an entirely different message than the one the author intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Story..My Way Living Life Full Circle","review":"I truly enjoyed this wonderful work of Marilyn Dean.

Anyway, now I have a 19.2 saw, drill, five batteries with no way to charge them. Since the charger is no longer stocked or has been discontinued, about $1,000 worth of tools are useless to me. Way to go Porter Cable! I guess I too must switch to Milwalkee. By the way, it sounds to me that the only favorable reviews were written by Norm & Tom of This Old House under alias.

A little research yielded this website and all of the BAD reviews regarding Porter Chargers.

Conversely,in the winter they need to come up to \\"temperature\\" to begin charging and use time is, in my opinion, significantly reduced.

The belt clip is a major asset for me. The batteries usually last for about 60hrs. The headphones are more than adequate.

I use it only when I am walking on the treadmill, but it gets a lot of use and it is holding up very well. Very glad I found this as I have a lot of cassettes that I don't want to give up.

The characters seem to come alive, and what characters they are too! This novel has almost everything. Action (great battle scenes), love (very tasteful sex scenes), and humour in good doses. I found myself laughing out loud more than once. And there is also magic and fantasy, although not enough to make it a fantasy novel. Just enough to make those times seem very magical and mystical.

It is a classic of conservative thought. Not libertarian or pro-capitalist thought, either, CONSERVATIVE thought.What does that mean? It means that Kristol faces up to the fact that capitalism has some anti-conservative implications, its profit orientation and individualism can undermine the stability of families and neighborhoods. He is not willing to accept that price, and thinks that capitalism ought to be reigned in. That is why he gives it only \\"two cheers\\" rather than the \\"three cheers\\" customary for unconditional approval.This book is full of insights, even when it aggravates."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wasn't a fan I would have been bored to tears","review":"This video talks a good hype, but has damn near nothing to back it up.

Well, if you knew absolutely nothing about Marcinko and Red Cell, then sure MAYBE you could come away with some new information. But for fans like me it is a total waste of time. What little video of the operations we do see is vague and doesn't show much of their training. Maybe their physical prowness.

The binding appears to be sturdy and should hold-up.The features include brief introductions (I'll comment on that later) and a rather extensive index. There is also a short introduction by Huntington Cairns. The texts also include the standard line numbering from the Greek text.The brief introductions are laughable and can (and ought to be) skipped. Edith Hamilton, though a respected woman, is not a Plato scholar.

I liked it. I think it gives a fair image of the South after the Civil war, although I am Dutch.Though Faulkner has been compared to very difficult writers as Proust, and his style and works often have been called hard to understand, I thought it excellent written. The use of metaphor and symbols in this book is very stunning. E.g. When father Sartoris comes home from a lost battle, the first thing to do is build a fence. Yes a fence to keep northern influences away.The book gives some good examples of the change in relations between black and white people. It helps to understand politics and society in Southern states."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible first-time Faulkner","review":"This book is actually a chain of short-stories that Faulkner wrote during the mid-thirties and then collected them in novel form.

It's not a lightweight book, though. It is powerful and often neglected.

However, after reading a few of these shorter tales, I realized that they were almost as good as one long story. They were ingenious, funny at times, full of what I had come to expect from Mercedes Lackey. At the beginning you finally receive the story of Tarma and Kethry's first meeting and their oath to Tarma's goddess. At the end was a satisfying \\"mini-novel\\" regarding both Tarma and Kethry after they had settled into running their school.

I felt the book strayed too far from the original purpose of Heinlein's excellent book. This novel detailed the military aspect well, but completely missed the philosophical aspects of Heinleins book that made it a classic. The book is often thought of with the movie, even though they are nothing alike. It is unfortunate that this other seemed to have never even read the novel Starship Troopers, much less adhered to its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent me a super-old version","review":"After ordering, the vendor emailed me and said that the one he had didn't quite look like the picture.

Beckinsale was so bland and I thought the acting seemed forced throughout. Knightly's character lacked any charm, which made me wonder why any woman would fall for him. The version piled on the foreshadowing so that you didn't even need to guess what was going on between the characters and this aspect particularly disappointed me and did not seem true to Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"kate a little full of herself","review":"I guess the thing that turned me off about this edition of Emma was when Kate Beckinsal was complaining about Gwyenyth Paltrow. Gwenyth has legitimate acolades, while Kate is mainly known for leather. I enjoyed the grand production more than this one, and was swept away by the acting and sets that the hollywood production was able to achieve. I usually prefer A&E productions, but this is an exception to that review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paltrow's version is far superior","review":"I saw Gwyteth Paltrows version of Emma first, and this movie did not live up to it at all. Kate Beckinsale was marvoulous as Hero in \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\", but in this movie she makes Emma seem nasty. Harriet was a little waif, Frank Churchill was to flirty (Ewan McGregor did a much better job), and Mr. Knightly was constantly angry with Emma. You never got a chance to fall in love with him like you can in Gwyneth Paltrows version. The costumes, sets and music are pretty bad, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic!","review":"Enjoy this verison more than any other, this verison the actors seemed as though they could have really lived the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"i washed it but not whatched it yet","review":"we have the movie in vcr form so we liked the movie be fore we bought in dvd form ok"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I love this story and this is a good version although it is not my favorite version of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Best Adaptation!","review":"Please watch THIS adaptation.Do _not_ taint your minds with the insipid version with G.P. Although she is a very lovely actress in many other movies, she is leagues behind Kate Beckinsale's \\"Emma\\". Beckinsale is Emma to perfection. And Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley is right on as well. I had this one to begin with and rented the Hollywood version with Paltrow and almost couldn't get through it. If you have the slightest regard for staying closer to the text of Jane Austen, stick with this adaptation. It is fabulous! I haven't seen Beckinsale do as well in any of her other roles, but she is amazing in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good adaptation - if a little dark","review":"I really liked the Kate Beckinsale version of this famous novel. However, I read the book, and it was intended as a humorous look at the \\"elite\\" in society. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance, as well as Mr. Knightly (in the Paltrow) version, seem to keep more in sync with Jane Austen's intended voice. Still, a great movie....watch both, and make your own comparisons. Both pick up different aspects of the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma - Not my cup of tea","review":"The performances were passable - in my opinion Mark Strong did a fine job. Since this dvd is an early presentation, sorry to say I was disappointed in the quality and could do nothing to improve the viewing experience.

Yes, I understand \\"Clueless\\" is a modern retelling of \\"Emma\\" but it is still different in several pertinent ways.) Beckinsale's portrayal is EXACTLY how I would expect Emma Woodhouse to look and behave if she were a living breathing person.Thank A & E for giving us a \\"real\\" Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Emma Jane Austen described","review":"This version of Emma doesn't begin to capture the essence of the heroine, Emma. Jane Austen's Emma, while possessing some inbred snobbery, is still a highly likable, innocent character who develops and matures as the story moves. The Emma in this adaptation is not only snobby, she's boring and seriously lacking qualities to make her even likable. The whole video lacks the lightheartedness Jane Austen infused in her book and which the Gwyneth Paltrow version captured so beautifully. If you liked the book, get the Gwyneth Paltrow & Jeremy Northam version instead, and save yourself a lot of disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!","review":"I was lucky to see this Emma first before the one with Gwyneth Paltrow in it. This one was so good it made that Emma look bad. It was crisp and perfect. I loved it! Truly it is the best Emma that's come out yet!Kate Beckinsale was Emma. She played naughty very nice! And her co-stars let me not forget...they were all great... the casting was perfect. The chemistry of the characters are unforgettable.It is quite an adventure trying to figure out, if you've not seen Emma before, who loves who. It's enjoyable and plays miscommunication very well. I was quite fascinated with their lives and swept away.Indeed the smug attitudes and mockery of one another and the misfortunes, and let me not forget the childish, prudish Emma make it a top choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...no thanks","review":"Please do not bring out ye flogs and whipping posts. I just didn't like this version of \\"Emma\\". Specifically, I REALLY did not like Kate Beckinsale's take on Emma. She came across as snobby and frankly unlikeable. Maybe that is staying true to the literary character but still, not a pleasant person. Maybe I can blame Gwenyth for my dislike, she spoiled me with her sweet, naive portrayal of Emma. However, many reviewers here have valid points regarding this version of \\"Emma\\" (Knightley, for example, seems to be just right) but in the final analysis, I'm sticking with Ms. Paltrow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of copies","review":"The transfer was less than ideal, bringing it's overall rating down to four stars. There is a small white line that dances across the top of the screen most of the way through the picture. But this is the it's only shortcoming.

The others don't compare with this one. Kate Beckinsdale is very good as the lead character and the production is much more realistic than the others out there. Emma is a difficult book to produce it is a bit thin and shallow. This is the first show I've seen that has made Emma as realistic as possible. It really works! I found myself engaged in the story and feeling for the characters. It works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted and more","review":"Absolutely wonderful adaptation. If you have to pick an Emma, this is by far the best.Emma is endearingly flawed. She is perfect in her imperfections. And she sometimes interferes where she shouldn't. However, her intentions are always just and good from her point of view. Kate Beckinsdale is perfect as Emma mainly because the other characters are perfectly cast. Don't even imagine anyone else as Mr. Knightly!!! Mark Strong is perfect as Mr. Knightly in the way that Colin Firth is perfect as Mr. Darcy. Enough said.See this movie. It's fun but also very touching as Emma discovers that the human heart is surprisingly difficult to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The better \\"Emma\\"","review":"As compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow version, the A&E version is by far the better \\"Emma\\". First, Kate Beckinsale was far better than Gwyneth in portraying the character. Gwyneth didn't make me believe she was an 18th century aristocratic lady, whereas Kate did. Second, the A&E version better portrayed the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma. Emma was much, much younger than Mr. Knightly, which was in keeping with the fashion of the day. Third, the character development was superior in the A&E version. Lastly, the A&E version was truer to the period than the one from Hollywood.Bottom line, if you want a version of Emma that's truer to the period, go with the A&E version. If you want typical Hollywood fluff, go with either \\"Clueless\\" or the Gwyneth Paltrow version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is by far my favorite movie production of Emma. It is very well cast--I especially liked Kate Beckinsdale as Emma, Lucy Robinson as Mrs. Elton, and Samantha Morton as Harriet Smith. Most importantly, to Austen fans, this excellent adaptation is both entertaining to watch and true to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very one dimensional Emma","review":"Kate Beckinsale's performance, to me, seemed extremely one dimensional. We certainly see the vanity, but none of the compassion which makes Emma a worthy (albeit immature) hero traveling along her arc. By comparison, Gwenyth Paltrow's performance (within a year) shows us a misguided socialite, who repeatedly displays compassion.The best example might concern Emma's view of Martin. While Paltrow tells us he is beneath her, she also points out that were he less fortunate (than he is), she would feel honor bound to help him. Kate's Emma, on the other hand, simply despise him for no good reason.Having watched both features back to back, Beckinsale strike's me as a twin sister of Mrs. Elton, rather than Austin's kind-hearted, but misguided Emma.I would recommend forgoing this version and taking Paltrow's instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Emma yet!","review":"My mom, sister and I all enjoyed this version of Emma very much! I just love the romance it has to it. Other people have said Kate Beckinsale's Emma is annoying/dark/whatever but I thought she was absolutely perfect. The rest of the cast was very well chosen too, especially Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley... there was great chemistry there. My mom thought he looked too young but I don't care. :) Another big reason why I liked this version better than the Gwyneth Paltrow one was that it's more true to the book, both literally and in spirit. The GP version just seemed a little too Hollywood to me, too molded to fit the masses.Of the three versions of Emma I've seen, this is my favorite! I'd say watch this one first, the GP version second, and don't even bother with the others, unless you're feeling very tolerant."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Version","review":"I absolutely love this version of Emma; I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as Emma and Mr. Knightly. The scenery, performances, screenplay, and attention to detail combine to make this a wonderful adaptation.I have another verson of \\"Emma\\"; but nobody does Jane Austen better than A&E;/BBC. Their attention to details such as costume, music, scenery, food, etc. can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma","review":"Having watched this movie once is enough for me.

Don't bother.","review":"I might have enjoyed this more if I hadn't already seen the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma. This one just doesn't capture the essence of Jane Austen's excellent novel.

The set piece dance at the end featuring the, here, three couples joined in bliss, Knightly and Emma, Frank and Jane, and Harriet and Robert Martin (Robert Martin?

The humor, tenderness,and interplay between Emma and Mr Knightly was lost in this version. Get the other version for the music, story, characters and beauty of the unfolding love between Emma and Mr. Knightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much superior adaptation of Emma","review":"This version far surpasses the Gwyneth Paltrow version, both in actors and story. I much prefer Beckinsale to Paltrow, and very much prefer Mark Strong's more attractive, strong Mr. Knightley. Very romantic. The father is delightful as is Emma's tenderness toward him. I love Emma's fantasy scenes about the results of her matchmaking and the minister and his wife are delightfully obnoxious. A more subtle and well-acted Emma in all. Highest recommendations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An overshadowed gem","review":"Forget if you can, Gwynneth Paltrow's worthy but stiff Emma, which was so marred by the supporting cast. This is a supberb adaptation of Jane Austen's book, convincing in it period detail, and utterly charming. Every character is, somehow, as one would like to imagine them. Kate Beckinsale makes Emma convincing in her follies, and utterly warm and attractive, as she ought to be. There is a particularly brilliant performance from Mark Strong, who makes the moralizing Mr. Knightly smoulder. In supporting roles, Bernard Hepton as Emma's self-absorbed hypochondriac father turns in a finely tuned performance that is never caricature; and, equally, Prunella Scales as Miss Bates maintains great dignity in her comic turn. Beyond the excellent performances, this is lovely to look at. Even if you are not a \\"Jane-ite\\", try this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen's Emma - DVD","review":"My wife and I enjoyed this on A&E and bought a copy on VHS as soon as it became available. The production is extremely well done and is true in spirit to the novel. Our tape is now worn out and it seemed like a good idea to pick it up on DVD.

But then I thought to try again, but this time I mapped a list of characters as I read. This helped greatly but suddemly I thought this was all a joke. Characters kept appearing for maybe short amounts of time and then more appeared and at the end of the day I never knew or cared about anyone.

I did not expect this camera to be spectacular, but I did think that the camera would take decent pictures in dark places. I was wrong! This camera requires a certain amount of lighting. You can change the the brightness of the camera but that only helps a little. The pictures tend to be somewhat grainy if taken a few feet away. I did not try using the mp3 player, nor will I ever because I have no use for it(i have an ipod). I did end up getting a better but more expensive camera.

The flash serves absolutely no purpose not to mention its akward placement; your hand almost always covers it when taking pictures.The pictures comes out dark with or without the flash so the camere is best used in daylight..ONLY, so forget about capturing any night time activity with this camera. The pictures seem blurry and the differnt quality choices seem not to make a difference. The video isn't bad though not enough memory to record much. The memory card slot keeps popping open, but thats the least.The manualis useless. The MP3 player isn't bad either, i'll probably use it more than anything else on this camera, but the problem of memory arises again as the camera doesn't come with any external memory i.e memory card,this has to be purchased separately.

As with all the previous posts the video camera works fine for kids and non important things, if you don't have any problems and can get it cheaper. I purchased a brand new one just recently from a local store for $50 and that was a little too much for what I got. When recording video you can't hear any one very well except your own voice. You have to be right in someones face to hear them. I purchased it to replace my old Canon point and shoot, bad sensor, and ironically it still does better with sound. The positive side is the video is super nice and working with MPEG4 is cool. Otherwise cameras that cost $100 or at $150 are way better. Do your research...which by reading this you are.

I can't get any infor on the website, and the instructional DVD won't work in either my PC or DVD player so I'm at a loss as to why.

Well, here's a look at the events that inspired that song.On January 30, 1972 Catholics living in the Northern Ireland's city of Derry march for human rights denied under British rule. But this wasn't an ordinary march by any means. Thirteen marchers were shot dead during what was later termed \\"Bloody Sunday\\".This movie alternates between both sides of the firing line. Efforts of the march's organizers leading up to the march along with several young men who participated in the march are captured. In addition, the military readiness of the British soldiers is also revealed.

If you are not familiar with what lead to this place in history, first research the appalling conditions that Catholic Nationalist were forced to live under, then you will understand. In the sixties and early seventies Catholic Nationalist (a minority in the North) were treated much the same as how Black Americans were treated in the South in the 1950's.

The only drawback is that the liner notes -- including the lyrics -- are in Japanese Kangi.The big problem with this item's listing on Amazon is two-fold. First, it is mislabeled. If you notice, it's listed in Amazon as the NETWORK album by Network. In fact, if you look at the cover, the album is NIGHTWORK, which was their second album. The review calls this their first release, and that's the second problem. Network's first album was in fact titled NETWORK! And their first album was, in my opinion, much better than NIGHTWORK.

I only wish that LM would have packed a small washer that fits between the clip and screw to solve the play problem...but once again it does not affect how well it clips to your pocket. I also have not had any problem with the tool coming open in my pocket.

Here is one example of my disappointment: Brennen describes the \\"universal energy field\\", and claims that through her high-sensory perception she can see \\"orgone\\". But her description of orgone (little tranlucent globules that come down from the sky) sounds a lot like the little bits of crap that float in the liquid on your eye. (You normally don't see the crap floating on your eye because your brain, quite rightly, ignores them). So, either her great ability to observe ('high-sensory perception') is just really poor observation or she doesn't adequately describe what she is observing. Either way, the book is misleading.I suspect what Brennen is actually observing through her 'high-sensory perception' is really optical illusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for these quacks!

All there is are claims by Ms. Brennan, which cannot be validated in any way.The book did give me a few laughs though, although it's sad that people who actually need medicinal care believe this nonsense. People who feel they suffer anything should better see a real doctor instead of getting involved with quacks like Brennan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cautions","review":"Although this would be a wonderful book for anyone who wants to heal who can already see energy and auras..There are still plenty of us who can't, and the author makes no adjustments for us visually stunted folk who can't see colors, but can feel general states.

I work with computers, and this has been a real help. Instead of carrying a full-sized multi-bit screwdriver, I have a compact Wave and my bit set.

Yesterday, when I was unsnapping it (herculean effort to do that by the way) one of the snaps themselves broke. Now I have only one functional snap. The other one broke by separating the steel round cover part of the snap away from the inner/inside portion - so it isn't fixable.Because this isn't an expensive item to begin with, it isn't worth the time/trouble/money to return it. I was basically happy with this product until the snap broke.

Where would be the juicy, behind the scenes stories? Mr. Enberg shows that selective story telling and evenhandedness can be very readable AND interesting. What comes across is a life of dedication, hard work and a love of sports, recognizing that are multiple sides to a sports story.The comment by one reviewer that he is the worst announcer ever, while it doesn't address the quality of the book, is simply incorrect. One only needs to mute the TV while watching his broadcasts and observe the poetic flow of his delivery while his booth-mates, many of whom are excellent, stutter and stray from the game. There are some personal lessons in the book and much appreciation to be gained from what it takes to produce a quality sportscast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst tennis announcer ever","review":"This book is typical of an announcer who thinks any sporting event is about himself and how much he can talk during it. I (thankfully) am not exposed to him on telecasts other than tennis but that is plenty.Do you think someone commentating on tennis matches for 10+ years would (or should) know NOT to talk continuously THROUGH the points?They should and he doesn't. He ruins every tennis match he talks, babbles and mutters over. His hallmarks are: long-winded never ending run-on sentences (about nothing), beginning to talk almost every time a player throws the ball up to serve (ensuring he will talk over and through the entire point), and dominating the amount of talking. If there are 3 announcers he will easily STILL talk 60-70% of the time!This book is more hot air from a know-nothing self absorbed announcer.

It fails to mention the Catholic Church and the fact that they have maintined records for hundreds of years. If one has Catholic relatives, as I do, the Catholic Church would be the logical place to look. Had I not already known this, I would have been left uninformed by this book. That is just one example.

Yes I would recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leatherman needs to wake up.","review":"Leatherman needs to wake up as a company. What's with the new-found love for Velcro? What happened to the old fashioned snap-button closures? The ones that don't wear out after a few months of normal use and make about 1/6th the noise when you engage them? And is the sheath about twice the size of the old-style Wave sheath? Yes, to hold all the bits that you might use once a year. Still better than the leather version. Sad to see that Leatherman, Oakley and the rest of them are trying to fix things that definitely were not broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"This is the best case for my leatherman. Very durable and very strong Velcro. Idk boot you all but I need some thing strong I'm a IRONWORKER and my tools take a good ten hour a day beating. And with my harness on this case still upholds. So I rate it a five."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than that new fake 'leather' sheath","review":"I had reservations about buying this sheath after being so disappointed by the lousy, heck let me say it, aweful quality of the 'leather' sheath that ships with the Wave these days. The old ones from years ago were great, it still have one and have been using it for a decade!So this nylon sheath fits all 3 of my Waves just fine. The lid/flap closes well as the velcro strip is about 2 inches long and a little over an inch wide. The belt loop should easily accomodate up to 2 inches, even on a thick leather work belt.I am a little concerned about the single point stitching and how it will hold up over time.There are also what I am assuming 2 side pencil pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought out...","review":"This sheath handles the my New Wave and the extras I added very nicely. It's a little more bulky than expected,but that's only because it can carry the extra bits I ordered.

Honestly, I would say this sheath is equal in quality and reliability to the Leatherman Wave multi-tool itself. While the velcro does make noise (is there any velcro that doesn't??) and it will eventually wear out given the properties of the hook/loop closure system, the retention of the closure is nice and keeps the multi-tool adequately secured. For the price it is an especially good buy, I also recommend purchasing the additional screw-driver bits for the multi-tool. While you will only need to use a few realistically, having more gives you options and they will also fit inside this sheath without unneccesary bulk. There is also some space on the sides to add a small permanent marker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best leatherman holster out there","review":"I can hold wave, a aaa light, a zebra telescoping pen, and the accessory bit set for wave inside this thing.

However, I found it difficult to use from the ground. The pitch of my roof is 4/12 and, after attaching several extensions to get far enough from the house to get the proper angle, I found the Sno-Knife awkward to use. I then used the Sno-Knife (with one extension) from a ladder leaned against the eaves of my one-story house. This worked well for me, but some people may not be comfortable on a ladder in winter. I was very impressed how quickly the Sno-Knife slid snow off my roof (I only used it on fairly wet snow). I also was impressed with how I could remove snow at an angle to the side, so it did not slide onto me (I would guess that Sno-Knife is better at this than other roof-clearing products). Sno-Knife should be easier to use from the ground on steeper roofs, but question its use with two-story houses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product.","review":"Sturdy mailbox, but needs about 3/4\\" spacer under the bottom to mount flush on a horizontal surface as the back of the box extends below the floor of the box.

I had taken the PC burned music Cd's out of my 2001 Camry changer when I recently traded it for a newer Lexus ES series and although they played perfectly in the Camry they skipped and cut out in the Lexus. I ran the cleaner with no improvement, but after researching further I learned that CD's created at a fast burn rate can cause this problem. I burned new ones at 4X and problem solved.

I returned the first unit and tried a second unit only to find that it did the same thing so it was also returned.I liked this DVD player but it is very distracting for the movie to stop suddenly and so sadly like one of the previous reviewers I will not be using this unit until Toshiba fixes the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Playback Pauses Unacceptably","review":"Unfortunately, I like the other reviewers here found that my 4980 unit paused unacceptably and randomly throughout playback (usually about once an hour during a movie).

I quickly returned that unit.I contacted Toshiba once again, and still claiming ignorance of any known issue with the 4980, offered to replace it with a 6980, worth about twice as much. I readily agreed, and if they indeed do so, and it doesn't have the pause problem, I'll be quite content."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD player","review":"This player upconverts 480i to 1080i, which was the primary reason I purchased it. It does that nicely, although it took a little bit of setup to get it working. There are two things I don't like about it. The first is that it is slow to respond to input commands. This often causes me to hit the button a second time which then doesn't give me the result I wanted. Second, when playing a DVD that is in 4:3 mode (a purchased television show for example), the default is to show it full screen on the TV, which means everything is stretched out. There are multiple settings that have to be changed to get it to display properly. I think that should be automatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"I primarily bought this unit for the HDMI/upconvertion.

The position of the speakers is about 50 feet from the source. Monster cable alone would be over half the price, as I would have had to drill through the floor, crawl under 2 sets of icky tight spaces to pull the cable, etc., etc. My time and money would have broke even with the cost of the units BEFORE even tackling the question of which bookshelf speakers to buy.

Well . . . when I tried to place them in another room, the sound quality was terrible. The hiss from the speakers was louder than my old cordless phone and the music signal often broke up. This despite attempts to adjust the frequency and placement. All this occured when they were only 40 feet from the transmitter (albeit through two rooms), they only worked reasonably well within 20 feet of the transmitter. The claim of a 300 foot range is clearly ridiculous in the real world. Less than a day after receiving them my wife and I agreed that they weren't worth it. I would only recommend them to someone who plans to use them in the same room as the transmitter (or really close to it), otherwise the poor sound quality far outweighs the convenience that wireless theroretically offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great after some work","review":"The wireless speakers work well, with much greater sound quality then I expected. The only issue is that it took some time to adjust the speakers and transmitters to the right frequency (the one with the highest quality of sound that didn't interfer with the 900 MHz phone) but once that was accomplished everything has been working perfectly. An hours worth of hassle doesn't seem too bad for a long term solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"The speakers are supposed to work up to 300 feet away.

So I ordered it. Big disappointment. It seems to work fine within about a 10 foot radius of the small signal station, but beyond that reception is sketchy at best--not even as good as my 900 mhz phone, oddly. In particular, the system seems to have problems when the speakers are not in line-of-sight contact.

I can cleary understand the dialogue between Lee Marvin and Mifune yet the film could have pumped up a notch with at least a shred of Budo action from Mifune. Its evident from their first encounter on the beach that Mifune's raw talent could have produced a dramtic fight scene but they are left standing there, fiercely gazing at one another with no climax.Chanbara films of today are far more entertaining and not conservative like Hell in the Pacific. I recommend \\"Seven Samurai\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didnt go through hell","review":"The movie was great, and an absolute classic. The characters wre well established and thought out.

There is also a Alternate Ending on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best WWII Film","review":"\\"War movies\\" generally exaggerate, or trivialize, or ignore the facts and they rarely bring you deeply into the actual feelings of the participants. This one does the best job of any, and both stars make Tom Hanks look like a piker. As enemy combatants (one American, one Japanese) forced to fight and then cooperate on a remote island, the two actors make you feel for them -- and through them, the entire world caught up in WWII.

Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico. It appears to me they may have also changed the formula.

Before this I was using Regenepure which was working pretty well but is a lot more expensive. I saw this was ranked high and you get huge bottles for pretty cheap so decided to try it, but I think I might have to go back to Regenepure.

It is great to have the popular Rhapsody-Concerto with such a fabulous viola soloist - Tabea Zimmermann. The last movement is particularly intense and engrossing.The viola concerto separates two works written for the same unusual combination - piano trio and string orchestra. They are wonderfully played by the Trio Wanderer. These works should be far better known than they are, and hopefully this disc will help in that regard.The first piece (Pamatnik Lidicim 1943) is a serious and moving elegy to the victims of a Nazi massacre in a town near Prague. Martinu's sound-world in this piece is unique and searching.The Gurzenich Orchester Koln under James Conlon play brilliantly and the SACD sound is clear and well balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my old VCR","review":"I was ready to discard my old VCR when I saw this product on Amazon.

Nathaniel Parker plays a landowning Oxford grad who decides to become a police detective (a la Lord Peter Whimsey, who was far more interesting and entertaining). The decision is questioned by his peers, and rightly so, because all he brings to the table is a pretty face, a cow-eyed look, and an aggressive manner. The plots are standard--the hero and heroine are detective partners who secretly are in love with each other. And you really don't care about who the murderer or murderers are. The character of the medical examiner is a direct steal from the one played by David Macallan on NCIS, except that he is younger and better looking. In fact, the shows tend to feature handsome men and plain women, plainly dressed,some in need of dental work.

All the beats are really good. This is more like a 3 6 mafia featuring Fiend. What I mean is Fiend doesnt really show as much of himself in this album as he does in his other releases. 3 six mafia on this record are like how they normally are so if you like them then cop this album. Fiend comes correct on this album but hes doesnt get too personal which i think is a strong point for him usually. But he rips all his verses and his flow is really good. While Fiend sounds good on this album, he sounds a little out of place on sometimes on the Memphis beats.

It's ideal for the 3-6 crowd and my son used to love following the intricate drawings of the roller coaster tracks with his finger. The pictures have a lot of amusing detail (sort of like Goodnight Gorilla where there's almost a backstory told in the pictures) and we used to play a game where we'd try to find some of the sillier people standing in line.

Instead, the first part of this film is vulgar and boring. Every other line features some perverted joke. I'm not sanctimonious - I don't object to curse words out of hand. However, the f-word is used so often that the dialogue becomes stilted and sounds phony. Who actually tells their father that they like looking at vaginas all day long.The film does pick up eventually - after 50 minutes, in a 90-minute film. Even then, it's not particularly funny - just amusing. Still not worth watching. I can't believe Robin Williams has come to this. What a sad end to a great comedic career."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's greatest dad","review":"Awful, it had a lot of sexual reference and pornography suggestions, I'm so glad I got to see it before the kids would do it, I expected so much more from Robin Williams movies, I watch the theatrical rental several times, it appeared to be funny, but it wasn't at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unfunny and painful to watch","review":"This film is loaded with zero percent comedy, bad acting, bad writing and zero charm, heart and soul.

I did not laugh even one time during this \\"comedy\\". I was looking forward to seeing what I hoped would be another great performance by Robin Williams, who I am a big fan of. Not this time. This movie was gross and disturbing. I expected a comedy and this movie was nothing but disgusting sexual references one right after another.This movie is 100% NOT for kids - or adults for that matter.

But then it became a \\"Hollywood\\" predictable film until the end - but it was not worth it to watch the whole thing.Bobcat wrote and directed and there were a few highlights and unexpected turns, but overall this was a two dimensional film.No one liked Kyle Clayton for a reason - he was a jerk. Robin Williams - did you need a paycheck this bad? It looked like Robin wanted to jump out of his skin and tear this one up, but the material did not let him. An interesting concept for a short, not a feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please spare me...","review":"I am a huge fan of Robin Williams and he didn't let me down as far as his acting goes in this movie.However, I did not enjoy watching this one. The son was extremely disgusting, so much so it was unbelievable, and the whole premise that every teenager and adult in the school suddenly started idolizing such a disturbed teenager is over the top.This is a \\"Black\\" movie, but I would not call it a comedy. I found nothing funny about it and it left me feeling depressed.This is one Robin Williams movie I wish I'd passed on watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly underrated film by who?

This is in no way a main stream film but I loved it and have watched it over ten times now and each time it gets better.This is one of Robin Williams best roles, on par with his job in One Hour Photo.

It is somewhat sad and certainly uncomfortable but there are also parts that are funny. Robin Williams does a phenomenal job in the lead, and Evan Martin makes a quite an impression in an albeit small role. It's definitely worth a viewing for the story and acting. I might put it with the likes of Win, Win in terms of a quiet but good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN'T JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT'S COVER","review":"Based on the cover, I would have never watched this movie.

What could have been true to some degree or other was phony, and I'm not just talking about the script. Of course the exploitation of his dead son and the cheating ambition of \\"Lance\\" the father of \\"Kyle\\" the impossible son was bad enough, and the ending far from satisfying or even understandable, but the premise, to me, was even worse.One reviewer on another website said it best: the film couldn't decide whether it was comedy or drama and tried to be both but succeeded at neither. But some of the dialogue in the early part was so gross it was good. The direction was tight and quite okay as was the cinematography.I'm not sure what, if anything, could have made it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipper","review":"Good movie, kind of disturbing, fast shipper, product as discribed. . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of \\"THE\\" worst movies I've ever seen","review":"I thought having Robin Williams (Which I'm a fan of his) in this movie might make it a decent view. It did not.None of the charactors were likable. I was actually happy when the future Rapist son died. Then the high school glorified the suicide.... Sorry Bobcat but when a student commits suicide the school \\"Never\\" glorifies it. When I was in school there was a student suicide and the kids weren't even allowed to excercise a minute of group silence in his honor.Robin Williams had to have done this movie as a favor to Bobcat.It's very dark, and the only highlight was Bruce Hornsby... Other than that I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Horrible movie","review":"The main character in this movie finds his teenager dead one day and decides to hang him in the closet from a belt. It's absolutely horrible, terrible movie. Don't confuse this with traditional Robin Williams movies that inspire you.

I can't believe that he would play in a movie like this, morbid humor. I'm thinking, \\"Did he even read the script before?\\" Maybe I just didn't get it?

Faulkner's writing is complex, sometimes difficult, yes.

It must have become fashionable in literary circles at one point to praise Faulkner, and since then people have become afraid to appear uninformed and announce that the EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES.This book, just like _The Sound and the Fury_, is bursting with pages of prose where you just cannot tell what is going on.

After a year of rolling and unrolling it for storage and transport, the soft facing came completely off the rubber backing.

The day after I got it, our company sponsored a class given by a professional photographer and she said this was a great camera -- the kind of thing she'd take on vacation, so I felt I had made a good choice.

I never received this camera. Although I placed the order back in August, the shipment was post-poned several times. When delivery was post-poned for the last time (for me, at least) on Oct 28, I allowed the order to be cancelled. By this time, this discontinued model was difficult to find, and I ordered a different model, a Kodak P880, from another seller.

I ran across the room, screamed & jumped from happiness. Guess what? The camera wasn't even working. I did everything on instructions & installed correctly, even waited for 4 hours to charge lithium battery in the camera, but the lens wouldn't open. No pictures shot. So now, I'm gonna waste some more of my time, finding a post-office, sending an item back for exchange, waiting until it arrives again. It's just so annoying & frustrating! My mood is totally ruined.I'm not even sure if the camera will operate correctly when the replacement arrives & if it will, that it will shoot properly. Very sceptical now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Camera!","review":"I love taking pictures although I am not the smartest when it comes to buying the right one.

I'm a big race fan and my pictures from the race are great...you can see everything so clearly, even as the cars are flying past. The zoom, shutter-speed, flash, lighting, and all the other options were perfect. I would recommend this camera for someone whos looking for a good digi camera that is reasonably cheap and takes awesome pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mid sized digital","review":"The A620 was a replacement for a very dated 1.5MP camera that I use for general shooting and it's a real treat, fast shooting time and all the adjustments I wanted in a digital.

All in all an excellent camera at a real bargin price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made it through an Iraq tour even after being dropped in the powdery sand","review":"This Camera brings back good memories for me.

I would recommend this camera to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Camera","review":"This camera takes really good pictures and has several features. There are so many setting that make it easy to take shots. I only wish it was a little smaller. I really like the pop out screen and it also will shut itself down when you haven't used it a long time to save battery power. Still finding new things that it does. I would recommend this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large and Lovely","review":"While somewhat ungainly in shape, this is a marvelous technical camera.It takes excellent pictures, saves photos rapidly, cycles quickly to allow rapid photography, and is more frugal power wise so batteries take more photos. Its movie mode is so good, it competes easily against many digicams, but in a far more portable size. The movable LCD viewfinder is as effective as the legendary rotating lens made famous by the Nikon coolpix. Over 6 months old, my camera has taken some abuse and is alive and well. Some users have warned against jamming the lens mechanism, so I've taken care to insure the lens shaft is free of dirt and moves freely.The built-in instructions are easy to understand, but the camera falls short of 5 stars because one needs to read the manual to understand the fine nuances of programming this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera Great Value","review":"I searched and read a lot of reviews especially on cnet.com (great site). for 7megapix it was a super value. Plus a 4x optical zoom. There were a lot of higher priced smaller camers.. but they were only 5-6 mp. For me i wanted the highest mp. We bough this for my father and I ended up buying one along with my sister. Our family now owns 3 of these. I would recommend a higher sd card. 1gb will hold about 300 pics at the highest settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera","review":"I did a lot of research on digital cameras before I purchased this camera. I was mainly looking for a good macro setting and the option of manual settings. This camera has both. I also really like the adjustable LCD screen, I get creative with my shots and being able to angle the screen in different directions really helps. The battery life is great, I've taken nearly 500 photos on one set of batteries. There are a ton of settings so you will need to read the instructions. It also has a totally automatic setting which makes it very user friendly. I highly recommend this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera takes great pictures","review":"This canon product offers great flexibility in customizing a picture and takes great pictures in the automatic setting. It is light weight and small, which means easy to carry around and likely to be carried around. So far there has been nothing to say negatively about this product. The software accompanying the product is great also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy for price/performance factor","review":"If you love to take photos this one is for you. While it is not as sleek as the T series from sony or the exilim from casio,it easily outperforms them. It also feels good in your grip. It has FULL manual control and 7 MP. I think this will appeal to serious photographers. The menu has plenty of useful features, yet easy to learn. I believe that good user friendly interface is vital to operate a digital camera. The 4x optical zoom is more than enough for most occasions. Image quality is very good/excellent for ISO 50 up to ISO 200. The ISO 400 is also usable if you do not intend to produce very large print. Low light photography is also good (but don't forget the tripod). The reasons that cause me to give it not full five stars are-redeye-no preset sport scene-usage of AA batteries-the cover for digital and SD card are moderate built"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small size but works like a professional camera","review":"I've had this Canon Powershot A620 for several month. I also own Canon EOS-20D camera. I love this EOS-20D very much but I don't take it along with me because of its size. This A620 fits in my pants pocket, does every feature EOS-20D has, with a slight bit less quality.Since I am a real estate investor, I carry this all the time to shoot many properties. Its movie function is also awesome. I can take quick family activites without bringing my full feature movie camera all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best buy I have had so far !","review":"The batteries just never dies.

Things I like about it so far: It seems to be VERY fast. It takes really good quality pictures. Macro function works very well. It's fairly comfortable to hold. All things considered, it's RELATIVELY user-friendly. The negatives are: It's somewhat heavy for a small camera. Parts of it seem very \\"flimsey\\" such as the door that covers the lens when not in use. The \\"red eye reduction\\" function really doesn't work very well from the results I've seen so far (athough perhaps there is a way to make it function better and I haven't figured it out yet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this camera!","review":"The Canon Powershot A620 works perfectly for my uses. I was set on the A610 5.0MP, but then realized this is under ten dollars more! So I jumped in and got the 7.1MP. The only thing I am really not a fan of is the flip out screen. In time, it will be a good advantage, I just have to get used to it. The accent color mode is awesome, and shutter options impress me. I took a really cool picture of the night sky with a 15 second shutter and it turned out great. Canon did a good job with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally flawed design ruins good product","review":"Seemed like a very fine camera until we discovered the UGLY truth. A Google search reveals Canon is/was the subject of a class action suit for this very problem.Any interference with the action of the zoom lens renders the camera inoperable. It must be returned to Canon for repairs. To their credit, they did repair our camera no charge in about 2-3 weeks.

No camera is perfect and this is true for Canon A620 as well but its strengths and photographing capabilities makes up for that. I don't think I will be upgrading this P&S anytime soon. My fave is the vari-angle LCD, M mode, and color accent. Features of higher end cameras, these specs really lets me play around with my shots and I am the type of person who doesn't like taking \\"boring\\" photographs. People are usually impressed with my photographs but all I do is point to the camera. =))) So 4 thumbs up for A620. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone with a budget under $400 even now in 2009!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only it could make cofee, it would be perfect!","review":"Love it. had it for several months now and have yet to find something wrong with it. If you've owned a digital camera before, there absolutely no learning curve what so ever.Just follow your guts and you'll find the function you want.But all the frequently used ones are right there at your finger tips.I personally love the custom timer function that allows you to set a delay up to 30\\" and take up to 10 pictures!

The 7+ megapixel resolution produces great picutes (and huge files). The more advanced features take a bit of practice.

Saved me alot of time. I installed about 15 doors and the template held up well. However, the bit is quite dull now. I recommend using clamps vs the nails to avoid fixing the holes. If you have alot of doors to hange like I did, you can make an 'L' shaped insert for the jig to route the strike plate recess. One fault of the product is the directions aren't very clear, especially for the 1/4 radius hinges. To cut these, you flip the jig around and use square portion of the jig. This square corner creates a 1/4 radius because the router bit is 1/4 inch. Make sure you practice a few times so not to ruin a good door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Parts Break Easily","review":"The jig broke the first time I adjusted the hinge size.

I have ordered the Milescraft #1293 from Amazon and will try to review it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"The router bit is high speed steel and was dull to the point of being useless after 3 doors.

It does not work well installing a new door into a frame with existing hinges on it. The stops to adjust for the door thickness were off by 1/8th of an inch. this cost me a new door. and the place to nail it into the door are off so I had to drill new holes. After making the modifications ( and another door) it worked really well. I liked the fact that it came with it's own router bit and the adjustment for the hinge size is really cool. The double headed nails helped a lot when pulling it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for the price","review":"bought this unit used it several times with no problems except the bit dulled quickly purchased carbide version of same router bit am quite happy.

To set your depth just insert the router bit into your router, and place your template over the bit, then lay your hinge beside the bit and raise or lower you router depth gauge until they match)The two corners (If you don't want them round) must be cut square, and that's just a very little bit that could even be done with a razor knife. Very east and simple. These are being discoutinued, so better buy quick, Lowes is even selling them for under $19.It took me about 12 minutes to read the instructions, and about a minute and a half to set it all up."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Design changed!","review":"This used to be a great little product. I had an old one that worked just fine until I broke it by accident. But when I bought a new one, I couldn't believe what they'd done - they've switched out the double-head nails for flat heads and there are no guide bushings like before. AND, the new flathead nails just barely clear the template thickness; nowhere near enough bite to hold it to the jamb while routing! How many thousandths of a cent did they save with this with this blockhead move?

It was published in 1999 and has ideas from the 80's and 90's. Virtually none of the products used are still being manufactured. Likely because they are so far out of date!If you are new to scrapbooking, do yourself a favor and pay attention to the publication date on any book you buy.

I ended up with hard undercooked rice, and a mess in my microwave. The water boiled over and went everywhere, and since it is rice water, it was starchy and hard to clean. Now I have 2 unopened boxes waiting for the Salvation Army. What a waste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for rice. Good steamer.","review":"I wonder if the way this rice steamer is made has changed recently. I bought mine after all the rave reviews. I cook rice several times a week. I was very pleased at first. Then more and more water leaked out during cooking. Later, a plastic part of the cover that locks it on, broke. I hoped it was a fluke and bought another one. The latest one is almost useless. So much water leaks out when cooking rice that I have taken to using very low microwave settings and cooking it much longer. Still the results are disappointing. This morning it took about 40 minutes rather than the 22 minutes I used at first, and still the results are poor. It worked well steaming vegetables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Loss","review":"Unfortunately I bought this product based on the positive reviews.First I cooked rice. The lid system does not keep the water from boiling over, so the rice cooked well, but it worked no better than cooking rice in a mixing bowl in the microwave.Next I cooked pasta. It worked, but again, the water boiling over makes this appliance no better than a mixing bowl for microwave cooking.Next I cooked popcorn. It left many kernals unpopped when the already popped corn began to scorch. Unsatisfactory.Next time I tried to use it, I noticed a serious water leak where one of the feet attaches to the bowl. It will no longer retain water, and so is completely unusable. It was washed only by hand, never in a dishwasher.Since I bought it through the mail from Amazon, and it was only a few dollars, it is not worth returning it for a refund. So it is a total loss.Don't say nobody warned you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"We love using the microwave for rice - not faster, but simple, easy to clean, leaves the stove top free for other dinner preparations. BUT this version is not a good choice. The two-part top leaves a layer of boiling water when you take it out. The plastic pot gets a little soft and flexible. And finally, it breaks easily when it falls to the ground. Oops. Different one next, hopefully like our old faithful from Chinatown that lasted for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well cooked rice for a change","review":"No more sticky rice.

But last summer when I saw it in a silent auction and realized that I could get it for a $1 bid, I couldn't resist. Best dollar I ever spent...this rice cooker actually works, and very well at that. The rice it makes, parboiled, white or brown, has all turned out great. The only time I had any sort of mess was when I did the maximum amount of brown rice, and then it was no big deal to clean up. This makes it so easy to pick up a Chinese entr��e at our grocery store, and come home to make the rice in the microwave -- we save money by making our own rice and it couldn't be easier to get it done using this cooker.

As for the lyrics, they are great song-poems that suit perfectly well the melodies--flexible and light rock rhythms and Phil Lynott's unique voice, which strolls between the calm and the storm.

That is kind of obvious information.Following this course, I took a software development course. The two classes are in series. Techniques learned from this book did not help me. When it came time to write documents (project proposals, documents for external design and internal design phases, etc.) this book was no help.

The best way to describe \\"American Beauty\\" is simply to say that it shows how life is too short to not go after what you want -- but how life is also too short to not appreciate what you already have. And as Kevin Spacey/Lester Burnham says at the end, if you don't understand what I mean by that, you will someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is more of a movie review than a script comment. \\"American Beauty\\" is an extraordinary film, and it works on so many levels. The performances (especially Kevin Spacey's) are superb, and it's visual sense is nothing short of cinematic poetry. But if there's one aspect that really stands out, it's the script, never have I read such a truthful and penetrating story of American suburbia. Every line rings true, and it perfectly shapes the character from whom it's coming from. It's alternately bitterly funny and profoundly moving, delving into the core of life and never shying away from it's realities. I was genuinely amazed with the way the story unfolded, it wasn't just like watching a movie, it was like peering into a couple of lives with a searing intensity. \\"American Beauty\\" is definitely a film you want to see, it's too good to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I was sceptical before reading the script and seeing the movie, all that hype I thought.

It is infinately profound and affecting, and it is beautiful and poetic on a tremendous scale while maintaing subtle, understated nuances. The writing is flawless, in a word. The performances in this masterpiece of American cinema only accentuate Alan Ball's wit and depth.

Every sound he makes--every whisper, every consonant--is interesting and intelligent. And unlike some better-known lieder singers (such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau), Kurt Moll does not indulge in sentimental exaggeration nor play circus tricks with his vibrato. Just straight, intelligent, beautiful singing and sincere dramatic interpretation from a serious man with a terrific contrabassoon-like instrument.Pianist Cord Garben is a genius. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Story, Weak Writing, Terrible Binding!","review":"I have read this with five of my kindergarten classes as we learned about the various arts and traditions of Mexico.

While many of his other earlier works were just as good, his subsequent works of Civil War Collector's Encyclopedia Vols. 2-5 that he did in later years just kept declining, lacking the original research and text that made his first a classic, not to mention the quality of the memorabilia, as well as the authenticity of some of them.

Vashti's gentle voice and quiet, short meditations on dreamy, rustic life strike a chord with a society that is constantly on the move.She herself DID go to that life after this single record...Though it is too bad she could not transcend her shyness to make more records, I must say that this album is a testament to the influence of traditional folk music on the experimental scene today. To go back to the beauteous structures allows us to move forth, deconstruct, and manipulate the essence of our musicality.We are also reminded that the extremely short song is no less powerful and evocative.In short, this album should be enough to lull even Mike Tyson. Simplicity has rarely been showcased like Vashti Bunyan performed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The female Donovan","review":"I actually hadn't heard of Vashti until after that Reebok commercial with \\"Train Song\\", I completely fell in love with this album after hearing the song clips.

However, high impact jumping on and off the bench are a theme in this workout(including standard jumping jacks). Most of the routines include high impact steps with no simple way to modify them to be low impact.I bought this because I really enjoy complicated routines however very little cueing is offered, and when it is it's too late to be of any real value. The \\"warm-up\\" was a few minutes of aerobics (including jumping jacks) then right into stretching. After the stretching the instructor goes right into the aerobics again. For me it was not an adequate warm-up, especially for what is a high impact workout.Sadly disappointed by this since the reviews were so high for this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging is right!","review":"I love the instructor's enthusiasm and creativity, but I find this step program difficult to keep up with and difficult to learn even with the tutorial. I would have preferred something less complicated. I don't like a lot of turning, it makes me dizzy. It's a good way to trip. I still use it, but I don't follow them exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning ADVANCED STEP Only","review":"There needs to be a bigger warning sign somewhere on this stating..ADVANCED ADVANCED ADVANCED step exercise. I workout everyday so I'm in really good shape. When I got this in the mail I couldn't wait to throw it in my Xbox and get my workout on. I had to turn it off after the first 15 minutes. Amy didn't explain one move! She just started in..did the step once or twice and moved on to the next one. I usually don't give up on workouts but there was no way that I could call what I was doing a workout. I actually stopped and found that just watching it was a challenge in itself. The CD seems a bit outdated since they outfits are from the early 90's or 80's.I would not recommend this CD unless you're a step trainer at your local gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Nothing could ever be as fun as step if you have a good teacher and great music! Unfortunately, they have phased step almost completely out of the gyms where I live and I have had to resort to buying tapes and DVD's I can do at home. This one is really good, and yes, it is hard but once you learn the moves you have a great sense of accomplishment. Additionally, there are six different selections to choose from if you get bored. The music is pretty good and I am really picky about music. I like edgy more dance or techno tracks for working out and this doesn't make me want to turn the DVD off. Overall, I am very satisfied, but I'll never stop hoping they bring step back to the mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Song","review":"Though some people may be disappointed, the same people who are still complaining since 1991's 'Metallica' came out, this single is great. Mama said is unlike anything Metallica has done in the past, it sounds really fresh and like the rest of 'Load', it is outstanding. Another big plus to this cd is the other two songs on it. Creeping Death is one of Metallica's best songs, but the live version really stands out from the studio version; you can really feel the energy and appreciate Metallica's capabilities onstage. The third song on the cd is the cover So What; this song sounds great as well, and it is nice to hear Metallica play live a song which hasn't gotten it's just do!

I look forward to reading more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Groan Empire","review":"Let me offer a little advice to those of you considering buying this book: DON'T. I've wasted money and time that I will never get back. It is just about the worst Doctor Who novel in any series. The Doctor is portrayed as a ditzy shadow of himself who does pointless things simply for the heck of it. The visited planets were agonizing to read about. And to add insult to injury, there is a \\"Marty-Stu\\" (male \\"Mary Sue\\") character who inserts himself into the Doctor's party based on no merit other than existing and who becomes the \\"narrator\\" of the book, with little asides into his own uninteresting life story. By page 100, I gave up and just skimmed through the rest of the story; it wasn't worth it. Do yourself a favor and buy a different Eighth Doctor novel, like \\"Anachrophobia\\".

First please realize I am a long time owner of the Wave. I have had mine for close to a decade, and during that time I have come to own about 3 sheaths, this being the 3rd. The first one which came with my Wave, the velcro worn, and as a result did not want to stay close. So I then ordered the new Velcro model where you can wear it sideways, which makes concealment that much easier. However, in a short amount of time the straps got worn and that was not possible anymore. So I ordered the leather model instead, but the problem is, unless you wear a really less than wide belt, you will struggle slipping your belt through the strap. At first I thought there was a breaking in period, but it has been many months, and this is still an issue. Other than that it is great, and does what it's supposed to do, but the leather strap could use a little less tension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sheath ever","review":"This sheath simply can't get any worse at all.

I was a little skeptical about the universal fit, but it does adjust so that it can fit most heads.

I don't like these things tight and this seems to be shaped with a real head in mind, not a mannequin. It is certainly made for an adult not a child like many I have tried. It is easy to clip on and remove and does not make me sweat - my hair isn't so bad either after wearing.

That part is very flimsy and not well-designed.The helmet has good cooling.Seems to leave way too much of the back of the head exposed. I understand that the pointy part in the back will keep your head from hitting the ground if you fall backwards. However, if something were to hit you in the lower part of the back of the head - such as a truck mirror for example - there would be nothing to stop it except that flimsy, hard dial-fit buckle.The chin strap fits uncomfortably, if you adjust it to hold the helmet securely. It really digs into that area where your jaw meets your neck. If you loosen it, then the helmet doesn't seem to be on securely.Looks too bulky on my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most bang for the buck!","review":"I ordered one of these to try it out and was so pleased that we now have \\"3\\" of them and all who use them like them.

Once the pads wear a little the velcro starts to poke your skin, not fun.We're debating returning this helmet because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"good fit, but awful buckle ruins the helmet","review":"The universal fit mechanism works well and the helmet can be made nice and snug. The main drawback with this helmet is that the buckle/strap combination is horrible. I can't ride 15 miles without it becoming dangerously loose, necessitating constant correction. The straps seem too thick for the buckle adjustment slots, hence the slippage. Maybe this is not a problem if you ride 2-3 miles at a time, but it is a major inconvenience for longer rides.

I contacted customer service in July to tell them I was having an issue and a very nice lady promised to send me a replacement light. Now, 2 month and 3 excuses later, I still do not have a light.

With plenty of colors to chose from (5 of my 21 helmets are Solars), you can look good on just about any color road bicyle. If I remember correctly, they don't come with visors, which are primarily for mountain/street bikes.

The members of dc Talk have gotten together extremely rarely the past few years since splitting to do work on solo projects (hopefully not split for good) so anything new from them together as a band is highly anticipated. Their title track \\"Let's Roll\\" is unbelievable and better than anything off of their Supernatural cd.All the tracks on this cd are good in their own right and overall this cd is easily 5 stars.

The cd after the first few songs, though, I'm not crazy about.Tracks 6, 13, 15, and 18 don't even have words--just soft music. 14 and 16 are both the Lord's Prayer, just to different music, both soft styles. The first 5 and numbers 7, 8, and 10-11 (which is really just one song) are basically the only \\"contemporary\\" Christian music with words. 9 is a country song.Good lyrics, but most of the cd is not as upbeat as I would like. 3 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Just another way for people to cash in on the tradgedy of September 11.

I ordered two, and regretably installed one on my car (will have to take it out and replace it with an one-piece gasket). The second one was already broken from the glued points as I was opening the box. I had to return it for refund. I called Fram to find out if this is a new design, and was told that Fram never manufactures a gasket like that. I do not know where could Amazon have gotten it. It has patches on the boxes to cover a suffix \\"A\\" on the model #FT1220, i.e., FT1220A.Buy it from your local auto parts store so you can see it and verify it's a one-piece gasket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works!","review":"This Product is one of few that really works.

Ware's \\"Freedom Suite\\" magnificantly rehashes the Sonny Rollins song. Ware has Matthew Shipp on piano, William Parker on bass, and Guillermo E. Brown on drums. Since this was my first Ware CD, I wasn't sure what it would sound like. It's surprisingly catchy, and Shipp's off-center piano adds a dimension that didn't exist on Rollin's original trio recording. There's still a lot of saxophone (Parker and Brown are low in the mix, so Ware and Shipp dominate), and Ware is up to the challenge. I don't think this disc is much freer than the original, so it should appeal to most jazz fans. At a concise 39:25 length, Ware wisely chose to put out a very good shorter disc, rather than fill it up to 60-70 minutes with padding. I recommend it to modern jazz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Bought this to ease the use of AA batteries for the charger. Fast shipping, charger works as intended.

It was worth reading though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Book","review":"This is a solid book covering the requirements gathering process. My only concern is for shops that try to implement the entire process verbatim.In today's web development world, customer expect progress every 30 days (a la XP Programming). If you force every project down the Use Case, FUnctional Specs, UML diagrams path, then there's no way to get incremental projects out the door that quickly.My suggestion is to customize your process and take the best from this book. Use the majority of processes for large projects, but keep in mind that most projects that don't deliver any incremental value with 30-90 days of start, will either be cancelled or fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comprehensive","review":"If you are a beginner to requirements management, I can't think of a better place to start. It contains a chapter on just about every aspect of requirements and even touches on Project Management (the 2 areas are closely related).Why did it lose 1*:- the book is a little dated .. it reads like Karl started by promoting the SRS type document to capture requirements, but as the book progressed he started to promote use cases, (which have become more widely accepted in the last 10 years).- some of the examples are flawed. This is perhaps an unfair criticism, because I may be finding flaws that few other people will spot, and they do not detract from the value gained from reading the book.- too many words and not enough examples. This is a criticism that I level at almost all technical books of this nature. Karl's is no different in this respect.One of the better books for anyone needing to learn about requirements management."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and very practical book, I DO recommend it","review":"I do recommend this book, both for experienced of novice sofware developers or consultants for several reasons:1. The content has a great balance between practical advice and theory, so it won't burden you with information applicable to 5% (e.g. huge projects) of your daily work2. It is well written, both in content and edition style (format) so it is very easy to read and understand quickly3. It has references to standards and literacy but it is just to illustrate and not so heavily that makes it hard to readTo sum up, its one of the very best SW Engineering books I've read so far and so that I do recommend it.Alex BallarinIT ConsultantCynertia Consulting, Barcelona, Spain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Business Requirements","review":"I work for CDW and this book came highly recommended. It did not disappoint as it is clear, well written, and organized in a logical format.

The suggestions for labeling and writing requirements alone make it worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book describes everything you could want to know about writing software requirements.

This is one of the best technology-related books I've bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone affected by software system development","review":"If you are looking for a very direct, down-to-earth approach to developing and managing requirements, this is the book for you. If you believe that managing requirements is overhead that you cannot support, you need to read this book. Karl takes a very practical approach to requirements development and management. He explains his approach in a succinct manner and provides very good examples to make his point. This book should be a mandatory read by all software development project managers, whether they come from the business or technical side of the business. Additionally, Karl's book makes good reading for anyone who is affected by the development of a software system such as business visionaries, end-users, quality assurance, business analysts, technical writers, trainers, and developers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Book On Software Requirements","review":"This book covers all the different aspects of software requirements in a very concise way.

In appendix it has a good example on the requirements for an hypothetical Cafeteria Ordering System."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best book on the market!!!","review":"Many books claim to provide best practices, this book delivers. From page one it is obvious that the author is writing from real world experience. Too many books on requirements are written by university professors with no real experience.

The world has changed and some of us have minds that have not yet adapted to the change and therefore we are seen as outcasts and therefore we have problems and therefore we need medication etc... The thing is, ADDers suffer and it's mostly from an educational system that is too standard and a society that is unforgiving. Thom's theories are great, he needs a book that transcends just those with ADD and ADHD, but reaches out to society - a book anyone will read and benefit from.

Every teacher should have this book as required reading.

They were advising us to steer him toward vocational training because he did not handle acedemic settings well. It was upon getting a good diagnosis of the extent of his ADD, and upon reading this book, that we were able to explain ADD in a positive way to him (age 13). From that day on, his attitude changed about life and his potential to enjoy life. Today, he is a Junior in college, working with children at both his church and at the local YMCA. He is a Hunter who has learned to help the Farmers in this world. That will always make him a valued team member in communities that must deal with Hunters who don't know why they don't fit in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least helpful of all the books I've ever read on ADD","review":"While I get the whole \\"farmer vs. hunter\\" analogy I feel that it is unnecessary to spend 171 pages elaborating on it. ADD is extremely complex and there are probably not two people who have all of the same characteristics of it. This book frequently made inaccurate generalizations like \\"ADD people are creative and therefore great at projects\\". While that may be true in many cases, maybe even most cases, it certainly is NOT true for all of us. My son HATES projects in school and is terrible at them for a number of reasons. Despite the title, I failed to find any \\"new\\" ways to work with my ADD child. Anyone who has been dealing with the complex accademic issues that often accompany ADD already knows this basic information. I might recommend the book only for those who are just beginning to learn about ADD. All others should save their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The farmers vs hunters analogy was intriquing at the beginning, but by the end of the book, I felt like the author had over-generalized (in some case in accurately generalized) ADD behaviors/characteristics to fit his analogy. I would not recommend this book to anyone.Obviously, other reviewers have a different opinion so take mine for whatever it is worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents, this is the first book to read!","review":"Is your child disabled by ADD?

The storyboards are incredibly detailed and look fantastic. The majority of the drawings are done in black and white but there are some in color and color picture stills from the movie as well. The artist comments are fun to read and provide some insight as to what they and the directors were thinking. The only thing this book lacked was an interview or essay done with the Wachowski's themselves. Other than that I'm completely happy with this book. If you're looking for more info on the production and visual effects check out the following magazines, Cinefex #79, and American Cinematographer April 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"showcase of genius","review":"I was hoping the book would deal with the filming and post-production aspects of the movie, but they're apparently saving that for a later book (that will only be written if this one sells!). This one is almost exclusively pre-production, but even that is well worth seeing. The Wachowskis went all-out on the script, including scene after scene that they had no idea how to film at the time. The storyboards had to brilliantly showcase the action, mood, and intensity of the story just to get the go-ahead from Warner Bros to commit such a large budget.It's depressing how most Oscar-winning movies are just a bunch of talking heads when you can page through this book and see such hard work and ingenuity in scene after scene. At least they got rich off it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can not be told what the Art of the Matrix is","review":"I ordered this book over a year ago. Delay after delay, and I still was surprised when the book came out. This book is massive. Picture upon picture from the storyboards to conceptual drawings plus the shooting script. You'll be amazed by the amount of information they threw into it. If you are as big a fan of the film as I am, you'll have to have this book. With a word or two from the artists, and a page from William Gibson. Who could ask for more? Just get it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whare are the rest of the sketches?","review":"I have read some of the glowing reviews so I felt I had to write. If you don't own the ultimate matrix movie set and you haven't seen the glorious full color illustrations and sketches that brought these amazing movies to light, then you might love this book. It felt more like the story board or comic book Matrix but NOT the art. Many of the production illustrations, certainly the costume illustrations are left out of this book. Rarely have I seen a movie or movies have so much artwork created so I am baffled by this oversight. When I watched the making of disc dedicated to the illustrators and artists, I was shocked that the Brothers Wachowski would slight so much of their immensely talented team. And as much as I appreciated the script in the book, I would have traded it without hestitation for all the beautiful illustrations and sketches that were missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment does not come cheaply","review":"After hearing about this book, I , like many other matrix fans waited with anticipation for it's arrival. After weeks of delay it finally arrived and i bought it without even opening the plastic wrapping. When i got home and opened my prize i was shocked to find over 400 pages of rough and ugly looking storyboards. Apparently the wrapping was meant to hide this appalling book instead of protect it from damage... I realize it's an \\"art of\\" book but the poor quality of it was absolutely the biggest disappointment i've ever had with any movie tie-in book. What about the computer effects? the cinematography? this is also a great part of the art but is totally ignored in 400+ pages.(i guess i have to wait for \\"the making of the matrix\\" if it's ever published ) If you're into movie books and NOT comics stay away from this one. The day after i bought it i returned to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice addition to the Art of titles library","review":"I was surprised at how thick this book is when it arrived. It's nicely published with good paperstock, nicely printed images and cloth/stitch binding. It feels like equal parts storyboard, script and conceptual artwork. If you are expecting a similar format like other Art of titles you may be disappointed as artistic medium (range of medium) is limited. If you read the reviews and understand what this book is then you are more likely to be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could'nt you like it?","review":"This is a book i've been looking for a long time!!

It would change directions all by itself while using. Now after using it for maybe 10 minutes it cannot be used at all. It now slips and will not lock in either forward or reverse direction. This is a huge disappointment since I have always considered SK tools to be the best hand tools for mechanics. Its not some cheap - made in China - piece of junk. It was made in the USA and I would expect much better quality from SK. Now I need to try and find a way to make a warranty claim. Also, the sockets in the set are not up to SK's normal quality.

This is definitely a page turner and not a book to read late at night and alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, Entertaining Novel","review":"I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers who felt this book was unoriginal, and not worth your time. I found this book to be an exciting novel, and one in which you really began to feel for the characters.Another plus, one which some other reviewers have mentioned, is the fact that it is a quick read. The style it is written with, and the pacing, make it a quick, enjoyable read.I have read other Douglas Clegg books, and, while I admit it is not his best, it is still worth your time to read this novel. I don't think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess of a story","review":"This book was really two stories. One of them was sort of interesting -- a kid from the wrong side of the tracks attending a wealthy kids' boarding school, a secret society, a mysterious family secret... I was interested in this part, and would have happily read an entire book about those topics.The other story was a mess. Some sort of... haunting? Ghosts seeking revenge? Occult groups? None of it makes much sense, none of it is well-explained, and the ending is a cheap cop-out. I just read here that Mischief is actually the second of three books, but there's NOTHING on the front or back cover or inside the book to indicate such.I'm glad I paid less than a buck for this book, because it wasn't worth even that."},{"rating":"1","title":"'this is un-original'","review":"The beginig is good, great, but after that, [the first 2-3 pages] it faltered.

This author has the potential to become another Peter Straub but he has to work seriously on it by studying Straub's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering and pointless","review":"This book reads more like a stream of consciousness than it does a well-written novel. It's comprised of a series of unusual events (none of which make much sense or are explained well) that are loosely tied together with a razor-thin plot. The characters are dull and their actions and motives make little sense. The plot itself is nearly non-existent and meanders from one point to another without focus. By the end of the book I didn't care one way or another about any of the characters, and didn't even understand what was going on. Everyone seemed to be a confused idiot wandering around in an alternate reality. Mischief could have been the very first draft of what later became a good novel, but should not have been published as is. Clegg can write when he wants to, but this book doesn't cut it.

Clearly states the many-faceted emotions that those left behind often feel. Very comforting and informative. This book is a must have for everyone who has dealt with the suicide of a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book but..","review":"This a really good book. It provides great insight into the process of suicide and what it is like for those left behind. However, the author doesn't seem to realize what she says about herself in her own words. She states that she wished she would have left her husband when he became very sad and withdrawn from her. She said that she sort of regretted that he was able to kill himself before she left him. No wonder he killed himself after both his parents died. She certainly doesn't seem very caring or loving. The other stories are great and it is a great book. But, the author seems pretty selfish and heartless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading for anyone who never got to say goodbye","review":"The title of Carla Fine's book caught my attention after the suicide of my brother nine months ago. I was searching for answers, and I found them in her book. She knows her subject intimately, and she was willing to share one of lifes' most unbearable situations with other suicide survivors. I have recommended this book to family members who are also searching for answers. Unfortunately, we'll never know how someone can end their life without thinking of the effect on their loved ones,but it helps to know others have survived the suicide of a family member. Thank you, Carla Fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting information","review":"Being a recent survivor of the suicide of my son, I find myself reading every word I can find on the subject. With a lot of the books I have ordered, I have found myself overwhelmed with information that gave me statistics, histories, studies and a lot of numbers that do not comfort the ones left behind and did not really help my mental state. The author speaks very personally of her own battle as a suicide survivor and also speaks with survivors from all walks of life about all different family members, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, children and friends so there are a lot of perspectives. It was helpful. To a survivor of a recent suicide, that speaks volumes. I would recommend it to anyone struggling with the suicide of a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I wish I could get the word out how helpful this book has been since losing my daughter. It's truly been a savior. Better than any counseling I tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I liked this book because it wasn't preachy or psychoanalytic. Carla Fine doesn't pretend to have all (or any) of the answers. She presents the stories of suicide as they are, with all the emotion and confusion that any survivor has experienced, thus making the reader feel that they are not alone. The book is written compassionately and you identify with the feelings shared by the people she interviewed, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the death. For me, the book provided the comfort of going to a support group before I was actually ready to venture out of the house. I've recommended it and passed my copy to all my family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquently written and very comforting to survivors","review":"This book is absolutely phenomenal. I am a survivor of 2 years. This book has offered me comfort and allowed me to realize that I am not alone. It is really down to earth. Meaning, it is not too technical to become boring. The author offers her own experience with suicide and it is completely heartwrenching. I know that she has been helped by writing this book. I pick the book up to read and cannot put it down. I hope that every survivor gets a chance to experience this book.

Enter the world of female submission with more than your initial questions answered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on your level of Understanding","review":"Keep in mind, Claudia Varrin is a switch, however shares many of her experiences as a submissive throughout this book. I thought it was a good read into the realm of D/s. This is not an extraodinaire \\"how-to\\" manual, but provides a good foundation and simple ideas in pleasing your Dom/me. As you read Ms. Varrin's experiences, you will find much of her service to be impractical for today's hectic society unless you are able to devote yourself as a full-time, in-home submissive (without children, without pets, without other responsibilities) which many of us are unable to do. Submission is a lifestyle AND a mindset and it is up to you to decide where you and your Dom/me want to take it, then discover ways to integrate into your everyday lives. Considering there is limited literature available for female submissives, all in all, this is a good introduction and recommended for those looking to explore the lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Limited...Not Recommended","review":"I read this book, hoping it would be a good and indepth look at female submission within the sexual D/s context in general. What I got was what the author personally thought was arousing instead. Most of what she mentions in this book (ie. tips on what to do, wear, how to behave) isn't helpful and it must be realized that such things are highly individualistic. What works for one won't work for all.I also found the fantasies she mentions in this book of poor taste. I'm not one for racially \\"Othering\\" and \\"exoticizing\\" people and I resent that she does this in the book (I'm thinking of the Middle Eastern Man against \\"milky white skin\\" fantasies). This was written very much from the perspective of a particular white female submissive, and that's what you get, her limited (and unenlightened) perspective.

That's not to say the musicians aren't talented - they're just not good songwriters. For some music that will at least get your feet moving or hips shaking, try the more salsa-style tracks which emphasize musicianship over political message: El Comal (tk 4), Micaela (tk 7), and Taquerito (tk 10) all have a spicy latin edge and well worth a spin.

Plus, I was worried he might choke because he was eating so fast! This bowl really does work. It now takes him about 2 minutes and 30 seconds to eat- which is still fast, but much better than 45 seconds! The bowl is very durable and washes up nicely in the dishwasher.

Granted, I tend to read mysteries, thrillers & historical fiction and not romance novels, so perhaps that is why I found it so disappointing.

[But then, I like the ending of this story better(he, he, he)]. The way they had to give up each other's life for true love's sake seemed unavoidable yet tragically right in a way.The ending was also fantastic because it did not leave one hanging and made one believe that love can really transcend the boundaries of time. The way \\"Remembrance\\" used the idea of past lives and how it affected the present and the future was very intriguing. However, I found the beginning of the book quite boring, though some parts were quite important to understand the book better. This was the reason why I gave this book a nine.

When the book went back to modern times at the end I was lost. I admit I had to sleep, and work, so I had put the book down for a day or two. What a mistake. I bet I read 20 pages of the last segment before I could remember what the beginning was. And this book did not warrant going back to the beginning to remember where the author had left off.

Having to read about Hayden Lane, the romance writer in the present was extremely boring. The part regarding Cathering & Tavey wasn't exactly thrilling either but it was vital to the section about Callie and Tallis. Those two will have you in tears!!! And they totally make up for the lack of feeling I got from the other characters. I think the concept of the story was great and the time traveling part interesting and fun to follow, but the book spends so much time on Callie and Tallis and making you LOVE them, that when you are switched over into the other time periods you feel cheated and disinterested.

The movie takes place in California, where you can't even take a squat without reams of paperwork (if you'll excuse the pun.) Yet these clowns are selling stolen bikes to dealerships....yeah, right. The plot is shallow and stupid and makes \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" look like Shakespeare by comparison. A sad commentary on the biker lifestyle by someone who is obviously completely clueless in regard to it. Harleys in your movie does not an \\"Easy Rider\\" make.Unfortunatly, I couldn't give less than one star.

I simply can't believe this movie got two five start reviews. This had to be one of the cheesiest biker films I've ever seen. I RENTED this movie and still feel like I got ripped off. The acting is awful and the plot is just plain ridiculous. The creepy biker and predictable RUB stereotypes were offensive.If you want a horrible movie with bad acting and offensive stereotypes then this may indeed be the holy grail for you, but as far as I'm concerned I want that hour and a half of my life back.Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie. If you're really a glutton for punishment go rent it.

The product is really helpful. It was in good conditions but the no in the conditions I thought anyways its helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivalry explained","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Being a newly active member of the Clan Donald, I had always seen references to the Macdonald/Campbell feud but never understood it or the history. Mr. Tomson tells the story from the beginnings with the events that led to the centuries old competition between these two great clans. Now it makes sense to me why people snicker at the Clan Donald and Campbell's tents being next to each other at the highland games or the little battles between them. The history of the Lords of the Isles and Earls of the Campbell family are easy to read and enjoyable. The second half of the book is just various stories of people of the name Campbell and Macdonald who ended up in rivalries or succeeded or failed in different endeavors. A fun easy read, yet very informative. Good book to have on the shelf for members of either clan."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is sloppy and unuseful","review":"This book is written by someone who obviously understands the subject very well, but isn't very good at presenting it. The equations contain many mistakes and none of the terms are properly presented. Any other book on the same subject would be better. If the author simply referred the reader to another book, he'd be saving the reader a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Completely Useless","review":"This book was used as a text for an electro-optic devices class that I took. I can honestly say that the book was almost completely useless to me throughout the course. Topics are covered very poorly if at all and good explanations are few and far between. You would be much better off using other books, neighbor kids or indeed rubbing sand in your eyes rather than try to use this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DFD is not at his best singing in French","review":"I bought this album because I was looking for some of the more rare Ravel songs on it, such as the Don Quichotte songs, and Un Grand Sommeil Noir. That's the only reason YOU should buy it. DFD's lieder singing (in German) is well-known, for good reason, and highly commended by everyone. But in French he's not at his best. I also found it puzzling that he sings the Chansons Populaires all in French, since the languages they are written in are Italian, Spanish, French, and Hebrew. DFD does them all in French translations. For a better version try Cecilia Bartoli (for the Chansons Populaires), or Natalie Stutzman (Histoire Naturelle)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is a Classic","review":"This album gives you about three seconds before getting to business. Their business is your pleasure, but it's the pleasure of poking repeatedly at the bruise you got from a girlfriend's bite. Oneida play with all the rock ruthlessness of a band like Lightning Bolt, but with the drawn-out (drone-out?) blissful serial composition of Steve Reich. It's better than that, though. Textures are rough but precise--a sheet of burlap lace. Instruments and equipment collapse, hyperventilate, sputter, and explode smoothly and intuitively. This is rock music! All your Town and Country discs will begin to smell like your grandma's living room. Play it loud and blow yourself up--this is about as good as it gets, friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was concerned that this would be rubbish, decades after TG was vital...","review":"...but it's quite good.

I found myself drawn right into the story, and overall, I enjoyed the read. I often look for new authors, and many of them are with smaller publishers. There are some typographical errors, but not a glaring number. Also, a few pages were printed incorrectly, but not to the point I couldn't read the content. Those problems reflect the publisher so I cannot be as harsh as some reviewers, but I have to say that I can't give 5 stars for these very reasons. I would enjoy reading more of this authors work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday romance at its best!!","review":"...I found this a very fulfilling book to read.

Like the big Klos�� book, I do not feel that this book is appropriate for complete beginners, as it does not go into fingerings of notes and assumes that the student knows how to finger all notes beforehand. However, the exercises and etudes in the book are excellent in building the student up once they know the very basics. The theory in the beginning of the book is very good as well. I would suggest the student begin with a different method book made for beginners and slowly integrate Carl Baerman's method book along the way as he/she becomes capable of performing the exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 Celtic knots with drawings","review":"This is the basic book on Celtic knots using bias strip tubes, with 12 different knots to work on.

I agree with the other reviews. The main things that set this project apart were Larry Dunn's production (his synth programming and orchestration is absolutely gorgeous, as always!) and something not mentioned in the previous reviews: Marcus Miller (how could you not mention MM?!?)!! Oh my god, the tone, the groove! Marcus was only about 18 years old on this CD, but had certainly done his homework. This wasn't Marcus' first recording, but among his first. It was definitely his highest profile recording up to that time, and notable because he was playing with Lenny White, inviting direct comparison with Stanley Clarke. Marcus doesn't shy away from the challenge, and even throws in a Stanley lick or two, as he sometimes did in this early phase of his career (check out Brecker Brothers' Detente). This CD really marks Marcus' arrival, which is (not coincidentally) also the beginning of the end of the Stanley Clarke / Jaco Pastorius era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent b-sides","review":"Meeting in the Aisle is an electronic instrumental, and shows that the band was starting to lean in other directions. It also appears on the How am I driving? EP. Lull is a very short song featuring a great guitar line and a xylophone. It manages to simultaneously be a great b-side, and sound incomplete, while also sounding like there's not anything more to add (which is probably why it's a b-side). While the lyrics are about being in a personal lull, it somehow manages to cheer me up. Since Lull can't be found elsewhere, I recommend getting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!!!","review":"Anyone who dumps you clearly has no repect for you or their self. You must always communicate to see what the other person is thinking and feeling. When they don't communicate, they could possibly dump you. Pick up on the cues. The books says about the dumping language, but it is all pretty obvious. The person is being a coward!! If the person really loves you and wants to a least be your friend then the person will talk to you about what is right and wrong. You may have started a relationship with a serial dater/dumper, who is in denial about their problems, emotional issues and fears, and you didn't find out before hand.Don't control the person because that is exactly what the dumper is doing - controlling what happens in the relationship. Confront the person with their own thoughts and feelings by communicating. Love yourself, because that person clearly doesn't love their self. But, remember, still have some compassion for that person.Take care."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a custody evaluator, I suggest this as \\"mandatory reading","review":"As a custody evaluator, this is mandatory reading for parents in my program.

Each chapter is unique, and gives homework for the person to work through topics like anger, loneliness, grieving, etc. I found the chapter on dumper/dumpee relationships (grief vs. guilt) and the chapter on love to be the most valuable. Fisher describes many types of love, and allows a confused person to sort out where they and their spouse actually stood with each other, both during and after a marriage. Unravelling confusion is important to anybody going through a divorce. I cannot more strongly recommend this book to anybody who has been dumped by their spouse.

Content is Horrid.","review":"I ordered this book before I saw the cover. I shouldn't have. Written in 1983 it certainly isn't up-to-date. Apparently it was updated in 1998, but I didn't see anything revised but a new introduction. The body type is hand lettered calligraphy. I am not kidding. Not only is it difficult to read but it repels any respect from a typographic efficianado. I'm sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good overview of basics of type","review":"Sure, you can find newer books that will walk you through software to do typesetting, but this book has some of the timeless information to introduce you to what type is all about. It has some historic information about fonts, info on leading and layouts and so on.I found this book at the library, and found it informative enough that I chose to buy it. The information did help me decide which fonts to use for a poetry book I put together. I recommend it especially for beginners, or someone who wants an in depth overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiness and Sadness","review":"This book is such a roller coaster ride. You start out feeling the love between these sisters and laughing along with their escapades. Then tragedy strikes. I had to put the book down for a little while because these characters were so real to me that I had a hard time continuing. It wasn't like reading a book it was almost like sitting down with the author and having her tell you a long story. Very personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read if you already like Greek mythology.","review":"Like most books edited by Martin Greenberg, you get a good mix of stories. But don't read this book if you have no idea about Greek mythology - you will be completely lost, since most don't bother to explain themselves (or tweak the myths entirely, and expect you to get the joke). Overall, it was a fun read that fills up your time in an enjoyable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dem Bums\\" of Brooklyn","review":"this book is a marvelous collection of material about the old Brooklyn Dodgers. It reads like a history from the mid-19th century up until the time that Walter O'Malley took the team away from their fans to LA. It touches on every major event in the team's history; and there are many. Jackie Robinson's historic entry into the major leagues is covered from every angle. The one and only World Series in Brooklyn and the lamentable exodus as well as the great rivalry with the New York Giants are explored.

It would be naive to deny that at some level, Johnson titillates by drawing heavily on the scenarios of bondage pornography. And yet he simultaneously undermines that titillation by deconstructing any fantasy elements in favour of the likely reality of the main character's growing discomfort and claustrophobia. The resultant impression is tense and highly unsettling. Further distanced from more lurid genres by Johnson's unsensational literate style, this detailed study of the character dynamics of collective evil is an under-rated classic of horror. (Mendal Johnson, incidentally, died in 1976 and never finished any other novels)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I destroyed it too","review":"The author must have been a very bitter, miserable man to have created such a torture filled book.

As a result, Brunt's account is superficial and, ultimately, disappointing and unsatisfying. Orr has hinted that he might tell his story himself some day but I won't hold my breath. I suspect he will remain a secretive, introverted man, someone who plied his trade for too short a time, then bowed out with dignity. There's really nothing new in SEARCHING FOR BOBBY ORR and, as much as I like and respect Mr. Brunt, he has done little to disspell the mystery surrounding Number 4...and perhaps that's for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put: one of the great books about hockey!","review":"Only Ken Dryden's \\"The Game\\" rivals this one, in my mind, for hockey writing excellence. Though, at only 42, I am too young to remember seeing the greatest defenseman ever play the game, I do recall his retirement ceremony at the old Boston Garden, when grown men cried at the sight of Bobby Orr in a suit instead of on skates.Just as Bill Russell is a Boston legend I never had the opportunity to see perform, Bobby Orr will forever live in my memory as the thoughtful and highly intelligent, youngish looking man who is deloved by New Englanders for all he had done.Highly recommended for all sports fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun family counting book","review":"Fun, cumulative rhyme includes counting, and family relationships (sister, grammy, grampa, etc.) as the whole family goes overboard getting baby chickens at the general store.

(She's also married to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.) This was her first Lieder recital, recorded in the early 1980s, and it presents a healthy, generous voice of almost spinto propotions in a repertoire very well suited to her interpretive gifts. The voice has a mezzo-like richness, capable of wide range of tone colors, but most impressive are her free, vibrant, easy top notes. She's best described as an energetic, passionate singer who lives the drama of the texts. The result is impetuous and often thrilling, if lacking a little in subtlety. It's a shame Varady isn't better known outside of Europe, because this is a world-class voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful guide","review":"I find it difficult to rate any one book on glassware since as any glass collector knows, one would literally have to have an entire library dedicated to antique glass only.As far as this book goes I found it to have a good bit of information on many areas of Fenton glass, some of which I was seeking and some I was not aware of. Overall,it is a good general guide, but as I said previously one would need a roomful of books to cover not only glass in general but indeed an entire section of said library would have to be just for Fenton glass.

I broke the tool, and never did unstick the drain. I was fooled a little bit by the photos of this product. As of 9/10/2012, there are two photos of this product, one in packaging and one out of packaging. A close inspection reveals that these are two separate designs of the same general product. In one, the central hexagonal part of the tool looks like solid material (other than the two holes through the middle. In the photo of the packaged version, the central hexagonal part of the tool is webbed. The webbed version is the one I received. These webs are of an exceptionally low quality, and they busted right off the tool without much pressure under a crescent wrench. I'm not a strong person, but this isn't a strong tool, either...If I was buying this tool again, I would buy a different brand name - one where the central hexagonal portion was solid material rather than webbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY - CHEAP CAST METAL, WHICH BREAKS EASY","review":"Got this at Lowes today.

Should be steel. Not ready to write off the \\"Made in USA\\" company yet and returned this for another, which is steel and has the curved teeth almost like a transmission gear. Put it in the drain, tap with a hammer and then use a 1/2 drive ratchet or breaker bar to remove the drain - those \\"teeth\\" will bite into the drain \\"trumpet\\" and will not slip.

It's okay to have an agenda, but state it and don't politicize it and make it a polemic. In other words he needs to be scientific and straightforward in making much of his arguments.

This isn't surprising considering that Lackey was producing on average 4-5 publications a year when the Last Herald Mage series was written.

I recommend reading this novel purely for its themes and concepts.

As in the first part Vanyel learned how to be a lover, in this part we can encounter him more often in a role of a father or a patron. So no heartbreaking Romeo&Juliet-like tragedy lovestory is going to happen - which was the reason I was buying the book and the reason why I was so disappointed when I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Good","review":"This is a wonderful book with probably the most loved shaych, or gay character in the literary world. Vanyel is love and beloved, the trilogy is beautiful, it moves you to believe in truth and beauty and faith and dying for things you believe in. i love you, vanyel and ashke i know that you are happy whever you are. I want everybody to read this trilogy and understand love that deep.It is a treat for fantasy fans and although the lead character is gay, it is neither campy nor porn.

I cried almost as much in this one, as with Magic's Price. (I don't want to give the story away for new readers). It kept me awake trying to solve the murder mystery. (My husband was not appreciative.) Misty's writing pulls me into the story, as another reviewer said, and I feel a part of it all. I feel so sorry for Van. I wish Misty would have given us more of his life and training, but this trilogy is worth reading. (I've read it 5 times since October 2001, and laughed and cried every time.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The entire trilogy kicks!","review":"These have been my favorite books for a very long time. I like the potential and foreshadowing in this book. The highlights: resolution of the familial conflicts, and his final release of the pain caused by 'Lendel's loss. He comes across as infinitely human and yet is still the hero we all want to be. I think I'll always love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"After pain, grief and prejudice the hero still wins!","review":"Mecedes Lackey has got to be the all-time champ at story weaving. Through all three books in this series the one thing that always wins is Love. No matter how much Vanyel suffers he finds the strength to continue because someone loves him. I haven't been gripped by a book like this in a very long time.Ms Lackey has also managed to slip in practicallity in her fantasy. Magic use has consequences, both good and bad, depending on how it's used and IF you're paying attention. This really helps the book come alive because it makes sense!I highly recommend this book and the others in the series to anyone who wishes to be totally immersed by a story and it's characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to see your heroes DO something.","review":"Then don't buy this book.This books picks up like 15 years after the one before.At the end of the last book, Van met the bad guy and killed him. So I figured this book would lead me into his maturing and learning how to to use his powers. Um, no. Apparently Van has been fighting a war some border (don't know where because there is no map!) and has this great reputation. We never actually get to SEE him do any battling. As a matter of fact he doesn't really DO anything for the first 80% of the book! Not until Lackey decides to, ONCE AGAIN, throw a bad guy at us in the LAST TWO CHAPTERS and have van kill him. So for the entire book, we don't even get a HINT there is a bad guy looming. All we get is Van's wonderfully yucky life. Then BOOM, there's a bad guy in the last 2 chapters and van goes and kills him.Wow.Exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"If i could have, I'd have given this book 50 stars!!

Sorry, people who complain that Mercedes Lackey's characters are cardboard-Vanyel, Savil, Jervis, even Yfandes, are more human than some folk in our 'real' world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting there...","review":"This book is a bit of a strange bird. I feel a little bit like the author was trying to correct her shortcomings on the first book in the series (Magic's Pawn)--and was in fact successful--but that she all but abandoned the reason I picked up the series in the first place: the gay protagonist. Yes, he's still gay, but he's totally celibate, and spends a fair amount of time wondering if he might, in fact, be straight.That said, the plot of this book is 100 times better than the plot of Magic's Pawn. It is believable (mostly), compelling, and the conflicts and villains don't just appear out of nowhere with no motivation whatsoever. In addition, there is fantastic character development, better than the first book, and many new and lovable characters with real dilemmas.Overall, I had to rate this book higher than Magic's Pawn, because there's no question in my mind it's a better book. If you got this far, DEFINITELY read on to Magic's Price, because it's the best of the three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Memoir of the 1960s Seattle Fringie Scene","review":"If you were in Seattle in the 60s, reading the Helix hippy rag, hanging out at the Eiger and the P House, sitting on the Fringie Wall, smoking dope on Hippy Hill, protesting the war, blocking freeways, going to piano drops and pre-Woodstock rock festivals (Sky River), rooting for the Seattle Seven to get off, and whatnot (and you know what \\"whatnot\\"), then you *have* to read this book. Personally, I think Crowley spends too many pages recounting distant events on the national scene, to provide background for local events, I presume, but the remainder of the book, which gets down into the nitty gritty of what went on back then on the local Seattle scene, makes slugging through a few pages on the Chicago police riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention, for instance, well worth the effort.

Most \\"ambidextrous\\" scissors are regular right-handed scissors with no special design feature other than a tight hinge. When gripped right-handed, the hand naturally pushes the blades of the scissors together. When gripped left-handed, the blades get pushed apart. Obviously a loose hinge on supposedly ambidextrous scissors makes them no good for left handed people.Even if I were right-handed and the loose hinge did not make the scissors useless (they do still work right-handed), I would still say that any pair of scissors with a loose hinge after only a couple weeks of normal kitchen use is simply junk.

Sci-fi should be based on doing something, not having boring characters discussing dead civilizations and non-happenings.In addition, the living characters were dull and stupid and seemed to unaware that they were on other planets or that a dangerous situation could exist anywhere.It would also be nice if Mr Devitt actually knew a little science to go with his fiction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psalms 103: 15-16","review":"I am a casual reader of SF books, and it is the preferred genre in which I read. I feel that Jack McDevitt had a great idea, but a little difficulty in expressing it. The plot is not entirely original, but the concept is universal in truth. One thing while reading this book: I kept thinking to myself, after I'm gone, what will I leave behind? Reading a book that only glances at that topic, it is nonetheless an engaging story, and read within two days of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping page turner","review":"McDevitt has truly created a masterpiece of science fiction with \\"The Engines of God.\\" The plot is so engaging and full of gratutious twists that it is sure to keep any reader on his or her toes throughout the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody Likes Wasted Words","review":"There's nothing more infuriating than a story that's about 5 times longer that it should have been because the author for some inexplicable reason decides to get into ridiculous details about everything from the scenery to people's private lives, none of which have anything to do with the tale and serve only to make the reading process a chore and a bore. You just want to scream at them: \\"If you've got a story to tell then get on with it already!\\" I gave up after the first few chapters. I've got a life to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci fi the way I like it","review":"This is my favourite Science fiction premise: in the future humans discover the remains of an ancient alien civilization in our solar system. Who were they? Where did they go?In Jack McDevitt's enjoyable 'The Engines of God' the alien civilization is known as The Monument Makers, as they have left monuments in our solar system and other nearby solar systems.We follow Priscilla Hutchinson ('Hutch') and a team of archaeologists as they try to uncover the mystery of the Monument Makers.The book is quite engrossing and is set up in a serial fashion with four different parts each with it's own rising action and climax, with the mystery only solved at the last climax. It also sets up for sequels which there are currently five."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Engines of God","review":"It was a long boring book. I would not buy it again.

But a book has to inspire its readers for the whole length of it, not only for the last 100 or so pages, when the story finally picks up some speed. Long dialogues and descriptions are alright when they contribute to the development of the plot, but they are not a value in itself, as which we can see them here very often. The characters may be conceivable, but their actions are slow and sometimes their motivation remains in the dark. Often the descriptions of the circumstances blur your imagination rather than make things clear.The fact that there is no ending makes me fear there will be sequel. I am not sure I will read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding First of a Series","review":"OK. I liked \\"Polaris\\" and really enjoyed \\"Seeker\\", but this one didn't really do much for me.

Some chapters would make interesting short stories, but altogether, the book is a miss. The conclusion, if it can be called that, is sure to evoke a \\"So what?\\" - even with all the amazing events that occur, don't expect a big payoff. Additionally, even though ships in McDevitt's universe posess a \\"hyperdrive\\" of sorts, the book's timespan seems to be TOO quick, thereby diminishing its scope - this also holds true for the characters, which don't seem to change much... strange, considering the amazing circumstances they are put through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DIFFICULT-TO-READ SCI-FI BORE!","review":"Wow!I found this book difficult to read and boring all at the same time. After the first 100 pages, the story goes absoultely nowhere and after another 100 pages the story still goes absoultely nowhere and so on.

I understand the reviewer who said it's an electrical issue, but on the other hand, we only have trouble with the light staying on when the water stream wasn't terribly strong to begin with.

If so, it didn't work. And Joan Crawford is all wrong to play the sexy femme fatale. Her shoulders are more fitting on a linebacker. Oscar Levant is twitchy and perfect for is role, but that isn't enough to save the cast.We pretty much know where the plot is going from the beginning.

When I purchased the power strip it came with a Lifetime Warranty. I contacted Belkin to use the warranty - the Belkin responsevia email, was that what they gave me was a LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANY and that since they are no longer producing this power strip they will not honor their warranty. They sent me a link to purchase another one. So I called their Customer Care Dept. at 800-223-5546, and they told me that the Limited Lifetime Warranty is only good while they are producing the product and after that they don't support or replace the defective product.

All he sings about is how he denies God's existance, and yet he acknowledges Satan's. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you kinda need to accept the existance of both, or neither one. I think its ridiculous to believe in the existance of only Satan because if this were the case, theoretically, only evil would happen in the world.Plus, the figure of Satan comes from Christian doctrine in the first place. I personally believe in God, and in doing so, acknowledge Satans existance. If you dont believe in God, fine, no one can make that decision but you, however, Deicide's lyrics are nothing to base anti-christian or atheistic views on, as they really dont know what they're talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of 2004 so far","review":"I got this album when it came out. Not expecting to much, I put it in. I thought the first song was pretty good, so onto the next one... and after about the third song, I got extremely bored with this album. It's the same thing over and over. No progression, no timing changes, nothing. It's very lacking, and has no creativity what so ever. Deicide is a band that brings a bad name to death metal. Hell, even Cannibal Corpse are better than these guys, and that's sad. Not to mention, the lyrics are terrible. Mad at God? That's the most unoriginal thing I've ever heard in my life. Terrible album, I suggest this be avoided. If you want some real brutal stuff, get some Cryptopsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete BS","review":"This stupid band lacks creativity!

Those are just the people that they are trying to offend.The great thing about this record is you can really hear the guitarist progess over their previous stuff on the other albums. The solos are more than just slayer-esque fast runs and whammy tricks. NOw you can hear arpeggios meshing with chord progressions, badass harmonies and all that stuff.

However, I think this CD is amazingly funny, and it's really just something anyone could put on as background music and be entertained for the half hour it runs.

My favorite songs have to be Parkinlot, Darth Vader, Take A Sh*t, Hardonz, and Mouseybrown. There's also a live MSI video for Panty Shots on here too.

Every one of their songs has enough musical ideas crammed into it to make into 3 songs. Then their awesome musical talent clashes with lyrics that appear deranged at first but after repeated listenings you begin to hear whisperings of true genius within them.Now take away the musical content. Many tracks don't even have music and the ones which do don't hold a candle to any MSI track. Then replace the brilliantly insane lyrics with vulgarity from a 5th grader. Now chop it down into 30+ segments totaling 20 minutes. That's \\"Left Rights\\" and it is horribly, painfully disappointing. I threw my copy away.

People of the weak at heart have no reason to be here, but then again you came in looking for some particularly out of this planetary comprehension 'other' than the norm type of stuff to boot! After a few quick but tracks upon first listen one hears the remincent sound of MIS permeating through the carnival-like madness contained within.

It's really amazing to sit and think about how mindless has evolved from \\"Tight\\" to \\"When Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy\\" to \\"The Left Rights\\". You have to compare \\"Storytime\\" on \\"Left Rights\\" to the hidden track on \\"Tight\\". Just take my word for it, and get this cd.

While it lacks block buster numbers, it has many fine passages, including the large ensembles. Its libretto is weak and the opera is very short -- this production lasts about 1.5 hours.The three principals sing well. Renato Bruson provides a fine rich tone, and Ileana Cotrubas contributes some lovely singing. Francisco Araiza handles the principal tenor role very ably, though he is recorded with a rather remote acoustic, particularly relative to Bruson. Unfortunately, all seem a bit unengaged in the drama. The chorus and orchestra do a good job, while the underrated conductor, Lamberto Gardelli, achieves a performance that strikes one as \\"just right.\\" This is not La Traviata -- or even Luisa Miller -- but given the weakness of the libretto, this is a most enjoyable recording. It has good studio sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unknown jewel of a performance!","review":"First of all, after all those Opera D'Oro recordings I've been listening to lately, this Orfeo recording has outstanding sound. The principals give their best; I was particularly impressed with Cotrubas, whom I associate with less full-blooded roles, and Francisco Araiza, in a rare foray ut of his usual Mozart/ Rossini repetoire. Bruson is perfection, as usual. Gardelli keeps things moving at a brisk pace. This is the only commercially recorded performance of this rare opera. I got it used and I am glad I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price!","review":"Without going into the details on sizing, the other reviewers handled that quite well. The quality is what is expected and the price so much lower than paying retail locally.

Heavy Metal Monster is one of my favs and is a great metallic guitar track. The overall theme of the album resounds through each piece, which provides a nice warm, yet spacey trip.

It's still a lot of money for a 120GB 2.5\\" drive (OEM drives go for around $60). Moving from the 20GB drive to the new one was pretty simple (just attach the cable and insert the disk), if not a bit slow (it took me about an hour and a half for the whole process).

So here's where I'm at: I could spend $100 on another \\"20\\" GB one or spend the $80 more to get 6 times the space...hmm, makes sense to me. Now if you want to get into the price comparison to PC parts, of course they're gonna be more expensive, that should be an assumed thing! People just have to realize that buying and keeping up with a video game system is costly, you are making someone rich, bottom line...if you don't like it, don't play, pretty simple.

Tons of FREE content if you have the hard disk space.I believe I can even transfer my home photos to it to use as a slideshow.Super simple installation. Insert CD, pull out USB connections, plug transfer cable into new drive and other end in the rear USB. Push A.

Doing the data transfer was a breeze with the provided cable. It took just about an hour to transfer all the data, mainly due to my large amount of Rock Band DLC. I wish the price point was lowered, especially considering the fact that the newest iteration of the 360 console includes the 120GB HDD. I maxed out my 20GB HDD that came with my 360 Pro.

Personally, I have spent the last many evenings and nightly hours getting too little sleep, unable to put the book down. I thoroughly enjoy it, and relish the critical, source-based discussion of the blackening of Queen Mary's reputation. The authoress is an expert in her field, is obviously extremely well read, and I find her writing clear, captivating, beautiful and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and Fascinating","review":"Fraser's biography of Mary Stuart remains the standard against which others are measured -- and with good reason. It is complete; containing all details available from the historical record at the time of the writing: 1969. And it presents a good case for the redemption of Mary's reputation. Though at times, Fraser can seem an apologist for Reformation-period English Catholics, as she does in her excellent work on the gunpowder plot.The book did for me what I most wanted it too; provide the full story on Mary, the Scottish-French connection, Marie de Guise, and the importance of all of these in the history of Elizabeth I. I found this book a great supplement to my other reading in Tudor history. The book is dense with detail -- but very readable and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly tedious","review":"I have not read other books by this author, but have read many other biographies of the period. I am fascinated by the times and the politics. I often will sit down with one of these biographies and be so interested I will have trouble getting cooking, cleaning, etc., done at all. Not the case with this book. I am forcing my way through. One thing that particularly irritates me is the constant use of comments from the time that look like they would be interesting, but are in French, with no translation. Another is the continual reference to portaits and busts of Mary, with long, boring descriptions that have no life. The book contains none of these illustrations, yet refers to her appearance often. I have not yet finished this book, and may have to return here to eat my words later, but at this point I do not recommend it for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI...Biographies should be NON- fiction.","review":"I could go on about this one forever. So i'll keep it short and simple(simple for all of those readers who gave this book a good review). This author is completely biased, objectivity being alien, which is a very unwelcomed quality in a biographer. Fraser sounds more like Mary's defense attorney than the objective observer she's suppose to be. A \\"biographer\\" should know better. I will never buy another \\"biography\\" written by this woman. If you want a good read on Mary, try \\"Immortal Queen\\" by Elizabeth Byrd. It's actually not a biography, but a novel, and reads a hell of alot more realistic than Fraser's \\"fantasy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a biography","review":". . . it reads like a bad lawyer's closing argument in Mary's defense at a trial. Why bad? Because Fraser, instead of confronting the evidence against Mary, ignores it all. This is certainly not an impartial biography or even an open-minded one; Fraser admits in her preface that she adores Mary, and refuses to acknowledge any evidence against her -- Casket Letters, coded messages to Anthony Babington approving of the plot to kill Elizabeth, signing her kingdom away to France when she married the Dauphin. This should have been privately printed by a vanity press at the author's expense, not presented as valid biography by a reputable publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asking for forgiveness on behalf of Mary Queen of Scotts","review":"Queen Mary was not an intelligent woman... She was carried away by her passion, feelings, desires... She has never been a true and competent ruler... She was just a tool for Catholics to be played against Protestants...

Antonia Fraser chronologically captures the life of Mary Stuart without subjectivity in a definitive work of specificity. Fraser ignored the dating complications from the sixteenth century to provide a modern biographical reader that may be read and comprehended by anyone possessing the skill of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of detail and some peculiar conclusions","review":"Fraser's biography seems to be the product of lots of admirable research. I'm impressed by her access to original source materials, as well as by her attempts to synthesize the details she gathers from them into a coherent story of Mary's life. But the conclusions she draws often seem sentimental and unrealistic. On more than one occasion, she corroborates information about a person's behavior with some folkloric history of the temperament known to run in his or her family. It sounds like someone's great aunt gossiping about an errant niece, and had to seem just as inappropriate to an historical biography in 1969 as it does today. Moreover, while she only wrote the book in the late 1960s, the author's own social views show through strongly and seem strangely out-of-date or even prudish in the early 21st century.The wealth of detail and the story they describe are satisfying in themselves, but someone else might have told this story to better effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The adhesive lasts about two days before the clip falls off the wall.

So you can judge my tastes, I also like Shaolin Temple Against Lama, Iron Monkey, Wheels on Meals, and Fist of Legend.

We see the Moscow of the early 20s, when capitalism wasn't yet banished (we see advertisements and foreign cars), a time of relative freedom in the Soviet Union, when the nightmare of Stalinism was still far away.

First of all, the alarm buttons are in a place that makes it difficult to press down. You have to actually pick up the entire clock to set the alarm with the buttons because the way it is set up, there is no leverage when try to press the buttons. Two, its not very intuitive where the alarm on/off buttons are. It took me about 30 seconds to find the off button each morning when I used it as an alarm clock. That can get annoying if the person next to you isn't waking up with you. Third, the radio quality is so poor. I like to wake to music, but all I got was static.

Unfortunately, we do not get enough of her own and her son's stories; it is not a memoir. Neither is it a well-researched informational book about adoption. The information it contains is pretty superficial. (To give an idea, the author cites People magazine for the earth-shattering news that some foreign-born adoptees are now searching for their roots.) It's also not very well-written: despite her boast that \`\`literature and language have always been part of my life'' as a translator and publisher, the author comes across as not only stilted but downright ungrammatical.

This bag is wonderful, and I know I can store my a sandwich, drink, fruit, and a late morning/afternoon snack. It holds everything well, and the bag keeps everything nicely insulated.It is important to know that this is more of a picnic bag based on its size, and it'd easily fit another food for another person if you're looking to have a picnic with your honey.If you don't have ice packs and are in an office environment, as this bag is big, it is doubtful it will fit comfortably in an office fridge.The utensils provided are very nice, but the napkin is a bit difficult seeing as it does need to be washed. The salt and pepper shaker are certainly cheaply made, as it seems like one of the lids on the shakers won't stay closed. Good thing I don't keep these in the bag, otherwise it could be a big mess.Based on all of these, I give this bag 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"lilpollo08","review":"Awsome!

This bag is so casual it look great snd the material is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Expected","review":"This is perfect for work! It holds a three-item rectangular frozen dinner with plenty of room for other items (and that's just the bottom compartment). The upper compartment easily holds a couple of drinks, a dessert, and and various napkins, pens, a toothbrush, etc. The silverware is high-quality, and I really like the zippered pouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Very good product!Solid, good looking, complete and it keeps the cold/hot inside. The only problem are the zippers. I've been using this product for a couple weeks now and I have some problems with them. Nothing serious for now but who knows... So far so good!All in short, a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Amazon Available - 5 Stars!","review":"I absolutely love this lunch bag. I got my first one as a corporate appreciation gift. Everybody who saw it wanted one too. I had to find out \\"who makes them?\\" The top compartment easily fits a 32oz Nalgene bottle. I bought a stainless steel coffee tumbler that fits without leaking too. The utensils and tableware are sturdy, durable and well-made. The plates are microwavable. I replaced the salt-n-pepper shakers with quality miniature glass ones available thru Amazon 3rd-party (webstaurant.com) at a really inexpensive price. It's nice eating take-out or lunch with real tableware instead of plastic forks, Styrofoam plates and cardboard boxes. I've given Picnic Time as wedding and birthday gifts with great feedback. At picnics, tailgate parties, beaches, concerts in the park - it makes a nice impression or adds that special touch.Picnic Time makes a whole range of really good quality picnic bags. The tough part was finding them. Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first sight","review":"I ordered this lunch box for my son (9th grade). I fell in love with it at first sight!

This does the trick nicely and with the flat ice packs I bought it keeps everything nice and cold throughout the day indoors. I did however run into an issue with the zipper but they stand by their product and I got a new one fairly quickly without and hassle. A very nice product and a nice company behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picnic Time Lunch Bag","review":"Looks like a good bag at first, until you look at the back side stitching. Looks terrible. Also in the top compartment are two stain lines in the fabric that rubbed out, but looks like something square-like may have been stored inside like a container or something, just not sure. I have reason to believe this is a second or third quality lunch bag. Probably the 1st quality is sold directly in the retail store not through amazon.com. I have never seen lunch bags in any price range in any retail stores with poor stictching on the back side bag like this. I am beginning to be more cautious of what I bag. Another thing It says it is made in China. I am sick and tired of China garbage products. Next time I will pay more and only buy USA made."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite pens","review":"I love these things.

The tale of Ferguson's year of living dangerously as an environmentalist in post-Communist (but not post-corruption) Uzbekistan is part thriller, part work of reportage and part gripping traveller's tale.Ferguson's witty, sardonic and humane narrative exposes both the environmental devastation wrought on the Aral Sea by corruption, greed and bad planning and the tragicomic realpolitik involved in international development projects.Despite the mounting frustrations of his stymied job and the corruption and crime he recounts -- including a brutal murder -- Ferguson writes with real affection for Central Asia and its people. The characters are vividly drawn, and the book is dotted with sharp vignettes of the fabled cities of the Silk Road. I hope a British edition is available soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner!!","review":"This book is about a story of 4 friends (Dez, Benny, Nick and Tee) who have lived in the same neighborhood since they were young but have had different walks of life.

You got it...","review":"I was on a tight budget when my otherwise reliable CD player (A MagnaVox) of 3 years died on me. I bought this one because I needed a cheap CD player with skip protection and a car adapter. I found the car adapter did not work, however, and so used my old one. The skip protection , moreover, is slow and fails frequently - often with little or no reason. In addition, it occasionally stops working for no apparent reason. As one final gripe, the sound quality is pretty mediocre (especially with the headphones.)My recommendation? I suppose you could do worse, but not by much.

I didn't want to spend to much on a player, so I got this one, but just ended up sending it back. I should have just saved the money I spent shipping it back and used it to buy a slightly better player. Don't count on ANY skip protection. The headphones are almost worthless, and even on maximum volume it's far too faint. Spend the extra $20 or so for a better one.

This player cannot be used anywhere but on a completely flat unmoving surface. Anywhere else, it skips so much you cannot hear the music. The headphones that come with the player suck too, they have no sound range. They sound HORRIBLE. The only good atribute of this If you want a durable Portable CD Player though, this is one. I dropped it from the top row of a set of bleachers, onto a concrete floor and it still worked. If you want the best value for your money, buy a Sony with ESP2 and spend a bit more.

I am a fan of re-mastering material if it makes it sound better but if the old style reverb still sounds like singing into an empty dumpster then why bother.

From the start, I encountered poor shifting and excessive gear noise. After two months the shifting got so bad, I opted to replace it with the previous gear oil I was using (Redline MT90). Now my shifting is back to being easier, with the gear noise gone...

Apparently my cousin, had to change out the transmission, cause he was complaining he was \\"losing gears\\".From what I've heard from other Toyota 4x4 enthusiasts, the synchronizers in the transmission require some friction in order for you to engage into whatever gear you're wanting. Seems that Royal Purple's gear oil is a little too slick for at least, a Toyota transmission.I've now got a 1987 Toyota 4Runner and I'm going to spend my money on Redline's MT-90 gear oil, since I've heard so many good things about it from other Toyota enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"omc seadrive","review":"changed the lower end oil in my OMC Seadrive outboard and took her out on two long trips and had no issues at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Power","review":"Had the differential oil changed in my 2003 Ford Ranger.

The pictures are beautiful, there is just enough text to understand what you are seeing and know about the creator, and the way the pieces are put together (curated?) is excellent.For the jewellery designer this is a fantastic resource book, and for anyone else, it is a great introduction to an artform not always known or appreciated and to the discovery that jewellery can be far more a craft.The only thing against it: it is perhaps too heavily weighted towards American creators: I would have liked to see more Japanese, Australian, New Zealand creators."},{"rating":"1","title":"500 Brooches Review","review":"This book, as all others in this series, is put together very well.

At your next party put on this CD and ask everyone who's singing. 9 people out of 10 will probably say \\"Someone who's trying to imitate Callas\\". There you have the plight of Lucia Aliberti.I've often wondered if Madame A's true vocal mechanism mirrors La Divina's coincidentally or if the lady is REALLY on an all out mission to resurrect the voice of a ghost. I just can't be sure. In the meantime on this CD there's plenty of inaccuracies in intonation, no trill, lots of wobble and high notes that sound really pressed. Likewise missing are subtleties in vocal colors and phrasing, and some really odd candenzas - all things that Maria Callas would never have let get past the studio. My understanding is Lucia Aliberti makes some kind of living in Western Europe where I guess people aren't as picky as I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shocking to enjoy...","review":"I'm sorry but I can't enjoy this recital since it constantly shocks me how much Aliberti sounds like a 60s Callas. The bottle sound, the thin voice, the phrasing, the pushed low notes and she even looks like her on the cover! I'd rather have the real thing! Aliberti's high notes are in better condition than Callas' in the 60s but it came as no surprise that Aliberti didn't last long either. I'm also not surprised that she was so welcomed by recording companies who're always looking for a new Callas.2 stars because she is the best Callas look-and-sound alike I've ever encountered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soundtrack, but new tracks are nothing special","review":"As a soundtrack collector, I've always had a soft spot for Basil Poledouris.

However, if you are looking at this for the four bonus tracks, take a pass -- they are very short (clocking in at less than 3 minutes for all four) and add nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - again.","review":"In 2007, Larry put out his Christmas Spectacular.

If I thought I was disappointed last year, this year surpassed 2008. Larry struggles through this show starting with the opening dialog. The skits are not funny. The whole theme was not funny either.I am a big Larry fan, but these Christmas shows are really not working out. If you have not seen the 2007 Christmas Spectacular, rent or buy it. It was great.

The father who spouts quotations. The abusive boss from hell. Cliche after cliche.....You can see the plot hiccups (I can't really call them twists) coming a mile away.

The obbligato instruments in opus 103 (clarinet) and opus 154 (violin) add a warm color by often depicting an aspect of the text (song 2, opus 103, the clarinet is a bird): these are duets accompanied by piano. Fischer-Dieskau and Varady deliver marvelous interpretations of the text. Unfortunately, even Fischer-Dieskau cannot rescue a few of the songs from their repetative verse form. Overall, this recording is a wonderful addition to any vocal chamber music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a striking book!","review":"I have read most of cherie's books, but honestly, nothing prepared me for Anne frank and me.

It was the first time I'd seen a male belly dancer - complete with beaded fringe belt and fringed shirt.

I would say this is the most entertaining toy in her collection of toys right now. Our daughter is very hyperactive, and we used this toy to pacify her during her feeding times. Unlike other toys I have seen, this toy has several songs and nursery rhymes, and it is an excellent educational toy for babies. Since this is a soft toy, it would not hurt the baby if he/she falls on it. Only bad thing is that after several months of our daughter chewing on the ear, the connectors broke and the doll does not make any sound when you press the ear.Now I am going to get this for my cousin's twins. I am sure they would love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy with Slight Quirk","review":"I really like this toy for it's education value. It teaches you body parts, colors, as well as having fun, catchy songs. My four-year old loves helping his baby sister sing the songs and learn where each part of the body is. It also throws in some cute phrases to make it more amusing. The only problem I have with it is it's occasional \\"creepiness\\". It's not exactly pleasant to wake up at 3 o' clock in the morning to \\"Haha, that tickles\\". My husband and I almost half expected it to walk into our room of its own accord singing. I do wish it was a lot less sensitive, which has it's ups and downs. It's great for the younger baby crowd, a little less so for the older. I think in the long run I'd prefer it being less sensitive to touch so I don't have to hear it at odd hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy.","review":"I bought this toy from Wal-Mart yesterday and my 9 month old daughter just loves it. My only big complaint is that the puppy's right foot quit working about three hours after I got it home. I guess kids in the store pressed it too much and now I have to get a new one. I know better now, I'll make sure and buy from Amazon so that I know the toy hasn't been played with. At least it wasn't too expensive. As far as educational value this toy is great there are a wide range of things that the puppy will teach your child Colors, ABC's, Numbers 1-10, Patty Cake,Parts The Body,Songs etc. You really can't beat it .Update New toy works fine,it's my daughter's favorite she carrys it around everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"puppy is fun!","review":"We bought this puppy for my daughter on her first birthday.

It's overall educational learning experience is okay. I like how you press the foot/hand/tummy/ear and it will say what you are pressing. However, what makes this toy so annoying & frustrating for both baby & me is the fact that the of/off button is on one of the feet and it's sooooooo extremely sensitive that if you barely touch it, it will switch modes or turn off! This is why I give this toy 2 stars. If they had the on/off button in the back, where it should be, it would be an excellent toy. The songs are great and the voice is cheerful and friendly. I really want to love this toy but the fact that they made the on/off switch in such a ridiculous spot makes me want to flush it down the toilet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super noisy and annoying","review":"Okay. My son has had this for over a year now. He goes through periods where he doesn't look at it for months, then wants to take it everywhere. But, it is a super annoying toy and I would be just as happy to \\"lose\\" it in the next toy rotation.One - the sensor is super duper sensitive. A strong breeze can turn the darn thing on.Two - I don't like how once a kid has put it down, it keeps chiming up trying to lure the kid back to the toyThree - This puppy is super needy. It is always asking for hugs and wanting to know if you love it. It seems like it is gearing them up for having an insecure girlfriend/boyfriend later in life.Four - as for being educational, you can't understand what it is saying half the time, and the songs are hard to play along to. No more educational than using a regular doll to teach hands, feet, ears, etc...As you can tell, I'm not a big fan of this toy. Spend your money on something quieter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The songs cut off half way through and its way to sensitive. Overall very annoying and not very educational when it doesn't even go all the way through the alphabet?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to take out the batteries!","review":"Cute? Yes. Lovable? Sure. Annoying in the middle of the night?! YES!We finally had to take the batteries out of this thing because it would start singing on it's own at 3am and wouldn't stop until someone would go push the off button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My son got this toy for Christmas and he loves it. I wish it played the entire song though, only the first verse is on there. The box advertises that it has songs, but it doesn't tell you that its the first verse. For instance if you touch the dogs ear he will sing \\"do you ears hang low\\" and stop right there. My son is so young he doesn't care, but I figure if you are going to advertise you have the songs you should have the ENTIRE song."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute","review":"this puppy is very cute and my son loves to play with it. withing 4months of having it an ear and a foot had quit working. so not too durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying puppy","review":"We gave this puppy the name \\"annoying puppy\\", we received it as a gift and the giver decided she hated it before she gave it to our daughter. Bringing it home from the store she hit some bumps in the road and it made it start up. Very sensitive, doesn't finish one song before starting another. Would NEVER purchase one, looked like a good idea that went wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy","review":"This is a cute toy. It is educational (colors, body parts, abc's , and 123's). My daughter loves the fun sing along songs. It is a good size, not too loud (like some toys), cuddly and soft. Overall, nice toy and happy with purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADHD Doggie","review":"OK - this toy is cute and my daughter seems to like it - but, it has a hair trigger on some features and it is impossible to get it to work on others. When it does work, my daughter loves it, squealing and dancing along to the songs. But, often it changes in the middle of a song - one of the feet usually triggering a change and she looks at me like \\"What happened?\\" Of course, she forgets and goes along with it but it drives me and my husband crazy. The hands are impossible for an adult, much less an infant. This toy would be great with some major improvements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Loveable","review":"My daughter received this for Christmas when she was only 4 months old. She didn't pay him much attention until she hit 6 months. Since then she has grown to like him more everyday. She loves to lay on him and hug him. She thinks it is great that he talks to her when she pays attention to him - if she accidently brushes by him and he talks she will always stop and interact with him. She loves to dance to all of his songs and doesn't seem to mind that he stops or switches songs if she touches him. I would have given him 5 stars only I don't think he is as 'educational' as they make him out to be: He does sing the alphabet, says colors when you touch them and sings a number song (but he never 'really' counts to 10-more like 1 to 9)."},{"rating":"2","title":"gives me extra sleep time!","review":"My daughter has had this puppy since Christmas and it is her favorite toy. She sleeps with it and in the mornings the first thing I hear is her puppy talking to her. It gives me an extra twenty mins of sleep time. There are even days where she wakes up, plays with it for a while and then goes right back to sleep! Love this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved this until","review":"Loved this until I found out the blue ears were toxic and my daughter loves to constantly chew on them....it is now put away until she stops putting everything into her mouth...if then"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun singing dog","review":"A friend gave my twin boys this dog for their first birthday, and they still love it a year later. They carry him around, hug him, and babble to him. Every time I sing the abc song my son will go get the toy and press the song button until he sings with me. I don't see them getting tired of this anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Puppy - Annoying Singing Voice!!","review":"My husband and I bought this puppy for our almost-6-month-old son. We thought it was really cute... it had a cute voice that sounded like a little kid talking... until it started singing. Apparently the girl that they got to sing as the puppy's voice wanted to be a Broadway singer but it just didn't work out. It's nice to put some feeling into your songs but after hearing the ABC song TWICE we were ready to throw the puppy out the window. Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes is even worse. It just grates on you. It sounds more like a bad Broadway revue than a cute plush toy. I predict that our puppy will tragically lose its voice by Christmas.Another thing that bothers me is that they changed \\"This little piggy\\" to \\"this little puppy.\\"The baby seems to like it, though, and that's what really matters here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed in this little pup","review":"I am very disappointed in this toy. The abc song stops at \\"q\\" and the \\"this little piggy\\" and \\"itsy bitsy spider\\" songs sing one line and then it's over. It is a very cute little dog but I don't want my grandson only learning part of the alphabet. I will be returning this puppy. I gave it 2 stars because it does not educate very well, but as far as cuteness goes it gets 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIce toy, but not at 6x retail.","review":"This is a $20 toy easily available at that price at other online retailers and in store. This seller is charging 6x the regular price."},{"rating":"1","title":"My child was never engaged by this toy","review":"My DS never was drawn to this toy. I tried showing him, ignorning it to let him pick it up, putting it away for months, then bringing it back out. Nothing. And it goes off on its own sometimes, not ideal when your child is sleeping or you are sleeping so I had to keep it away from all sleep areas. I am 'sure' I would turn it off then it would go on by itself again. Then there is that gosh darn 'yellow foot'. Way too sensitive compared to other parts and other parts like the ear, way to non-sensitive for a younger child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I bought this toy for my 1-year-old nephew for Christmas. I believe it to be a great learning toy but it's entirely too sensitive. Before Christmas, I had it stored in my closet and it would go off at random times, sometimes in the middle of the night! Once he opened it, it would randomly say things as well and just slightly moving it caused it to start saying several things at once. If he touches the ear and then the tummy, it doesn't finish saying one thing before it starts another. I think that is very confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of different stuff going on","review":"My daughter - 5 months old - is really interested in this toy. She reaches for the puppy's nose all the time. It's encouraging her crawling. Only complaint is that it doesn't seem to really turn off when it says goodbye. I know there's a switch in the back, but that's a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"High levels of toxic compound..bromine, mercury, antimony","review":"Fisher Price has always been very cryptic about revealing compounds in their toys...perhaps it's because they contain toxic compounds. Go to [...] to see independent testing of this item. It is rated as dangerous due to levels of bromine, mercury, antimony. I have called FP on several occasions to find out if their toys contain BPA, phthalates or fire retardants and they have never given me a straight forward answer....just that all their toys comply with US regulation. Unfortunately, US does not regulate toxic compounds like Europe and Japan. Plus, all their toys seem to be made in China where quality control and chemical testing is terrible...hence all the recalls related to lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"We have this Learning Puppy and the Hug & Learn Baby Tad and I have to say the design of Tad is much better than the Puppy. The buttons on the Puppy are so sensitive that the slightest touch changes the song or the learning mode. The Tad needs a little bit of force (but not so much force that a 4 month old can't push the buttons) and so a song will normally complete itself and the modes don't change as easily. I'm glad that I got the Puppy as a buy one get one free sale and didn't pay full price for it. My son, who is now 6 months old, sees Tad as his friend. Do not recommend the Puppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wish our Learning Puppy worked as well as all the other reviewers'! Perhaps ours has a flaw, but it seems like a complete waste of money. It switches modes with the lightest touch, and our toddler isn't prone to light touches. Every time he grabs the Puppy, it changes, even right in the middle of a song. It doesn't seem to matter if he grabs the foot with the mode switch or not. Instead of being a learning toy, it spews a garbled mix of information. The only way to get it to complete a song is to have it up where my son can't reach it... and that's not any fun!I plan to call Fisher Price to see if we can get ours replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for a baby","review":"My now 19mo old nephew loves his birthday gift dog. He doesnt yet know how to say the body parts but he seems to enjoy playing with it. It's been around for 6 mo and it looks to be durable. It looks so cute it makes you smile. For this simple fact,I recommend you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for infants and toddlers","review":"My grandson loves his new toy. It is a great buy, more than I expected for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Toy","review":"My kids think this toy is ok but it drives me crazy! The sounds and songs are cute but the buttons are SO sensitive that we can never get through one before starting another. If we really want to hear anything out of this dog I need to hold it still while it plays. When my daughter trys to play a song it will switch to something else a couple beats in.This pup is so sensitive that I almost ran off the road while in the car alone and a bump made it start singing. The chuckle I got after figuring out what the unexpected noise was could have been the most fun we've ever had with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"We named it Yellow Foot","review":"The yellow foot sensor is so sensitive that it goes off all the time, so we just named him Yellow Foot.On the song setting, it would be nice to have a delay feature of some kind that lets the song finish even if another sensor is pushed. I can appreciate that, because of the target age, the sensors need to be easy to push, but I think they are a bit over sensitive in general. My daughter greatly enjoys the songs, which I don't find annoying personally, but we rarely get to hear them unless I hold her back from touching the toy until the end of the song!I can see this being a very educational toy. It is fun, really, but it's definitely not a hands-on toy because of the over sensitive panels...especially the yellow foot.And I didn't even know there was an off feature! We always turn off the battery pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite toy","review":"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she has one at my mom's and her babysitter's house and just adores it. The price was way cheaper than at Toys R Us. She now has this puppy at 4 different houses!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for 10-month-old","review":"My son received this as Christmas present from grandma. I didn't think he would like it originally because he doesn't really play with that blue octopus where you push the legs and it says the colors, but he likes this when I push the buttons for him. It's a nice toy to grow into and nothing like he has. Multiple songs and fun sayings. He laughs when I dance with him with to the tunes and I make hand gestures with the songs (head, shoulders, knees and toes). Will be glad when he can play with it on his own though."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TOY..BAD EAR","review":"I thought maybe there was just a bad few on here when I read the review about the broken ear but about 2 days later his ear stopped working. Out of no where.THAT ASIDE.. This is my daughters first FAVORITE toy! We named him Tommy because when he says tummy it kinda sounds like TOMMY.My niece also got one for her bday, i got my daughter a new one and passed on the one with the broken ear and 2 other little playmates also have one and all LOVE this toy. We have to bring all of them to the playdate or the babies fight over it. They all snuggle it and dance with it. All babies are between 11 months and 16 months but this started when my daughter was about 5 months old. She loves her TOMMY DOG which is what everyone else around here has names theirs as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this puppy","review":"This puppy is so cute and fun. He is perfect for my 6 month old. It sings so many cute songs. A must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sensitive to Touch","review":"I bought this toy for my 6 month old son after seeing it on many \\"bestselling toys\\" lists and based on the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst toy purchases I've made. The Laugh and Learn puppy is supposed to have two modes, one for leaning and one for fun songs. The puppy's left foot is meant to act as a switch between the two modes, but it doesn't stay in either mode regardless of whether you touch the left foot or not. The puppy has many cute songs, but I have never heard it complete a song, as it randomly says things like \\"let's learn and play games\\" or \\"yellow foot\\" or \\"that tickles\\" in the middle of a song! The puppy is supposed to say these things in learning mode when it is touched, but even when it is just sitting on the floor with no one nearby, it changes from song mode to a random blurb about body parts and colors. This toy definitely doesn't help my little one learn anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Educational","review":"I kept seeing the ad for the newest version of the Laugh and Learn Learning Puppy but after reading about it on Amazon.com I realized it was a little too advanced for a 5 month old. Luckily someone mentioned this version of the puppy more suitable for a under 12 month old so I got it for my neighbors great grandson. Needless to say I am the hero! The baby loves it. He likes the music and loves to chew on the puppy's ear. His doctor thinks it is the greatest toy and so does his social worker. I highly recommend it. It's a toy that the baby can grow into for fun and for educational purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!","review":"A very durable and educational toy! A must have for your little one!!Batteries last a long time, so just keep having fun with the puppy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Gabe's Favorites","review":"Our grandson received this toy when he was born. When he was nine months old, I became his sitter. I played the music for him every day, and he got so excited when he saw me bring out the dog. As he got older, he learned how to make it sing his favorites. He started to sing along, and began to count, name body parts, and learn about the alphabet. For a long time, this was his favorite toy. I purchased a new one to give his new cousin for Christmas. When Gabe saw it, he said, \\" I have a dog like that and Baby Jaxson will LOVE it! \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good musical toy!","review":"I got this for my 10 month old son, he loves music, well its cute and cuddly but the music part of it isnt great at all! the songs dont finish, at first i thought he was pressing something on the puppy to cut the song off so abruptly so i sat down with him and pressed one part of the body and the song came on but ddint finish (like i said ended pretty abruptly) so i tried another and they all do that! not a very good musical toy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy but my kid loves it.","review":"My son adores this toy. He's 6 months old, & he loves smacking it around to hear it talk. Since he enjoys it and it entertains him, I'll give it 4 stars. The songs are pretty cute & it seems to have several of them. It also comes with a cd of kid songs that I have yet to open. I would recommend turning it off when you're not actively using it, otherwise you'll get to enjoy random phrases throughout the day, which is kind of creepy late at night. Overall, this is a good product that my kid enjoys."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN BUT . . .","review":"The good thing about this toy is that the buttons are sensitive enough that my 5 month old can turn the music on, but the bad thing is they might be TOO sensitive! She pushes the ear and if the foot touches the floor or she accidentally touches the hand, the song stops and it goes to something else.Its a shame that when we play with it, I have to push a button and sit it far enough away from us that when we sing and dance along with the song, she won't accidentally change the song.On the other hand, the songs are great and fun to dance along to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Demon Dog","review":"We gave this toy to our youngest niece a few years ago and it has received the nickname \\"Demon Dog\\" throughout our family. Sure it's great for learning purposes, however; you'll be sleeping at night and all of a sudden be woken up by the dog saying, \\"Play with me!\\" from the living room. It makes me think of Chucky. I have to say if anyone gives my baby this toy we would promptly donate it to the Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete songs!","review":"All of the songs this Puppy \\"sings\\" are incomplete!

The tinny, whiny music and words must make babies want to throw up!

The old version doesn't have the dog bone light!","review":"I returned the toy. The dog bone collar which can lights up to the music on the toy I received is missing! I checked the picture on the outside package, there is none. But on the website description and the web picture, it shows the dog bone collar. The toy I received must be a OLD version!!!! I am not satisfied to be given an out-dated version.In addition, the toy had already made songs inside the crate before I opened it. It had been singing along during the shipment. When I opened the box, the battery strip to prevent the battery to be used up had been already removed.The puppy dogs songs can only sing to one sentence then switch to other songs. I felt something wrong with this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"not played with","review":"In 3 years of having this puppy it has never been played with.

Fortunately it was a gift from a family member so we didn't waste our money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for improvement","review":"The concept is great but there's room for improvement. The most annoying thing is when you touch his hand or feet ever so lightly, a different song or message starts or worse, it turns off. So the puppy could be singing a song and you're having the puppy dance around, and oops, puppy's foot touches the floor by accident and puppy says \\"bye bye\\".

She adored it. After 1 week the ear quit functioning so we returned it and got another one. That one lasted longer, but not much after a month the ear, purple hand, and yellow foot stopped working.. My husband performed surgery on the puppy and found that the wires came unsoddered ( excuse my spelling) from the reciever this lead to the malfunction.. It is a great toy, my daughter absolutely loved it, but unless it is fixed and the quality of workmanship is increased, I would not reccomend this toy to anyone. Too bad really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cat breaking wind will set this thing off","review":"My daughter was given this toy as a gift. To put it mildly, we do not like it. At all. It has this peppy, high-pitched female voice that just makes any normal adult grit their teeth. It's just so sweet and insipid. Even worse is the sensitivity of this thing. If the cat farts near it, it starts singing or proclaiming, \\"I love you.\\" It's also deceptively difficult to turn off. The bottom of one foot is a 3-way switch for power or to switch between singing and learning modes. The switch sucks. It's impossible to know if you've turned it off correctly. Like the other 1 Star Reviewers, I have had infuriating and terrifying experiences with this thing coming alive at night and beginning to speak without warning.In my parental experience thus far, Fisher Price normally has solid products. This is an exception. If there is a toy hell, this puppy belongs there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's favorite toy","review":"This is my 7 month old son's favorite toy. He is just getting his bearings and sitting on his own and he likes to have his puppy with him all the time - even though it's as big as he is! It's easy for him to get a response because the \\"buttons\\" are big don't require a lot of pressure to get them to make noise. Which, is good and bad in the middle of the night! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is REALLY loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter's favorite dog in the whole world","review":"This adorable puppy is my granddaughter's favorite toy and has been since she saw it the very first time. She has to have it with her even going from one room to the next. My only complaint is after about a week, the ear quit working. I contacted Toys r us through Amazon and they sent a replacement immediately. She was in heaven for about an hour when it arrived and she had two puppies. (haha) Unfortunately, the second one's ear quit working less than a week later. I'm sure it will be replaced, but to be honest, she could care less whether the ear works or not. She just loves hugging and kissing her puppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensitivity makes this toy an ANNOYING nuisance","review":"I DID pull the demo tag out...but this toy doesn't finish any of the songs, etc. because it is WAY TOO SENSITIVE. The slightest movement sets it off and switches modes...which makes it pretty much useless. Definitely not worth $20 for a stuffed animal. I wish I had the receipt and could return it! Maybe Fisher Price should fix the problem and send us all a replacement part. That said, it would be a GREAT toy IF it worked properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"When we received this as a gift, I thought it was broken because all the songs cut off in the middle (e.g., the alphabet song stops somewhere around P). But when I went to exchange it, I discovered that all of the Laugh & Learn Puppies on the shelf did the same thing. What's the point of having a toy that stops halfway through the alphabet?? It makes no sense, and it's incredibly annoying. Try Baby Tad from Leapfrong as a better, more functional alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect gift","review":"I have bought several of these to give as presents and every single person has been thrilled with it. It's personally one of my favorite gifts to give. Children love to interact with it and they learn while having loads of fun. I highly recommend this for any child from 3 months to 3 years. Kids also get very attracted to the colors. Learning is fun with this puppy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying!","review":"This dog is so annoying! my daughter (9 months) likes it ok, but is easily distracted away from it; and the darn thing drives me crazy! it won't stop talking, even if you press the button on the foot to off mode. if you turn it off on the batary case inside the velcro closure, it will obviously turn off though. the button in the ear won't work either. i just think that there are much better things out there that you could spend your money on. just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"My daughter got this toy when she was 9 months old.

He enjoyed it and played with it (with us singing along too) for about 20 minute stretches. We took it on a few airplanes with us as well b/c it's loud enough that you can hear it if it's close to you but the general noise of the plane drowns out the sound for other passengers. He is 2 now and still pulls this out to play with but it doesn't keep his interest as long anymore. We can still use it to teach colors but he knows the body parts.

This item came with no pull tab to disable the demo mode. Other reviews have suggested sticking something into the slot and jiggleing around. I have tried everything. it is not only stuck in demo mode but even that seems to be faulty as if you even slightly move the toy it changes songs every .3 seconds. Seriously. there is a loose connection and it is completely unusable. And it was my baby favorite toy because of the glowing heart and cute puppy face, but the songs make her confused and drive me nuts. Great Idea but unfortunately crappy build.

It plays a large variety of songs and says things like \\"got my nose\\". It is very cute and fun. But I didn't see the demo tag in the back by the battery compartment for like a year, so I only thought it played parts of songs! It is a great toy when you check for that tag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Happiest Toys There Is!","review":"My sister-in-law bought this for our daughter when she was only a few months old... she instantly took to it... eyes sparkling and and limbs wiggling with glee every time we pushed one of its buttons.As I write this, I am hearing my daughter, who is now 2 1/4 years old, singing with her puppy from her bedroom... it is a great comfort to her as she falls asleep.It is still on its first set of batteries, two years later, and is still going strong!Since this toy was such a hit with her, for the past two years at Christmas, I have made it a point to buy one of these and donate it to the Salvation Army's toy drive. It makes my happy to think of the joy some other child will have for years to come with their new puppy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the price???","review":"I have purchased two of these for grandchildren, but obviously the price listed has GOT to be a mistake! These sell for under $20 retail. If the price listed here is correct, don't do it! Go to your local store and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons too sensitive","review":"My son got this when he was 8 months old. He loves music and he loves soft toys. Winner, right? Wrong! While this is a great idea, the buttons are too sensitive. Just brushing one lightly triggers the sensor, so we have a toy that is constantly interrupting itself and never finishes a song. It ends up being very frustrating to both baby and mommy. I would definitely not buy this toy until the manufacturer has fixed this glitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of disappointed","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was around 18 months. She was interested in it at first, but her attention soon wavered. I want to add that I have a high tolerance for annoying toys, but this is one was too annoying for me! It would go off randomly, even after I had turned it off. She was much more interested in the Leapfrog Violet Dog doll than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"neeeds som work","review":"its a cute pup but he/she is very sensitive to the touch if its singing one song and you barely touch it it turns off or changes my daughter likes it ok but it could use some imroving wish i woulda waited because now they have a pink poodle that stands and sings"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laugh&Learn Puppy toys (2 purchased)","review":"I purchased two of these Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Puppy toys on October 23, 2011 for my two grand-sons for Christmas. Neither one of these worked, even after checking the batteries. Unfortunately, per Amazon's return policy, I cannot return these for a refund (or store credit) since I ordered them more than 30 days ago. Needless to say, I was a very disappointed Grandparent on Christmas Day.Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Learning Puppy"},{"rating":"1","title":"contains toxic bromine and mercury","review":"I was about to purchase this toy for my toddler: it looks like lots of fun! But then I checked it on the healthystuff.org database of toxic toys, which rates this in the red category for having a \\"high\\" level of bromine and also some mercury. Though I'm sure there are some toxic chemicals already in our home that I am unaware of, I decided that I'd rather not pay money to introduce new ones. So, I'm passing on this toy. Too bad, because it was just what I was looking for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sensitive!","review":"The only thing your child will learn from this toy is frustration and how to say \\"Bye, Bye.\\" The one/off button is located on the foot of the dog which is ultra sensitive. You barely set the dog down and you will \\"Bye,bye\\" and again by just the blow of the wind it will turn back on, \\"It's learning time!\\" This has to be the most annoying and useless toy I have ever bought for my son. I give it two stars because it is cute and a cute idea, it just doesn't work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Having the same trouble as everyone else...How do I get it out of demo mode?","review":"I read the reviews on this and half of the people were complaining about having the songs stop short. I saw people responding to them and saying \\"You have to take it off of Demo Mode\\". I thought to myself--I'm smart enough to figure out how to take it off of Demo Mode. Well, guess what? I've read the directions, pulled the batteries out and returned them, pressed every darn button on the thing, and can't get the songs to go full length. It's irritating for me and baby. If someone can send me directions capable of being followed by a paramecium, I will greatly appreciate it.Don't buy this toy unless you are sure you can get it out of Demo Mode....oh, I know, YOU'LL be able to do it. Good luck with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent toy!","review":"Well, I buy this product to my nephew and I think that it's a the best toys that I have gifted to him.

I was wrong when I gave my son his new toy he wanted nothing to do with it. He crawls right past it and has not acknowledged this toy once. The toy is way to sensitive the slightest touch and the puppy is cutting in and out of songs or saying bye bye because you slightly touched the on/off button. This toy could have been alot better. Save your money, skip this toy and buy something that is actually educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for an 11 month old","review":"My son has had this toy for several months and he's not the least bit interested in it. Maybe he's too young for it but he never plays with it. His friend has a my pal violet and she loves it though so I don't think that's the case. It does a lot more than this dog. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too sensitive!","review":"My daughter got this for Xmas and on the surface it looks great, however once you set it going you soon see how badly designed it is. The thing is FAR FAR too sensitive and constantly turns off and on, so all we really hear from it is \\"it's learning time!\\" and \\"bye bye!\\" but no actual content. As an educational toy it fails badly which is a shame as it has so much potential. I can't wait for the battery to run out as I'm so frustrated by it from a design point of view and hearing the constant \\"bye bye\\" as my daughter tries to make sense of it makes me want to throw it out of the window.I have never yet heard it finish a song, even when I take it off my baby and try to make it play a song all the way through there will be a slight draught or movement which sets it off doing something else. Really poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra sensistive..barely touch it and it switches to another feature!","review":"This toy had big potential..problem is, when my son is happily listening to a song, and he gets excited and grabs the toy, it switches to \\"yellow foot\\". Even at 6 months he gets disappointed and surprised with the abrupt change. It will even go off on it's own if you walk by it - not cool when the baby is sleeping! Fisher price needs to make sure you cannot switch to another song/feature, etc until the last one is finished playing. Of course kids are going to grab it and it shouldn't be sooooo sensisitve to the touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Nice","review":"***Revised review***I could not adjust the rating, but would now give it 4 stars. Thanks to an email from another Amazon shopper, this toy was saved from the trash heap. I had not noticed the plastic tab that had to be pulled from the back of the toy to get it out of demo mode. Once that's removed, it works great. The quality of the sounds and songs are very pleasant and cheerful. Some of the pressure points are still difficult for my 11-month old to find and manipulate."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying, hyper-reactive, and toxic","review":"I'll admit outright that i'm not big on battery-operated toys. I take the batteries out of almost every gift given to my 1-year-old. This toy may be one of the most annoying for the two minutes it took me to deactivate it. The voice is syrupy-sweet, downright cloying.As many other reviews have mentioned, it's also extremely sensitive. The lightest touch makes the puppy start singing or talking. (However, for the people who like this toy except for the fact that it'll randomly start singing in the middle of the night, there is a physical off switch under the shirt in the back. Turn it off at bedtime, and your problem is solved.)Lastly, the reason i've taken this toy away even though it has no batteries anymore: New York Public Interest Research Group found that this toy has high levels of bromine and low levels of mercury, both toxic. I didn't like seeing my kid hug and chew on this toy knowing it contains toxic elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun learning toy.","review":"We had gotten one of these puppies several years ago as a gift for our daughter. So this year, we bought one for our 6-month-old nice that I babysit a few days a week. She loves her puppy. It's nice because it only talks when they push a body part and then it's quiet, so it's not one of those toys that's annoying and won't shut up. However, I got out the one that belonged to our daughter, thinking that our 15-month-old son would love it (kind of forgot we even had it until I bought one for our niece). Of course the batteries were dead since it had sat in the toy box for 2+ years. When I replaced the batteries, it still didn't work. I don't know why. Maybe something became damaged in the toy box when other toys were piled on it. I was disappointed that I couldn't get it to work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sensitive and too noisy","review":"My daughter does like this toy pretty well (she is 16 months) but I have put it away in a closet because it is too sensitive and with even slightly brushing against it when playing with it, it will start saying something else or playing a different song so it is difficult to endure. Also, it tends to \\"go off\\" all by itself, which is annoying if I am trying to put her down for a nap and all of the sudden the puppy, which is across the room with nothing touching it, suddenly makes a loud noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed with this learning toy!!!","review":"My daughter has the \\"other\\" popular stuffed dog toy that claims to be interactive with the use of the computer. Between the two... Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Puppy is hands down much more educational. So, this toy does not say your child's name but it does teach much more than the other competitor stuffed dog. This toy teaches the names of body parts, colors, numbers, the alphabet, and classic toddler songs and rhymes. Fisher Price this toy is a winner!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy toy","review":"My daughter got this toy for her first birthday. She's only played with it a few times because it doesn't keep her attention. The sensors in the paws are sooo sensitive that she would be playing with it while it was singing to her and then she'd bump a paw and it would start doing something else. Too many abrupt changes would leave her unsatisfied with the toy. I say this toy is creepy because it goes off in the middle of the night and has scared me to death. Waking up to hearing \\"PEEKABOO, I see you!\\" is not fun. It goes off all the time when no one is touching it. I've had to turn it off and keep it off. If you want to get this toy for a kid whose parents you'd like to scare, then I highly suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great interactive plush toy","review":"My 7 month old daughter received this as a christmas gift and has so much fun making the puppy sing and light up. This came highly recommended from other moms who said their children learned quickly from it. The buttons are easily activated and the toy has multiple functions, including singing, playing games and naming body parts. I only hope it can last long enough for my daughter to play with it for several years. The construction seems durable and there are no small or loose parts, which make it ideal for my little one to have at such a young age. I would definitely recommend this to other parents as a great educational toy which is highly entertaining and not obnoxious or annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good options for your baby","review":"This toy is very nice and cute.It's a high educational value for your baby.He/she can learn colors, words, emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"Although this toy is cute in appearance, it has many drawbacks. We actually received 2 for our daughter last Christmas. One never worked properly. The one we kept is ultra sensitive as another review states. If you barely touch any part, it will switch songs or features mid-song. Even our daughter looks at us as if to ask what's wrong with the toy. It also seems possessed as the toy goes off on its own often even when shut off. In the middle of the night it can be heard saying \\"blue ear\\". This is one of those toys as a parent that you wish were never in your house. The concept is great, but find another toy that has less glitches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too sensitive","review":"My Dad bought this for my twins, and at first I thought it was a great toy. Then I realized that it changes modes, at the slightest movement - not a good idea for the recommended age range. This toy will be handed down to my nephew within the next couple of weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"Gave to my 7 month old niece for Christmas. She is just now using it to it's potential. She is pointing to the correct spots and using the puppy as it was meant to be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted Well ...","review":"I purchased this for my granddaughter 5 years ago for her first birthday. She loved the music and squeezing the paws at that point, and later enjoyed the parts of the body as she got older and became more self aware. Today she is six and has long outgrown this little puppy, but I notice she is very good at sounding out words. I give partial credit to quality toys like this which introduced her to the concept of reading because it has words printed out on the toy. The greatest difficulty in learning to read is understanding that words and letters have meaning.I notice that the newer version of this actually costs less, so be sure to compare the two before you make a buying choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless smiles!","review":"Got this for my son when he was 3 months. He is now almost 6 months and still loves it! Instant smiles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spastic Dog","review":"My son got this toy for Christmas. It is cute to look at and that is about it. It is not helpful for education in any sense because it never finishes a song or rhyme because the buttons are too sensitive, instead it ends up speaking in a garbled mess.Be sure to take out the batteries at night, because it talks for no reason and has woke my son. Not to mention it is creepy enough to usually say \\"peek a boo, I see you\\" at 3 o'clock in the morning.My son does enjoy it though, makes him smile and laugh (4mos) but it will be useless to teach him anything with it. There are MUCH better toys out there. You are better just to stick to classic battery-less toys and help make the fun yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"real disappointment","review":"The toy was for grandson's birthday in December. He received so much, he never played with it much before it stopped working in early February!! It was a complete disappointment for me and his mother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"Our one year old loves this toy! The first one 'died' at about three weeks old, but the replacement process was perfect and the new one is doing well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will keep your little one engaged","review":"This is a nice little puppy for your kiddo. Our little one really loves it and can't get enough of her favorite toy. The material is cushy enough and the toy doesn't have any pointy edges. There are a lot of musical tunes that the puppy can play with a baby's touch. The red blinker on the heart is an eye catcher. We bought this for our nephew as well and he loves it too. Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine had two power switch feet","review":"When mine arrived I was mad because the shirt was purple. THEN I saw that he had two power switch feet. He did not have a yellow foot at all. It looked so bizarre. Then I started playing the songs and things and I was annoyed by the voice already. Pass on this and get the Leapfrog Scout or Violet instead. It's much cuter. (and cheaper)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooo cute","review":"I bought this for my one year old and she LOVES it. 3 Months later it is still her favorite toy she sings with it, dances to the songs it sings and hugs it all the time!! BEST TOY i have ever bought her!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy for the money","review":"This toy was purchased for a 6 month old child. It has lots of fun songs and states the various body parts when pressed. I think my child may get more interested in it as she gets older. However, for the money it is a good little toy to take in the car and keep her entertained a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute puppy","review":"My daughter purchased this for my grandson and he played with this some but it wasn't one of his favorite toys. The item description from the manufacturer is accurate - I think my grandson just had too many toys and this one would have held his attention more if he didn't have so much to choose from. He seems to learn colors, numbers, etc. from us just showing them and teaching to him rather than using toys to help teach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons Broke","review":"My daughter likes this toy, but it has not stood up to the normal usage of a one year old, so far both of the hands and the ear have broken. I tried calling Fisher Price to see if they could do anything for me, but the call ends up being disconnected because of \\"high call volume\\". I'm glad I didn't pay money for this, it was a gift. I'm very disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear stopped working after only 3 months! BEWARE!","review":"My son loves this toy but after only 3 months the ear stopped working. It won't sing songs or say the body part or anything. And it has not been mistreated in any way and also hasn't even been used all that much (I rotate my son's toys out every week so he doesn't get tired of one thing). I must say I was very disappointed. Children's toys should be made to last and this toy certainly fell short of that!Be very careful when considering this toy for your little one. You may be wasting your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good learning toy","review":"My daughter received this toy as a gift. I thought it was really cute at first. But quickly became annoyed with it because the slightest touch sets of the different sounds. There is no way a child could learn anything from this toy because it switches from song to song with the slightest touch. I swear you could blow on the dogs ear and completely change the tune or the message. I don't want to confuse my daughter so I don't even give her this toy to play with anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will you be my friend? Decidedly NOT","review":"In the world of baby toys, this has to be in the top 3 annoying toys of all time. Creepy voice aside, this toy is so over-sensitive that it constantly goes off by itself...even when no one is in the room. There isn't an off switch that actually works and while most times I am searching for a way to silence it, sometimes when I am trying to play with it with my daughter, it actually turns itself off in the middle of a song. I dont have the heart to get rid of it because my daughter does like it. But if this puppy hasnt found its way into your home yet, do yourself a favor and steer clear of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun toy","review":"I like this toy more than my daughter! This toy is fun but I think for my daughter she likes to see really people talk rather than only listening to the toy (because she likes to see how the mouth moves when people talk). This toy has great music and songs. I called up my mother to just to let her listen to the songs. She was cracking up. The grand-mother and the mother had most fun from this baby toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"There is not much learning involved with this toy, and it talks ALL THE TIME.

He'd rather play with other toys, definitely not his first choice.The reason why I gave it 1 star...it is possessed! Ok, not really...but the dog will start talking at random times during the day and night. I literally have to kick it across the room to get it to stop. The itsy-bitsy spider song is now incredibly annoying.Not recommended. There are plenty of other toys out there that could fill its shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"daughter likes it because it is a dog but overall it is not a good toy!","review":"Please read before you buy this toy!! We bought this toy and not only is this dog annoying because you have to be careful not to press other buttons, but the dog does not finish the songs. It would be a very nice toy if the dog finished a song such as the 'ABC's....this dog only goes up to the letter P."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ADD Puppy","review":"Maybe I got a dud, but we call this the \\"ADD puppy\\" because it can't get through a sentence without changing course! The buttons are on a hair trigger and as soon as you touch one it changes what it's doing. So my daughter will be holding it and listening to a song she likes and then accidentally touch another button and it says \\"whoops, got my toes!\\" and stops. You have to set it down and not touch it if you want to hear a whole song. Also, if you don't turn the switch off, it comes on totally by itself. In the middle of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with Puppy","review":"Myself and a relative purchased the Puppy as a gift for my son this Charistmas.

I didn't expect him to be able to play with it much at that age, so it sat on the shelve till he was a year old and when I reintroduced it to him at a 13 months old, he didn't want anything to do with, to tell you the truth I was sorta happy that he didn't, becuase the puppy's voice really annoyed me. I could hardly stand it. I tried to give it to him to play with a couple more times over the months and he never took intrest, so I give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sensitive","review":"Great idea, but the buttons were too sensitive.

It goes everywhere with her and she is learning so much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying dog","review":"My sister-in-law gave this to my daughter for her 1st birthday. The recorded voice on the dog is so cloying and syrupy sweet it can give you cavities just listening to it. Maybe others wouldn't mind that over-eager baby voice because a lot of kid products feature similar voices, but that's not the only problem. The real issue is that there's no way to truly turn it off. If you touch the OFF button on its foot is says \\"bye bye!\\" but then if you touch any ear, paw, nose etc. it goes right back into action saying \\"it's learning time!\\" or \\"got my nose, woof woof!\\" It's NEVER off. There's no turning it off. I've bumped into it crossing the baby's room in the dark after checking her in the night and the dang thing starts playing the \\"itsy bitsy spider\\" song at full bore -- of course my child sits up screaming in fright. I think the product is ill-conceived and if you are the sort of person who doesn't appreciate that kiddie voice, it WILL drive you nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm missing something...?","review":"I bought this as an angel tree gift for a local kids' charity, but I will be returning it. Admittedly I have not put too much effort into looking at it, but the box clearly states that the alphabet learning song is A-Z, which seems obvious. Unless another button needs pressed to finish the alphabet, the song only goes to about P. That's rather useless and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creep-o Puppy","review":"I got this toy for my son when he was 9 months old. He seems to like it ok but it gives me the creeps. It is super sensitive and turns on with the slightest touch but only plays a few lines at a time. Occasionally it turns on by itself in the middle of the night or when it is in a room by itself. It is really creepy to wake up at 3am to the sound of \\"This little puppy went to market.\\" Plus,it gets annoying really quickly.I'm gifting this creep-o puppy asap. I HATE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"We hate it but our kid likes it","review":"My mother-in-law gave this to my son when he was 6 months. He is now 10 months. I hate this toy. I hate the stupid voice, the stupid songs it sings, I hate how sensitive the buttons are, I hate its stupid insipid face and its stupid purple shirt.But...my kid loves it. So it stays for now. I long for the day when he outgrows it so that I don't hear \\"It's a great big colorful world out there, everything has a color that it can share...\\" (I mean come on, what does that even mean?) Ear. Blue ear. Got my toes! Tummy!

With inspired madness and genius, Mirsky delves deep into the abyss of paradise and love. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful machine","review":"We've had this model for about a year now. It's a high quality product. Even on the highest setting, it's still softer than our cool mist vaporizer on its low setting. The warranty is unbeatable. It's super easy to care for. The filter is very accessible. My husband has terrible sinus problems and this machine has been keeping him medication free since we purchased it. You can sign up for an automatic filter replacement program where the new filter is delivered automatically when it's time to change (every six months is recommended in order to maintain the 10 year warranty). It's costly, but worth it compared to the junk that you can buy in an average retail store.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"children, women, and AIDS","review":"This may be a textbook for nursing students, but I think everyone would find it fairly readable. At the time this book was written, AIDS was mostly a disease of adult men; thus, women and children with the virus were a minority within a minority. This book has more chapters on children than women and I wish the opposite was the case. There is only one chapter on international HIV-positive women and children: this may bother some people since that is the population in which the illness is most rampant. This book has lots of useful facts in it (but remember that it was written a decade ago). It discussed how AIDS affect reproduction, healt care providers, and family structures. People concerned about women and children with AIDS could really employ this as a good reference for educating the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book on the CFL","review":"First of all, Mr O'Brien's book is truly informative about the last couple of decades of the CFL's long history. Thus, if you are familiar with the league's early years, the text supplies an excellent (though sometimes \\"heavy\\" in details) history of the venerable Canadian institution. Quite a few questions and hypotheses about the social and national elements associated with the sport are offered always in an intelligent and well documented manner. It is unfortunate a prequel book (especially for the years following WWII up to Mr O'Brien's study) does not exist although the author includes a condensed history of the sport in the first chapters.However, it would have been nice if a number of pictures had been included in the book. I suspect marketing/price reasons must have prevented the author to do so.I highly recommend the book and hope that much more titles regarding the CFL would be available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected For a CFL History","review":"Being a collector of books on team histories, I bought this book expecting to see a year-by-year history of the CFL, team by team, along with many great photos. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. After browsing through this book and not finding what I was expecting, I returned the book for a prompt refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is up with this?","review":"All due respect, the cover is the worst. This is supposed to be a book about the CFL. If you want to sell a book about football, even if it's a discussion of the backroom dealings of such a sport/league, put an action pic on the cover. Brutal marketing!Next the focus seems to be mainly on the foolish expansion into the States. OK, maybe this is a book marketed at Americans but even so...talk about a too narrow focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"the german army on the somme 1914-1916","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in the Great War, I have read much on the Allied side but very little from the German army viewpoint. This is a wonderful book my only disappointment would be Sheldon's lack of maps. His maps were lacking, it would have been helpful to have some detail maps of the battle region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for many years!","review":"I keep returning to it even after trying other foundations.

Maybe I'll send him everytime! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The foundation is better than some of similar products I used, including Clinique or other bigger brands. The biggest benefit is it won't make your face dry, and the powder is fine enough so that it is hardly discernible when you have it on. The caveat is that you really need to find the right color.

The reaction time to hitting the drums is VERY slow and sometimes non-existent. It does not play the beats for a long enough period of time to even play along with it. This toy is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Who would have thought rock and orchestra could go this well together? Styx has always had a dramatic quality that no other band comes close to, but the addition of the full orchestra just gives a majesty to the Styx catalog that I never imagined. Dennis is a genius and listening to this just underscores how second rate Styx sounds without him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inredible","review":"I was fortunate enough to see Dennis perform with symphony in Kansas City last March, and even more fortunate to meet him after the show.I really can't say that I've been a Styx fan for well over 20 years because I was barely two by then. Still, I've been following them for a little while now; definitely long enough to know that Dennis was the heart and soul of Styx.This album takes some of Styx's best songs, lesser known ones, and Dennis's solo work, and puts them in a new light. It's incredible. Another reviewer mentioned that you don't know that Tommy isn't up there; it's true, nor do you care. Dennis is doing what he does best, with some of Styx's best work.I saw Styx, with Gowan, a few months after this, and it was clear to me: Dennis was the heart of Styx. There should be no doubt about it. If you are a fan of Styx, Dennis or classic rock, this album is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO PRODUCT RECEIVED","review":"HELLO,I STILL DID NOT RECEIVE THE DENNIS DEYOUNG DVD!I SENT SEVERAL E-MAILS BUT DID NOT GET ANY REPLY!

Can you imagine what it would be like to devote your life to playing really complex, subtle classical music, only to wind up playing power chords behind Dennis DeYoung's massive ego?!!

This planet is being settled by humans, but there have been some very odd children born...A rather dark book, with hints at the worst aspects of eugenics, it at the same time manages to be rather touching. The struggles of not only the TARDIS crew but also the parents of one of the mutant children against the planetary government focus in on the inhumanity of which humans are capable.Exactly how the situation arose is the central mystery to the book, and its slow unfolding is the central driving force of the novel's latter narrative.This is Steve Emmerson's second Doctor Who novel, and confirms that his first was not just a flash in the pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"a to z about alaska","review":"an almost everything you wanted to know about Alaska . learned a lot . going there in October I'll have fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Combo?","review":"I dont think it was necessary to have Part 1 and 2 on a combo pack.

That is undisputed. But this CD doesn't fully showcase the strength of it. I wasn't too fond of her first CD... I bought this one hoping she'd matured since but it has yet to happen. Most of the songs on this album are lackluster. Three captivated me... including (and surprisingly) a cover of Sarah Maclachlan's Angel (in Spanish) which she nailed with such perfection, but mostly, the album is dull. It's not all her fault... it's also the arrangements on the songs. Boring for the most part. I hope her next CD embarks on original music from her. She sings \\"The Rose\\" in English... (which Bette Midler made famous) but it didn't seem that Yuridia put much effort into it, surprising given the fact she does speak English rather well. Great range and potential... just poorly guided is best I can summarize. Hopefully she can get out of this funk by her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"No es Original/ Not Original","review":"Yo anticipe el segundo disco de yuridia desde hace meses y por fin descubri que lanzo otro, pero mis esperanzas fueron rotas este CD es de lo peor no tiene el mismo nivel de calidad que el primero y ademas cada cancion es un cover, O sea yuridia es LA REINA DE LOS COVERS o que honda, no para nada me gusto el disco y no creo que este disco fue el que decian que ella estuvo grabando en espana, o sea es de lo peor, Parecen las canciones de sobra que no llegaron al primer disco, muchos de la academia ya las interpretaron, y no es original y el retrato del disco parace la yuridia del 2005, Yuridia ya tiene un nuevo look, no no no este disco fue lanzado no mas porque los envidiosos de Azteca saben que cualquiera cosa con la imagen de yuridia va vender.

Este album es uno de los peores disco del a~o pasado en la musica latina. No hay duda alguna que Yuridia tiene una gran voz. Eso no es punto de discussion. Pero hay que ser honestos, este album parece que lo hicieron en uno o dos dias. Son los covers mas horibles que he escuchado. No puedo creer como masacro la cancion de The Police.

Excellent!","review":"This book centers on Sulla who is a facinating yet deplorable character. You can't help rooting for him against Marius and I enjoyed this book immensely. As all the other Roman books as well. Wonderful history lessons. Ms. McCollough is a perfect storyteller, I live for these books! Read on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grass Crown","review":"What an excellent continuation of the series! McCullough imbues her characters with as many heroic qualities as they have human frailties. I found The Grass Crown to be an easier read than First Man in Rome, though this may be because I was more familiar with the Roman character names and some of the history of each of them. I did find some of the depravities disturbing, but this is history and the author tells it like it was. If you enjoy Roman history and political and military intrigue, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Decay of Marius","review":"Following The First Man in Rome, McCullough has returned with a seductive sequel, detailing the falling out of Marius and Sulla, the slow rise of Mithridates and the final collapse of Marius' sanity and his reign of terror leading to his short-lived seventh consulship. Young Pompey arrives on the scene as the precocious youth that he is, along with Cicero as a fellow cadet. We can begin to detect some of Yong Caesar's drive as well, but at the end of the book, Sulla continues his war in the east and Rome is ruled by Cinna, glad to be free of Gaius Marius' army of freedmen and slaves. The current voice of reason in Rome is Quintus Sertorius, recipient of the grass crown and the leader of the massacre of Marius' slave army. I cannot wait for the rise of the younger generation amid Sulla's reforms: Cicero, Pompey, Crassus and Young Caesar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Fascinating book about strucutre of language, how people represent their external world within their mind, how their speech reflects their representation of the world, and how therapists can use the speech patterns to help people improve their lives.It's a neurolinguistic programming book, based on the work of some very gifted psychotherapists and hypnotists."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important \\"first\\" for ACNPs: Well-written and useful","review":"This impressive 54-chapter volume is the first comprehensive clinical textbook for both students in acute care nurse practitioner (ACNP) programs and practicing acute care NPs. Its focus is on the core skills, pathophysiology, diagnostic reasoning, and therapeutics that comprise the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of the ACNP's daily work. This well-constructed, well-written book deserves a close look. It contains many interesting and unique features (useful tables, for instance) and has particularly strong coverage of cardiology and some surgical specialties. As well as being of obvious interest to NPs and NP educators in adult acute care (for whom it's a \\"must-have\\" book), and perhaps physician assistants, the sophistication of the coverage in some areas (cardiovascular medicine is one), would make it an excellent choice for clinical nurse specialists and educators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Customer Service","review":"I had to order this book twice.

It has unique percussion qualities...you can play the bottom of it like a tabla, and you can flick the string to create rhythmic and harmonic tones ranging from one pitch to another pitch. You can also squeeze it by the wishbone supports to distort the pitch of the sound. The strum really does sound like a 'boing' as you vary the tension in the string. The string also feels really delicate and feels like it could easily snap by your finger when loosened to play lower sounds.When I'm not using it to play around with, it also makes a unique looking pencil holder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gates Belt!","review":"Found product online with easy at vendor site, ordered and received quickly!!Also found instructions online as to how to replace and install new belt.EASY...Great...well done by all!!

The language is a beautiful read. The subject is depressing. The main character, Kazuko, discovers striking insights to life that offer a pessimistic view. This is Osamu Dazai's way to describe what is wrong with the world. I don't agree with some of his thinking (but my thinking is, like Dazai's, subject to our historical context). I do feel the desperation behind his intentions... the confusion of a new world with old codes... a need for revolution... both socially and morally. His mindset reflects those of Japanese in transition.What's most intriguing is that this is how Dazai felt. Apparently, the suicide note in the novel is based on one of his [unsuccessful attempts]. It may reflect Japan morals, society and literature, but at a more personal level, it reflects Dazai's own demons tugging and pulling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dry, but very informative","review":"This book is part of the Places In Time series, and looks at the various prehistoric sites in Europe. All of the major sites are covered, from the famous cave of Lascaux to Stonehenge, Skara Brae and the Borremose peat bog.For the most part, this is a very informative book. The author takes a serious and in-depth look at each of the sites, avoiding unnecessary (and all too often unwarranted) assumptions about them and the people who built them. Indeed, if the book has a flaw it is that it is written in a little too dry and academic of a tone. But, that said, it is a wonderful resource on the sites, really telling you what is known about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"HD F-150 Center Cap","review":"It is what I ordered. It is what I got.

However, I won't get to try this one because it contains both dairy and tree nuts, which was not revealed in the item description, and to which our kids are also allergic. This is not an item that can be returned, but I donated my three bags to another family with celiac but no other allergies.

Who could ask for more than that? It doesn't have any bean flour in it so it doesn't have that aftertaste that is common in other mixes. There are some great recipes on Pamela's Website as well, especially the one for Cornbread. It really taste good to mix butter(or margarine) with some roasted pecans and a little honey as a topping for it. It makes really good pancakes too. The bread recipe makes a nice loaf, but I would consider it a desert bread, so although it does ok even if it isn't toasted, it's not really good for sandwiches, but it does work very well when you spread jelly or a chocolate/hazelnut spread on it. I buy this from amazon, it's a great price esp compared to the local health food store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked Bob's Red Mill better","review":"Personally, I prefer the gluten free products from Bob's Red Mill.

Amazon has a great price compared to stores near us. I cannot address how these pancakes taste leftover, as we have never had left overs when we make them.

Even my gluten-free hating husband loves the pancakes which turn out fluffy every time. I've made many of the recipes on the bag, most of them have been hits including the drop biscuits. This has also come to be a replacement for regular flour in regular \\"glutened\\" recipes such as banana bread, macaroni and cheese and gravy.

I really feel good using this mix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite surprised!","review":"I was really hoping the positive reviews were accurate for me (meaning same tastes in food) as I have been expensively disappointed in the past w/ a few of the 5 star food reviews. I just finished my first pancakes. They were very good as they looked and tasted like typical pancakes-well, maybe a little lighter and tastier. I was VERY pleased and will try the other recipes on the package. To make the standard pancakes, it only took one egg, one tbsp. of oil and 3/4 cup of water. Since i cooked them using my Anolon titanium pan, no oil was required. Quick, easy and delicious topped only w/ organic maple syrup. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Pancakes I have ever had in my life ~~And I made them. :)","review":"I have never been able to make a good pancake except for buckwheat. When I saw this as a lightening deal and read all the 5 star reviews I figured it was worth the try.OH MY GOODNESS~I just made the most wonderful fluffy light and thick pancakes. I have never and I mean never had such a good pancake. Being wheat free is a bonus. I don't have to be gluten free but I do tend to be a bit sensitive to too much wheat at times.I almost wanted to take a picture of these pancakes. I could not believe I made them. You have to give this a try. I will never want another pancake but these. They are much healthier too, I used the spray butter on them and sugar free syrup and even with those two things they are FANTASTIC.I will be on subscribe and save when my supply runs low. I cannot wait to make other things with it for the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the ingredients listed?","review":"I tried reading all the information on this before I bought it to find out what the ingredients are.

Crusty, Dense, Sweet! Can't make a meat sandwich out of it because it is so sweet! Try Gluten Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich or French Bread & Pizza Mix, they taste like real bread!

Well not with this mix and all of Pamela products. Let me tell you she knows what shes doing. I make peanut butter cookies that some people say taste BETTER then the wheat version (and I use flax oil butter and organic peanut butter as well as 1/2 white sugar1/2 stevia and its actually healthy!). I make pancakes that are so good I cant believe my taste buds. I love to make PB&J sandwiches with the thick pancakes and it is the best. So me and my Celiac sis swear by all Pamelas products. You should definitely try the bread mix you will be amazed.

I make my waffles with buttermilk and they are delicious! I highly recommend it to anyone. Buy it in the pack of 3 from Amazon for the best price since it is expensive elsewhere. Only half a cup of mix per meal for me makes a waffle and a little left over for dog treat. Dog loves it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST of Gluten-Free","review":"I was blown away by how amazing this baking mix is. I made the recipes on the back of the bag and they were incredible. I have been sensitive to gluten for years and have tried EVERY gluten-free product out there. Once you try this stuff, your search for a good flour substitute will be over. Guaranteed. The simple drop biscuits actually puff up and are light and delicious (I added garlic powder, oregano, and shredded cheese to approximate the Red Lobster biscuits - they didn't disappoint!) The pancakes/waffles are fluffy and wonderful, and they even freeze and reheat (toaster) perfectly. My 1 year old loves this stuff and you will too.

Her writing style is as crisp as ever, and the plot has light touches of the magical realism she used more in later books. But I didn't connect particularly with most of the main characters. The elderly woman who is a catalyst for several of the key events in the story, and the \\"giant\\" introduced quite late in the book, are far more interesting and clearly-drawn than the couple whose marriage is supposedly the central plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly written","review":"Hoffman never disappoints. The characters are real, and I found myself spellbound and laughing at parts, near tears at others. I couldn't wait to see what happened to the giant and the old woman who couldn't fly. I love how she handled the tryst and really didn't tie up all the loose ends so my imagination can keep these folks going.And she crafts her prose with such a bare-bones command of the language that it's a joy to read. No extra fluff, no adverbs in the way. She just goes right at it with amazing skill that must be the combination of a supernatural gift and years of honing her talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A + ALICE","review":"I love Alice Hoffman books.

The people didn't seem very realistic to me at all. Their responses to situations and interactions with one another weren't believable at all. There is a lot of talk of love but I don't feel any kind of love between any of the characters at all. As much as I was hoping to get to the end when it finally did arrive I was like what? It just ends. In what seems like the middle of the story. While I really like her other books I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad and touching","review":"I liked this book.

Often, these stronger math students are weak readers, and it's because of this I recommend this book. Each topic is introduced with a problem/question (math students love problems), and the answer is given with a short (1 to 2 pages) easy to understand explanation.This book is a good counter balance to very theoretical physics books. It has almost no math, and concentrates on explaining physical phenomena with simple sentences, not equations. Someone with no science background could read this book without any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Physics","review":"I have just received this book and wow!! very good provocative questions (many with lengthy answers) that challenge your basic physics understanding.

I am having lots of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the bags are adaquate, but the frame....","review":"I have to say that I was so excited when I bought this strainer. It looked so simple, and so functional, and best of all, so affordable! Then I attempted using it...The bag falls off the frame if you fill the bag more than about a third full, no matter how tightly you tie the strings. The reason for this is that it can't slip under the metal loop completely to grasp better because the legs of the thing come directly out of the hoop, and for intensive purposes, from the edge. There is nothing for the bag to grasp. I do larger batches of jellies, and having to slow down production this much is unacceptable.The upshot is that the bags work. If you've already bought this, and have access to some gallon-sized glass jars (ours were originally pickle jars), you can use those and put the bag in them. It works PERFECTLY. Almost as if that was the original idea..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story Every Child Will Love","review":"IN REVIEWOne-Eyed Jack is Paula Miller's first children's novel, and the first in her Faces in History series. One-Eyed Jack's antics and the conflict he stirs up on a ranch in the 1880s make excellent reading for children ages seven and up. The three siblings in the book face the same issues as young readers today--family conflict, respect for parents, and faith. Young readers will doubtless see resolutions for their own problems as the main character Nate confronts his issues.I recommend this heartwarming tale for any child, especially if it can be read aloud by an older reader who loves a good story. Miller skillfully weaves her points among the blades of story grass. Everyone will be inspired as Nate overcomes his personal obstacles with faith and perseverance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of CRAP!","review":"This product is quite possibly the worst performing electronic device I have ever seen.

Other writers on Kosovo are quite biased which often makes their work less valuable. Noel Malcolm, however, writes un-biased and entertaining about a difficult subject - his book can be read right through and is also working quite well as a manual about Kosovo. This was the book I took to bed in Pristina in the summer of -99- and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a simple (if not so short) history of Kosovo. However, if you are looking for an analysis of the strategic role of Kosovo in the Balkans on the border between East and West, you will have to go elsewhere.

I bought the book hoping to find out something about Kosovo and the people who inhabit the province. Instead I found it tendentious, uninformative and rather unpleasant with its obvious pro-Albanian agenda. Malcolm does not seem to have written the book with the aim of informing readers about the region, but rather to further his believ that Serbs and Serbia are to blame for all troubles in the region and that whenever Serbs suffer they somehow have only themselves to blame!

It is accurate. I rated this only 1-star, because it stopped working after only 7 months of use. AND, because the 1 year warranty is not what it seems, due to hidden costs to use the warranty if the pedometer breaks.Omron warrants the pedometer for 1 year, and will repair or replace it if it breaks within the warranty period. Seems fair.BUT..., it costs about $5 to ship a broken pedometer back to Omron.Omron charges $8 for return shipping after it repairs/replaces the pedometer.It is cheaper to buy another one for $15. Good item for as long as it works...which was not long enough in my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's defective...","review":"...don't expect Omron to act respectably. Mine stopped counting steps after three weeks of use. To get a replacement, you must call for a return authorization and address (this info is not in the manual), and then you learn that they demand $5 for 'shipping and handling' this 1 ounce item, which is on top of your cost to return it. At least in my case they first try to induce you to buy a new battery, telling you that it only comes with a 'trial battery,' although the manual again says no such thing and this web page says the battery should last a year. All in all, this company is sleazy, so you'd better hope that your item doesn't fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product and even worse service","review":"I ordered 2 pedometers. One works fine, but the second one does not recognize the actual number of steps taken. As my husband and I wore the pedometers on a walk, the bad one recorded 1/10 the expected number of steps. When I called Omron to complain, I expected a replacement. Instead, she wanted me to mail it to their service department so they could evaulate it. $8.00 shipping each way. When I explained that would cost more than the pedometer, she suggested replacing the battery even though the serial number of the pedometer showed it to be only 6 months old. Tough luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Step Counter","review":"This is a very good step counter for a relatively low price. It counts steps and it includes the time.

It is also accurate only for steady walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condensation build-up","review":"I LOVED this until the 4th day using it, it was really hot outside and i went on a long run.

The replacement worked for a few months, and then it stopped working too. The screen worked, the low battery indicator was not activated, but it just stopped counting steps.I like the concept of a pedometer and this model is simple and easy to use, with a clear display and easy scrolling of step counts for the past seven days, but if you want a product that will last, I suggest you avoid this model and perhaps avoid Omron entirely, as I expect most of their models use the same basic design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron HJ-150 Hip Pedometer","review":"The Omron keeps great walking statistics (up to one week) and also keeps track of the time.

The people in this film were hard to connect to as we only got snippets and summaries of their lives in brief interviews. It feels like each of these people had 7-minute interviews that were chopped up into a movie; it's really a bunch of mini-interviews, not a documentary about people's lives. And listening to them whining about how hard it is to be black wasn't particularly interesting. I am black so I know what it's like; that's old news.

Having been in a few scenes here and there, there is always the token black kid among them. I was looking for a real innovation, perhaps a personal story or two. Instead, I got a very generalized look at why others are punk rock. Alienation, feeling outside of society, feeling misunderstood are all a part of it. These black kids that were profiled in this documentary were one of the few black people in their community. They will naturally look to what the white kids are doing for entertainment. Maybe this was with limited access to cable television and the Internet, but it's really not surprising how black teenagers will look to punk rock in some places and hip hop in others.There are no surprises here. The only highlight was seeing a few interviews with members of the Dead Kennedys.

Mysterious ballads from Cherie Currie, with smoky, sexy vocals (MUCH better than her awful solo stuff), and a wild album cover to boot. The opening track is amazing, Joan singing the title track.

Well, a few months ago my G2 ran out of ink, and the only refill in the supply closet at work was a cartridge for an Impact RT. It's slightly longer than a G2 refill, but I gave it a shot and it fits...and WOW!I like a bold line, and this is BOLD! It's almost like writing with a fountain pen. I just love the flow of the ink and the look of the lines it makes. I've only ever used these refills in my G2 pens, so I have no experience with the actual Impact RT pen.

The authors did a good job of putting the Doctor and his friends into history. The Doctor is also helped by a young documentary journalist named Claire. The book at times reads like one of the many purely history based novels like \\"The Plotters\\" or \\"The Witch Hunters\\".

First, don't be discouraged by flawed first drafts and scenes that don't match the images you had in your head when you decided to write them. All writers experience this. Rewriting is where the magic occurs.Second, only include writing that advances the story or reveals something important about the charactor.

They worked out great - they are comfy, sleek, and don't get stretched out easily.However, since I am 5'2\\", I needed to hem them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing way off","review":"The waist of these yoga pants is so small I could not get them on. No stretch to it. I held these up to other yoga pants of the same size in my closet and the waist was several inches smaller. The material was not soft and comfortable for what I would expect and want in a yoga pant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable Pants","review":"These pants are wonderful. I purchased them for my tap dance class. Very comfortable even for someone who wears 12 in pants. I purchased a large, because I'm quite curvy. They fit very well, they move very well with my body type. Just perfect for my 5\\"6 height. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yoga pants i've ever found. Love them!","review":"I just received these pants in the mail and they're great! I am 5'8 so they aren't as long as i would usually like them to be, but they are long enough so they'll do. :). They are comfy and fit perfect!! I will definitely recommend these to anyone to buy. Great for taller women, which yoga pants, as well as all pants are SO hard to find that are long enough for me so i love that about them, but i will most definitely buy ANOTHER pair of these again shortly! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga pants","review":"Great yoga pants for the price. They fit nicely. Only problem is they do begin to fade quickly after several washes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as long as i thought they would be","review":"They are realy comfortable. I love them.

Feel nice on and i would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to size!","review":"I bought these pants in anticipation of giving birth in the next week, thinking I needed some comfortable pants to lounge in afterwards. I usually wear an extra large, so because I knew I needed room I bought a 2XLarge. These things did not fit!! I could barely get them over my butt! And they fit VERY snug in the thighs. I know I'm 10 months pregnant, but even my maternity clothes are not a 2XL. Thee things should have fit! They are not true to size, and will NEVER purchase from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late coming, but it did finally arrive","review":"We had some shipping issues with this product (as we did with about 6 others). This one was delayed, but eventually did find my recipient and she loves them. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"Cute, breathable. Could be made a little more durable to last longer. A nice pant for a thin person it may last longer. Others, you will need a sewing machine to extend life. I would repurchase for the nice low price, until I find a more sturdy product that might last a little longer. Also could be made and available in petite size (short). I just cut off the ends, and product still looks cute for workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST TRIFLING","review":"I WAS SO EXCITED TO RECEIVED MY PANTS TODAY. THAT TURNED SOUR REALLY FAST. THE PANT WAS BALLED UP IN A BAG THAT WASN'T SEALED AND EXTREMELY WRINKLE, I WAS REALLY SCARED TO TRY THEM ON, ESPECIALLY WHEN I NOTICES THAT THE RETURN SECTION ON THE PACKING SLIP WAS MISSING. I'M NOT GOING TO SEND THE PANTS BACK BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY HATE FOR THEM TO RESEND IT TO ANOTHER CUSTOMERS. TRIFLING - IF I COULD GIVE THEM A HALF OF A STAR I WOULD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs small","review":"These seem reasonably well made, but they are SO SMALL.

They were WAY too small. I was so looking forward to wearingthem and I am greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fabric, run a tad small","review":"Bought these because everyone mentioned how LONG they were. I am 5'10 and hate spending $20 more for longs or talls, so I ordered these. Like them but I don't find them all that long. In fact I hope they don't shrink in length, or I will be out $19. Suggest buying a size larger as they don't stretch as much as standard lycra-sorts of yoga pants. Love the fabric. Nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite yoga pants that I own!","review":"I received these pants, in a medium, as a gift a while ago. I had never owned a pair prior to that but when I tried them on, that changed. I'm 5'6\\", 135 lbs and they fit me perfectly, just a little on the long side. I would typically buy a medium in everything so all the other reviews saying to order a size up must not apply to me. I love the thick material, the nice flare, and that they are super comfy. I did end up buying all the other colors and they all fit perfectly as well. The other colors don't seem to run as long as the black though. All in all, I will continue to order these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not True to Size","review":"I like the material and design of these pants. Unfortunately, they are way too small. I ordered my size, according to the size chart, but they arrived and as soon as I pulled them out of the package I just folded them up and put them back in the bag. I know for a fact, they wouldn't even go over my hips. I ordered a 2X, they look like a large (at most)."},{"rating":"1","title":"sized small","review":"Just got these pants in the mail. I ordered a size up as I was looking for a loose fit. upon trying them on, I realized that instead of having a wide elastic band, it is instead very narrow and fits very snug, even though I sized up. I plan on returning these as the fit is uncomfortable. If I would re-order these, I would size up yet another size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go up a size!!","review":"Decent pant, but way too small..I'm a small/ medium but the medium was way too small..

The waist band is not too tight and the length is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pants","review":"I ordered an XL size because from reading reviews on the pants they run small and not true to sizes. The reviews were right on point! The XL were more like a med/large. They are pretty pants made from great material."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"L is not Large - it was Medium.They fit, snugly, but wouldn't have survived the first wash.I returned this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tight band!","review":"I found these pants while I was looking to buy a secondary pair of yoga pants from a brand that I already own. These were suggested by Amazon and I was drawn to the fact that these had a long inseam. I prefer yoga/ athletic pants to be long.So, I ordered these in black and I was disappointed. The top band of these are WAY too tight. They are high waisted and sit at the top of your natural waist, which I do not care for, and then, the top band is very constricting. Many brands of yoga pants have a band that you can fold down- these also do not fold. These are very uncomfortable to wear. I am a medium in most clothes- sometimes a small depending on the brand. The medium fits fine everywhere but at the top of the waistband. I do like that length, but thats about it. I wish I had just ordered what I had intended to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga pants","review":"Yoga pants were long and tighter than most. I usually wear a small, but heeding the warnings, I bought a medium, and was still plenty tight. And plenty long too.

Not one pair fits the same.I have an Xl that fits fine, a XXL that is so tight they are smaller than the xl, and an XXL that is so big they roll down the waist when I walk.I personally feel they are tagged wrong. If I hold all 3 pair up to each other, you can clearly see they are not cut the same, the one xxl is much smaller than the xl.Great pants, but your taking a chance on the size.For reference I'm 5'7 and wear a 14/16."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bake-Wear Set","review":"I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this bake-wear outfit. My daughter is 6, and it fits her perfectly and she looks so adorable in it. The colors are bright, the material durable and the pot pad and mitt work just fine. The wooden spoon is more decoration than actual functionality, but it looks great in the apron pocket. She was very happy Santa had left it with her easy-bake oven on Christmas morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls Cook Apron, not more","review":"I wanted this set for my 3 years old boy, but it is purple and pink. so only girlish colors (i thought it would be blue). the apron is nice. but it uses a small velcro to close. so you cannot adjust the size very well. it is recommended for ages 8 and up, but the hat is already to small for my son, who's head is just normal. it only fits my 1 year old, but it is tight on him too. so we cannot use it. and the hat was the reason i bought this set. i would not buy it again and therefore not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin revived","review":"This is a thought provoking and valuable contribution to the educational drive in England and America to revive Latin as a core foundation subject and as the key to European culture, classical and Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anacondas - Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"Bad actors, bad script, and was this some college student-directed flick that got out of the can? PLEASE put it back in. Do yourself a favor and miss it. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I use to be easy at forgiving some flaws but...","review":"As I told in the title, I use to be easy at forgiving some flaws but in the first scene they just happen to show at least three species that doesn't exist in Borneo, one of them the Anaconda itself. And then, please, repeat with me, Anacondas are slow and vulnerable on land. They do not move fast as lighting, they feed just once at a time and take lots of time to digest the prey. They don't go eating again and again. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks ok, but...","review":"...\\"Anacondas - hunt for blablabla...\\" is just another one of those many B-monstermovies out there missing style. I'd watch \\"Lake Placid\\" one more time instead, because of the personality/ties that movie is containing. You don't get \\"close\\" to any of the characters in \\"Anacondas\\". And so the story keeps missing something so essential in a story being told until the movie is over. And that's the problem, it's not about how \\"real\\" it looks or not. The snakes are rather good, but \\"Anacondas\\" is not thrilling. It didn't shake me one time -and this because of the camera, the editing and the music. The timing simply isn't there. I don't think I'll watch it again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Action Horror Movie!","review":"I can give this movie 5 stars cause although there is not much CGs, it's really a good Action Horror movie and really makes sense! You think cause the name of movie is \\"ANACONDAS\\", you'll see many Anacondas and too much CGs, but CGs and Anaconda scenes are much less than the first part. this movie technically is an old movie and most of the special effects are as good as early 80s! but that's not really matter, Conclusion of a very good production, very good directing, very good and reasonable story and beyond of all, very good actings is a movie that I can give it 5 stars! and at last, cause there is not much Anacondas, don't refuse to watch it, it's not boring and grabs you from the first scene till the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly but loads of fun","review":"As dumb as it is, you'll no doubt be highly entertained by Anacondas, the far superior sequel to the 1997 original. This time around it's the greedy co-orperate types who are the real snakes, the reptiles are bigger and scarier, the direction darker and more complex and the fun level higher.I would have liked to have seen more people gobbled up but it's mighty fine, completely harmless fun for what it is. Anyone judging Anacondas as anything other than popcorn fare doesn't deserve to have their opinion listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the negatives","review":"I saw this movie in theaters and it wasnt bad. I didnt walk out feeling that i just wasted 9 bucks on a horrible movie. The actors werent bad and neither was the snake. Hell, even the story wasnt too bad. Come on folks, we want action and not an in-depth storyline with character development anyway, do we?...then I read the reviews about poor special effects and was amazed. Poor special effects? The special effects were much better in the second film. The acting was much better in the second film as well if you exclude the acting talents of Eric Stolts & John Voigt(sp?), from the first.I even plan on purchasing the dvd when it is released. I gave this flick 4 stars considering their budget restraints. Though if i were to compare it to every other giant snake flick ever made--and their are alot of them out there--then this would be 5-Star all the way. So i say, ignore the negatives and buy this movie for it is definitely better-than-average. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the first","review":"i seen horrible cheesy movies but this 1 doesnt come close guys now i probably raised a disagreement somewhere but thats part of reviews right?anyway just a quick rundown for those who havent checked this out yet its basically a team of young scientists who are planning a trip to Borneo somewhere near Vietnam if im not mistaken to attain an orchid that makes you young forever and along the way they encounter problems with their boat, escaping huge anacondas that dont know when to stop, and somehow surviving...thats basically the storyline you have to follow. i seen this in theaters for free so i couldnt complain much... i thought it was good enough to own on DVD so you be the judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The First.....","review":"I much rather Anaconda as to this film. Although I have to say that this movie is more of a comedy than anything else! Of course, we have the Cool snake but to me, this \\"sequel\\" doesn't deliver as much suspense as the first and does not have as good a cast. Good special effects but not as good as the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst snake movie ever created since \\"Rattled\\"","review":"OK, this was the worst movie about a giant snake/snakes I'd ever seen. And the worst movie about snakes I'd ever seen since \\"Rattled\\". The Anaconda's in this movie aren't that mean looking and you never really even see them squeeze anything to death and swallow anything whole. So it does not surprise me that people are trying to sell this movie for one cent on this web site.
