My husband and I are going to take him to see his own \\"grampy and grammy's\\" pumpkin patch too so he can experience first hand how a little baby pumpkin grows into a jack o'lantern. If our two year old learns the virtue of patience in the process, it will be an added bonus!The author,Nancy Skarmeas, also has a series of books about many Christian holidays including Valentine's Day, Easter and Christmas.

I enjoy listening to this over and over again ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 4 Stars Because \\"Nebraska\\" Got 5","review":"This album will rip your heart out. Like \\"Nebraska\\" it is deep and thoughtful, perhaps not as \\"dark.\\" It reminds me so much of Dylan at his best - listen to the harmonica.Much of it is \\"derivative;\\" the melodies go back to earlier stuff.I would, however, like to take this opportunity to say thanks to his backup - Max, Nils, Stevie and the rest of E-Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nebraska, more like Toledo","review":"I am a huge Bruce fan and I was looking forward to this album. However, it's not the new Nebraska. I don't know why Bruce has started singing in that weird Dylan-on-helium voice, but it's irritating to listen to and distracts from the lyrics, which are a disappointment on this album. Buy Ghost of Tom Joad if you want to hear Bruce using profanity, including the f word, on \\"My Best Was Never Good Enough\\", yet another whiny song about his divorce, or for the song \\"Youngstown\\" which is one of the best that Bruce has written in the past few years. Otherwise, buy Nebraska and pretend this album never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated sleep-inducer","review":"I've been a Bruce Springsteen fan for most of my life, but I really can't get into this album. Folks, it's not his best album (that would be either Born in the USA or Darkness on the Edge of Town) nor is it a classic. Youngstown is a great song, but the rest of this album isn't that great. One review said that this album was \\"the best driving music ever made\\". Trust me, if you listened to this album while driving, you'd fall asleep at the wheel.If you want a great acoustic album by The Boss, check out Nebraska, one of the best ever made. The Ghost of Tom Joad pales in comparison.I've heard a lot of comparisons between The Ghost of Tom Joad and The Boss's latest album, Devils and Dust. For the sake of Bruce fans everywhere, let's hope those comparisons are false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, those poor illegal immigrants!","review":"This is the kind of album we can count on from Springsteen when he's in a folksy, populist mood. But it just doesn't hit home, both in terms of Springsteen and folk populism in general. As a Progressive, I can appreciate his lyrics about injustice heaped on the downtrodden. But this music is sung and played without any conviction. The music is unmemorable. The synthesizer adds a welcome touch, though. When Springsteen moves to the plight of immigrants, he loses me. Those of us who have had our careers and workplaces ruined by legal and illegal immigrants can't work up any sympathy. To be a complete artist, Springsteen needs to produce albums like this and \\"Nebraska.\\" But if the songs aren't tuneful and the performance is half-hearted, it won't do him or us any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it ... only if you a maniacal fan of Bruce !","review":"This CD is probably the WORST in Bruce's carrier . It is terrible from the beggining to the end , with a single exception .... \\" Youngstown \\" All the rest is something to forget . I think , Bruce should stay at home , instead of recording this garbage ."},{"rating":"2","title":"America in verse","review":"Simply his best. Forget E-Street and electric. Bruce shines. The tunes are folkish, haunting and telling. Like \\"Nebraska,\\" Bruce takes you on an American journey, exposing us to comman-man truths of this country. The vivid imagery is compelling. Also, if I remember correctly, Bruce himself traveled some rails for inspiration with a sociologist researching a book--sorry I can not remember the author or title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it another try","review":"I just witnessed Bruce's Nov. 14 show in Cleveland, Ohio, from the fourth row. To sum it up, I was deeply moved. It was almost a life changing experience. Bruce played a couple of songs from this album, \\"Youngstown\\" (my hometown) and \\"Ghost of Tom Joad.\\" His performance was so powerful, I had to give this album another listen. Perhaps the songs are soft and depressing, but no fan should be without this album. This is an album you have to listen to four or five times before you really soak it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"From the first to last songs, Springsteen is at his best. I've enjoy most of his earlier stuff and when he came out with Nebraska it was well worth the wait. The Ghost of Tom Joad is for the true BOSS fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"When I first heard this album, I ignorantly decided it was the worst Bruce album ever, and it sat on the shelf for about two months. Then I saw Bruce on his solo tour, and started listening. I don't think there's any Bruce Springsteen album that takes longer to appreciate than this one, but when you get to that point, wow. It almost makes Nebraska seem two dimensional and immature by comparison. This is the work of a master. It has stayed in my CD changer for the bulk of the 3 1/2 years since it was released. For the listener who just wants the next Bruce rock and roll album, spend your money on something else. But for the person who wants a true experience, and trusts Bruce Springsteen to take him/her there, The Ghost of Tom Joad is a true reward, and is clearly one of the greatest, most challenging, and most rewarding music experiences you will ever find."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"As far as I am concerned, this is the best album Bruce has ever made. As I own practically every album he has released, I am speaking with some knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Bruce's weakest album!","review":"Bruce has been writng about the working man for a long time now. However, for the first time, the stories in his songs seem forced and artifcial. Like he is writing experiences he's gotten second and third hand, rather than lived. He's moved his characters out of New Jersey and into the southwest and it seems false. It dilutes the work and the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment of epic proportions.","review":"In the past decade, Springsteen has grown more and more detached from his own music. On \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" he sounds as if he's recorded himself reading the paper whilst strumming a guitar. Only \\"Youngstown\\" shows flashes of Springsteen's former intensity. The rest is the work of an artist who has lost interest in his fans, in his music -- perhaps even in himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Nebraska\\" it ain't","review":"I was excited when I heard that Bruce Springsteen was going to record another album in the \\"Nebraska\\" mode. My excitement turned to disappointment, however, as I listened and realized that there are no songs here close to the power of that album's \\"Atlantic City\\" or \\"Johnny 99.\\" What you get instead is a lot of standard folk-singer-stands-up-for-the-downtrodden tunes that fail to achieve any transcendence. Bruce's stand for the oppressed would be a lot more convincing were he not already a multi-millionaire rock star. This is a well-intentioned but ultimate self-indulgent effort from an artist capable of much better. Never was the need for Bruce to bring back the E Street Band more evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This album is a disappointment. Use your money to buy something better like The River. Only die-hard Springsteen fans would like Tom Joad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the music ?","review":"This cd is the most depressing and has the worst music of any of Bruce's recordings. Many of his past recordings have been depressing, but the music always made it listenable. There is basically no music on this cd. I haven't been able to listen to all of it without falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsure and tuneless, but Springsteen's not a lost cause","review":"This is, to me, Springsteen's first wholly unsatisfying record. \\"Lucky Town\\" and \\"Human Touch\\" did not sustain the excellence of his work from \\"The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle\\" through \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" but they had a few moments on each of them worth saving. With the possible exception of \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" this album lacks the focus and haunting tunefulness of the Springsteen album it is most often compared to, \\"Nebraska.\\" I admire the attempt to venture back out into America's lost stretches with a newer, multiethnic and all-encompassing point-of-view, but this album is in dire need of a melody, and lacks even the qualified uplift of Nebraska's \\"Reason to Believe.\\" It's not enough to make me lose faith in his talents--it's just the man's first real misfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs To Be LISTENED To","review":"I am surprised by the negative reviews here. Maybe to those who only appreciate The Boss for his Born In The USA and the catchy, radio-friendliness of those songs, this album could seem a little too mellow. But for everybody that appreciates Bruce's lyrical prowess and the ability to tell an amazing, heartfelt story, this one does not disappoint. If this CD is put on as background noise while you are doing something else, then granted there is nothing that will stand out, as the songs are pretty quiet and solemn, with just Bruce's voice, guitar, and some light keyboards (mostly used for atmospheric effect). Songs such as Youngstown and Sinaloa Cowboys are so beautiful and lyrically amazing. I think everybody that owns this CD owes it to themselves to just find some time to sit down and really listen to this CD, and appreciate everything it has to offer. Heck, give up an hour of mindless TV and do your brain a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to par","review":"I hesistate to give this album less than three stars because of who this is. Springsteen is an important artist who justly demands respect, and I applaud him for doing whatever he feels like regardless of whether it's commercial. However, listening objectively, I find this album just doesn't work. An entire album's worth of barely audible guitar picking and intense muttering (and occasionally offkey singing) has tremendous potential to put you to sleep, except for the occasional Dylan-esque harmonica solo which may jar you unpleasantly awake. Springsteen already did a pared-down album before with \\"Nebraska,\\" and this odd attempt to be Woody Guthrie doesn't really hold up all that well in its general lack of melodies and overunderstatement (to coin a word.) The title song improves with listening, and the lyrics are competent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Why is \\"Nebraska\\" great and this not? Both albums have great stories. The difference is that you can sing the songs on \\"Nebraska\\", in fact that album has some great melodies. I challenge anyone to hum the tune to \\"Galveston Bay\\" of Baloba Park\\" right now. Stories are great, but they are only a part of songwriting. That's why Flannery O'Connor is known as a great short story writer and not a songwriter. Why does Springsteen not know this? \\"The New Timer\\" is simply wretched with a vocal performance that is so close to self parody that it would fit nicely on a Saturday Night Live skit.The title track and \\"Youngstown\\" are good, (the latter is actually much better as a rocker as released on \\"LIve in NYC\\") but they really only stand out because they have discernable melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom joad","review":"Very very very slow to get it.

I just finished reading \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" for the first time a few weeks back. I know, I know. How can a middle-aged, first time novelist (\\"The Legacy\\", Savage Press, 2000)just now be reading classic American works like Hemingway, Steinbeck and Faulkner? Just getting around to it, I guess. In any event, I was so captivated by the novel, and I remembered The Boss had an album titled after Tom Joad, I thought, \\"what the heck, why not give it a try?\\" Being from Duluth, Minnesota's inland port and gateway to the Iron Range, of course I heard \\"Youngstown\\" when it came out in 1995. I had forgotten just how great a tune it is. The rest of the album, including \\"Tom Joad\\" is good, not spectacular (hence the four stars and not five). Nebraska it isn't...but I think songwriters, like authors, only get one of those in a career.A solid, solid effort, not at all simply the musings of a \\"rich spoiled rock star pretending to be poor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was never really a Springsteen fan until I heard his \\"Nebraska\\" album. I was captivated by the eerie, gritty essence of the album and the blue collar storytelling. It became one of my most cherished albums.When I read that The Ghost of Tom Joad was a sort a \\"sequel\\" to Nebraska, I enthusiastically picked up a copy. Unfortunately it was a disappointment.The Ghost of Tom Joad is a highly polished, full-studio album and as a result, it fails to recapture the folky, haunted feel of the lo-fi Nebraska album. In addition, although the album has good storytelling and lyrical quality, there are few catchy melodies and little variety between songs. Halfway through the album it starts to get very monotonous. The title track is the only song that really stands out.I had high hopes for this album but ultimately found it to be mediocre and forgettable. In my opinion, it does not hold a candle to Springsteen's outstanding \\"Nebraska\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"his most diappointing album","review":"the songs all start to sound the same after 3 tracks. a very talented man who needs to find a new inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who haven't yet decided to buy it...","review":"Forget all the talk about how much this album is a suicide soundtrack and drop the ten bucks, cut away everything but the title track, turn out the lights, hide any sharp objects from yourself, and immerse yourself in the most gripping, gritty, transcendant,and perfect song Bruce has ever done. I promise it will haunt you if you give it the chance. And if you'd allow me to exaggerate perhaps a bit-call it The Great American Song as well.And the rest ain't so bad. Especially the last stanza of Youngstown, perhaps his most poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique sound?","review":"This is definately in the top three of Springsteen's best ever albums. \\"Across the Border\\" is one of his best songs and don't know why it isn't a single or put on one of his many greatest hits albums. I love the hybrid-country style which to the best of knowlege is a unique sound here. If there's another artist with likewise I would like know..The only thing I have to admit to is that I didn't like this CD on first listening and I stored it away for almost 10 years. There's also a couple of songs here that the album could probably have sounded better without, but then that's always the case with Springsteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves One Star","review":"The purpose for buying this radio is the hand crank feature. For the one I bought, after the factory charge died, the hand crankdid not recharge. In addition I tried a charger, but it also failed to do the job.

I was kept on the line for over an hour. Not only were they unfamiliar with the product, but they also refused to replace it. It was all together an awful experience.The non charging dynamo is a common problem -- beware. This is not to be trusted in an emergency, but if you do get a working product it might make an OK toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total lemon","review":"I got this specifially for an emergency kit (because it supports the Weather band). When it arrived it would not take a charge from the hand crank. Like others noted, it would light up, but no power would get saved. Thinking that maybe the battery was really fatigued from sitting in a warehouse, we tried cranking it for 10 minutes straight. This only led to the crank falling off! (yes it fell off, and no we were not being rough).Batteries would let the unit turn on. Once on, the stations did NOT come in clearly, and there was ZERO weather band reception, just terrible static.I was very surprised about all the failures in this product. Jensen is a good name, and i could understand maybe one of these things happening as a fluke, but this product was a complete piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio works only with batteries, not by the crank","review":"And if I'd wanted a battery operated radio, I'd have bought one!We cranked and cranked for about 10 min total, the charging light went on, but it only worked when we put in AA batteries. When I called Jensen with the 800 number in the manual, I got the message that all circuits were busy- this was during the day on a weekday.I am returning it, it's a dud.

Schneider weaves his terrific knowledge of San Francisco, history of music, and remarkable people in a highly imaginative way, creating intrigues and suspense and erotic tension, so that despite the beautiful lyrical sentences (which are sometimes long but alwasy artfully wrapped up, like musical phrases in Beethoven), I read the novel anxiously, delighting in every turn of the events, and every strange detail--for example, a protagonist, blessed and afflicted with the perfect pitch, can't help himself but to analyze many sounds, assigning them C sharps, etc. I will reread the novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some pretty words","review":"A promising premise, but in the end I didn't get it.The ending was just hollow for me.

I heard from your publisher daily (why I picked up the galley from the get go).I SO wanted to adore this book. A man writing from a woman's perspective & approaching a lesbian relationship with tenderness; and it WAS tender. I give him that.

I really like the well thought out, full complement of features as well. Sure there are a couple of inconveniences, but on the whole you get a lot of functional complications in a really nice looking watch. I was surprised by the weight as the physical size isn't out of the ordinary, but the density of this watch really gives it some mass. Nothing you can't adjust to rather quickly.

This watch is a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROCEED WITH CAUTION","review":"I returned this watch the day after I received it. I prefer a larger \\"clunky\\" watch (they look more masculine). This is a somewhat diminutive dainty watch. If you have big hands or arms, then this isn't the watch for you.

I contacted the merchant who told me to send the watch back at my own expense, pay a restocking fee and I could receive their offer. Not exactly a good taste in my mouth from that reply......Once the watch arrived I must admit I was disappointed in it as well. It was not as substantial as I hoped, especially for a man's watch. There was nothing wrong with it, but I did not feel that it was as nice as similarly priced watches by other manufacturers. Personal taste I guess.In the end I returned the watch and was charged a restocking fee.

Basically it's the original versions of all the songs that METALLICA cover on GARAGE INC.The first volume makes one solid collection, and though this one has some killer tunes its a disoriented mix. Songs like TUESDAYS GONE, which I love, Lynyrd Skynyrd rocks, but it doesn't fit here.The first disc is the stuff that was underground when METALLICA was coming up the ranks. Its the stuff you'd expect to hear. The stuff that mom hates and it makes your ears bleed.The second has LOVERMAN by Nick Cave and the Seeds.WHile it isn't bad, it just seems to me like a way to make more money. I'm not sure I like the whole concept of this thing anyway. I mean, its not like these bands aren't awesome on their own.

It isn't a surprise at how highly overrated this EP is...first off, you have Mike Patton (most overrated musician in the last 15 years) teaming up with an amazing band in The Dillinger Escape Plan. The EP isn't bad, 'Rock Paper Scissor' being my personal favorite, it's just not AMAZING. Really listen to it, it sounds like DEP is rehashing some material from Calculating Infinity. And as for Patton, it sounds like his vocals are a mixture of Fantomas and Tomahawk. He is busy buzzing and chirping over the music 98% of the time, so you can't digest the great music that DEP bring to the table. Simply put, he can be downright annoying. It sounds exactly like, if DEP and Patton were to collaborate. Trust me, it's nothing to woo over like a mindless maniac. I like it, it's just not great. Bring on the new DEP full-length. And I think Patton should go back to whatever band he's messing with now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Weak compared to the old stuff","review":"Dillinger Escape PLan IS one the best Hardcore bands there is. Their old albums are great but i think this one has turned for the worse. For those who were fans of their old work surely would not like much of this album because of their new singer.

Just let me say, that the music itself is mathematical, explosive and awesome as usual. BUT Mike Patton ruins this cd. I usually enjoy his work, but this a horrid match, in my mind only one man would fit with dillinger, and that is Dimitri their original vocalist. The only song I would actually recommend on this cd is \\"Come to Daddy.\\" Otherwise, save your cash and buy Calculating Infinity or any other DEP cd just not this one. and as I said above, listening to this is like watching your hero get ... in the face, you just look at it a lil different.

However, no one can deny that this combative extreme hardcore experimental band had finally met their match in patented vocal weirdo and spazz Mike Patton. Undoubtedly the groups most sought after release due to this vocalist's inclusion, Patton fans will be delighted to rediscover Patton at some of his high-strung best; calculatedly brutal without all the sinking pretensions usually seen deforming his recent work. Perfectly complimented, this uncompromising ep is a blistering tour-de-force of control and release, as distracting and chaotic as it is involving and orderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal genius...","review":"This is one of the best albums I have ever encountered. I was amazed at the sonic mind scrambling from the start, all I could do was listen in shock as I was aurally brutalized and how much I love that sensation.

Fans of Burnt By the Sun and Luddite Clone, take heed-- this one was made for you. Your folks will say things like \\"I miss when junior used to be into Metallica and Slayer. At least the music made sense.\\" This won't make sense if you just can't get it. But if you get metal, hardcore, or raw noise, you're going to want \\"Irony is a Dead Scene.\\" This is the band that took me off of lameass radio rock and into the dark yet enjoyable world of hardcore.

That musical madman, Mike Patton joined forces with The Dillinger Escape Plan to make one of the heaviest cds I have ever heard. Patton should be the permanent vocalist for this group, no doubt about it. From the first second, this cd hits you square in the chops and doesn't let up. Before you know it, you'll be singing along with these toe-tapping ditties. But beware! This'll make you wanna run amuck and trash your own home. It'll make you wanna do that Steven Seagal-arm-snapping-thingee on the guys who remade the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

But enough people insisted that the perennial critical favorite \\"Something/Anything?\\" was a force to be reckoned with in pop music. And how can you refuse a two-disc set at this price?I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does this album contain genuine power-pop masterpieces (\\"I Saw the Light,\\" \\"Hello It's Me\\"), there's also plenty of great experimental stuff to chew on as well (\\"Breathless,\\" the \\"My Roots\\" medley). Plus, Todd plays all the instruments himself (on the first three \\"sides\\" of the album, anyway). It's amazing how well he handles each instrument.This disc belongs in your collection.

You'd be hard pressed to find another album with the diversity of styles running rampant through this double album. And all this done by a 24 year old man by himself (3/4's of it anyway). No wonder Todd Rundgren hasn't been able to match the quality of this double album. You can't top perfection. Eighteen other people here find it perfect, too. And if one person finds this juvenile or overly sentimental and raucous, well then I guess I'm an overly sentimental, raucous juvenile (in his mid thirties) who always loved this music (and who'll always stay juvenile in his heart). Maybe this is the reason why this album has such staying power. Besides being great songs they will always remain forever young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it as a teenager -- I guess I've moved on","review":"\\"Marlene'.

As a reformed Christian, I have heard various reports of A.W.Pink, and was curious to \\"know\\" the man through this biography. My conclusion is that Mr. Pink was not a perfect man (who is?), but was very godly and took a courageous stand for the truths presented in the Bible when so many Christian men of his day would not. Mr. Pink was a seasoned Christian full of insight and encouragement for those wishing to grow in the knowledge and application of God's Word.

It has an extensive section on history of the pottery, includes a section on the various marks or backstamps (with photos), and covers production both in Ohio and in California.The book has a wealth of photos of the various lines made by KTK, and includes a wonderful group of images of the famous Lotus Ware, as well as info on the well-loved whiskey jugs. An especially nice feature of this book is that the pricing information is included next to the photo of a piece, which is much more convenient than having to look things up in an index in the back. However, be aware that online auctions have changed the values of some KTK pieces somewhat, so the pricing info here may be a little high.

In the beginning of my reading, the book gives me a mix feeling towards Liz Taylor, more negative than positive. But after I finished reading I really felt for her. In short, the story reveals her complicated life in the most open manner. It tells everything you want to know about Liz Taylor, from birth up to the latest marriage (and divorce). It also exposes her severe addiction to drugs and alcohol which is very shocking. What a life story! I enjoy reading the book because it flows smoothly, it is insightful and it gives detail information for every occassion in the story. It is a great book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative","review":"This book is mainly a put-down of Elizabeth Taylor, who worked tirelessly to help people with AIDs. She may have been spoiled as a child but she worked very hard in the industry. It isn't easy being a child star, transitioning into a real actress, especially when you are burdened with almost preternatural beauty. Everyone expects nothing but lovliness from a person like Elizabeth. She hated the nick-name \\"Liz\\" so I should've known from the title of this book that it would be an endless put-down. The author quotes people who said horrible things about her. I far preferred Richard Burton's biography of Elizabeth Taylor. His wasn't a paen to a godess but it was a real, honest look at their lives together. Forget this book! I quit reading it after about 80 pages.

Even more farfetched is when Matthias shows up at the World Cup final and that so inspires his player-hero that he wins the game!

The first song is somewhat uninteresting but gets you into the mood of the CD. Overall there was a good amount of vocals and I could really feel some nice highs and lows. I found the second half of the disk to be very uplifting and had a really nice rhythm, particularily from track 11 onwards. The end of the CD left me feeling very satisfied.The mixing on this is seamless, and if I play this in my car instead of on my computer, I can't tell when one track ends and the next begins.

A brilliant recipe for success and a substantial income.This album is your standard set from Tiesto. Trance and multiple tracks featuring female vocals. Appealing to the masses (and there is nothing wrong with that) but not appealing for my electronica tastes. I just had to check out a few of his earlier albums after being completely taken aback and impressed by disc 2 of his In Search of Sunrise 5. I wish he would mix up more sets like that.

Yesterday I decided to pick \\"In Search of Sunrise v3\\" and I cannot stand it. The music is so lifeless and lacks so much energy. Yes, trance is meant to be soothing but not enough to make listening experience bland and boring. And that's exactly what this album is.After hearing Andain's \\"Beautiful Things\\" on Nyana, I was sure I'd at least like the album for \\"Summer's Calling\\". Wrong. Slow and uneventful like the album itself. The only song I really enjoyed was the \\"Southern Sun\\" remix by Tiesto himself but I had even heard that before so it was nothing new.Extremely disappointed in this CD and Tiesto.

And I'm also a big fan of both the \\"Dummies\\" books and the \\"Complete Idiot's Guides\\"...I found this author's take on the City of Lights to be thorough and insightful as well as downright pleasing to read. I've talked to a lot of people who are heading to Paris. My sense is that they're almost all going there with things in mind that they want to see and do... but also with an (irrational) fear of not being able to do it because of the \\"language barrier\\" (which is pretty much non-existent these days).This book is a perfect, gentle guide for those who are about to hit Paris as \\"Innocents Abroad.\\"I definitely got the feeling that the author who put this book together was as excited and passionate about Paris as I was the first time and as I am every time I get to go back.Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful guide with just one flaw","review":"Full disclosure: I own the 2nd edition of this guidebook, so maybe the omission I found has been corrected.For the daytrip to Versailles, the author lists two methods of transporation: driving a car or taking a tour bus. However, the easiest, quickest, and cheapest way is to take the RER. It deposits you about 200 yards from the palace. I was shocked that this info wasn't included as every other guidebook mentions it.

We installed it December 30 and so far it works very good. We installed it with a Pioneer Stereo 3200BT. Only thing I wished they would supply better instructions with the unit as to the options of wiring but with a little patience and finding the install instructions for the 3200BT the job is complete.The red power wire gets constent power and there is a purple wire out the back of the 3200BT stereo unit that gets connected to the reverse lights power. Now it works in reverse as well as being able to view the trailer as we travel down the road. This unit not only assists you to park, it works great for hooking up to the trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible picture resolution","review":"Has to be one of the worst cameras out there.

You people have heaped so much praise on this turkey that I was expecting something special. Suck - come on, this aint even got the energy to suck. If I was to make out to this disk Id be asleep inside 4 minutes. Its obvoius that these guys can play and could do much much better. Perhaps one star is a bit harsh but I was expecting so much more.Every Sade disk has got at least one, sometimes two killer mid tempo funky grooves. It was this kind of *** that I was expecting on this disk. However, this disk is another triumph of style over substance. What you get is some halfway reasonable vocal tracks together with crappy instrumentals complete with 1 finger piano solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetback","review":"I love this album from beginning to end. I remember seeing the video to \\"you will rise\\" on BET Video Soul in 1995 or 1996 and I was just attracted to the song.

My favorite songs are \\"gaze\\", \\"softly, softly\\", \\"hope she'll be happier\\", \\"you will rise\\", and \\"sensations\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly refreshing spin on R&B and Trance music","review":"From the baddest back-up group an R&B singer's ever had since Prince (pre-1991), Sweetback bring us more groove, more chill-out finesse, more pure soothing soul music than any other record that came out that year.

There's an interesting lady-rap number called \\"Au Natural\\" that takes aim at the sexism often found in the male counterpart, but Bahamadia foregoes the temptation to be just as badass as the dudes. Most of the rest of this disc is instrumental, running the gamut from numbers that would make good Sade songs to semi-ambient to the techno/ eastern fusion of \\"Arabesque\\" to a crossover funk/ jazz that Marcus Miller would approve of. Hey, they had to do something until last year, and I hope The Lady cuts them enough slack to do more of the same as a change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade's Band!","review":"Need I say more. Stu Matthewman, Andrew Hale and Paul Denman are a trio to be reckoned with. Take a look at the guest artists- Maxwell, Amel Larrieux, Bahamadia & also Leroy Osbourne(Sade). This is Urban Alternative at it's best. This CD takes you through an emotional joyride that you will want to take over and over again.

He's just another Tupac sound a like. Which isn't so good. Even though he do got some nice tacks on this CD, It still not that good of an album. But if you a southern Rap fan, than this a CD that you would get. Other than that, It would be a toss up. The Production is bad, not horrible bad, but bad. If the production was better I'd give it a four, but a two what I gave it. I took one star off for production, one stars off for sounding like Tupac. And one more star just because I just don't like it too muchOVERALL Evaluation: Get it?

I'm sorry I had to spend so much to figure that out. It is so understuffed, it is like sleeping on a sheet.

I won't buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Ticking","review":"I got these about a year ago for a gift. They were quite firm but I figured they would break-in after using them for a while. I put them in pillow protectors before using them. After the first week they had down coming out all over. Little dusty bits and full pcs of down. The more they are used the more dust/down. They are a pain to deal with. I was very unhappy with them. I really wanted a good set of down pillow and this just isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute...with a few problems","review":"I was excited to get this for my daughter, but found that putting it together was a bit difficult. Some of the pieces were warped, but I did finally get it together. The only problem is that the stool was missing the cone shaped piece for stability. The vanity does seem a little wobbly too. I am a little disappointed, but hopefully my daughter will like it!I did email the company (CDI Toys) about the problems but have yet to hear back.My last complaint about this vanity was that the mirror is IMPOSSIBLE to get out once you put it in.

It worked perfectly all Christmas Day,my daughter loved it and played with it for about three to four hours, then that was it. Cinderella stopped appearing, the voice recording started running extremely fast, it gives the wrong or no responses when you chose something off the vanity. I promptly took it apart and returned it. Of course they didn't have any in stock, so I got my money back and hopefully my daughter will think Santa forgot to return it since he had to take it back to get \\"fixed\\".

The light flashed, Cinderella appeared, but NO sound. We took apart the mirror and reattached it, and never got Cinderella to appear again OR any sound. My best friend bought one for her daughter and had problems getting Cinderella to appear as well. We went to three different stores (first two were sold out) the day after Christmas to get a replacement (thank you K-mart). FINALLY we found one that worked.

When we put the toy together Christmas Eve (as it was a gift from Santa) it had an incessant beep and Cinderella kept flashing in the mirror, making the toy unusable with the key in and powered on.We returned it to ToysRUs today for a full refund and are looking for a replacement.

It couldn't be a bigger hit! I was concerned after reading other reviews on this site, but have been plesantly surprised. At first, Cinderella did not appear in the mirror and the lights didn't work. My husband pushed the mirror in tighter and now it works great! The accessories are durable and she loves to 'get ready' with Cinderella."},{"rating":"1","title":"The novelty wears off quickly","review":"This was the one thing that my daughter really wanted from Santa for Christmas. Months later, it sits in the corner of her room and is used once or twice a month. It's not very stimulating and after a few minutes of play, she loses interest. It also tips very easily so we've had to prop it against a wall to keep it from falling over. The volume is also very loud but that's no longer an issue since I taped over the speaker. Cinderella appearing in the mirror is a nice touch, however, an adult needs to position and push the key in forcefully for her to appear. Quite difficult for a child to do. I wish I had saved my money on this one and purchased a nice wooden vanity instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"please make sure the key is in and vanity is pushed in!","review":"I thought toy was a lemon we tried new batteries and still the vanity did not light up but after reading a review I went back into her room and pushed the key in it moved just a tad and also pushed down on vanity and the light lit up on vanity and started working and hadent worked since christmas but works great now time the time to review you will be happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!

Curse you Cinderella!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good......","review":"Received this toy for XMAS and did not work out of the box. The lights and sound do not operate. We'll see if the replacement is any better. I would suggest avoiding this product, as it appears the manufacturer does not have good quality control.

Also important to mention is that the design and quality of the materials for this toy is fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"we did not like it","review":"This was a cute concept and my daughter was very excited when she got it. Then we opened the box up! The some assembly required was a nighmare. The stool is too small for her to sit on and she weighs 35 pounds! The make up falls out of the holes and the whole thing is not easy to organize for a 4 year old. The clear plastic drawer on top broke after 5 minutes of GENTLE play. The concept was cute but the quality just isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"To begin, we received the product [from etoys.com] damaged! Though assembly was easy and the toy was appealing to my children, it lacked a certain quality I have come to expect from Disney. The decals were darker than the table top, which looks cheap.

I will try to contact the vendor, though.Please see my pictures on the product description page. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"also had problems","review":"We also had problems getting our vanity to work. I read the reviews and reattached the mirror, but still nothing.

I cannot believe they get $75 for this - the first one we bought we got all put together and put the batteries in and of course it didn't work.

We bought one, put the whole thing together, only to find the mirror did not light up. Rather than take the whole thing apart to return, we bought another one, took the mirror out of the second and swapped it with the first, put the mirror that wouldn't work back into the replacement box, and returned it, avoiding a lot of work.

There is a connection between the mirror and table top and one between the mirror and the key that need to stay tight...but they just don't. It does not appear that this toy is really designed for kids to play with. It looks pretty and the concept is neat...but we really haven't been able to see it in action at all.

Push the mirror down as far as it will go.4. Flip the top over so you're looking at the underside of the top and you will see 2 screws holding a cover over the bottom of the electronic port. (You will also probably see the gap that is keeping you from getting a connection)5. Push down on the cap over the port and you will hear a loud snap (I thought I had really broken it!)6.

It worked but as I'm an taking everything out the second box I notice that the hand held mirror for vanity is broken and that the main stick (the Cinderella image) is not in the box as well.

You only need one pair of them to share around the table per 3 people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me crabby","review":"I bought this for my crab-lovin' hubby and was really disappointed.

The extras are amazing, taken from the numbers in the shows and you can play them like a music DVD. When you find a Glee person, they each have their favorite episodes and characters. I loved the Madonna episode and the Lady Gaga songs were great. The show ending at regionals was masterful, you never know why they didn't win.The first year had some very interesting stories and character development. I am looking forward to year 2 and I hope they keep up the good work.I figured out that the reason I like the show so much is that the stories are funny, sad, silly and tuneful and I recognize all the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!

We have been in music and singing in groups since high school. We especially enjoy episodes that feature a remix of classic rock, our \\"old music!\\" Even though we are from a different generation music has been our lives. We also enjoy the story line. My husband is a high school teacher and I am recently retired. Even though the storyline may be a little tongue in cheek sometimes the issues are very real and the feelings portrayed are very real. The episodes on Kurt's bullying were particularly well done (and sad) Some of these reviews complain of the music getting more attention than the plot. In our opinion the focus is perfect balance. Music brings people together and provides relief from real life challenges, sorrows and hopelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vol. 2 is available.","review":"To those complaining that they will have to buy this version in order to complete their collection, you are MISTAKEN.

When I see Ben Stiller sell himself short in such a cliched, self-hating-jew stereotype, it makes me cringe, but that's not the real reason I disliked the movie (and the entire genre it represents so well).When someone in an awkward situation lies to try to make it better, then lies to cover up the lie, then continues in greater and greater contortions to try to preserve their illusion of social conformity, it's presented as funny. But to me, it isn't. It's a tragedy, and it's a tragedy reflected in our daily lives as a society.This movie reminds me of everything I dislike about shallow social convention, and about people who subscribe to it and who desperately crave the approval of others. No laugh track, no acrobatically awkward pratfall, could make me find that funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet the Boredom","review":"Again, I find myself at odds with society.Millions of people are enraptured with MEET THE PARENTS if for no other reason than Ben Stiller's surname being 'Focher' (you can just imagine the pronunciation jokes).Then, it's the THREE STOOGES meets FATHER OF THE BRIDE with some hilarious antics that predictably end up with the father and son-in-law sorting out their differences in a formulaic conclusion.The fabulous Ben Stiller and the legendary Robert De Niro are wasted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"De Niro washed up","review":"A sad end for the actor who brought us so many fine performances, in serious and comedy roles (Midnight Run). Obviously it's not the bitter end, but I'd be surprised to see anything terribly good come along now.

American Pie and Theres soming about Mary was alot funnier....rent this one first"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and so predictable","review":"Have to disagree with those who have raved about robert de niro or given the movie a better rating because he's in it. His performance is wooden, his character detestable, which he does all too well; he's not an actor, he just plays himself, and he certainly can't rescue this dud. When you watch the outtakes (which are so boring) and then watch the movie again, you can see under the surface that they are just trying to contain their laughter. This painful 2 hours doesn't even come close to 'something about mary', despite ben stiller's efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"This movie is funny, romantic and very suspenseful, but...something is missing. I think what's missing is a different performance by Stiller. In this movie you are able to see Stiller's stereotype performance. Anyway, the best performance for me is De Niro's. He is one of my favorite actors of all time. I can't wait in watching \\"Meet The Fockers\\" !!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and only occasionally funny","review":"I was very dissapointed with this movie. I found that Ben Stiller was very annoying as well as all of the other characters. Most of the time we sat there with a flat face and just kept looking at each other wondering how this movie got recommended to us. I enjoyed Deuce Bigalow and other 'dumb' movies. This movie was simply not funny and actually irritating most of the time. I'm Selling my copy to EBAY that's how much I don't like this movie as it has no rewatchability. I am very easy to please and RARELY sell any of my DVDs on EBAY because I like to collect DVD's, but this movie has no merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit from De Niro & Stiller","review":"This is a big one from both De Niro and Stiller! De Niro, especially, knows how to blend well in a comedy: he's been parodied numerous times, but to see him in an actual comedy works even better. The rest of the cast makes it all the more engrossing. This will certainly bring big laughs and even bigger hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the Parents","review":"The movie 'Meet the Parents' is a humorous film. It is about a guy named Greg who is a nurse. How weird is that?! Well anyway he meets this girl named Pam Burns. They fall in love and all of that good stuff. But, Pam's dad is a bit suspicious and litterally sniffs out lies. He has this thing called the circle of trust. Greg is given a chance and is in it for.........a little while.But Jack isn't too fond of his daughter's dates or boyfriends. Well anyway in the movie Pam's cat jinksy gets lost and its up to Greg to find him. Greg really didnt have any luck finding him. But, I think you should watch the movie and find out what happens. You'll love it. This movie is rated PG-13 and is about 2 hours long.I would reccomend this movie to anyone who likes crude humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Hilarious!","review":"This is definitley the funniest film of the year 2000. From beginning to end, this flick will make you laugh to your heart's desire. My cousin calls Ben Stiller a \\"poor man's Jim Carrey\\" with his comedic performance in movies like \\"There's Something about Mary\\" and of course \\"Meet the Parents\\".I'm surprised no one thought of this storyline before. Trust me folks, this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is funny then i'm dead","review":"Because seeing a nice guy just get abused by a bunch of snobby, pretentious, holier than thou schmucks just ain't my cup of tea. All I could feel was sympathy for Stiller's character. Although I have to admit I laughed at the volleyball scene. So sue me."},{"rating":"1","title":"De Niro's Worst Movie","review":"Another Dream Work's dog... Meet the Parents is forced, boring, and just plain not funny.As a big fan of De Niro, I expected a certain level of entertainment, but this movie was rancid. The script was boring, background music grinding, and acting horrid. Could they have made the audience suffer more? Luckily it was only 100 minutes.An actor of De Niro's capability really should not associate his name with such projects...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's your call","review":"Before you rent or buy Meet The Parents, it helps to know whether this movie's type of humor is to your taste. Here's a clue: the lead character's name is Greg Focker.Greg ... Focker. Many people think that's absolutely hysterical. Do you? then this is probably your kind of flick. Otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is depressing, and the vague attempts at comedy are predictable and stupid. There is positively no attempt at witty conversation at all! If you would like to see a good Robert DeNiro comedy flick, try MIDNIGHT RUN. Meet the Parents is DEFINITELY a miss! The cat, the story, everything lacks originality and thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whole Family Loved It!","review":"If you are going into this movie expecting a serious film with major plot structure, you will probably be very disappointed. This is a \\"sit back, relax and just enjoy the simple humor of life\\" film. The plot is simple. Guy goes to meet the parents of the girl that he wants to marry and everything that can goes wrong does go wrong.The characters were easy to relate to (honestly, how many of us have been terrified to meet the \\"future-in-laws\\") and the over-the-top nature of the events in the movie only added to the hilarity of the comedy. Stiller and De Niro work well together. I was laughing out loud throughout this movie and it has become one of my current favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another \\"ho hum\\" comedy","review":"Yeah, sure I laughed. So what? There's nothing particularly new or clever about this movie. Both Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro have had better roles in better movies. Plus, I found it excruciatingly painful to sit there and watch Ben Stiller do stupid and embarrassing things again and again and AGAIN.If you're in the mood for a movie you don't have to think about, and you like watching people humiliate themselves then by all means see it. But only a mindless idiot could give this film five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for two scenes that where funny.","review":"That's right, there are only two scenes in this whole long boring movie that where funny. My wife and I wanted to rent a comedy and heard that Meet the Parents was a great comedy. I guess people will laugh at anything really stupid, which this movie is; very stupid and not very funny. The best scene, by far, is when Ben Stiller is on the roof trying to get the cat and what happens after that. That's it. Typical Hollywood ending too. Very disappointed. After this movie my wife and I watched Charlie's angels which (I can't believe I'm saying this) was a much funnier and more enjoyable movie. Meet the parents also dragged a lot. A lot of the scenes could have been shorter and funnier. I just don't understand what people are laughing about when they watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder this movie bombed in the theaters!!","review":"Don't get fooled by the snappy trailer ... this is one unfunny film. You're going to get suckered by the Stiller / De Niro billing, but you're in for a major disappointment. Like the characters in the film, MTP is stiff, dry, even painful to watch.I still can't get over how the trailer set up my expectations. Shame on the Hollywood marketing machine for duping the general public. This movie bombed in the theaters, and deservedly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming quality...","review":"When I saw this movie the first time, I saw no humor. However, I was subjected to this film four more times that week, due to some unusual circumstances, and it was only then did I truly come to despise it.The story is Ben Stiller meets girl. They fall in love, and then Stiller has to meet her parents. The humor is reliant on the fact that people find it humorous that the hopeful husband-to-be always gets everything wrong. However, it's just not funny. DeNiro, although playing an interesting new character as father of the bride, does not add to this, already mess of a film.Stiller can be funny, but bathroom humor and slapstick can only go so far. If that's you're thing, then you'll like it, otherwise just stay away.(The only good thing is that the sequel is ok, but that's a different review.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny First Half, Then Runs Out of Steam","review":"I really liked the first half of this movie. Stiller and De Niro are very funny. My favorite scene: the dinner where De Niro reads the poem about his mother that ends with the cat using her ashes for a litter box! My favorite line: \\"I have nipples, Greg, would you like to milk me?\\"But about two-thirds of the way through, the movie felt like it was just Piling It On the Stiller character. When Stiller actively deceives his future in-laws about losing their cat, I lost a lot of sympathy for him and really didn't care how it turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The parents are not worth meeting","review":"It was supposed to be so funny. An hour into it, I was still waiting to laugh. The plot was predictable. The characters were made of the cheapest cardboard. I wound up thinking, \\"none of these people are worth what Stiller's character is going through.\\" Least of all, the complete whelp of a fiancee who was dishonest, weak-willed and insensitive. The funny moments can all be viewed in the trailer. Beyond that, it's just difficult to watch.I really like Ben Stiller and I love Blythe Danner. But DeNiro should be totally ashamed. Totally ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible, horrible waste","review":"So, what happens when you take one of the best comic actors of his generation, and put him up against one of the most acclaimed dramatic actors of any generation?Well, when you've got a script as predictable as Meet The Parents', you get dissapointed.The film takes the greatest fear of any movie character (meeting a prospective spouse's parents) and works it by numbers. The few surprises (DeNiro's occupation, for one) are mostly under used. While there's a few really good & surprising gags, the majority of the film is wasted with predictable jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid az heck","review":"Whaz up with this stupid movuie? why is it so dumb? bad acting by robby. i can't beleiev it. how could hez maek a bad moviee? ben stiler is not a funny guy at all. iz dont likke his styukle is comedy. nothing good ibcould thinnk about thiz movie. and jay roach is one of the wortstd ircyteo today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't like to be painted with that brush...","review":"This is one of the few comedies that just gets more laughs every time I watch it. The characters are so perfectly and subtly portrayed that there's always something new to enjoy. Owen Wilson really steals the show here as the ultimate ex-boyfriend! DeNiro's performance is a nice surprise as well! The DVD has a nice outtakes reel and some nice other special features. Look forward to \\"Meet the Fockers\\" in 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on De Niro?","review":"Why you waste the comic brilliance of Robert De Niro on such a ludicrous and unfunny comedy is beyond me. People will watch him in MEET THE PARENTS and laugh at his humor, but when it comes to seeing his good performances in GOODFELLAS and TAXI DRIVER they act like those films are no good. ANALYZE THIS is much funnier and more inventive...so watch it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I didn't laugh once. There isn't a sympathetic character in the film, with the possible exception of Blythe Danner's. The actors deserved a better script, a better director, or agent's who knew when to say \\"no\\". Don't bother renting it, buying it, or wasting your time seeing someone else's copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidity meets Dumb and Dumber","review":"I like DeNiro very much, but not in this movie. The flick is so dumb that I couldn't watch it to the end. I don't think it's funny when someone steps into every imaginable an unimaginable trap on the way to get the father's yes. It was too much - rather too little - for me to handle that movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE Disappointment","review":"I liked Something About Mary, it had a good blend of comedy and character interaction that really made it work. This movie is not Something About Mary. Ben stiller is funny, and holds the few actually comedic moments of the movie together, but other than his performance, little of the film is comedic.DeNiro plays his role in his usual strict and stern manner, with intensity that is lost on the plot. The comedic elements that are stung along between him and Stiller have their moments, but all in all have been done a thousand times in a thousand other movies and have lost their charm.This movie is for you if you like formulaic comedy, cannot get enough of childish sex and potty jokes and enjoy watching a man struggle against an impossible in-law. Perhaps I hav egrown too old to be amused by the same ... jokes that are everywhere in today's comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"mactheknife","review":"Alot of hype, not a great movie. The comedic aspects were so-so. De Niro is great but Stiller is painful as an out-of-step soon to be son-in-law. I'm not sure where all the hub-bub about this movie comes from. Way over-rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"we are not amused","review":"I had heard several people say this DVD had them rolling with laughter so I was expecting alot. I was mildy amused...intermittently. The plot was rather predictable with lots of slapstick humor. There was nothing new or fresh about the story or the presentation. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it unless you're an under-25 male!","review":"Stupid! Unfunny! Lots of toilet humor! Ben Stiller's character is such a totally pathetic loser that it is COMPLETELY ridiculous and implausible that a gorgeous woman like Teri Polo would be interested in him -- not to mention continue to love him after he's made an utter fool of himself for an entire weekend and torpedoed her sister's wedding! Not as horrible as \\"Something About Mary\\" -- which we turned off after the famous \\"hair gel\\" scene -- but strictly for brainless adolescent males."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Movie that Deserves a Warning Label on the Box!","review":"\\"Meet the Parents\\" tells the story of Greg (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who wants to marry Pam, the girl of his dreams. But in order to do that he must meet her parents. Robert De Niro plays Pam's father, Jack, who is not in all impressed with Greg. Jack is a case in himself from potty-training his cat to having a \\"Nannycam\\" to watch over the house. And as if by magic, Greg and Pam arrive the same weekend that the family is making plans for the wedding of Pam's sister, Debbie. The weekend gets off to a bad start with some unfortunate accidents, snooping, and Pam's ex-fiance being Debbie's best man. One incident after another is all Greg needs when he knows that this visit will determine the rest of his life. How will this tragic weekend end? See for yourself and pick up a copy of \\"Meet the Parents\\" today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ for a comedic interpretation of a classic situation!","review":"This movie dealt with a very common situation a lot of people face - bringing the love of your life home to \\"meet the parents..\\" the anxiety and unease created from such a situation was creatively humorized by the distinctive talents of such characters portrayed by ben stiller and robert deniro, to name a few.. greg falker's fear was so palpable that instantly i felt the deepest remorse for him while at the same time couldn't stop laughing.. albeit, some of the scenes were a bit far fetched, they were still presented with raw comedic talent to carry the movie along and add to it.. this movie is for those who love ben stiller and enjoy laughing..!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so funny as I thought...","review":"Ben Stiller plays a lovesick male nurse who wants to ask his love (Teri Polo)'s father (Robert De Niro)'s permission to marry her. Silly hijinks ensue, but not as funny as I thought as it was in the preview. Some cute moments, but doesn't produce genuine laughs, or at least chuckles, which the show \\"Friends\\" almost always does. But \\"Meet The Parents\\" just wasn't funny enough, but it's worth a look at, and it garnered an Oscar nomination for best song, Randy Newman's \\"A Fool In Love,\\" so if a movie has garnered an Oscar Nomination for best song or whatever minor (such as best costuming, etc.), best if you stay away (I only watched it on VHS three times). You may ending up hating it as well as wasting your money buying it. Hopefully the sequel will live up more than its predessor. Rated PG-13 for language and some very mild ... content (as well as seeing Ben Stiller in a skimpy Speedo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern comedy classic","review":"A second DVD release (\\"Bonus Edition\\") came out at the end of 2004 to coincide with the theatrical release of the sequel, Meet the Fockers. The only additional material is more outtakes and some short featurettes. The original DVD had plenty of extras, including outtakes, deleted scenes, two commentaries, and more, so don't fall for the double dip. The difference in price is only three bucks, so if you don't own it already, it won't kill you to spring for the \\"bonus\\" one. But if you already own the \\"Collector's Edition\\" from 2001, there's no point in upgrading."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious, possibly the funniest movie of all time!","review":"The first time I saw this at the theatre...

Ben Stiller is a comical genius and Robert Deniro plays a great out-of-style role (normally acting in more serious movies), yet their chemistry was great.The movie has Ben Stiller, who would like to propose to his girlfriend, meeting her parents...and that's where the fun begins! I recommend this movie to everyone, it's one of the better comedies i've seen in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"This movie really made me laugh. I am usually hard to please when it comes to comedies and find alot of movie humor just silly rather than funny. I was surprised to find myself laughing outloud til tears came to my eyes at some points in this movie. The whole dinner with her parents that first night just kept getting funnier as things went from bad to worse. I don't think you need to be a Ben Stiller fan to find this funny. This was the first movie with Ben Stiller I had seen. By all means rent it before you decide to buy, tastes are subjective, but this movie is at least worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meeting the Gentiles","review":"A better name for this movie is \\"Meeting the Gentiles.\\" I am extremely tired of seeing Jewish men portrayed as insecure, ineffectual nervous people. I have never met a Jewish man like Woody Allen or this wannabe Woody in \\"Meeting the Parents.\\" Cinema needs to retire this tiresome persona. It's never been more than barely tolerable. And in this movie, it is just plain creepy. This pathetic... guy is so condescending to his Gentile girlfriend that you pray throughout the movie that they won't stay together; that a light will finally go off in her head and she'll realize the guy is treating her like dirt because she was raised in a clean suburb and not in cesspool like New York or Detroit. It's an awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"There's Something About Mary\\" without Mary and jokes.","review":"Let's see: good actors, nice genre, interesting plot and no fun at all.

It might have worked better if Ben Stiller had been a dumb teenager instead of a professional nurse. As it is, he is a professional nurse, and with all of that education, he can't explain his side of a string of horribly contrived disasters. It is one of those films where no one can explain the obvious because the script won't let them. It is a fine premise: boy meets girl's parents, it was just a rotten script. Jay Roach said this was the funniest of 50 scripts he had been reading... if this was the funniest, I would have hated to see the other 49.

Run away dogs, accidental fires, uncomfortable silences. Hardly the makings for a \\"movie of the year\\". If you are a die hard Ben Stiller fan then by all means rent this movie.

I didn't interest me then, but I thought why not. Boy was I wrong to even spend the money to rent this movie. I like Jay Roach; the stuff he's done with Austin Powers is great, but this is just plain horrible. The movie drags on and on and once you thing this young man is in the clear, here comes some more stuff to mess with him. It just gets tiring. And I'm sorry but DeNiro should stick to dramatic roles. He's not funny; in this or Analyze This. Ben Stiller has talent and it was sad to see him wasted in this predictable movie. Boy I can't wait for the second one, and yes they are making one. Thanks Hollywood for taking this bad idea and running it into the ground.

DeNiro is incredibly good as a no nonsense father who becomes increaslingly suspicious of his daughters boy friend played by Ben Stiller. The dialogue between DeNiro and Stiller is unbelievably funny as Stiller's character digs himself in deeper and deeper. Both of these actors are in top form here.The scene where Greg Folker (Stiller) is at the airport counter dealing with robot-like airline employees had me in stitches.Owen Wilson is very well cast and does a great job as Folker's girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.The supporting actors are all good and the screenplay is well written and delivered.Overall this is a movie worth owning because it stands up to multiple viewings and continues to provide laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty funny","review":"Ben Stiller plays Gaylord \\"Greg\\" Focker, a male nurse whose deperate need to make a good impression on his fiancee's parents causes him to spend a nightmarish weekend with his future in-laws. He is continually humiliated and belittled, most notably by his bride-to-be's father, a former CIA man played by Robert DeNiro. The results are uneven but generally enjoyable, with a few good laugh-out-loud moments. The fiancee (Teri Polo) frequently comes across as such an insensitive, disloyal person that it is difficult to understand why Greg loves her so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest of all time!!!","review":"I thought the part when Gaylord got Debbie in the face was hilarious.

I found it contrived - lacking cleverness, wit or subtlety. I found myself getting more and more annoyed and frustrated as the story unfolded. There were a few humorous scenes, but not enough to save it for me. The last scene was a culmination of the tacky and awkward humor throughout the film, as he was letting out his frustrations into the hidden camera. I love physical or silly comedy, as long as somehow we are given the idea that there is intelligence behind it. I was relieved to read the other less than positive reviews, because I felt alone in not being impressed by this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film is NOT VERY FUNNY. Another Disappointing Comedy.","review":"I really wanted to laugh, but found myself with a grimmace for most of the movie. The characters were way to contrived and the jokes and humor were forced. I actually found myself annoyed most of the time by the characters. Ecept for just a rare 2 or 3 funny clips, this film was actually annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh..","review":"This one just doesn't come out right... you'd expect Ben Stiller and Robert Deniro to work well together, and this movie bombs by no fault of the cast, who perform admirably. Its just that, we've seen all these sight gags before, and anything original here just doesn't hit the mark enough to be really funny. Stiller's would-be family are such snooty, annoying people that frankly, you'd rather see him just drop everything and forget about marrying this girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny for the easily amused","review":"Meet the Parents is about a male nurse (Ben Stiller) who spends a weekend with his girlfriend at her parent's house. Stiller finds out immediately that his girlfriend's father (DeNiro) is quite the character. Stiller's character tries his best to impress his potential father in law but of course the harder he tries the worse things become. The film does have some funny moments especially the subtle jokes but the more obvious jokes are not so funny, just dumb and predictable. Meet the Parents is just another movie in the continuing downward spiral of DeNiro's career. When did Robert DeNiro become so lame?? If you are easily amused you will love Meet the Parents if you are not it would just remind you of old Three's Company re-runs. If you are a fan of Robert DeNiro and you want to see a comedy rent Midnight Run....that was made when DeNiro was cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something *NOT* about the Parents","review":"I saw this one and figured \\"Hey, Ben Stiller is funny, and it has De Niro in it, so how bad could it be?\\"The answer: Pretty bad. My wife and I both felt like this movie was a waste of the time we took to watch it.This movie tried to hit the same vein of humor as Something About Mary, but missed at almost every occasion. Nothing in this movie seemed to click. De Niro's character came across as both poorly written and poorly acted.We almost turned this movie off 5 or 6 different times, but finally ended up watching the whole thing just to see how it ended. So I guess I can say that it does it least have that going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMM...DID WE ALL WATCH THE SAME MOVIE?","review":"I'll be blunt: this movie is definitely NOT as funny as many people would like you to think it is. Oh, it has its moments here and there during which you'll chuckle and giggle. A couple of lines will even have you laugh out loud. Just don't expect the riotous laughfest that's been promised by reviews on this site or by the television commercials themselves.The DVD includes a couple of deleted scenes, one of which (\\"Surf & Tur*\\") should definitely have been left in the film because it's actually funny. The outtakes should have been omitted altogether because, frankly, they're boring.This is not the worst film you could ever watch, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. This is a definitely NOT a purchase. Maybe worth a rental if there's nothing else available, otherwise skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"After so much hype, and the movie teasers, I was expecting this to be a pretty funny movie.Unfortunately, after nearly 30 minutes into the movie, I had uttered scarcely a chuckle. De Niro, of course, does his usual good job. Ben Stiller adequately plays pretty much the same \\"Something About Mary\\" character.I thought there were less laughs than \\"About Mary\\", with the two major comedic scences space apart by agonizingly long periods of irritating nervousness between Ben Stiller's character and \\"the dad\\".At least \\"About Mary\\" had the funniest part up front. \\"Meet the Parents\\" makes you wait nearly 30 minutes before the first good one.In fact, if you've seen the full trailer, you've seen all the funny parts. If you are a fan, its worth the rent, but not the buy. My copy is up for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like to be able to give this no stars!","review":"Don't waste your time on this movie.

Poor Mr. Focker's constant streak of problems really had me rolling on the floor. I loved this screwball element, the neverending onslaught of difficulty and misunderstanding. But all of the sexual and homosexual double entendres really distracted me from the humor, because I don't find such shallow jokes and things funny at all.I would like to watch Meet the Parents again for the intriguing plot, but I would find it difficult because all of the less than funny things really take away from the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite movies of all time","review":"There are not enough words to express how BAD this movie is. It actually made me squirm while watching it. If you liked Something About Mary--which was also painful to watch--although it had a funny moment or two (CPR on the dog was a hightlight)--you may like this one too--but it is even worse. If you'd like to see Ben Stiller in a movie that is actually funny and has some heart, check out KEEPING THE FAITH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is supidity funny?","review":"I know the majority of the people found this movie funny, but I found it very stupid. And I really like good comedies, but this one is not. It is just a sum of stupid gags. To enjoy this you really need to leave your brain at the entrance of the theatre. The only good thing about the movie were one or two gags, and the always funny Ben stiller, whose talent for comedy is unquestionable. De Niro has the same stupid mafia face throughout the movie, I think he should return to serious movies -he was funny in \\"Analize This\\" though. If you want to see good movies with Ben Stiller I would recommend the very different \\"Something About Mary\\", where he really gets to display his squills, or the romantic comedy Keeping The Faith, seen by not too many people but a nice, warm-hearted comedy directed by first-timer Eduard Norton, who is also a lead character in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Maybe my expectations for this movie were too high. I had heard that this was a hilarious movie filled with funny moments. What I saw a an almost unwatchable movie that is anything but funny.If you are reading this review then most likely you've seen the others and have a general sense of the plotline. I won't bore you with banal details. This is Ben Stiller trying to cash in on the same vein as There's Something About Mary (I really didn't think this was funny either). It is predictible slapstick which fails miserably to be funny. Too many stupid things occur in this film and it just becomes annoying.It is also sad to see De Niro in this role. You think of Goodfellas, Casino, and Taxi Driver and then this. He should know that after almost thirty years in film that comedies are not his strong-suit. I felt bad seeing him in this film.Owen Wilson is the only bright spot.

Greg wants to make the best impression possible, as he desperately wants to marry Pam. Time after time, Greg tries to get on Pam's father's good side, only to have each scheme blow up in his face--not to mention almost ruining a family wedding and destroying the house!Ben Stiller again plays a loveable guy next door.

Ben Stiller brought his unique brand of comic timing to bear against his suitably dour, unimpressed, ex-CIA dad-to-be, Robert DeNiro. Frequently bitingly humourous, there are some good belly laughs to be had as well. DeNiro's under the breath condemnation of Greg's purported drug problems are great. The master-of everything ex-beau, the volleyball match, the septic tank, the race home, the cat incident all combine for a high-brow/low-brow joke coupling that works.

The story had good ideas, but, timing and direction killed them. There was too much time watching and waiting for things to happen. Apparently, the director was assuming that the audience had little or no imagination. I laughed at a few things, but, I felt this movie was a waste of my time, money, and gas to pick it up at the video store. I was constantly feeling uncomfortable for Ben Stiller, yet, thinking how stupid he was for his lies. I did like how he ruined the wedding plans for De Niro's other daughter, but, that was a long drawn out breath. If the young people today consider this funny, they need to gain a little more depth to them. This movie appears to be a rough draft instead of a finished product.

How can anyone find this formulaic, predictable, overly praised, boring, no brainer excuse for a comedy, entertaining? The dialogue was just inane, and over-simplified, at least I had thought it to be simple, but for others, which greatly disturbs me about the current state of the American psyche, it was 'genius'? Don't make me vomit. It was like Steve Martin's 'Father Of The Bride' only worse.The only joke that was funny was the 'focker' thing, and that got old after the second time someone said it.

Even the tracks notated as \\"score\\" are misrepresented, as they are odd little snippets that don't even include the film's truly haunting and beautiful main theme. I was so disappointed to realize the CD did not include any of the real score at all. Still, a worthy purchase for some gorgeous and evocative classic songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still got bumps!","review":"This did absolutely nothing for me. I still got razor bumps.

Since I have sensitive skin, I was thinking that this extra gentle formula would even be better for me. I was wrong! This formula actually \\"suds-up\\"- which is not like the regular formula, and made me very itchy in uncomfortable places! Also, all of the printing on the container had washed off all over the shower and made quite a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product bad packaging","review":"Love the product works great for my sensitive skin.

It sounds like someone took the trebel knob and turned it all the way to the left; like Joe is singing in a barrel. It's almost impossible to make out any of the lyrics.Joe Cocker has released some good live albums (notably 1990's \\"Joe Cocker Live\\"), but this is not one of them. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe sounds better elswhere!","review":"I would be willing to bet Joe Cocker had no say in the release of \\"Standing Here\\", a live 2 cd set recorded in May of 1981. The recording finds Joe Cocker at a stage in his career when he was still getting back on his feet from years of abuse. His voice is weak and the band is surely not as good as his late 80's and 90's Chris Stainton bands. The cd has most of his classics and some nice mid-seventies album tracks but they lack the power of his best live offerings. Listen to his \\"Maddogs and Englishmen\\" or his \\"Joe Cocker Live\\" cd's and compare it to this release and you will see what I mean. I am sure some fan is going to be upset with this review but if you are truly a big Joe Cocker fan like myself, you know this does not come close to his best live recordings. I would not be shocked if this cd went out of print fairly quickly. Thank goodness Joe is healthy again and singing better than ever, but this release should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few chances to hear the late, great B.J.

The product was easily installed and intuitive. We familiarized ourselves with it before our trip and felt comfortable with its use and functionality. The problem with the Garmin Language Guide is the listing of words was extremely limited and the phrases are not ones we found any use for. I realized that my two years of very rusty high school French from 30 years ago and the ability of most everyone in Paris to speak at least a limited amount of English more than adequate for us to maneuver this large European city. Perhaps if we were in a more rural area where fewer people understood English this tool would have been more useful.

The Nuvi 1390T only has a micro SD slot. I called Garmin, and they said the Language Guide comes on a micro SD card with an SD adapter (not what I got). This product was definitely not what Garmin told me it should be. I am concerned that I may have been sold a counterfeit product!!! Do not buy this if your Garmin GPS does not have a full sized SD card slot!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a helpful tool","review":"This product takes more time to figure out then it is worth. It was useless with basic road signs in French or French menus. One really bad example is that you can find a useful phrase and ask \\"Where can I go handgliding\\"? Wow, that will come in handy over and over. It is so bad as a translator that I would never recommend anyone to buy this product, you would truly be wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think it is!","review":"Garmin language guide was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! It comes with zero installation instructions. Inserted the chip into a Nuvi 660 and nothing happened. Technical support email link does not work.

Will revert to my Franklin Spanish/English translator. Although not a particularly sophisticated device, it does work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Way Translations are useless","review":"Of what good is a translator when you can't understand the response; i.e the fact that the Nuvi translates your questions into a European language (in this case German) is of little use when the respondent answers in German. What's needed is a reverse translator that allows the native speaker to either select an appropriate response or type it in (assuming they have the patience to do so and do not misspell words). There are many interactive translators on the market but unfortunately, because of the memory required; they're all computer based. This is especially significant because languages like French and Especially German are often so grammatically different and because of that the English translations are often confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good so far. Haven't used it overseas yet.","review":"One nice unadvertised feature of this product is that the data and program completely load into the GPS (Nuvi 670 in my case). So the chip can be removed and the SD card slot can be used for other things. Also, phrases in the oher language are spoken for help with pronunciation. Or you could just let your Nuvi do the talking for you. Overall usefulness in a foreign country remains to be seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The book quality - new, but not excellent material. Prompt delivery.

I saw her at Ronnie Scott's in London last December and she rocked the house. On stage she's like a Janis Joplin - you can't help but be moved and fall in love. Word has it that she's appearing in New York in September 2001. For now, if you live in or are going to England, check out her website: sarahjanemorris.com.

The first two discs are great, but the last leaves me a little disappointed (the later stuff is a little too synthetic-sounding). I can't argue with the price though, and it makes a nice companion to the 'Arkology' box set which delivers several more Lee Perry produced classics and their dubs (\\"War ina Babylon\\", \\"Police and Thieves\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andreas Raufeisen- ART","review":"I THINK --- Big art, nice womans, but...- where is my stuff ?

However, it is not in the books's scope to tell you how to flatter your unique shape. If you are a woman who is round all around, or thick top and down without much waist definition, these tips will work great. However, any curvaceous woman, like a pear or an hourglass, might wish to purchase \\"The Pocket Stylist\\" instead, as the advice there is not to make you look leaner as much as flatter your existing body type.

There are a couple of clunkers here and there, but on the whole this is a masterpiece -- lyrically, sonically (for the time, anhyway), and musically.If you're expecting a bunch of three to four minute pop songs then you will be disappointed. This is much like a concept album (thought the concept is a bit vague - ha!) in that it should be listened as a whole, especially with good headphones late at night when you're by yourself.There's really not much more to say. If you're a fan of Rundgren then this is one of the best albums of his to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rundgren's best work","review":"This has always been one of my favorite albums. I've owned the vinyl for 20+ years and just bought the CD. I've lent the CD to many of my 20 something co workers and they are just blown away by the production and the color. Sure it has a few rough transitions but when you consider the era when it was done you have to give Todd credit for breaking new ground. The original work is some of his best and his tributes to R&B and broadway are excellent. This Album deserves a good listen by anyone who likes music of any form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaped My Entire Musical Outlook","review":"This was the first album I had when I was 12 years old (taped onto a cheap cassette). I used to listen to it incessantly, and as a result, I see how my musical tastes developed out of this one album--always wanting creativity, and especially variety. This album contains examples of almost every rock or pop/rock format there is. You've got straight ahead rock and pop songs (\\"Just One Victory,\\" \\"Sometimes I Don't Know What To Feel\\"), experimental sound-effect laden trips (\\"Dogfight Giggle,\\" \\"International Feel\\"), a '60s-based soul medley, and hard rock craziness (\\"You Need Your Head,\\" \\"Rock and Roll Pussy\\"). This is definitely for the person who gets bored listening to the same sound for twelve straight songs........and it will always be the most influential album to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"i tried and tried to get it....","review":"ok,Ive had this lp for about 15 years and played it then and quickly put it away.I love Todds first three solo albums filled with geat productions,upbeat music,power pop brillance.I was on the amazon reviews yesterday and saw ungodly amount of praise and joy for this album.so....... ! listened again....perfect vinyl copy....through a great pair of headphones....a good buzz...at night......and got a headache.It starts out promising but the production is godawful...the songs are coy at best...pale beach boy rip-offs...that unnessasary medley(come on you can write,todd!!)a swirling mess!!This is NOT a psychedelicmasterpiece...only another overdosed musician with to much time on his hands.sorrrrry!!t"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"THE\\" Missing Link","review":"When i discovered this album in 1984 it broadened my musical taste and led to the appreciation of a gifted individual. Im not going to label /anything here, just note that this album was a precursor to many styles and bands, like Chrome. While being a throwback to many, including Zappa, and maybe even Raymond Scott. If you dont have this then you do not understand music as art. You cannot ignore the significance of this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most hopeful records ever made","review":"When this came out twenty seven years ago it had alittle poem by patti smith written in green ink on top of a band-aid. you won't get that with this edition of the cd, but you will get music that still soounds 27 years ahead of it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I have always liked Tood Rundgren but amazingly enough had never heard this album until by chance I listened to it recently. Instantly I was mesmerized by the full frontal attack of sounds that are totally unlike anything I had ever heard before. The melodies/chord progressions/rhythms/vocals/solos/effects are nothing short of amazing/stunning. Truly Side 1 of this album is a sonic masterpiece right up there with anything ever produced by any of the musical greats since the beginning of time - thats how much it has affected me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Purchase the MP3 Download","review":"One of Todd's greatest works ever is AWATS. However, the MP3 download ruins the original flow of the album by breaking up each track. If you are a Todd purist (if not, go away) you need to purchase the vinal or CD version. The download version is a waste on money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book tells only bad stories about Albania","review":"The author realy seems to be proud of himself that he has survived Albania. I agree that not everything in Albania is perfect, but who wants to read stories about how lucky the author is that he wasn't killed and that since WWII no other foreigners has visited a place. Sometimes, you have the impression that the author really believes that he is one of the first foreigners to visit the country and not to travel back in a coffin. The book is another example of writings about Albania only mentioning the bad points because these things sell better. There are other critical books about the country much more worth to be read (e.g. Post's Women in Albania)."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely false","review":"Dear friends. I'm an albanian guy and i lived there until a year ago and I know how it is. Some things that carver wrote are true, goverment mafia but what it's said about the people is totally untrue and very offensive against the albanian people. What about i tell the history of america by listing that two high school student killed 20 others and a guy killed and mutilate 6 people in a mc donald store.The problem is that a lot of people dont know about Albania and anything they read its interesting true and whatever.In albania maybe part of the goverment is corrupted (It happens in every post communist state) and a lot of corruption going on and maybe once in a while a group of people rise against the goverment armed (same as waco texas) and even the pay is only 100 $ for month, but a similar disgrace of the albanian people is ridiculos.

This book contained many familiar references and pictures, as I'd traveled through Albania the same year as the author. Had I known what he experienced, I'd probably have reconsidered my trip! While I had no problems, Carver's travelogue takes the reader through incredible experiences with a variety of people that illustrate the Albanian mind, so unique these days, having been isolated for 50 years under a repressive dictator. The amazing thing is that it's non-fiction. This is a fascinating country, and this book takes you on a clearly on-tourist look at the people, landscape, and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading for an up-to-date review on Albania","review":"This book is well written and a pleasure to read. I picked it up upon my return from a three-week trip to Greece, including the fascinating Epirus and Macedonia. As at some points on my trip I was a mere 30 kilometers from the Albanian border, it appeared as a logical follow-up to benefit from Carver's lively and recent experience. The good maps help a great deal. I feel that after reading the book I have gained a good understanding of what makes Albania tick (or not tick!). Although the beginning is slow, the momentum builds up; it is well worth to hang on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA/Hitachi C Camcorder Battery (Energizer)","review":"Good replacement for what is becoming a hard to find battery especially for those with a full size VHS camcorder that still works and is still very usable in today's digital world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Of Montreal album...","review":"Every one is amazing, mind you, but this one is incredible because he delves incredibly deep into territory only slightly perused on \\"The Bedside Drama\\": sadness, all-encompassing and honest. The untitled tracks here represent perhaps the last of a truly sad bunch of songs. I, for one, love sad songs. I revel in them. Kevin Barnes is happy now, which is by no means a good thing.

This book is amazing becuase it discloses a small amount of evidence of esoteric meanings hidden in ancient philosophy. Of course Strauss is not the first author to mention this (another good refrence is Morals and Dogma, Albert Pike) but Strauss also gives away a few clues on how to decypher the ancient texts. This book is a must read and own for any one who wants to see beyond the conventional, exoteric side of philosophy. I highly recomend it to any freemason or initiate of a mystery school.

How well I remember seeing the TV clips shown in the movie in my own living room and the feelings of intense dislike for the man called George Wallace. The movie also puts a human face on Wallace that shows the depth to which the man fell in his persuit of political power. I think the imaginary character of Archie served the purpose of helping the viewer to understand, at least in a limited way, the pain that was visited on the black people during this era. Certainly it is easy to see why Gary Sinise won an Emmy for his powerful and intense portrayal of this much despised man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Accuracy","review":"Any time I see that Gary Senise is one of the actors in a film, I know that I want to watch it. Whether as Lt. Dan, Harry S. Truman, or George Wallace, Senise becomes the part that he is playing. Some actors, including many A list actors, bend a role to fit their own personalities. Gary Senise is not one of those actors.\\"George Wallace\\" portrays the title character as he was, a pragmatic, many would say opportunistic, politician. Although Wallace began his career as more liberal than was the norm in Alabama at that time, he was willing to make deals with whoever would help to get him elected - including members of the Klan - and to say whatever those people wanted to hear.That later in his life Wallace shifted away from his racist stance leads to the question: Who was the real George Wallace? This film helps to answer that question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, great acting.","review":"Exellent film, inspired and eye opening to those who have never seen how far the lack of understanding will take you or how much of a life can be spent doing harm to those you do not even know.I'm sure you will enjoy this film and the message it delivers. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance","review":"A great performance by Gary Sinise again!This movie takes us back to the beginning of Wallace era and show how people can let themselves lose track of their ideal in politics, although in this case in ends with a revelation for the main character and a lot to fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"History distorted by hollywood","review":"If you want to know the basics of George Wallace then this film is fine. But if you want to know true historical facts go somewhere else. This movie creates characters and scenes that never happened.

Oh well.But there is no reason Music To Eat should have been down there with the yoga disc. This may not be as immaculately arranged as a Zappa album or as dissonent as Beefheat.The jams, however, have mass qualities of both, and also have the folksy reflex of early Little Feet. They are also quite amusing, charming in their raggedness, and I have laughed out loud several times listening.For a progressive, or aspiring progressive album, the sound can be a little flat. On the other hand, the offhand rough edges of these lengthy tracks add to the immediacy and humor.Quirky album for any prog or underground collection.

The puzzles at the end of each round are all the same, in which you have to reorder some tiles to reveal a picture.

However, I was wrong. His music is still no good because I find it very surprising that being an European dance music DJ his mixes are that bad.

The songs on this disc are very elaborate and upbeat (don't get me wrong, I love dark techno like Ralph Falcon's \\"Dark Beat\\", so this is a pretty big deviation for me). The standout tracks are, of course, \\"Heaven\\", \\"Sunlight\\", \\"The Boys of Summer\\", and the updated \\"California Dreamin'\\", which I am tempted to say is better than the Royal Gigolos' recent attempt at bringing the Mamas and the Papas to the dancefloor. All in all, I'm a little startled by the harsh reviews I've seen; though I'm a lightweight when it comes to trance, I have to say this is much better and more comprehensive than, say, Tiesto.

And those who think the kewpie-doll singing of Do on the title track make Paula Abdul seem like a natural born diva need only listen to vocalist Loona on tracks like 'Sunlight' and a very misguided remake of 'California Dreamin' to realize she's as good as it gets here.

I'm a huge fan of dance music but i can't really stand this kind of b-dance. \\"Heaven\\" a classic Bryan Adams song is better on its original version so is Mama's and the Papa's \\"California Dreaming\\" and Don Henley's \\"Boys of Summer\\".

The rest of the CD is a disappointing revelation of DJ Sammy's lack of inspiration beyond the earthly bounds of standard euro-sounds. Remakes are the name of his game, and his own original creations are euro-bland. He tries to recycle several other classics like \\"California Dreamin'\\", but the magic is gone. Besides \\"Heaven\\", the CD's most redeeming sounds come from his remake of \\"Boys of Summer\\", which is still far from heaven. The \\"El Condor Pasa\\" remake at times sounds like the type of Asian muzak you would hear in a Chinese restaurant.

Overall, I like the album a lot. It's not something I need to listen to daily, but I can definetely appreciate it as a work of music. I suppose there are people out there whose musical sensibilities are either so assaulted by conventional stuff or so advanced that this is like the soothing voice of the creator; but to me it's just nothing more or less than good.

The gain of the book is some of the early career and life facts of the subject.Unfortunately, the author's glue by which he holds his facts together becomes venomous, revealing his bias.

No dig is left undug and no innuendo is too low in this corrupted work. Although there are factual tidbits thrown in, they are not consequential. If you have an interest in this book borrow it. Do not pay good money to an author who would desecrate the memory of a great leader.

For example, he tries to give an impression that the police were innocent and at the same time admits that \\"Special Branch was indeed responsible for murder and torture.\\" Far from viewing him as merely another revisionist I was left with the impression that Hart has an old imperial view of history - pro British - and fails to see the actual basis of what was actually going on in the Irish war of independence. The important issue is not who was the more violent but what were the actual issues, political and social that were involved. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants an understanding of the period and what shaped the times.

For my education, I asked people everywhere I ventured, from museum officials to local people in pubs and on golf courses, about Michael Collins.

Collins brilliantly ran the whole operation compelling Great Britain to hand over the keys to Dublin Castle. When he signed the treaty with Britain, he acknowledged he had signed his own death warrant. What his brave man accomplished before his death at 31 is more than remarkable. In Ireland, he is a man for the ages.

He was simply a man who made the best of some really difficult times in the only ways he could. I think it is unfair to hold him up with some of the other great men of the 20th century.

I have heard tracks from his upcoming album \\"Nile\\" (out 4/25/05), and can say that it will be as good as everything else Patrice produces.

A wire carrying the 120VAC input to the transformer was shorting to the case. I repaired the uninsulated wire with some heat-shrinkable tubing and the PR20 worked.When on, the PR20 continuously produces an audible 60Hz hum that can be heard from at least 10 feet away.The PR20's output terminals are uninsulated threaded rods that extend approximately three centimeters beyond the rear of the case. An insulated binding post would be a safer alternative.On a positive note, the PR20 continues to work after six months of continuous use. However, in light of the design and manufacturing defects mentioned above, I would only purchase another PR20 if there were no other alternatives.I give the PR20 two stars, in part because there are lower-quality power supplies available on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great CD!","review":"Cliff Eberhardt does it again with this latest CD, \\"School for Love.\\" Beautiful songs performed superbly and with great emotional impact.

Dora is a twentieth century heroine, but that's all the good I can say about this book.As a reader of many, many vampire novels, I was extremely disappointed in the way Billson made vampire existence out to be: shallow, carping, and empty with none of the rich and captivating drama that Anne Rice or L.J. Smith portrays.Dora's whole existence seems to stem from her fruitless chase of a man completely unworthy of notice whom any woman with half a brain cell would have long since discarded. Her vampires are too caught up with their businesses, their \\"nips,\\" and their petty day-to-day problems to come across as anything besides pathetic. Violet is made up to be a vampire Barbie doll, and just about as intelligent.For a good read, try \\"Queen of the Damned\\" by Anne Rice.

They make them as a separate line so they won't directly compete with their consumer lines.My experience is that these batteries do not last quite as long as the top consumer lines from Duracell and Energizer. However, they are within 10-20% (depending on the application), and are considerably cheaper.

So, if you were expecting him to sound like his previous albums I've got a question for you... How many times can an artist/musician bash society and all it's glory before he/she starts repeating themselves?

Either way, I really dig Tim Skold's guitar solos, etc. However, the keys could of been left to the co-founding member, Madonna.All in all, this is a good rock album, but anyone else sick of looking at booklets of just Manson's face and different poses???

Unless former band members are outright lying, it's pretty obvious the guy is an egomaniac who has shed all talent from his roster. I hadn't listened to him in years (LOVED S.L.C and A.S. while M.A. was only mediocre, as was P.O.A.A.F.) and really lost interest shortly after M.A came out but totally dropped him since.

Bring back your unique Industrial Metal/Shock Rock sound! Bring back the days of lyrics and material that was flourished with deep metaphors and symbols. Until then, MM will now stand for \\"Mediocre Manson.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Sellout!! Horrible!!","review":"Besides Mechanical Animals, and this may be worse, this CD just plain sucks. I have officially given up on him. He is like Metallica at the end. Just a commercial sellout. It doesn't sound like anything that made his fans like his music. Manson used to have the greatest sound, from his voice and his screams, to his industrial sounding hard music. Now it is just stupid sounding wimpy music. Do not buy it!! Let him write music that made people like his sound. This CD SUCKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly Lame","review":"I have been a BIG Manson fan for over a decade. I own nearly everything he's ever done, including singles, soundtrack cuts, etc.This album disappoints on so many levels I don't know where to begin.I'll keep it brief and say this: even having Tim Skold on board can't save this mediocre, bleary, dreary collection of tracks from collapsing under the weight of its own pretentiousness.It is uninspired musically, ponderous lyrically, and dreadfully performed. All of this can be blamed directly on Manson and Skold, who (according to the liner notes) were the ONLY contributors in those areas. That's right... no Pogo or Ginger Fish here.If you want exciting music in the vein Manson USED to make, I cannot recommend Tim Skold's unfortunately out-of-print \\"Skold\\" highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reinforcing the stereotypes...","review":"To be blunt, this album is just not good. First of all, you all need to realize that Marilyn Manson IS NOT GOTH. He's a heavy metal artist. Makeup doesn't make you goth. I've never liked Marilyn Manson, but a friend burned it for me, so I gave it a listen. It's not an impressive album. With song titles like \\"If I Was Your Vampire\\", \\"Putting Holes In Happiness\\", and \\"You, Me and the Devil Makes 3\\", this album honestly sounds like Manson is parodying himself. It sounds as if he is trying to say things that sound \\"goth\\" but end up sounding like a tired, old, faker. If you want real goth that actually sounds dark, buy \\"Only Theatre of Pain\\" by Christian Death. Then you can see where Manson ripped off his vocal style from."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst manson ever","review":"i am a huge fan of manson but this album disapoints on every level.there is not one groovin song on the album.it is all slow melodic stuff.i thought his last album was the best yet.i expected so much more from manson and tim skold"},{"rating":"1","title":"It must suck","review":"To experience suck a slow painful slide into obscurity.

However, Eat Me, Drink Me has me completely stumped. It's not good in fact it's not even just ok. The overall feel of the album is one of radio-friendly shallowness, not to mention that it is very hard to tell when one song ends and another begins. It sounds processed like most of the new bands out there...not at all like the Manson we all know. All I can really say is this album has proved to be very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame with a capital L","review":"I didn't think it could get more boring or more slow than Holywood...but it did. I am sorry but Manson cannot sing. And Tim Skold is not the musical genius that Manson must think he is . These songs are slow...boring...no hooks...dragging drums, hardly any keyboards, boring riffs and I think i would rather be in a coma . What is he going to do in concert...stand there and sing these slow bland songs? I know he isnt stupid but I have to wonder sometimes . I think Twiggy must have seen the direction, he was smart to bail out when he did. Ginger fish, pogo, twiggy, john 5, they all added something to the albums. This sounds like a slow boring inside job where no one knows what he is talking about. Thank God for samples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Its not your outlet if you're looking for something just balls out hardcore like The Golden Age of Grotesque. Where The Golden Age of Grotesque was Manson's ego CD, Eat Me, Drink Me is its polar opposite. In this CD he opens up and just spills it. I'm having relationship trouble recently and this CD made so much more sense when I felt like my heart was torn out. I actually had to shut it off because I couldn't deal with the raw truth of it all. So amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in pure and true art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very generic, and boring...there are no good riffs on here","review":"Well, the Manson that created Beutiful People is gone......this is boring, with no cool riffs or catchy songs....obviously needs to hire yet another round of band members to come in and write him some good tracks...His voice is still very cool...he just has nothing to sing over the top of......check out the new Fozzy All that Remains Reloaded to here what great riffs and songs can do........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice cream cone with worms","review":"I love MM.

So this cd, for all its inadequacies, is a great sounding disc. The production is crystal, the guitar work is perfect, and Steve Perry, by all measures, is in great voice. However, I am amazed that a group that clearly appears to be trying so hard, could produce such an inconsequential album. The crux of the problem is in the songwriting. No amount of great production can save this collection of bland offerings. The lone exception is the heartfelt \\"When You Love A Woman\\", which follows admirably in the footsteps of great Journey ballads like \\"Faithfully\\" and \\"Why Can't This Night Go On Forever\\". The other songs are beset by overwrought lyrics and vanilla melodies. Worst of all, the band seems to be having no fun at all. This album is a lone blemish on a great catalogue of music by a great group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-worked and disappointing.","review":"TBF is a mixture of every previous JOURNEY album. Simply put: it is a re-working of old material. Laden with their classic power ballads, TBF reflects nothing new. Each piece can be structurally or lyrically found on previous albums. Even the \\"original\\" ONE MORE is reminiscent of their little known DREAM AFTER DREAM album. Only EASY TO FALL is memorable and fresh. Another ballad, DON'T BE DOWN ON ME, BABY, has bright moments of the R&B soul that is Steve Perry but lacks any lyrical cohesiveness. Overall, a disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest of all Journey albums with Steve Perry","review":"This sounds like a downgraded version of Perry's 1994 solo album \\"for the love of strange medicine,\\" which by the way was very good. You can feel the tension among the members of the band, here, that spoils the chemistry. Boy, what a long collection of unmemorable, plain dull songs. I can maybe salvage three tracks here: the single \\"when you love a woman,\\" mid-tempo rockers \\"If He Should Break Your Heart\\" and \\"Forever in Blue,\\" None of them, by the way, equal the poorest track from their previous album \\"Raised on Radio.\\"And I don't know how one can explain the very poor production here given they had a huge comeback budget to record and promote this thing. I spent the full price back in 96 for the original release. What a shame.

I'm almost sure these are out-takes from the last few CD's in the 80's. How many balads are there on this thing? Take a look at the picture of the band on the jacket. Was Perry cut and pasted in?

As my wife and I got married the same week this was released, this was a natural pickup, since we'd both liked Journey in the past. \\"Escape\\" Journey was putting out a new album. Problem is that the album is a bore. The first three songs are good, but after that, it's mostly unlistenable. That was a shame, as we both loved Journey a lot. It also has a god awful horrid album cover.I would have given it just one star, but I really do like the opening first song a lot, and tracks 2 & 3 are pretty decent, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I love the whole album. Anything Journey puts out it is always good to me. The first song really fast pace you can hear the words very clear \\"Message of Love\\".

They sounded phenomenal on this album, on all of the songs. They still have that big arena rock sound all over this effort. There's still that '80s feel in the 1996 songs, but the emphasis is on the present. Message of Love reminds me of Separate Ways (Worlds Apart), only faster. When You Love A Woman continues where Open Arms left off. I was pleased that it got a Grammy nomination! The rest of the album is quite good. Sometimes, the power ballads outnumber the rockers in the album's second half, but they're very adventurous and experimental on here. This was Steve Perry's last album with the band despite a bitter conflict with band members. He's what made this band happen as its lead singer. Steve Augeri is good, but he has a long ways to go to catch up to Perry's status. This was a great album after 10 years off! Few longtime bands these days can pull it off like they could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD for Journey fans.","review":"I'm disappointed to see so many criticisms of this album. Yes, there are certainly a lot of ballads on this one, but that's what makes it great. On here are some of my favorite love songs of all time. Even after so many years, Steve Perry still had a voice that could take you over the edge and make you melt. It's really hard to pick any favorites on here, because they all fit together well as one unit. In this case, the album is greater than the sum of its parts. About the only track on it that doesn't stand with the rest is \\"Castles Burning.\\" It's just OK. Even if you don't like all of it, there are so many tracks on this one that you're sure to find something good. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider This As Journey's Greatest Hits Vol.2","review":"Journey is one of my favorite artists of all time. And their 1981 masterpiece Escape is one of my all time favorite albums.Trial By Fire is an outstanding album and it is almost comparable to their greatest hits album. But the year 1996 was still bad for melodic rockers like Journey allowing only one top 20 hit When You Love A Woman. But many music fans who haven't bought this album are missing too much great music. Message of Love remnicent a bit of Seperate Ways is outstanding rocker, and Can't Tame A Lion are magnificent uptempo pop rock, also missing are Steve Perry's masterful ballad works such as When I Think Of You. It had been a crime that such great songs had been neglected. So only way to have them is to buy this album. A must for Survivor, Journey and Two Fires(Kevin Chalfant band) fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comeback","review":"I have waited for years hoping that they will reunite after their last album Raised on Radio.

The big hit off this album was \\"When You Love A Woman\\" which reached the Top Ten in late '96/early '97. The album as a whole breaks no new ground as it is just vintage Journey consisting of ballads and mid-tempo rock tunes. In fact, the only fast tracks here are \\"Message Of Love\\", \\"Can't Tame The Lion\\" and the bonus track \\"I Can See It In Your Eyes\\". Unlike other reissues, there are no tour dates because the tour that was to follow was put off due to an injury Perry suffered shortly after the album's release. Eventually Perry was released from the band. The booklet features photos and credits instead.It's been ten years since I purchased this title on cassette.

I had trouble understanding the plot, if there was one. I was confused with the excessive amount of violence in the fight scenes, how exactly did the bad guy jam his fingers into other characters chests and then cause them to erupt in massive volcanic-like fissures of blood? Maybe it's me, but I like a little realism in my anime.The dialog was written so that a three year old could follow it, but unfortunately the film is much too violent for a three year old to view, so I guess the film's writers need to sharpen their writing skills.I don't understand how films like this one can make it into the \\"cult classics\\" genre. If you view the film without bloodlust on your mind, you will be impressed at how stupid the story actually is.

Thanks For The Ether is probably the album I listen to the most along with EP Collections 1 and 2 by The Cranes and The Dreaming by Kate Bush. It's unfathomably beautiful on so many levels. The music is extremely visual and atmospheric. It's like Svankmajer's Alice and the original Grimms Fairy Tales and Edward Gorey and everything beautiful and strange. I wouldn't say it was goth, I think it far surpasses goth. It has a brilliant, dark sense of humour to it. It's a very artfully satisfying album. I would love to get my hands on How We Quit The Forest, but apparently it's out of print or something...anyway, their music sounds pretty much exactly like their cover art, and if that excites you as much as it does me, you should seriously whip out that Visa card and get movin'.

Which he is. He always knows how to rock. Which he does. And he can just plain pick 'em with the best of 'em. No doubt about that. But more than anything else, he's an artist. And it began to become very clear with each one of his releases, that he answered to no one but himself. His emotions came out in his songs, his music & his amazing musicianship. I could rattle off a handful of songs off this, his 3rd release, that I think stand-out from the others but it would be a waste of time. Front to back. Side to side. Beginning to end. Chris Whitley's records need to be listened to from first track to last. Looked at from cover to cover. And absorbed right through the skin & straight into the soul. Chris Whitley, a poet that will forever be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for any CD collection","review":"While Terra isn't Whitley's strongest work (see his Living With the Law or Dirt Floor for unparalleled, 5-star albums) that's like saying Michael Jordan had a mediocre game because he scored 40 points instead of 45. Tracks such as Weightless, Immortal Blues, Cool Wooden Crosses, Gasket and Aerial make this CD worth far, far more than the $$ you'll spend for it.

His talent for songwriting and guitar-playing goes unsurpassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I adore CW's music beyond all reason--","review":"actually, I also adore CW himself beyond all reason. But this CD is terrible. I mean, it's really bad. With the exception of the spooky and powerful Clear Blue Sky and the funky and original Aerial, these songs range from the unlistenable to the merely OK. My life is no different for having heard Cool Wooden Crosses (unlike the case with, say, Dust Radio or Frontier or Scrapyard Lullaby) while Still Point is just monotonous.As to the one song everyone seems to like: Automatic has some wonderfully intense and vivid lyrics but the music is so bone-chillingly radio-oriented that it's one of the most off-putting songs I've ever heard by any artist. Nothing wrong with radio-friendly tunes--they help sell CDs and keep artists afloat. But Automatic's music is pop-ish in a hostile way. Maybe a way to give the finger to a record company that wanted, like so many fans, just a rehash of Living with the Law? Maybe that's what this whole CD is about.

I also find the Jan Hammer track \\"Escape\\", which won a Grammy by the way, to be a very cool 1980s flashback.

If you have any appreciation for late 70's Stones or 80's Santana then this album makes for a great listen. In fact, I'll probably listen to it more often than Truth, Blow by Blow or Wired because it is a rare example of first class Beck guitar combined with good songs and great singers.

From the very beginning I have found them very entertaining, but his early works were generally a little shallow. That said, as time has gone on he has matured as an author. This novel has a very great amount of depth. Admittedly the way he presents parallel trains of thought is sometimes a little hard to follow, but is well worth the effort.

What delighted me the most is how early my nephew would be able to finish each of the unique couplings... such \\"I like the taste of cream/but while I drink I dream/of birds and fishes\\".

Di'Anno didn't and still doesn't have any vocal range. He sounds like someone who's trying to use the bathroom, but is constipated. These versions of Iron Maiden songs are far inferior to the ones re-done by Bruce Dickinson. If you like the way Rob Halford sings and Bruce Dickinson and Ronnie James Dio, Robert Plant, Geoff Tate, then you'll hate this CD. If you want truly great metal, look elsewhere. This is similar to bad garage band stuff sung by a drunk 9th grader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul, who?!?! JUST KIDDING!!","review":"THe Beast is back!! Although he might punch you in the face and tell you he never left. This is a great collection of the best Di'Anno era Maiden tunes. Recorded at various locations it is a live album that reminds you who came first. Some times Paul adapts a low growl, and sometimes almost hits those high notes of old. This however does not affect the vibe of the songs. They kick arse and so does Paul.This is the live cd that Maiden should have released when Paul was still with them. Combine this with \\"Maiden Japan\\" and you have a great live document of Paul and Maiden. There are two other live cds by Paul contaning a few Maiden tunes, and solo songs as well, but this is where the buck stops.

I still think the ring is beautiful and its made from stone, not gold, silver or platinum. I have seen Rhodonite in catalogs and they are at least $40 when set in silver.

These ladies fawn so much on her voice that I couldn't continue reading. Please, I know it's beautiful but get passed it! It further offers no critical insight and remains quite superficial.

As another reviewer points out, the 50s setting is not carried through the dialogue, which indeed sounded far too 90s. Several of the character's ruminations about 50's B-movies and horror sounded so close to other sources (most notably Stephen King's own thoughts on the topic in his nonfictional Danse Macabre) that I almost expected to see an acknowledgment page at the end. My biggest complaint, however, is the way in which chapters ended with a 'surprise.' Often, what would have been a more interesting scene in terms of character responses is left for some new scene, stifling the material. This stop and start pacing and a heist that takes too long to develop make this book an overall disappointment. The reader's time is far better spent with any of the LA Noir series by James Ellroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story with good characters but writing little originality","review":"I almost finished this book.

You do remember your business partner?\\"), I began to realize that these characters weren't original(one of the main characters seems loosely based on Christoper Walken's character in <i><b>The King of New York</i></b>, the prose did <b>not</b> match the period (he's got people in the 50's talking as if it's the 90's. i.e., \\"Like, um, what are you going to do?\\"). And a pet peeve of mine, British writers who want to write American novels but then slip in stupid British sayings like, \\"It'll work a treat!\\"Whatever.

So D.W. sets out searching, looking high and low. However, she soon realizes that due to her selfishness, she never purchased presents for her family, so she begins creating masterpieces for everyone, including Pal, Arthur's puppy.Fans of the ARTHUR TV show will be enthralled to find a holiday book perfect for young readers and their parents. While it shows how young children truly act when the holidays roll around, it also depicts how great it feels to give presents to the ones you love. This is a wonderful holiday story that will be cherished for years to come, especially by those who love D.W.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 5 year olds!","review":"Our family is already a big Marc Brown fan, so we thought we probably had a good bet in this new D.W. book.

The instrumental arrangements of the first had a crisp \\"cool jazz\\" feel. The 2nd album was just mostly standard (and quite lame) hip-hop tracks.

The hi-hats are closed most of the time (hi-hats are a part of a drum set next to the snare), and it doesn't sound as energetic as when they are open. The more energetic the music is, the more we seem to like it. That is why so many of us like the Self Titled and Blue Room more than Oz Factor.

The sound of this CD is a unique blend of jazz, pop, folk and even soul. The melodies are beautiful, the lyrics insightful, cutting, moving and authentic. Martyn's voice is really one of a kind and so is the music. There is an honest, soulful, simplicity here that is summed up on the song \\"The River\\". His love for his daughter is deeply evident in \\"Look At The Girl\\". \\"Patterns in The Rain\\" is incredibly moving.The albums I like the most are those that transport me somewhere: to \\"The River\\" by Martyn, to \\"Hergest Ridge\\" by Mike Oldfied.

It has been a superior choice!The Suncast cart has delivered on all fronts, plus some. Despite its plastic components (an original concern) the metal tube framing makes it sturdy and rigid. The cart assembled in minutes and has proven to be an excellent value. No more trips back and forth to the garage for tools while working in the yard... simply roll the cart out with you.

Admittedly, much of Amos's book is technical, with mathematical equations that are more daunting than anything else, but there is an astounding array of knowledge, that, while not directly helpful to my goals is fascinating, nonetheless. So far (I'm up to chapter 5) I've learned a few techniques that have helped to craft my spinning into something more advanced than bumbling, but more than that, the book has sparked my further interest into the world of spinning. For example, I don't plan on growing, harvesting and preparing flax for spinnng, but I was fascinated with learning about the process.All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of info but hard to get through","review":"Too wordy, only line illustrations and a flamboyant writing style ,which makes the text hard to get through, gives this book a 2 star rating. Page 16 seems to indiacate that the writer has very little confidence in your being interested enough to continue and has a paragraph entitled \\"Why You May Want To Read Further\\". The book does answer some questions about handspinning in general but, in areas where more detailed info should have been provided, there's nothing. For instance, I wanted to find out how long I should steam a skein of yarn to set the twist. Pages 199 to 201 tell me nothing (except that steaming is best for wool).If you've done some spinning and want a book that interesting in its approach then buy this book. If you are new to spinning or want good reference books for your shelf then you'll be much better off with \\"Hands on Spinning\\", \\"The Ashford Book of Spinning\\" and a subscription to \\"Spin Off\\" Magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference to Keep on Hand.....","review":"This is the first book I purchased when I began to learn to spin. Although in the beginning alot of it was over my head, in the 5 or so years that I have been spinning now I have read this book many many times, and used it for quick reference often. Every time I read through it I pick up something I missed before. Amos's humor takes the edge off of learning something new. Although he does go into detail on the chemistry of scouring, and the physics of the twist, this may be very useful to those most serious about their art, however these sections ar easily skimed over for those who arnt. The plans for tools in the back do require someone with woodworking experience, as Amos states in the beginning. I like having them anyway because you never know when you will meet someone like that.

It is an absolutely incredible movie if one is in the mood to decompress and laugh about the zanier side of the film world.

The only English bookshop was my escape route...then I bought Dr Rat. Even the first few pages made me feel ill...I distinctly remember a passage about kittens' vaginas and microwaves.

If you love animals, avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing is fine, but couldn't take the violence toward animals","review":"There is certainly a place in literature for books like this. From what I'd read, novels like \\"Animal Farm\\" or \\"Watership Down,\\" written from the point of view of the animal, are great works with very important messages.I'm not sure if this book comes up to those standards, but I'm noting the similarity.I simply couldn't handle reading about the torture of lab rats. I got through a couple of chapters, but just had to quit. Perhaps it changes tone later on.I wouldn't discourage anybody from reading it, simply saying that my stomach couldn't take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madness as Education","review":"If you read Dr. Rat you will never forget it -- ever. I read this many years ago and was reluctant to pick it up for a re-read because of the discomfort and horror it engendered, although I felt oddly compelled. A second reading did nothing to change my mind that a book that could make me that uncomfortable was worth a second look. (Those who believe in mankind's God-given right to dominion over the earth and its creatures should be forced to read Dr. Rat.) This is a strange, intense, often wildly funny, but serious book for people who relish chewy intellectual meat over sentimental feel-good pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Animal Lovers","review":"There is nothing wrong with the book and it is well written and clever. The thing I did not like about it was the detailed descriptions of the experiments on animals.

How do you know if it works?","review":"I'm giving this product a 1 star review because it doesn't list the frequency or range of frequncies that it operates on. It only vaguely lists that it works somewhere in the VHF range. Are we consumers just expected to buy this and be stuck with it if it doesn't work because of radio interferance? If they bothered to post the frequency range under the product description like most of the other wireless microphones do, than pershaps consumers can determine before we buy it whether or not it will work in our environment. If you purchase this item, you're gambling that it's going to work. If you're in a small club in the middle of nowhere with no other RF use anywhere nearby, odds are it will work. But if you're like most people who use wireless mics in a very crowded RF environment, not knowing whether or not this mic is going to work before you buy it is not acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley Murdock is blessed and her vocals are off da hook!","review":"I have loved Shirley's music for over ten years, when I saw all her albums on Amazon, I felt like I found the old school that I've been searching for for soooooo long.

As a people trainer, I found it useful for defining the buzzwords of dogspeak needed to convey concepts to dog owners. Human to Canine communication is the key element to success in training.

They are so well done, they look exactly like the characters on the show, so your child is sure to enjoy them. There are no hard plastic pieces, and the shirts stay on, so there's nothing to lose on them. They are just big enough for a 2-4yr old to grab and snuggle, or carry under their arm.

She was a couple of years ahead of the Alternative R&B wave. I don't want to try my hand at revising a small part of music history but, her music along with Dionne Farris, Me'Shelle Ndegeocello & early D'Angelo softened up the Black Music community for the projects now getting all the praise & attention, such as Macy Gray, Angie Stone, Erykah Badu, Jazzy Fatnastees etc. The cut \\"Infatuation\\" is an infectious aural potion of Prince, Gladys Knight, Nancy Wilson and other great jazz, funk & R&B influences. It's a shame that she was overlooked by so many with her debut. She's a much stronger singer than Macy Gray, more original than Angie Stone, more down to Earth than Badu. I certainly hope she gets the chance to bless our ears one more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i hoped for.","review":"this is the \\"americanized\\" laurnea'. not too good. her voice is beautiful but i don't feel that its a soulful voice, therefore, shouldn't be on these tracks. the track are too r&b and should be for fantasia or someone like that. the loose ends flavor fits her voice better, or over broken beats (nujazz flavor) or she should work with Agent K (Feed the Cat 2003). he is out of London and that flavor music fits her better. I am kinda sorry i wasted my money on this cd. the cd is full of talent but imagine your football greats in the NBA or NHL...........exactly, her voice does not fit the production/musicians on this CD. Someone before dared to compare her to Erykah Badu. not in the same tree. Erykah is more abstract yet pinpointed with nice basslines in her music.

It may not be the most intellectually stimulating, thought provoking film to ever grace the movie screen, but then what would it be? What is it is a fantastic piece of entertainment, and the soundtrack follows well in the tradition of the film. Borrowing strongly from hits from the '60s, the soundtrack includes two versions of \\"Dancing In the Street\\": the original, and a new version by Disney's latest pop icon, Myra. The CD also has classics like \\"Born To Be Wild\\" and \\"Let the Sunshine In\\".

The concept of active directory is confuse and primary. The approach of OUs, group policy and delegation and security are very superficial and it doesn't give any foundation to implement this features of Windows 2000. The figures are too big (it looks like to fulfill pages and for the book have more volume).

The title said for kids, so I thought I would read some to my class. After a few non-laughable ones, I started reading through some and discovered that most of the jokes would be accepted well by middle school students and above. Some were very tasteless including cannibalism. Do third graders need to mull over jokes about cannibalism? I didn't read those to the students so I ended up marking the ones that were acceptable (maybe two out of five or so). Still most were not funny and needed explaining to the students.

'Inertia,' a slow, psychedelic groover, features one of Damon Albarn's best vocals, while the somber character study 'Mr. Briggs' brims with inventive guitar playing from Graham Coxon while also hinting at the lyrical direction of the British Trilogy.

A book that includes words like \\"boneheads,\\" \\"nut-brains,\\" \\"big mouths,\\" etc. should not be in the form of a book geared to young children. Board books teaching counting are usually aimed at young children, and should also not include \\"The sun burnt Triceratops into dried up bones,\\" policemen yelling, and dentists shouting.

We like the dinosaurs, but why use a made up word like \\"mooth\\"? Why spleet, bleep, spleet with no clear answer what happened? Why is the \\"policeman on a trike not pictured\\"? Why baseball all of a sudden? And why bones in the sun?

This book is not just for architects but for anyone who is interested in the Chirstian Community and the future of the Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"I know that most historical fiction is just that; 'fiction', but this book was highly implausable and improbable, the heroine is masochistic and the hero is not just \\"wounded\\", he is a jerk, and I could not find one redeeming quality in this man. Ms. Joyce puh-leeze return to writing about strong alpha male rakes with hearts of gold. If this is your first Brenda Joyce book, please read her earlier novels, they sizzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Brenda Joyce at her best","review":"This HR is 500+ pages- didn't finish it. The hero was sullen & impatient & lady hero was selfish& spoiled. The story would have been more interesting had she married her intended & learned tolove him instead. Story had too many repeated themes & I did not care for either main character.Ms Joyce's book, the Masquerade, is so much better written & hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not up to par","review":"All I have to say is this. How many times can a man blush! Very repetitive and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"When I bought this book I had already read several Brenda Joyce novels. So I was expecting this book to be as good as the others, but it wasn't. The book started off well then went down hill. Sean and Elle had nothing in common. The whole time Elle was trying to find out what happened to Sean. She was so annoying!! Don't get me wrong this book isn't terrible its just Brenda Joyce usually writes such good novels that this one was a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor story and unlikeable charaters","review":"The story was very thin, Eleanor was a spoiled brat, and Sean was wishy washy at best. I actually liked Peter Sinclair the best. I think he got a lucky break 'not' ending up with Eleanor in the end! This book is not worth the time to read it or the money to buy it or the window to throw it out of! But if you are a Brenda Joyce fan and an unbeliever and you must read it, I would suggest the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to meet your one true love at a family reunion?","review":"I really couldn't find a way to support these main characters in their quest to love each other eternally. I just couldn't get past the idea that he used to think of her as a sister and then she became hot and then he had the hots for her. Pardon me, but I want my characters to be strangers or at least not family relations before they take the leap and fall into forever love. This book was a bit on the disturbing side for me. I gave it two stars because the writing was okay even if I hated the plot. Can't recommend this one though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"Wow, I am completely surprised by the negative reviews. This was the first book I have read this year that I could not put down. It was wonderful. Elle and Sean are substantive characters. Brenda was true to their characters throughout the book. Elle's personality might be annoying at times but that is part of the magic that makes this book work. I love the fact that when Sean is released from prison he isn't whole and strong. His vulernabilty drew me in. I felt as though I had a vested interest in the lives of these two. The flashbacks helped explain why Sean had to turn his horse around when Elle was calling his name, and why Elle continued to harass Sean until the truth of his suffering finally came out. They have been their for each other from the very beginning. It was their destiny. On a final note, Peter was remarkable. He deserves the greatest love. Only those of us who have had to let go of a loved one to allow them to experience true happiness understand his agony."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly, a love story","review":"I am an avid romance novel reader. I have read so many books, but this one truly stands out to me as a true love story. It is about an unconditional and eternal love. I like the characters, Sean, and Elle so much. Sean is a very sweet, tortured hero. He made wrong choices but I can see that it could happen to anyone. Elle is wonderful: she is brave, she is not afraid to love and to hold on to it. Her love for Sean makes it 5 stars. It might not be realistic to some people but I read romances for that kind of love. However, most books fail to portray love well."},{"rating":"1","title":"such a disappointment","review":"i love brenda joyce's books and have read all her others but i couldn't finish this one. i thought the story was horrible and found Elle to be most annoying. it's just too incestuous for me. it's one thing if they met each other when they were teenagers but to literally grow up with her since she was a baby, that's too much for me. i hated that elle felt betrayed by sean's \\"other woman\\" even though it happened 4 years before and what eventually happened to her. where's her compassion? she's so selfish. i had to force myself to get through the book after the first few chapters but i just can't finish it. i may just read the end to find out what eventually happened. sorry but i'm definitely not recommending this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stepsiblings in love.....ICK!","review":"1 1/2 StarsI made it through about 400 pages before I realized it wasn't going to get any better. I got that far because it was a Brenda Joyce and I love her older work; clearly not the caliber it once was. There was nothing appealing about stepsiblings that were raised together having sex. It was unnatural and disturbing.Apart from that (if one can actually get past the incestuous under(?)tones), the heroine was tstl. The story took forever to get moving. By page 200, the bride had yet to be \`stolen'.In the 400 pages I plodded through the heroine told the hero she 'loved him so much\` at least a hundred times, they'd had sex, he stomps off in horror about it, she throws herself at his feet, 'cups his cheek\` about 300 more times, he loves her, he loves her not..... All the while running from the British cavalry hot on his trail set to hang him for murder!Phew! Not a keeper for me. For a steller BJ read, try \\"The Conqueror\\" or \\"Dark Fires\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, repetitive and boring!","review":"As a fan of Brenda Joyce it gives me no pleasure to admit that I had to force myself to finish reading this book. Without giving away too much of the plot (not that there was much of one) about 300 pages of the book were devoted to Elle saying \\"I love, you\\" or \\"I hate you\\" and Sean replying \\"No you don't\\" or \\"Marry Sinclair\\". I actually skipped over 10- 20 pages at a time because the dialogue was so repetitive, and still the action had not moved along. The story doesn't come alive until the last two chapters, but by that point, the interest comes too little, too late.So far my favorite in the De Warenne series is \\"A Lady at Last.\\" In that book we see Brenda Joyce at her creative best. \\"The Stolen Bride\\", on the other hand, shows signs of lazy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I've loved Brenda Joyce ever since I read \\"Promise of the Rose\\" and cried my heart out... but I'm sorry to say that her latest de Warenne books, including this one, are nowhere near as captivating as her older work. After reading this book, I realized that nothing much really happened in the story... most of the middle part takes place in one room and most of the action there involves the same tired conversational exchange. I kept plodding on loyally, hoping to be struck by the same heartbreaking poignancy of her earlier stories... unfortunately, it never happened. I just finished the book a couple of days ago and I can't even remember how it ended -- it was that unmemorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOUTELY TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This, by far, is one of the worst books I have read in a very long time.The characters were not believable and annoying. The entire story line was so boring. What a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible but read for closure","review":"The good thing about dynasty books like these, is that you get background with other characters, and dialogue with the ones you like. Absolutely disliked this novel.But good to know how Eleanor became Mrs. O Neil! Will be trading in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hay?","review":"BJ took a nose dive with this one in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of the sad downslide of Johanna Lindsay. Same thing happening here. She usually has such strong, passionate writing but this novel was so redundant that I have to think she was just writing it to get it over with. Taking the easy way out. Hopefully her next books will get her old spark back. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalist, trivial and re-hashed from better books ....","review":"I've seen \\"Mr. Shaw\\" speak at s conference; I cannot describe adequately how much I held this presentation in disdain. Maybe this talk was valuable to someone who had just awaken from a 20 year coma, or in all seriousness, to the executive who doesn't have a computer on his desk and depends on a secretary to print out e-mail, because it was sensationalistic and contrived. To me, much of his material seemed completely repurposed from Evan Schwartz' work and full of lots examples why we should all \\"look out, or you'll be disintermediated\\". I'm sure this guy is off somewhere toiling on his latest book, which no doubt will get \\"5 star reviews\\" from his friends and associates, but save your money and consider Amor, Swartz, Robert Plant for insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary","review":"This book is all but 108 pages. The text and diagrams are representative of texts on computer science written in the '60s and '70s. The book also includes a loose page correcting page 13. There are better books out there for the non-technical reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool for ecommerce beginners","review":"For those of us who know nothing about ecommerce but know we need to learn, this is just the book to read first. It's in plain english - no technical jargon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old ideas and messages","review":"Mr. Shaw's book misses the mark on the issues facing companies with E-Commerce. His book lacks the depth and incite that either a novice or experienced e-commerce reader needs. Mr. Shaw addresses E-Commerce from an EDI perspective and does not provide the vision that companies need to address the technical and process issues surrounding e-commerce. He uses examples of companies that have been disected effectively by most e-commerce books and periodicals 2 years ago. He provides no additional value to these examples. The book is overpriced, lacks content - don't waste your money or time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright, overall; very shallow","review":"Read it, but only if you don't have high expectations from the start. If you know absolutely nothing about ecommerce then use it to ward off sleep during a plane flight, no more. It's the bare minimum anyone would like to know about the topic. Mr. Shaw tells one this, so no false expectations are aroused. And yes, that loose leaf correcting page 13 is a tad bit unprofessional. Graphs and tables are very unpolished."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing birthday for my gandaughter","review":"I was disappointed - the doll that was shown on the website with teeth was not the doll that I received.

It does not have the spirit of her other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Lousy Disc","review":"How could she follow up Come On, Come On? She obviously couldn't with either this one or Stones in the Road. COCO is my second favorite disc of all time behind Marc Cohn's first one. This disc has a couple decent songs, Naked to the Eye, Place in the World and ...Italy. There are far too many filler songs that don't have nearly the energy of Come On. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by ham-handed drumming","review":"I have been a fan of Carpenter's since the mid-80's, but this album is very bad. The main problem is the overwhelming basic beat laid down by the drummer, which is so annoying that it makes it impossible to pay attention anyhitng else that's going on. This has been a problem on previous MCC recordings, but not to the extent that it is here. This is the only MCC album that I've played only once and then disposed of: give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A three player...","review":"Played it three times and forgot about it. Not her best work. She is so much more talented than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this country?","review":"I came across Ms. Carpenter's \\"Down At The Twist And Shout\\" on a country assortment album and thought it was a super song. So in browsing in a music store I came across this album and bought it on the strength of \\"Twist And Shout\\". All the reviews I see on Ms. Carpenter is that she is such a great singer and songwriter. She wrote all of the songs in this album and I guess they all mean something to her but they do nothing for me. Every song seems to have the same beat and rhythm and goes on forever. I listened to the album three times to make sure I wasn't missing something, but sure enough, every song was awful. I won't play this CD again. I've been a country music fan for over 40 years but this is as foreign to me as the acid rock of the 1970's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad Album","review":"I think \\"A Place in the World\\" is a good album. But in the shadow of Carpenter's previous commercial success, its failure to catch on is disappointing. And as a follow up to \\"Stones in the Road,\\" its songs are lower in quality. But although not as great as Carpenter's other wonderful work, it is a good album in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"Once again Mary Chapin sings a great combination of songs - songs that you can't sit still through as well as hauntingly beautiful melodies reflecting on cosmic questions. The song, A Place In The World, speaks from (and to) the heart of us all. Her ability to paint wonderful images with her words continues to shine brightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Verdi a composer?","review":"This book is a nice overview of Italian politics during the life of Verdi with a subplot regarding European politics.The author spends pages describing the literary source of the operas, more pages describing the libretti and then after describing the Theater and singers intrigues, there is the most flimsy description of the music. Arias duets etc are hardly ever discussed in musical terms and details. Plot weaknesses and strengths are usually discussed. This is repeated for every opera.Poor Verdi and his music are reduced to comprimario status in this \\"Literary Opera\\".It is a pity because the author writes very lucidly. I just think he is off topic too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a rainy day","review":"I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter and 13 yr old son. My daughter loves them, while my son has only a minor interest. They go together pretty easily once you get the hang of it.

His lyrics have stories and melody is so beautiful. I've never heard such fantastic songs in my life. If you listen his songs only once, you must become his fan at once ! The ballad \\"Run Away With You\\" is my best 1. When I listen this song,I live in whole his world. Efharisto is very powerful and sexy ! Spanish guitar and his awesome vocal make a dream world.

But that's a problem I have with a lot of visual artists whose work I love - writing is not their strong suit, and when they start \\"explaining\\" what they're doing in a picture, it becomes terribly clichéd. Ward avoids this by not obviously linking her images and her words, but as I gave myself permission to enjoy the luscious artistry without having to read all of the painted text, I took much more pleasure in the book. Now I'm looking forward to going back to her previous books with this same approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja vu","review":"1.0 out of 5 stars Deja vu, October 2, 2008By Cristina - See all my reviewsI bought \\"Spilling Open\\" because it was quite different from all the things out there at the time.\\"Brave on the Rock\\" had interesting pictures.\\"Messy Thrilling life\\" has only the introduction to recommend it,that's why i bought it.Whatever i thought to find in this book,it wasn't there.It seem all the books of Ward Harrison could be in one volume,they are repetitive and show us that she has not grown as an artist.In my view,she never had potential as a writer,most of her book are quotes from other people,and i don't find inspiration in someone that seem to be dealing with the same issues over and over.Whether you are interested in art journals or looking for inspiration for your own creative journals, there better books out there.I doubt I will buy another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent read, but won't keep you up at night.","review":"This variant on the explorer-in-over-his-head/alien invasion themes was a good enough read, but did not engage me as thoroughly as a Chalker book usually does.

This movie is shocking in that it is almost ridiculous. It pulls you in and the entire movie you are waiting for that happy ending, or at least a resolution of some kind. Well, no.

Not only do they do an excellent job keeping my feet warm in the cold, but I get millions of compliments every time I wear them. I didn't buy them looking for compliments, but... that never hurts.

I liked the boots on sight, but the $25 price essentially sealed the deal for me. Since it's not winter yet, I haven't worn them outside, but I can tell they are quite warm just from trying them on -- my feet were hot! My only quibble is that the cut is a little funky and I can only get the boot on by placing it on the floor and stepping into it. There's clearly some sort of cardboard type material in the heel portion that collapses somewhat easily if you try to pull the boot on.

Weber purchased some of the assets of Ducane out of bankruptcy, but specifically refused to acquire the liabilities arising from the previous Ducane warranties. Previous purchasers or Ducane grills who paid extra for the lifetime warranty are, in legal parlance, screwed.

No other reviewer says anything of this, so I'm hopeful.8-21-12 - I have returned the defective discs and gotten a replacement. The new one has all the episodes, plus the last four doubled on both sides of the disc. As long as they are all there, then I'm fine with it (23 episodes).

This DVD really doesn't offer much, save for a few rehearsal performances of some of Chicago's music, including a delightful revamped version of \\"Another Rainy Day In New York City\\". Each band member gets interviewed; not particularly insightful. Also included is some random an ultimately useless footage of the band backstage and preparing to receive a star on the Walk of Fame (wow!). And if that isn't enough, there is some video of Chicago performing live. Sadly, this DVD could have been considerably better if the production rate was upped a few notches. Otherwise what you have here is a pretty unnecessary DVD that only the die-hard Chicago fans would get anything out of...and that's pushing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Uninformative and Poor quality","review":"Ok I'll agree, the IDEA for this project was awesome, but it should have been left up to someone who knew something about interviews and music. The interviewer/host of this was this ditsy woman who got on my nerves within the first couple minutes. The quality of the video was horrible. There was nothing professional about this DVD, anyone off the street could do just as good a job as these people if they were given the opportunity. It is true there is more than one camera used in the filming, 2 to be exact, but the 2nd camera is a CAMCORDER, and it is very obvious when they switch over to it.

BUT, why allow themselves to be filmed pretending to try to remember and \\"arrange\\" songs they've played thousands of times before, as if they were some great new material ? And why allow interviews to be released consisting of moronic questions asked by 2 of the most brainless interviewers I have ever seen, and answers of less than zero interest to anyone, unless you are a 3 year old who has never seen an instrument before...The whole thing was appalling, and my conclusion is, these guys have NO pride..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait for a True Chicago Fan","review":"This DVD is certainly aimed at hard-core Chicago fans.

A true Chicago fan will look beyond that to see, even after all these years, how hard work pays off. I like the way they ask band members about starting out as musicians; there is some educational value for young musicians in some of their responses. The concert portion of the DVD is outstanding, and I hope this great band follows this DVD up with a full length concert DVD. All you true Chicago fans out there, don't over analyze this, just enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good Project gone really bad!!","review":"I was amazed that this was even sold. This DVD offers a behind the scenes look at a great rock group, Chicago. I had great hope for this DVD but it did not deliver. First, the quality of the DVD is really poor. The people who produced this must have been working on a limited budget because they only used 1 camera and the sound was terrible. In addition, the interviews were terrible.

Obviously, Chicago doesn't need to rehearse much to play the same basic concert list of 25 year old songs. Plus, Chicago is lacking to many original members these days to be the great band they once were. What the public wants is a great Chicago DVD of an entire concert from the 1970s. Please note, Chicago has not released an album of original material since approximately 1990. If this is a video of real artists working, then what are they working on.

Uneven machining makes this look like it was made by hand using a file to shape the edges. The serrated edge would probably work since it seems sharp.

The Saw is to small to cut anything that a normal person could just snap with there hands and the blade is so dull I doubt I could cut anything with it. All the other tools are pretty useless to me as I carry a Leatherman every day. If you want a REAL multitool buy a Leatherman. The sheath this thing comes with is just some cheap plastic that will surely fall apart with any sort of use.

This album has excerps from the first season of Rowen and Martin's Laugh-In which premiered in 1968. All the familier skits are here. The usual opening intro by Dan and Dick, the cocktail party, Sock It To Me, \\"Here Comes The Judge\\", News of the past present and future as well as a poem from the flower toting Henry Gibson.

With hits like It's All Coming Back To Me Now, Because You Loved Me, All By Myself and the bonus track (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Women and international bonus tracks such as: the spanish version of 'All By Myself' and I'm Your Light. Though it also spawned other hits from Europe, that was never release here: Falling Into You, Call The Man. The overall tone of this album is love, sadness and joy. With the English adaptions of If That's What It Takes and I Don't Know, with Fly taking the spot of Vole. This is, if not one of the best albums ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why oh why was \\"Your Light\\" left off the american edition","review":"I am giving the 2 stars to the U.S. release because recently I had been to Canada and just happened to browse around in a CD store and came across Falling Into You. To my disappointment, there was an extra track on the canadian CD that wasn't on the one I bought back home in America called Your Light. It's a really good song and I don't know why it was left off the U.S. disc. Not only that, but that song was released worldwide"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This is one of Celine's best cd's! My favorite songs are \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" and \\"Falling Into You\\". I really reccommend this cd to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's only the best singer in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"First of all, I would like to say that I am a very big fan of Celine Dion. She is has undoubtedly been my favorite singer ever since \\"The Colour of my Love\\". This album is magnificent! I have had this album for over two years now and I think that his album really set the pace for all her success. She shows amazing quality and power in her voice that can't be beaten by anyone else. She definitely showcases her amazing vocal acrobatics. I think that the best song in this album is \\"Falling into you\\". In this song she really gives it her all and shows that she is not just a wannabe. If you haven't gotten any of her CDs then you are missing out in the most poweful voices of all time. Go Celine!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There can not be an album better than this one.","review":"When both of us were falling in love, Falling Into You was the best thing that happened to us, It is very close to our hearts.

I could go on and on, but the album is just Great! I LOVE IT!!!!! I highly recomend it to any one. This is definately a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIVALICIOUS!!","review":"This is by far my favorite album of Celine Dion. It really showcases her awesome talent and each song is wonderful! This album is the one that sent her to SuperStar status and showed us all that she can deliver the goods. I never tire of this cd and had to buy it a second time because I wore the first out! I love each song but a couple of my favorites are; \\"Seduces Me\\" (so passionate!) and her rendition of Tina Turner's \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" (So uplifting!). Celine and Mariah Carey were neck and neck with ruling the 90's female pop scene. Mariah sent herself in the wrong direction but Celine still reigns! She will be around for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good,But There's Better","review":"Sure,Celine Dion is a \\"powerful\\" singer,but some restraint is in order,their (she and her hubby/producer Rene's) \\"more is better\\" approach can be quite overbearing. Like their overblown wedding,but that's another story. Some consideration of simplicity and another,younger producer is in order. David Foster or Daniel Lanois,perhaps? Celine Dion,she's \\"Canadian\\" sure,but she's no Sarah Mclachlan,Margo Timmins or Lorena McKennit who really are moving,dreamy, feminine singers. A far better experience with those three."},{"rating":"1","title":"WVAT BADD! LA MISSE LE FEMME","review":"En \\"Falling Into You\\" vest zong et only. Zound ov tom-tom gts ode.

Just a couple of songs are worth paying attention and listening to. It's a shame this got a Grammy Award. Both arrangement and instrumentation for this album were not well-done but just \\"medium-rare\\", I think. In particular, I don't like most accompniments were done by using synthesizers, which must be, I believe, an easiest way to perform (and to save time and efforts). My impression from this album is that proper endeavours were not made by Celine and other people including recording engineers who made this one. To tell the truth, this album made me be afraid of buying her next albums. I really don't think that singing songs well with nice voice is not all to \\"create\\" a meaningful album.But I still am a fan of Celine. I love her beautiful and powerful voice. I just want her to be better in all elements forming music other than singing itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough of it!","review":"Celine keeps me coming back for more.

It's wonderful for any Celine Dion fan, so don't hesitate when buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great diva","review":"The tracks in this album are all great! Celine's songs touch peoples' lives all over the world. And this album really proves it. From the sensual \\"Seduces Me\\", to the fabulous \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\", and the uptempo \\"Make You Happy\\", all music buffs can find a song here that suits them. Other tracks that I really love in this album are \\"Falling Into You\\", \\"Because You Loved Me\\", \\"I Love You\\", \\"Dreaming Of You\\" and \\"All By Myself\\". The 2 Bonus tracks here are \\"To Love You More\\" (which is included on the US edition of 'Let's Talk About Love') and \\"(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman\\". There are 16 tracks in all.

The amazing over 7 minute version of \\"It's All Coming Back To Me NOW\\" has many blown away. Also \\"Fly\\" about Celine's niece Karine dying. Also, the classic, \\"Because You Loved Me.\\" Dion does her best and never stops doing it.All of the music contributed on this album holds a special place, as always in Celine's heart from \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" to \\"Fly.\\" This album won in 1996, Grammy Awards mother, \\"Album Of The Year\\" and \\"Best Pop Album.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Celine's best albums!","review":"Even if you are not a fan of Celine's, you will be after you listen to this album!

All of which fell apart within minutes of wearing them. The stones fell out of at least one earring of each pair. Seriously? Four pair of earrings and they all lost stones? I was sucked in by the low price for sterling silver and I got stuck with what I paid for. While the company was willing to refund or replace the item with no issues, I would never buy anything from this place again. I could accept one pair falling apart. Things happen. However all 4 pair falling apart doesn't say much for the quality of their items. I've bought silver from several other places with no issues in the quality department. If you choose to purchase these, I suggest you check the prongs and the stones to see if they are loose and try to crimp the prongs to retain the stones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haiku Garden","review":"Good book ... just wish it were a bit longer.

This whole CD seems like a huge parody of all that is heavy metal and never fails to make me and my friends laugh. Come on, nothing is funnier than a song bemoaning the evils of Mr. Rogers followed by another song, which uses almost every profanity in the English language! If you want something to make you laugh, do not hesitate to buy Life is Peachy. If you want a legitimate expression of angst-filled catharsis, get Sunny Day Real Estate's first album or anything by Glassjaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"mabye with a little work","review":"Life is peachy seems like it could have been a good album if Korn had devided to work on the album some more. Songs like Chi and Twist could have been good with some extra work. Low-Riders and ADIDAS are pretty funny but the album could have been alot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers, carnage and a few hits","review":"This is not Korn's best album, in fact the band even admits it. This album and band have paved the way for the rap / metal genre with their screaming lyrics, heavy guitars and unique drumming. Good God, Mr. Rogers, No Place to Hide and ADIDAS are standout songs on the disc, but to make up for them being so good, there are songs that are just plain bad. The disc starts out very primal with the singer screaming in no sort of coherent way for the first two tracks, but singer John Davis is known for that. Mr. Rogers is a song with a powerful message of how his childhood was taken by his own ignorance of the world. ADIDAS is the top hit from this album, which also has a deep message of how the singer escapes from his reality by dreaming of sex. This album even has a few covers including Ice Cube's Wicked and Low Rider. The album contains a CD Extra with a live video of Good God that is worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhhh.....","review":"yeah, they had some really cool riffs, i mean some really really really good ideas. some of the most of the creative basslines i've ever heard from this hard of a band. but lets get real, the music starts off great then they completely ruin it with cliched riffs that arent melodic. and what about the lyrics??? no offense but these are not very good lyrics. they have more swear words in one song on some of this album then i've heard on a whole album, and yeah, they use them for \\"passion\\" right? well this cd has passion, but not very creative in my mind. So all in all, i think they had some really really good ideas, and the musicianship is pretty good. but i dont appreciate the really bad lyrics and he has a great voice, why does he scream so much? anyway, thats just my opinion. All in all, great ideas, good musicians, could have done a lot better. Another reason i still gave it two stars are there are some decent, well though out, and good songs on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?","review":"It's a cd with nothing more than mindless screaming.

It's painfully bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but....","review":"It is a vary daunting task to follow up the debut that changed the face of rock for ever,but korn did there best.This album wasent really rushed ,but it was recorded in a vary short piriod of time and the result where excellent.Now this dosent match the debut.The overall feel of the album is decidedly less dark and more of an album youd listen to to get pumped,whitch really isent a bad thing.It would really suck if these guys just made carbon copies of the debut,and im happy to say thay havent made one album that sounds like another.anyways if you are a fan of korn or not this is nessasry album for anyone who is into the alternitve metal scene.And if you are new to korn,star with the debut or take a look in the mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed","review":"If it weren't for Jon having a nervous breakdown in the middle of making Peachy maybe it wouldn't have sounded so rushed. As it stands, it's short, boring, not particularly well made and with only No Place to Hide, A.D.I.D.A.S and Good God to recommend it. GET FOLLOW THE LEADER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't own the CD, but I heard most of the songs.","review":"Okay I don't own the CD, but I heard most of the songs. Twist is a nice sounding intro. Songs like Good God, Swallow, and Kill You make this a good album. I didn't really care for the Deftones in Wicked because it got so repetitive and it seemed like a rushed song anyway(And if they had the Ice Cube one, who cares). Kunt is one of the disturbing song with Davis saying nasty stuff and singing \\"I don't know what to say!\\" And Head in Lowrider sounded hilarious. Lost was a boring song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unlistenable","review":"I am a big Korn fan, but I'll be damned if this isn't a hard album to like. Sure there's a few good songs like ADIDAS and Nowhere to Hide, but most of it has nothing to keep coming back to. Every so often I'll break it out and listen to it in hopes of finding something to get my juices flowing, but alas, my time is spent in vain.

It is dark,moody,groovy,and catchy especially one of my favz A.D.I.D.A.S which is the most catchy of all. My other favz which I recommend on hearing are the rageful \\"Good God\\" the groovy \\"porno creep\\" the twistful \\"Twist\\" and the dark mood of \\"Kill You\\" which Jon davis emotions get intense. A definite buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums I ever bought","review":"I bought this in a sale and the only reason I didn't throw it away was that it completed my Korn collection. I now wish I had never bothered with Korn so much; they can only give you so much pleasure on the best of their albums. The only good song on this album is \\"A.D.I.D.A.S.\\" and even there, the arrangements get sloppy; a cover band would do well to change it to make it smoother. Otherwise, the riffs are repetitive, the lyrics are uninteresting, and the singing is worse than death metal. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just a few comments","review":"I would would describe any Korn work as stupid crappy lame diluted metal s&*t, if you want real heavy stuff check out Metallica (especially the old stuff), Megadeth, Corrosion of Conformity and other GOOD bands. Korn should learn how to play six strings because they attempt to play 7 string guitars,(leave that to Steve Vai)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Do People Disrespect This Album?","review":"Why do people consider this cd to be a dissapointment? With tracks like Mr. Rogers and Good God i just cant see it being considered one. Follow the Leader is bad and issues is HORRIBLE.

I love KoRn. I REALLY do. But this is CRAP. I can't believe all the fans who adore this album and even go as far as to call it their best work. This is by far the most juvenile peice of trash this band has made. A grand total of three songs on this album don't FORCE me to shut it off: One is \\"Porno Creep\\", which is instrumental, the others are \\"Good God\\" (which is actually a very good song... one of the two preventing a one star rating!) and \\"Kill You\\" (also pretty good... at times). This album did need to be made, I am glad they got this crap out of their system and GREW UP. If you're looking for the talented, melodic, eerie, wonderfully peiced works this band has put together... IGNORE THIS ALBUM. It never should have gone public."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated band.","review":"I use to like these guys back in highschool, I didn't know my true taste in music before and I thought anyband like korn who plays the guitar can be really talented and worthy of owning but I was wrong. This is one of the most pathetic excuse to be called real metal and these guys have no real musical talent at all, I mean head and munky's 3 cord guitar work was just flat out horrendous, sloppy distorted bass noise from fieldy, I guess davids drums were ok and jonathan davis man that guy was an atrocious singer and a complete winer who should seek therapy. All their older albums are like the same garbage for miserable teens and I don't know too much about their new stuff because I don't listen to them anymore. Im not telling anyone to stop listening to korn it's just my opinion but I hope one day you all will find much better taste in music like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not nearly as good as the first one...","review":"This is the worst cd out of the 3 Korn cd's, but that doesnt mean its bad, no, hell its a really good cd, its just not as good as the other two, and by far as good as the first one. Killer Tracks: Twist (now this is a special one), Chi, ADIDAS, Good God, Mr. Rogers. But the best track in this cd i must say is WICKED (featuring Chino Moreno from Deftones)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not FOLLOW THE LEADER but it still rocks","review":"KORn didn't do as well with this album as they did wityh FOLLOW THE LEADER.

I think this is the best out of the 3 korn albums. i recommend it to korn fans and non-korn fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This album reminds me of Take a Look in the Mirror, or is it the other way around? It sounds like they jumbled this together in about a week, and unlike Alice in Chains, who can actually make a great album in a week, this album is abysmal. Sure it has some good songs and is quite creative but the songs just don't work. A.D.I.D.A.S is a catchy tune with one of the only memorable riffs Munky and Head ever concocted. \\"Good God\\" flows well and has the classic verbal explosion in the middle of it. \\"Twist\\" is a joke, thats not music. \\"Kill You\\" Once I actually listened to this song and figured out what it was really about, I had trouble listening to it again. And then there is \\"Mr. Rogers\\".....twisted, demented, spooky.This album will put you in not a happy place, either the music will suck you in and the mood takes control, or you realize that these songs are pretty loose, unstructured and the musicians are about as skillful as Linkin park's drummer and get pissed off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kon at their best","review":"Like KoRn? can only buy one of their cds?

But despite the enticing name \\"The Clutching Hand\\" looks like a homemovie shot by people who don't know how to make a film move. I lasted through the first two chapters. The pacing is rotten, the inane laughter of the villain gets quite old in a hurry and the cameraman clearly doesn't know the difference between night and day, as so many scenes supposedly at night shift to broad daylight the moment the characters to to an exterior scene. The script or excuse for a script is inane. I gave it one star because as someone else said, for 6.98 what can you expect. This is LOW budget production. Stick with Republic, Universal or Columbia for decent B pictures with mostly excellent cliff-hangers. If they'd had credit cards in 1936, I'd think the buffoons who shot this clunker used their own credit to get the film stock.

This 15-chapter snoozefest managed to secure Kenneth Strickfaden's electrical effects and a fine array of silent-screen veterans, including the \\"ever-popular\\" Mae Busch. However, it's a shame these talents were so poorly used. Bad-movie lovers may want to track down the 70-minute feature version."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to be a fan","review":"This cliff hanger serial is for the serious viewer.

The interviews with those involved are entertaining and insightful. However, I did have some small qualms; the packaging would lead one to believe that there is a lot of Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, etc. in the film when they are only mentioned briefly and there are no live performances by those bands. This is primarily about the Charlatans, a seminal SF band, and there isn't really much footage of them in existence to show. It would have been nice to have seen them playing live in their (very short) heyday, as well as some of the other SF garage bands briefly glimpsed in the film. Still, I recommend \\"Rockin\\" to those interested in rock history/evolution. Deadheads looking for concert footage will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was stunned to see how little footage of any of the bands there was on this DVD especially after the description touted them so much.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I watched this DVD waiting to see the Dead and Quicksilver to show up and guess what?-they're not in it! To even attempt to tie this DVD to the music scene in SF is outrageous. So if you want to start a bar out in the country and get one band to play there, buy this. If you want to see the DEAD-get their DVD, if you want to see QMS-get John Cippolina's tape, JA-get their DVD, etc. But don't buy this one. I watched the SF genre develop and kept hearing about THE CHARLATANS and couldn't understand why they didn't \\"break out\\" nationally. This tells me why. They just were not good.

Despite the similarity with themes in Haunted, Collector of the Hearts pales in comparison. In fact, it seems as if Oates has ripped herself off with this collection by using almost the exact same techniques as she did in her previous collection (such as numbering certain segments and arranging the stories in three parts).Similar to Haunted, the stories in Collector of Hearts are almost entirely about family relationships that become violent with physically or sexually. However, they are far more weird and border on being science fiction.I finished the collection but it took a great deal of motivation! I found some of the tales to be terrifying, but not in a \\"spooky ghost story\\". Instead, it was terrifying in a \\"how could someone think of anything this sick and twisted\\" way. Perhaps the best word to describe this collection is disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs deeper than your average horror tale","review":"Oates' stories in \\"The Collector of Hearts\\" are billed as grotesque, but the stories are not grotesque in the usual sense. Rather, it is the sense of foreboding, of struggling to conquer childhood hurts and broken relationships, that provide the horror in these tales. These are not stories you read for a good scare, so much as to get a sense of what in our ordinary lives might be horrific. One drawback -- the characters in these stories start to look and sound alike after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Squeak","review":"Restrained and disappointing mild, this follow-up to \\"Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque\\" didn't render me numb from head to toe yet eerily entranced.

I was very disappointed in this DVD since I bought for my child who loves the ocean and wanted to learn about sea turtles and fish not how to catch and eat them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discover Planet Ocean","review":"I think the title and the way it was shown on the Video was misleading and I ended up buying a wrong product. I had heard about a new series from Discovery and BBC as a follow-on to Planet Earth and decided to purchase it on Amazon. When I received it I realized that it was from a different company and had no relation to the excellent work done by Discovery. The big capital letter name for the video is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I would not recommend this dvd set it is hard to follow due to the fact that 2 narrators are speaking at once ione in english and one in a foreign language, and it does not tell you what the animals are or why they are doing what you see them doing, for example it shows an eel shaking and instead of saying what type of eel it is and why it is shaking it just tells you that the eel is shaking, which is kind of rediculous considering we can see that all ready. I did not find this dvd to be informative at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful!","review":"The packaging of this DVD is very misleading. I assumed I was buying a series by the renowned Discovery Channel. This is a cheap knockoff. The video is horrible and the english translating is worse. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Exploitation of the Ocean","review":"There are some nice shots in this video. Which is why I didn't give it one star. But this show would have been better served if it was a seafood cooking program. After a scene of fish swimming in the reefs we see the narrator eating them. Not my kind of nature show. They do show indigenous people living off the ocean in various ways, but all in all, it's all too exploitive for my sensibility. Like I said, it's more a culinary than nature oriented series. It makes me thankful that David Attenborough doesn't eat the creatures he shows us. I'd rather see Julia Child swimming in the ocean flambéing a live turtle, than recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!","review":"Save your money! This series is terrible. The people are speaking Japanese but the narration is in English and it runs from ridiculous to ludicrous. Most of the time the narration is not even close to being synched what you are seeing on screen. The music was stolen from some bad b-rated movie in from the 1970s. If you buy it, watch it with the sound off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult read and extremely apologetic","review":"I have read many great histories and technical works concerning WW2 but I spent more time in the dictionary than I did reading this book. The first, oh say, half of the book is at times fascinating but it quickly goes down hill (or vertically declines as the author would probably put it). The entirety of the text became extremely apologetic in my view. He seems to intimate that the blame for the Pacific War rested with the \\"White peril\\" and the blockades of the poor, pitiful, Nipponese. The fact is they chose of their own free will to attack Pearl Harbor and they deserved much more than they received. Sorry but in our current political climate I am tired of Americans apologizing to the rest of the world.

Make sure you have Mr Webster close though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colonial Apologist","review":"The Nobility of Failure by Ivan Morris, now conveniently out of print, is an elegant rebuttal to most of Dowers beliefs, which seem to be based on the premise that Japans culture was reassuringly American after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blanket Liberal Generalization","review":"J.A.A. Stockwin's blurb sounds like one of The New York Times adjectival laden editorial praise's of U.S. war crimes.

Before, I thought the Japanese were very mysterious. Now I'm beginning to feel that they are pretty much like westerners. The \\"inscrutible Oriental\\" is a misconception dating to pre-WWII.My only criticism of \\"Embracing Defeat\\" is that the author is strongly pro-Japanese and anti-American. Is it true that the American occupation forces were arrogant, power-hungry, and stupid? Was McArthur inept? I would like to think that the author exaggerated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Hirohito a war criminal?","review":"Yes. But it was probably a bit much to get a definitive answer, even from John Dower's fine book. He does discuss the subject at some length. That & the war trails were my favorite parts of the book (audio).It served American foreign policy at the time to not prosecute Hirohito & leave him on the throne. It allowed Japanese to cling to a shred of pride that indeed, they did not surrender unconditionally. It made occupation much easier & assured civil peace. Actually he was a criminal but many of his ministers & generals were willing to die for their emperor. So they did. He was quite willing to let them. What a man. The Japanese hero worship of General McArthur was almost embarassing. I don't know why, but I thought of the reverence we once held for George Washington in the 18th century. The Japanese got over McArthur.The irony is the decidely undemocratic way we imposed democracy on Japan. Apparently nobody listen to the unabridged audio version as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Sociologists Beware","review":"If you liked deTocqueville, or are a professional sociologist, you will love this book.

And it has a ton of information in it, both big picture as well as a lot of detail.The one thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it does not do a good job of placing what is described in the bigger picture of Japan at that time or of the allies. It's as though McArthur and the allied occupation is there, and at times has a (sometimes very strong) influence. But the rest of the time - nothing about them. And yet, they were the most significant single force for change in the culture.The same for the overall political climate in Japan. The emperor appears occasionally as do the top politicians. And the mood of the citizens is covered at times. But a lot of the time what is happening is listed as though it occurs in a vaccuum.With all that said - it's a real good book on a topic that is interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"may not work on your Mac","review":"Very frustrating - Amazingly, this won't install on Panther (OS 10.3) - advise that you consult the Apple discussion boards befoe buying this.

This book is the answer to the countless diets that I have tried. The authors present a nurturing, compassionate compelling answer to years of an unhealthy relationship with food and my body. The quotes along the way both inspired me and made me laugh. This is the type of book that I will turn to again and again for support and guidance. After reading this book I am proud to call myself a diet survivor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great step-by-step guide","review":"I thought this was a really great step-by-step guide into the Intuitive / Attuned Eating process. It presents some great insight and information as to why dieting is truly harmful to us, as is mirrored in \\"Health at Every Size\\" by Dr. Linda Bacon, \\"Intutitive Eating\\" by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch and other IE works. My only gripe was that there seemed to be very little time spent on selecting nutritious foods. I realize that it is counterproductive to focus on nutritional guidelines or infornation in the beginning of the Intuitive Eating process, but feel that it should have been addressed near the end of the book. Overall, if you are looking to add to your understanding of Intuitive / Attuned Eating or are trying to get off the diet treadmill, this book is a really great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for emotional eaters!","review":"I bought the Diet Survivor's Handbook at a drug store when I was short of reading material on a trip. I didn't expect much--just killing time. Wow, was I surprised. This little book gave me more insight than anything I have read since The Hunger Within (Migliore). It explains why diets are a myth (95-98% long term failure rate) and how to lovingly escape from both diets and emotional eating. I have already bought 3 copies for friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"I received this book as a gift. I am a physician, and have been trained in dietetics and nutrition. Sorry, but this book just does not make sense to me. Not to mention, new products are giving us dieters the hope that a few sprinkles of fake \\"sugar\\" or \\"salt\\" cause huge loss in appetite in surveys and experiments. Why, then, fight a losing or sad battle, when a product such as SENSA and others can get you to your desired weight?These women no doubt mean well, but they are not medical doctors. They should stay focused on their training, which I believe is social work. Also, they seem to miss the real symptoms that can occur if their program is followed, such as heart disease, etc. Finally, I noticed that some of the five star reviewers are personal friends or relatives of the authors, which makes me wonder about the credibility there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality fry pan","review":"I recently bought this pan and have used it and I'm very happy with it. First, this pan is HEAVY and solidly built. The quality is excellent--for example, the rim is nicely finished and the spot welds securing the handle will last forever. The steel is very thick, at least twice the thickness of an American made Vollrath steel fry pan that I own.I fried a couple of steaks and this pan really retains the heat. You don't have to crank up the heat to cook a steak in this pan.I highly recommend this pan. The merchant packaged it carefully and it arrived very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAPER SEPARATELY","review":"The price of this boxed set needs to be lowered.

I listend to the first song and was pretty suprised after the intro of the cats screeming it was awesome so was the next 3 songs after that one then I hit \\"Full Circle\\" my favorite song of the album maybe even my favorite Aerosmith song. I then listend to the rest of the cd and found 8 other great songs like \\"Pink\\" I would have to say this is a great cd. You can listen through the whole cd and not have to skip a song its so good.

I have loved Aerosmith since the 80's, but had never bought one of their CDs for some unknown reason. I was at the store getting CDs for my husband and decided to get it. I played the thing none stop until I wore out 2 of the tracks. I'm going to have to get another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting aerosmith cd ,","review":"This one was their weakest of the 90's. The 90's saw Aerosmith release some great material and this cd has some of that on it. \\"nine lives', 'pink' and other tracks are prime aerosmith that are as good as what came before. \\"taste of india' is interesting too, but there's some songs on here that are more like 'done with mirrors' rather than 'pump'. It's not a bad cd at all though; and most of us aerosmith fans have rated this a five or four star on this site for good reason. It's a enjoyable work of songwriting mostly. There's a few misses on this one but it's far better than 'just push play'. which isn't all bad either. I have all of their cd's and some bootlegs even. So as a fan I would say that this was not a letdown for me back in 1997 , nor is it now. In fact , they need to stick out a new cd and get touring again in 2012."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Awful, murky production and a shortage of memorable songs makes this 1997 album an uneven listen at best.Songs like \\"Full Circle\\", \\"Hole In My Soul\\", and to a certain extend also \\"Falling In Love\\" and \\"Pink\\" are quite good, but the remaining eight or nine songs are forgettable at best and some of them are just awful.The ballads \\"Kiss Your Past Goodbye\\" and \\"Fallen Angels\\" are slick and clichéd, and several tracks sound like an old, scratchy LP, buried as they are in feedback, annoying sound effects, and assorted noise and distortion.Aerosmith's attempt to sound vibrant and hip fall completely flat...I don't know why they don't just settle for being Aerosmith, they used to be such a good, tough rock n' roll combo back in the 70s.Not anymore, though. No wonder that you can get a used copy of this CD for less than a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith does it a little different","review":"This album should get more credit than it has been given. Initially, I have the same impression as many other reviewers..sell outs!! This album is a tribute to commercialism and capitalism, and in my opinion does not reflect the traditional raw Aerosmith sound as heard on the other albums...however, that does mean there are not a few gems on there...\\"Kiss Your Past Goodbye\\" and \\"Full Circle\\" are killer tracks with a blues background..\\"PINK\\" puts forth a monster groove reminiscent of the energy in \\"Dude Looks Like a Lady\\"...tracks such as \\"Farm\\" and \\"Nine Live\\" prove Aerosmith haven't lost their ability to totally rock out....If you bought Nine Lives give it another try..you'll be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I have been an Aerosmith fan for years and this has to be the worst album they have recorded, this album did have a few good songs, but not Aerosmith at their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This is one of the worst rock cd that i ever listened.

This is one of the best releases yet from the band that constantly reinvents itself, without losing the distinctive style that makes them Aerosmith. Steven Tyler pours his soul into his rock-ballads \\"Hole In My Soul\\" and \\"Fallen Angels,\\" yet still remains the coolest cat on songs like \\"Falling In Love\\" and \\"The Farm.\\" The driving guitar riffs get you up, and the softer melodies bring you right back down. While maybe not as passionate as their earlier songs like \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Deuces Are Wild,\\" this new collection brings a more diverse array of music, from the rockin' \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" to the funky pop song \\"Pink.\\" Aerosmith is back with a vengeance, with a release that every true music fan should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks to aero, for their sound.","review":"how can you feel, against a 30-year band? they surely will be noted by the book of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get lyric, loved the songs..loved seeing them in concert!","review":"I loved getting the cd and listening to it and then when I saw them in concert in the following months...I loved it even more!

There are flashes in the book of the writer than Stephenson has become, but it is a typical first published novel, which is to say, showing promise, but not really very good. Stephenson himself only consented to the reprints under duress.Buy this book if you have to have all of Stephenson's work, and are still in college or at least still think you are in college. Otherwise you won't miss anything by not reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close to reality to be entirely comfortable","review":"Biting satire of university life, also very funny. I might be missing some of the point because I'm not American, but it is still an extremely good novel. All the characters are extremely odd, but not quite enough to be completely unbelievable, especially if you have ever been to any meeting of any role-playing games club anywhere! As in all Stephenson's later books, the geeky science guys are the most normal, and are also the main characters, which gives the book an interesting perspective. Especially amusing are the depictions of university bureaucracy and the mother-goddess worshipping women's group. Especially troubling are the dictatorial S S Krupp (Roman Emperor, Anyone?) and the ludicrously extreme student politicians. Far too close to reality! In short, good book, good writing, good ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I'm impressed with the agents/publishers who found Neal on the basis of this book.

It baffles me somewhat that this book could even make it to print. I feel I should bash the editor the most. There are plenty of other reviews that break down why, so I won't go into depth, but here's some words/phrases that come to mind about this book: tedious, simplistic, juvenile, virginally awkward, skeleton-in-author's-closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this book","review":"This is a pretty much uninteresting and entirely straight forward story by an author who is a genius of cyberpunk.

The Big U was better than I imagined. You do not need to be an alumni of Boston University to enjoy this book, as a previous reviewer said. If you have been to college at all you will enjoy the commentary, and evens if you have not you might really be able to get into the world created in this book. I was suprised at how this book got better as it progressed, and If you are a fan of N.S. its interesting to keep in mind that this is his first book. At first the book seems as though it will be very down to earth and \\"realistic\\" but it soon becomes as fantastic and imaginative , like one would expect from Mr. Stephenson.

At times I had trouble telling the different characters apart, but it had the \\"psychedelic trip\\" feeling of attending big state U - for those of us who did.

It's an entertaining read, rather reminiscent of Matt Ruff's Fool on the Hill, but it's not even in the same ballpark as Stephenson's later work. Fine for what it is, but for the love of god, forget about Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash, Zodiac, Diamond Age, Spew, and whatever else you can think of before you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good start for an otherwise great author.","review":"I picked up this book at the library after reading Snow Crash and Diamond Age. Even the Neal Stephenson completist should consider not buying this book. It's poorly written and was left out-of-print for so long for a good reason. I highly reccommend anything else by this author, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining First Novel","review":"It's not a masterpiece, but it's enormously fun. It's based on Boston University of the early 80's and contains several inside jokes that only someone who attended B.U. (as I did) would catch. The version of John Silber is especially funny because he didn't exaggerate him at ALL. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Boston University's high-profile President, you only need to know that he actually talked and (within reason) behaved JUST like his alter-ego in the novel.It's a goofy, funny, light, and entertaining SciFi book. A great beach read for anyone who ever lived in a dorm or any fan of silly, surreal science fiction. If you like your SciFi serious, then you should skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, light read","review":"I see a few negative reviews of this book on the page, and I really can't imagine why. Sure, this is different than anything else Stephenson has published, because it's not so sci-fi, and sure, it's his first book and his prose is not as smooth as it is in the later work, but I found this to be a highly enjoyable book. I read it on a long flight and, being a college student, I found that a lot of the crazy things that happened to the students in this book actually reflected in some way the environment that I'm in. This is a funny, farcical book, and although the plot is hard to pin down, I found myself thoroughly enjoying Stephenson's look at life in a huge university. I definately recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humor and looks back with mild shock at their life in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly a Graduate of His Own Fictional MegaUniversity","review":"Nothing is worse than a book with a promising start that gets progressively more tedious with every passing page. Stephenson's satire on college life degenerates into a miraculously idiotic tale that goes WAY over the top and becomes a blatantly violent, purposeless bloodbath. By the start of the spring semester (the second half of the book), you'll realize you're in the unsteady hands of an alleged author who smugly revels in his own imagined cleverness and who obviously needs to revisit Fiction Writing 101 at his local university. Not interesting. Not funny. Not even remotely amusing. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satirical comments in search of a story","review":"Like many people who have read this book, I came upon it after becoming a serious Neal Stephenson fan. Like many others with whom I've spoken, I was seriously disappointed with The Big U. It seemed, on the whole, to be a number of different commentaries on campus life thrown, rather than woven, together into a book that was (amazingly) hard to pick up. I read this book for the sake of completeness, and will likely judge the fervor of other fans by whether or not they've gone through the ordeal. That being said, I do not recommend this book to anyone who is anything short of a Stephenson zealot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ought to be required reading","review":"Every kid who thinks that college is all about partying (as well as every financial aid office, registrar, and administrator) should have to read this book. If you're looking for Snow Crash II or Snow Crash the Prequel, forget it. This is much closer to the present. If you've ever been screwed around with at college, or torn at your hair because frat pledges pulled the fire alarm again, or felt like a number, then read this book and read it now. Chances are, your experience wasn't quite as bad as the characters' in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange EnV","review":"So far its really nice!

However, for those of you intending to buy it - I wouldn't if I were you. The sound quality deteriorates as soon as you put even a small obstruction in the way (like, when you put inside a pocket). And in general it feels as if it's made of cheap materials and unprofessionally. I don't have any experience with other BlueTooth sets, but I was definitely disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"more junk from Motorola","review":"This headset is constantly disconnecting and actually crashing (stops working until it is powered off and back on again), and now it refuses to connect to any device at all, merely halting partway through the handshake and locking up the bluetooth stack on whatever device I try to bond it with.

But if you are a full-grown man, or if you just have medium to large-sized ears, this device will flop around on your ear, forcing you to have to hold it in place, thus defeating the hands-free purpose.I read a review a while ago that said something like, \\"This headset was so loose, that while driving I went around a curve and just the gravity from that pulled it away from my ear.\\" I though this was an exaggeration and bought it anyway because it was on sale locally.It was no exaggeration, it was the truth and I don't use this device anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"average quality - static reception - function sporadically","review":"We've bought two Motorola H350 bluetooth headsets for our Motorola V551 phones. The earclip on the headset did not fit well to the ear. It was very loose. The voice quality from the headset was not very clear. After 10 feet separation from the phone, static noise occurred. Sometimes the headset would not link to the phone. For approximately $30.00 this headset is just average in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it!","review":"I got this unit with my phone and though it looks cool, it just doesn't fit right. It constantly \\"flops\\" off the ear, making it hard to hear, and the loop behind the ear doesn't hold it tightly. I have to constantly put my hand up to press it to my ear to hear while driving. I've since gotten the Samsung WEP 200, which is TINY, fits in the ear, is very comfortable and has great sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but you have to tolerate the static and buzzing","review":"I bought this for a Samsung A870.Pros: It pairs easily, fits well on the ear, and the buttons are easy to use.Cons: Way too much noise on the recieving end. Caller hears noticable static interference often and a constant faint buzzing noise. But aside from all the noise, the caller can still make out what you said and vice versa when talking. The noise is just annoying to have to put up with, and I am sure that there are better products out there.Bottom line: I am not sure if it is just the Samsung phone I am using it with, or if this product is always this bad. I guess I am going to keep shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I purchased this at the recommendation of the Radio Shack sales clerk who was wearing it and loved it. I brought it home charged it overnight so I could use it in the morning. Now my shift starts at 5:30am and so there was really no time to test it. Needless to say after 5 hours it quit. I tried recharging it and nothing happened. So I took it back and got another one and plugged it in to charge it and it charged 10 minutes and cut out. Needless to say I will not recommended this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Accidental calls","review":"No matter where I put the headset, the extremely obvious and protruding call answer/disconnect button gets pressed for longer than a few seconds intitiating a redial to the last number called.I'm returning this headset asap before I accidentally call the wrong person and let some information leak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Mistake","review":"From the first day I received this product I regretted purchasing it because it does not have an ear bud that goes into your ear like most bluetooths. It does not fit right,is not securely in place, if I move my head to the side the whole ear piece moves and dangles there and feels as if it is going to fall off. And the most annoying thing about it is that it keeps on making some sort of beeping musical tone in my ear for no reason. The best part is when I am on a call and for no reason this tone wants to interrupt and cut the other persons conversation off. I was anxious to get this when I ordered it since I am one of those people that talk on the phone and drive alot, but instead I find myself holding my hand from flinging the damn thing out the window. This purchase has definatley been more frustrating then rewarding, I give it one star only because it actually connects to my samsung a900 and even that takes long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with my Iphone","review":"I bought this thinking I might save some money but when I got it and paired it with my iPhone I could hear the people just fine, the problem was they couldn't hear me.

When I recently needed a bluetooth headset (my first) I asked my wife how she liked it, she said it was OK, and I bought one on sale for very cheap. It paired easily to my new phone and the callers on the other side were clear to me, but the headset created a loud humming noise only audible to the people I was talking to. It made it nearly impossible for them to hear me. Here is what I disliked about it:-the speaker sits on top of your ear and even at the loudest volume, I found it very hard to hear callers on the other end when I was driving-the part that wraps around your ear was very, very uncomfortable on the back side of my ear. I found myself taking it off when I wasn't on the phone-the humming that callers could hear made it useless.

And the people on the other end couldn't hear what I was saying because of static and my speech is distorted and disrupted by static (similar to a bad reception). I then used the recording feature on my phone and spoke into my headset and counted 1 to 10. Certain numbers could get cut out and you can barely hear my voice.I contacted Motorola and worked with their tech support to reset the headset (turn it on, charge it for 3 sec with the power adapter, unplug it and its been reset). I ended up sending it back to Motorola for a product exchange since there was a 1yr warranty. I'm still waiting for the replacement...will edit upon receipt of new headset to see if it was just that one headset or the entire model is like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 20 minutes...then won't connect","review":"I bought 2 of these actually.

I have a 1st generation Motorola slvr phone. The H350 connects fine but I sometimes have trouble getting clear reception.

This is because of how Bluetooth itself works, not because of this headset.Second: Complicated button sequences come with the territory. If you want a small headset that only fits on one ear, then there is limited room for buttons. All headsets have the same general key sequences.I am pleased with this headset. The microphone is not the best out there, but you will have to pay 3-4 times as much to get only slightly better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We use this camping and it's great!

I bought the book very cheaply from a reseller, knowing that it was a few years old. I was hoping for a little port insight, because I figure that information hasn't changed much.It was not worth the $4.00 I paid. The cruise line info is almost completely out-of-date.

Of course you know Ryan can't act, but for some reason, the director is so unaware of the fact that he asks her to expose her worst traits: mugging, pretending to be sad by holding a frown for a solid 8 minutes straight and diving into every happy moment with her patented syrupy googly eyed grin.

It's Hanks and Ryan together for the first time, so the acting is incredible. It's ridiculously funny. But it's a profound movie as well. It is a serious, critical look at the American way of life, especially life in the corporate world. Beyond that, it's a look at the human spirit searching for meaning. But even if you don't notice (or care for) these levels of meaning in the movie, it's very entertaining. I don't think any other romantic comedy has such depth. This really is a good movie, and I'd say it's worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe versus the volcano","review":"I enjoy this movie and when I could not find my copy of it I purchased a new one on Amazon.

In the same vein as many other cult films, you will either \\"get it\\" or you will not. I suspect that if you enjoy this film, you are a highly romantic individual, capable of dreaming, wondering, and at the same time, not taking yourself too seriously. To put it directly, this movie is a tragicomedy about life and our attitude towards it, particularly in difficult times.Joe Versus the Volcano showcases Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as actors that have really come into their own. It is a marriage of writing and acting that is rarely seen on the silver screen. True, there are bits and pieces that are a bit rough, and a few things I would have edited out in the final take. On the whole, however, it is spectacularly rich film with scenes that you will want to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Anyone?","review":"I have loved this movie since i first saw it in theatrical release. i would love to see a DVD of this film with an audio commentary from the director.

It's a very entertaining film; it feels as if Shanley reached into his inner child to create it.Sure, the script is very implausible, uneven, and sometimes absurd. But this movie never forgets to be funny, interesting, romantic, and somewhat mysterious: qualities few recent films have offered. There are many great cameo appearances from Lloyd Bridges to Ossie Davis, and Meg Ryan is wonderful playing three different parts.This is one of the last and best lightweight comedies Tom Hanks made before he started winning Oscars and became all serious and important on us. It's a treat to be able to revisit a time when movies this fun were made."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie when I was a kid","review":"This was one my family and I rented over and over again.

When I found out they'd done another movie together, I had to see it. It wasn't what I was expecting, at all. But it was definitely original. I enjoyed the sharp contrast of Meg's various characters, and the strong drive of Joe (a downtrodden man in an exceedingly dull and gray world) to find something more in his life. The imagery in this movie is striking and weird, but I was inexplicably drawn to it. As the story progresses, their stories begin to intertwine, and ultimately come together in a quirky, nontraditional love-story-esque way. See this movie for its oddities, and for the fact that it's a must see in terms of pop culture (Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan!)

But the appearance grew on me, and the calculator itself was a joy to use. I strongly prefer RPN (reverse Polish notation mode of data entry and execution), which is the input system for this calculator. It may not have the massive memory of a graphing calculator, but there is more than enough memory for many short or \\"medium\\" length (whatever that means) programs. It comes with a constants library and you can create your own equation library. It is lightweight and for general use, more than fast enough. If you want to converge some series, maybe, it may take all night or so, but otherwise, a very pleasurable calculator to use. I reach for it more than any other one I have (and there a few in the drawer).

I use it a couple of time a week and each time I want to smash it into a million pieces or light it on fire. I understand the design resulted from a student competition. Someone find the person who designed it, wherever they are working now, if they are working, and fire them. The fact that the buttons don't follow a horizontal line interferes with your brain's ability to identify a pattern and makes the keys appear as a wildly-arranged field of keys. The numeral keys are not clearly distinguished from all the others, and scanning horizontally for the desired key is made impossible. Please, please, people at HP, abandon this design. Favor instead a design that accounts for usability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not perfect","review":"Update 2008: Don't bother with the 33S anymore.

I had to have a different calculator to take the PE exam so my company likes the HP 33s so they let me borrow one. After getting used to it for it takes a bit to get used to, I was hooked on it. I like that it is very powerful but very small calculator. Very big display and easy to see equation and you can choose RPN or Alg. Of the calculators I have used (TI-35, TI-86, TI-89, HP-48, HP-49, & Casio 15) this is my favorite. Use TI-89 or HP-49 if you are needing a graphing calc., but if you don't then this is great for an engineering student or engineer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the 32S","review":"After my 32S died, I had no choice but to purchase a 33S. Wow, what a disappointment. The things that made HP's so good had evaporated. The error free keyboard feed back, the simple, easy to read screen, the general quality feel.....All gone.For me, I make errors with this calculator >25% of the time which I did not make with my 32S. This is because the parallelagram keys induce errors from lack of input (click with no input) and they keys are too congested. I have tossed this junker and decided to get my 32S repaired.

After a month the '8' key started sticking. Another friend of mine is on his 2nd calculator because of key pad issues. The '+' died on his. He is now looking at a Casios becasue the HP customer service support blew him off when he asked for 3rd calculator. I'm still using mine, but once the '8' finally dies I'm looking elsewhere.The following is an online petition to get the 15C back into production.

Of all of the HP calculators I have owned such as the HP15C, HP41, HP42S, and HP48 I don't ever recall entering complex numbers with the imaginary part first. Polar entries are reversed as well. With the large display they couldn't even figure out how to put both quantities on a single line. HP must have had much brighter engineers 20 years ago. It doesn't make sense that they decided to reinvent the wheel. But then again I guess former HP CEO Carly Fiorina's mantra was \\"reinvent\\"!A call to techinical service to see if there was a way to invert the entry mode for a Luddite like myself resulted in a conversation with a very clueless employee of 2 months. My advise to lovers of HPs old RPN calculator is take care of the one you own. If you need a PE/FE approved calculator buy the cheap Casio FX-115 and spend a day REINVENTING your keystrokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only RPN calculator allowed when I took the PE","review":"If this hadn't been the only RPN calculator allowed, I wouldn't have purchased it. I agree with all of the other reviews regarding the horrible \\"key action.\\" In addition, in my exerience the calculator has a much short battery life than my older HPs, a general flimsey feel, and I had no confidence in the results of my calculations (due largely to the key action). I did pass the PE exam, but my lack of confidence in the calculator (even though I bought it and used it at work for 6 months before the exam) added a lot of unnecessary stress to the experience.In short, don't buy this calculator unless you absolutely can't (like me) go back to using a standard, non-RPN calculator.HP, after you get past this whole spying on the board problem, please consider re-issuing the old HP 32sII."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Capable RPN Calculator","review":"I bought a HP33s a few months ago and find it to be a fairly nice calculator. I don't have a problem with the chevron key layout. It very nicely puts x^2 as a primary function. It is clearly meant for folks who punch lots of equations rather than someone who wants to program a calculator. Not sure who would program a calculator anymore anyway now that we have Excel, Mathcad, etc. on our computers.I find many of the required processes counterintuitive at first, but the manual is very well written.The keys are too hard for my tastes and slow me down. For one large equation, I could punch it in 22 sec. with my HP48, but it took 29 sec. with the HP33s because the keys are so much harder. The key layout is better for punching equations through, so it would be screamin' fast if not for the hard keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"I recently received a 33s.

While this new offering from HP may be the first RPN machine they've introduced since the 32SII in 1991, it misses the mark in one important area: the display. Punch in 222,222.222 and it's nearly impossible to detect either the comma or (more importantly) the decimal point.I have to agree with others that this one is no match for the 32SII (which I also own). I was so excited when the 33s came out I bought two -- one for home and one for the office. After using it for only a short time I returned the second unopened. It would be a great unit if they only hadn't scrunched the digits together so closely and used more than a single small pixel for the DP.Given the bad display it doesn't even make sense to discuss the great math functions! Now having said all that, to show my loyalty I admit I'd buy another 33s if/when HP resolves the display issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP really dropped the ball on this one!","review":"This calculator works.

She repeatedly got sidetracked into dead-end (not even red-herring) plot devices. The loose ends were never explained or resolved, ie, the theft from the bank, and the characters are cardboard cutouts.

I was expecting suspense from this book, but no, not enough of that to be classified under this category. Apart from the lack of proper dose of so call suspense, a few major drawbacks I found were that the story line was loose and flat. The authoress introduced too many characters in the story that it distracted readers and could lost their focus. If this book was a borrowed book, I would have stopped reading it after the first few chapters. However, since I paid every penny for it, I tried very hard, really very hard to finish it hoping something good and grasping would turn out eventually - telling myself that the money was not badly spent.Although the book was disappointing to me, I am giving it a 2-star because I think I have to be fair in giving the authoress credit of writing so many words, and her effort behind of creating so unneccesary distracting side stories.Sorry!

I found it depressing in the extreme. Comparisons to Steven King notwithstanding, I couldn't bring myself to care about any of these characters - they were all so one-dimensional.

The book has chapters on all US Virgin Islands. And a chapter with the BVIs all together and very brief. The competition - Fodor's and Lonely Planet - have separate chapters on at least the most popular BVIs (like Virgin Gorda) and only the smaller islands in a brief chapter all together. So generally speaking for the same price you can get a guide the whole US and British Virgin Islands (LP, Fodor's) or this book which generally is a US Virgin Islands guide with excursions to the BVIs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful Overview, Not Detailed Enough to Be Useful","review":"I would not recommend this guide. I bought this book to help plan a vacation to St. John, since I could only find one book specifically about St. John. This book was far too general to be helpful. It provides an overview of all of the U.S. Virgin Islands and gives a few hotel, activity and restaurant recommendations on each island. If you know which island you are going to, this information will be far too broad to help you really plan activities. I found better advice on Trip Advisor to be honest. However, for those familiar with Frommer's guides, it is in the typical Frommer's format, which I find easy to search and navigate compared to other travel guide formats.For an excellent reference on St. John, I recommendSt. John Off The Beaten Track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference book.","review":"I alway buy both Frommers and Fodors books when I go shoot a new DVD in this case, \\"The Best Virgin Island Beaches\\" here on Amazon. Neither are perfect but together they make up for each others weakness. I like Frommers a little better because it has a good section on beaches and descriptions. Also, their maps tend to be a little more detailed.

Even though I have been to the BVI several times, this summer I am taking this new updated 5th edition for reference"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"I thought I was pretty good at picking them but man, was I off this time. It's hard to tell when you've never been to the location before but after a week on St. Thomas and St. John, I wish I would've read all these others reviews before I bought this book. I was very disappointed. There were SO MANY unacceptable errors in this book. Maps were wrong...there's an error on the St. John map that shows a road when actually it's only a walking trail. There were typos that got us lost in the city. The reviews weren't accurate at all. Places where it read \\"live carribean music nightly\\" were false. The restaurants never had a live band!Please consider purchasing another publication unless you don't mind wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the shipping charges","review":"This book is a definite non buy. We relied on it and had major issues. Some of the information was flat out wrong. As mentioned by one of the reviewers, the book implies it is easy to get around St Thomas on the bus when in reality, taxis are really the only way. We saw 4 buses in 6 days! The cabs run 8 to 12 dollars per run. Assuming you go to a different beach every day and out to dinner, you are looking at $40 a day to get around (we ended up getting a car).Also, the maps are poor. We ended up relying on a free map handed out by one of the hotels to drive around.The beach descriptions are off also. Some were no more than sandy patches.You're better off saving the $12 for your first cab ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Available Book on the Virgin Islands","review":"My wife and I just got back from our 3 1/2 week honeymoon in the Virgin Islands. We island hopped, starting in St. Croix, then moved on to St. Thomas, and wrapped things up in St. John where we spent a lot of time exploring Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke and the other British Virgin Islands.We took several books on the islands, and this was HANDS-DOWN the best. Look no further, this is the best book available on the Virgin Islands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent traveler","review":"I love reading travel guides and this one was a tough read. I have purchased Frommer's guides in the past, which I usually appreciate for their thoroughness. It felt that this was more bogged down with historical facts rather than the best ;place to find roadside tacos. Mind you, I am a historian and not opposed to learning about history. In travel guides, I am looking for something to make it easy to navigate and lay out my itinerary for the week. They divided it by islands, but didn't really explain the best way to divide up your time. I imagine most people who travel to the Virgin Islands expect to island hop. The approach was a little schizophrenic, rather than linear (which I personally prefer when I travel). This particular trip is for my honeymoon and I will probably order a different guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Summer Read","review":"Another perfect summer read! Jill Mansell mixes family shenanigans, tough issues, difficult exes and a lovely romance to get Nadia Knows Best. Perfect pacing keeps the reader engaged throughout and a wonderful mix of both lovely and irritating characters abound. This was my first Mansell and she didn't disappoint! Witty banter, family squabbles and of course an exploration of what love really is (from the 20-something Nadia and her grandmother Miriam) made this another great chick lit read.NOTE: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but Fun","review":"Briefly, Nadia Knows Best is the story of a late 20's professional gardener who is engaged to the perfect man. This is a predictable enough story line that we know that he's going to dump her, going to want her back, and she's going to be tempted by an equally perfect guy she meets while getting over Stud #1. This story works because it is predictable and because the characters are so charming. Nadia is likeable. Her family is also predictably eccentric. No surprises here, just a relaxing read. And some days that's just what I'm looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable book","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a pleasure to read. The characters were engaging, likable, and funny.

The mother is a cow of a woman and is claerly not mother of the year material. Nadia's boss and love interest, is boring.

I was expecting a detailed study of a handgun that has had an amazing history. Instead Boatman is light on hard detail and likes to stuff the book with his own bizarre editorializing and fringe political views. It is blatantly irrational stuff, scary really. Evidently Boatman styles himself a hard tough guy, but in my experience real tough guys don't need to prove it. Any goomba can squeeze a trigger, Boatman.Cooper and the Weaver crowd are openly worshipped, and any alternate schools of pistolcraft are derided. Pretty sad, given that Delta and SAS use instinctive shooting, not Weaver. I guess Boatman never got told that by anyone.Avoid this junk at all costs. I regret that I spent even one dollar on this CRAP. There are many better books out there on the 1911. I am not sure that there are any worse than this. It could have been writen in an afternoon. Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Read-BUY IT","review":"Boatman has a no BS style, you just have to know that up front. If you don't like the 1911, you will not like his style. I think that perhaps the first two reviews were made irrationally. Honestly, I enjoied Boaman's style...sure, he has his moments in the text but I felt that it was a nice way to break up the pace. One can only write so much about a (nearly) 100 year old gun and not get boring. Oh and by the way, Col. Cooper is (was) the most recognized authority on combat handgunning and after many field tests, the Weaver stance is THE defacto STANDARD...it just works. I was not disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 1911 45 auto... it's in it's second century","review":"Great book by a talented writer.

Not so Amanda Marshall. Her songs and her vocals, abetted by big label production, come out swingin' for the fence. Her voice has the flexibility to go from soulful shouting to soulful warbling. Her lyrics are just as forthright. For my taste, it's all a bit too strident, too 'out front'. I prefer the artists that hold something back, that don't tell you everything, the ones that leave some mystery that compels you to play the songs again. Marshall has more immediate appeal, but one that wears thin sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sitting on top of the world!","review":"This cd starts incredibly good with the first 5 songs. Let It Rain, Birmingham, Fall From Grace, and Dark Horse are great popsongs, but Beautifull Goodbye is defenitly the best song.

The song was \\"Beatiful Goodbye\\" the first thing that hit me was the mood and that lovely Hamond organ sound and then I heard that \\"voice\\", that built the song up to an emotional peak that still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand. I had to get the CD in the US as it was not released in Ireland and to this day that song and the whole album is one of my favorite pieces of work and demonstrates an exeptional combination of Production,Musicianship,songwriting and of couse that unforgetable voice that cuts through to the soul every time.

Amanda's got an incredible voice that fits each of her songs like a glove. None of the harshness of Alanis Morrisette, no window-breaking high notes a la Mariah Carey, and a faster pace than the slow, lazy ballads of Celine Dion. There's none of the perfection-seeking, sad voice of Jewel; Amanda is a good, down-to-earth mix of pop, rock, and blues. Amanda's voice resembles a mix of Amy Grant(low end) and Sheryl Crow (high end) but she doesn't have the occasional overproduction & odd style that spoil several of Sheryl's tracks.

I was hoping to reduce or eliminate the mechanical noise picked up on my Sony DCR-TRV 103 by using this microphone. Well, even in the 90 degree setting, the mechanical noise that my camcorder emits is still picked up. In fact it sounded as though I was hearing two sets of mechanical noise instead of one. This mic should cut out the on board mic (a stereo version already), but apparently did not. Went into my settings and tried channel 1 only, then channel 2 only, then 1 and 2. Did not make a difference. Only good thing I can say is it fit in the Sony shoe. Of course it is not made to work with the intelligent shoe and is powered by battery and plugs into the mic-in jack. Don't bother with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice little unit","review":"Pros: This mic is easy to install and easy to use. Simply slide it onto accessory shoe and plug it in. This is a stereo mic that can be switched from a 90 to 120 degree cone of focus. Nice features included are a foam wind buffer and a cloth storage bag.Con: Although plugged into the camcorder, you must turn it on/off manually. Not so bad once you have trained yourself to remember to turn it on before shooting, but before that, expect to capture some video without capturing the audio (once plugged in, the mic is the sole source of audio).Overall: greatly improved audio. I am spoiled now and will always use aux mic for camcording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't have significant improvement","review":"I thought the mic will have significant improvement on sound clarity and quality, but obviously not. Also, it is not very easy to use that it is not easy to clip on and be stable, and needing to use on/off buttons to turn the mic on is really not a good feature (it should be just automatic).

Once I called customer service and asked them to send me the right item, they informed me that they could not do that. I would have to return the items, wait for them to receive them, refund me the money and then I would have to reorder the correct item.

While they do NOT last as long as OEM, I have found that the light they put out is much more suitable for night-time driving. They are MUCH better than the \\"Sylvania SilverStar\\" bulbs, which will only last around 6 months. I've consistently gotten at least a year or so from the bulbs, and find that the more-frequent replacement is worth the improved lighting.That said, save yourself a few bucks and buy the 2-pack. It's only like $5 more, which makes the replacement much more economical.I'm giving it 4-stars, mainly because I like the light these put out.

Fast forward to now, the end of December 2010, and the bulb has already burned out.Amazon had a great price on this bulb when I bought it, but considering that it only lasted 6 months, now it doesn't seem to be such a great deal.

Luther is one of those artists who always has well written songs that he sings from the heart. This CD has something different, a song with hip-hop flava that was suprisingly nice, I Can't Wait No Longer. Not many people can re-make a song and have it get good reviews, Luther did this here with (Knocks me Off My Feet--originally done by Stevie Wonder).The title track \\"Your Secret Love\\" is a winner. Other great tracks include: I Can Make It Better, Nobody to Love, and It's Hard for me To Say.

The interface is completely different, so there will be a steep learning curve for users upgrading from previous editions. Sometimes, software developers just screw one up, and this one is such an upgrade.Pay close attention to the features you need: If you just want to print files to .pdf, you don't need all the stuff 6.0 offers. You'll never use 80% of the features they've added.After one day, I got frustrated, realized I didn't have the time to learn an entirely new piece of software so that I could simply continue to make .pdf files, and uninstalled it.Lesson learned: Check for reviews FIRST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"OK, this does have some new features, which are handy.

Tables and explanatory background make clear how the species, age, feeding habits, and such can affect the taste of your catch. The labeled pictures of actual deer hind-quarters and such was really helpful for me in knowing how to cut better to get that butcher-quality result. For instance, where is the eye of round?

It's a sad state of affairs if America is buying this garbage in as huge a quantity as it says they are. I found it to be pure fiction and without any intrinsic value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another five cent book for the yard sale, if you can get anyone to buy it","review":"One of the most forgettable and poorly written books I have ever had the misfortune to come across. Sarah Gilbert is about as witty as a third-grader, but much less personable. Her characters are two dimensional and lifeless. Her dialogue is trite. If this book was meant to be humorous, then I'm afraid the joke will be lost upon most readers. One wonders if Ms. Gilbert even knows any real women in the real world, given the sheer flatness of her female characters. I cannot urge you enough to let this stinker pass by without perusal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pagan Movie.","review":"This is a great historical movie. It shows the effect of Paganism being taken over by the patriarchy. It shows reality with the King and Royal family living in long houses, sleeping on straw and living without \\"modern\\" conveniences.The Queen and her two sisters, one a Priestess and one a healer, are portrayed as humans with human failings. All in all a great movie about this Pagan Queen and her starting the city of Prague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I looked forward to seeing this film based on the synopsis and reviewers comments. I enjoy fictionalised historical films IF they are acted well and the story flows. Sadly, neither happened in this film. It may be pretty to watch but that is all. The acting was dreadful, the script very poor and frankly the characters were one dimensional. I am sure this story could have been done really well but it wasn't. I persevered through the 95 minutes only because I had spent money on this dvd. It will be consigned to the garden to scare off the birds. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing yet envirgorating","review":"This scent reminds me of a day at the beach, complete with the little seashells in the bottle. I spray it to feel good when I am a bit stressed. Sometimes I just spray it around the house. It seems as if I am at an ocean spa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!","review":"I was searching for a more natural perfume alternative to commercial products so I thought I would try this. It smells like Endust dusting spray. I asked my husband what he thought it smelled like and he said \\"Lemon Pledge.\\"Maybe some of their other fragrances smell nice but this one literally stinks......the shells are teeny, tiny, in the bottom of the glass. The spray is clear so just looks like water.The ingredients are listed on the bottle except for last ingredients which only read \\"other essential oils\\" which concerns me because of possible allergic reactions to unknown sources.Save your money and try another product!!!!If you want ocean type smell try an air purifier ionizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a excercises but a translation of a Sutra","review":"This book refers to philosophical basis of Buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion. It is not a manual nor a guide. No Meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book. the style is simbolic and poetical. it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content. It will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does NOT FIT a 2001 VW Jetta TDI....just sayin'","review":"Don't trust the fit application for this part....now they want to charge me $5.55 to ship it back stating that it isn't their fault it doesn't fit.......GOOD GRIEF!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheap and good replacement for a non-OEM manufacturer","review":"I did my own auto transmission oil change for my 2001 Audi A6 with this filter kit. It comes with the filter, a filter gasket and the oil pan gasket. There is no instruction provided and the packing is minimum. But nevertheless, the item comes in good condition and serve the purpose. The most important part - the filter looks decent, not thick but is double ply so it should be able to do its job. The oil pan gasket is a paper gasket - kind of cheap but serves its purpose. The form and size of the filter fits my car and I have no problem changing it. In summary, I would say that it is a cheap solution to change your car's auto transmission oil and keep your car's transmission life longer. For less than $20 including shipping, it is hard to beat a FRAM.For your information, it was my first time changing the oil, thus I would say that as long as you has the Audi Servicing manual, you dont really need an instruction from FRAM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview on complexity science","review":"If you need a great overview on complexity science and the different views of complexity in organisations. For managers who are responsible for building the future, who want to learn how to deal with the need for stability and change, both at the same time. This book is clearly written, gives great insights, and not only in theory. For me as Certified Management Consultant, this is already a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its only 23 pages!!","review":"A total rip-off. The description should say that this 'book' is more like a 23 page pamphlet with fuzzy picture reproductions and short descriptions that provide little information. Not worth the shipping charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should've been in the box!","review":"This unit is perfect for charging the spare battery for my Alpha 200 DSLR while on the go. The OEM unit that comes in the box is more than twice as big, and has a long power cord too. This unit charges the battery just as fast and takes up minimal room in the camera bag. Fold away prongs are a plus, although this unit will only charge the battery, it will not power the camera body remotely. For the space savings alone it is worth the money to me, and I think it should have been what shipped in the box to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony BCTRM Compact Battery Charger","review":"Would have liked a double charger unit of similar style and would like car adapter. This unit is small and compact fitting the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little charger is a \\"must have\\" for DSC-R1 owners!","review":"Forget the \\"brick\\" and the AC cord! Just get one of these compact chargers and an extra battery and your DSC-R1 will never be out of power. I carry a charged battery in my gear bag attached to the little charger and swap and recharge as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Portable Charger","review":"I lost the original Sony battery charger, so was glad to be able to get another one to replace it. It works well and is a little smaller than the original one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the Original","review":"A big fan of both Leslie Cheung and Joey Wong, I was disappointed with the Sequel when compared to the original - The original remains a classic, while the Sequel feels like it was hastily put together to ride the success of the original. What I really didn't like about the movie was the very fake looking ghost/monster...whatever you prefer to call it - okay, even though this was back in the 80s, but I am sure they could have come up with better stuff than that. Leslie revives the role of the helpless scholar/tax collector who is neither a martial arts expert nor a monk who can rid evil to the tee, Joey plays a new character who resembles the original 'ghost', Jacky Cheung is definitely a great addition to the movie but the plot definitely lacks the momentum of the original movie. Some great comical moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first one, but still fun","review":"The second installation falls short of the high standards of eroticism and humor and is not as scary as original Chinese Ghost Story. The plot (what there is of it) is less well defined and the emphasis is more on the humor, which is a little labored. All this is not to say that the film is not fun and worth watching, merely that it is not the classic that the first one is. Good but not spectacular special effects. I think one should definately watch these films in sequence, or you'll be left out in the dark a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful film, but terrible tape quality","review":"Just a word of caution - the VHS tape of this movie is of terrible picture quality. It looks like a bad, amateurish copy made from an already very worn master tape. I once saw a movie that had been filmed off a cinema screen with a standard video camera, and the result was similar...! :-) A real pity because the film, in its original quality, is a feast for the eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the trilogy","review":"With much lower production values and a storyline that is recycled at best, and boring at its worst, I would definately stay clear of this one.Part one is gorgeous, with bright colors and fun action with a plot that entertains and intrigues. This one is like watching a saturday morning cartoon from the 80s, filled with floppy jokes and bad acting.90 minutes of my life I'll never get to have back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story continues...","review":"The story continues, but Joey Wong plays a different character. Somehow she was reincarnated and this is the main problem with the movie for me. I wanted to see Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung continue their relationship, but instead Leslie Cheung comes to the realization that she is not the ghost he fell in love with in the first movie. Joey Wong plays a mortal and she and others are trying to rescue Ku feng from being executed. The cast is a lot stronger than the first movie but the story just isn't as good.2.5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Chinese Ghost Story too many","review":"The First one is a classic, the next one was less so and the third one is pretty forgettable, although they did manage to re-introduce some level of eroticism into it. If you're really hooked on the original, go ahead and watch it just to say that you did, but don't set your expectations too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"This reads like...how to restore your health 101","review":"Millions of people would benefit from reading this book, I definitely did.

Certainly not a specialist in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, seizures, Parkinson's disease, MS, etc....and general biochemistry. If these claims could be substantiated then why would the FDA allow the American public to continue using these products at all. This is a very irresponsible attempt at labeling aspartame as the culprit of everyone's ailments. Dr. Blaylock needs to go back to school to learn basic biochemistry and tact."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Crock!","review":"Sure, Aspartame kills. Tell me another one!

I began by looking at the brief preview and just could not get passed all the misspellings. Any book worth the price should have been \\"worked\\" by the publisher to get rid of the \\"dribble\\". Apparently, whomever the editor of this book is, they did a poor (if any) job of \\"editing\\".Too bad, because the information in the book is otherwise valuable. I'm an old Catholic School boy... taught by nuns. This book reminds me of my days in Engineering School... and an old saying... \\"When I was young, I wanted to grow up to be an engineer, and now I ARE one\\"!!!Hey, \\"Doc\\", how about a rewrite WITH CORRECTIONS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For brain doctors only","review":"I found this book to be unreadable.

It says it was written for those in the medical community and those who aren't, but I disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you trying to say...","review":"Not that good. I've read a lot and just felt this book was a bad read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Excitotoxins","review":"This book contains some good and interesting information for those who are proponents of the idea some people can be seriously affected by substances in the food we eat. Although I found the book to be very well written, it is a bit academic and not what I would call an easy read. I would suggest that this book is for those interested enough in the subject to delve deeply into the science behind this theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful although narrow","review":"This book is mostly about links between MSG and Alzheimers/Parkinson's. It goes into a lot of scientific detail about prior studies, brain function, etc.Unfortunately, I was already sold onto the idea that MSG etc are bad substances, so most of the book was irrelevant to me. I was looking for ways to find foods that are MSG free. In that pursuit, only the last 2 pages of the book help: list of common names of MSG or MSG-containing substances on food labels. The book was not practically useless, therefore.While reading this book, please realize that MSG and NutraSweet are not the only problematic food additives. There are preservatives like BHT etc added to foods esp meats, and those are also suspected to have negative health effects. Yet this book does not discuss them (maybe they are not exactly neuro-exciters).Overall, could be good reading for some, but I found minimal use of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I believe every human being who cares about not ending up in a nursing home should read this book.To those uninformed or apathetic critics, I say this: People who need their cigarettes will defend smoking.

You've got to die from something, but I'd prefer to die of something less exotic..eg shot by a jealous husband. Seriously, getting off aspartame completely stopped my tinnitus and dizziness.The most interesting story is how Donald Rumsfeld (yes the same guy)pushed nutra sweet thru the FDA against all opinions within the FDA.It was approved just days after Reagan took office..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed information that doesn't \\"talk down\\" to a person.","review":"Dr. Blaylock's sincere effort to provide the Excitotoxin sensitive person with accurate and detailed scientific information on the facts of MonoSodium Glutamate (MSG)and how it works; gives shocking facts about the dangers of MSG, with a vengance. The book does not \\"talk down\\" to people as other books about allergies and sensitivities often do. His information is always on the mark and clearly written. The Maryland Chapter of NO MSG strongly recommends \\"Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills\\" to all of its members; new and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that will change your life for better, for ever.","review":"I have known for years that MSG played a factor in my health and as such have tried to avoid it. Now that I understand (with disgust) that the FDA allows MSG to be masked by any number of different names I am successfully avoiding a large amount of Excitotoxins (aka POISON) in my diet. In addition, the suggestions to help combat the effects of EXCITOTOXINS have been a life saver. I feel 100% better. For the first time in five years I had a day where I had no headache. I had almost completely forgotten what it felt like to be headache / migraine free.You have given me back my life... Thank you Dr. Russell L. Blaylock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear evidence of the dangers of MSG & Aspartame to children","review":"Blaylock writes a story of brain damage and betrayal worthy of wide attention, especially among women of child-bearing age and parents. He presents clear evidence of severe damage to the hypothalamus, the regulator of most hormone systems, when glutamates and aspartates are ingested by pregnant and nursing women or by children. The relationship between low blood sugar levels and enhanced damage should be a wakeup call for diabetics and hypoglycemics, as well. This book is a bit of a slow read at first, but you have to understand some of the basic enzyme/neuron processes to grasp the tremendous potential for damage. Every parent should read this and take it to heart. The future of our children is truly endangered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DEFINITE MUSTREAD BOOK FOR EVERYONE WHO EATS","review":"This is THE DEFINITE MUSTREAD BOOK FOR EVERYONE WHO EATSin today's world.I cannot underline enough how good this book is.Buy it now and it will change in good your world and youreatig habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone needs to read this book","review":"The contents of this book are helpful to everyone.

Know what you eat and what it is made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for valuable health information","review":"This book reveals the hidden chemicals in most of the foods we eat. If you are health conscious you need to read the book and discover how MSG and its derivatives are a big part of the average diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will change your eating habits forever","review":"After reading this book I have become VERY careful about not consuming any foods or drinks with aspartame or MSG in them. The book explains how these ingrediants contain Aspartate and Glutamate and these are the amino acids that can be used by the neurons in the brain to transmit signals to each other. If we increase these in our blood stream to a large enough amount they will cross the blood brain barrier in most people and burn out neurons. Long term over dose can lead to burning out sections of the brain that can cause seizures and alzheimers.It is a tough clinical read but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I have spent 12 years reviewing medical studies about the value of nutrition and the harm fast food/processed food companies cause to our health. I totally agree with the authors arguments both against the use of MSG, aspartame, etc. and for the use of protective nutrients such as CoQ10, magnesium, etc. You would be amazed at the levels of MSG in fast food, for example, a popular company's fried chicken has thousands of milligrams! It is sad that most people take junk once a day vitamins that provide NO PROTECTION and yet they consume large amounts of poison from fast/processed foods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"I have not finished reading this book yet, but so far the information in it is very interesting. The book is very informative about what excitotoxins actually are, how excitotoxins are added to many processed foods, and how it affects the brain and nervous system. I gave the book a four star rating only because some information about the brain and nerves is a little above my comprehension, although the author tries to explain these functions in layman terms. Other than that, this book is a real eye-opener concerning hydrolyzed protein, msg, and aspartame. I would recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"How our tastebuds can kill us","review":"While this book is quite technological & scientific in it's approach to the problem of how msg, aspartame, cysteine, hydrolized protein & aspartic acid literally rattle & stimulate the neurons in our brains to death, the lesson here is to read it anyway. While much of the scientific information was way over my head, bottom line is that in just reading & mucking through it, I was amazed at what I learned about how the food industry is KILLING us! The more I read books like this, I'm convinced of this fact. When it comes to ALL the food choices we are given on a daily basis, LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!!! THIS is why there's more movement to organic foods, vegetarian & vegan diets, exercise, simpler lifestyles, less abuse of drugs & alcohol & tobacco, less consumption of sugar & caffeine.....all in the name of better health. Excitotoxins is one more missing piece to the puzzle of life and what NOT to do to survive it, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to Professor C.S. Lewis","review":"I visited Oxford a couple of months ago and I must say that I am glad I had bought this book. I wanted to see some of the most important places in the life of CS Lewis, but that is not an easy thing to do when you've never set foot in Oxford!A Guide to the C. S. Lewis Tour in Oxford, is more than a guide, it is an experience, sometimes closer to a biography than to a map. I've learned a lot of things about Lewis thanks to it, and do not regret a single moment buying it. Do not hesitate, you'll find everything you want to see with this guide in your bag.Moreover, it is easy to use, very accurate, and written with passion. What else do you need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND","review":"This sign is attached to my backyard gate. I chose it over the standard \\"beware of dog\\" sign.

Nevertheless, I laughed and enjoyed it as I have all other books by Wodehouse. Later on I had a chance to learn this sport, and one of the reasons for my accepting this new way of relaxation and exercise was (what else?) remembering the hilarious situations that develop in the links dear P.G. takes us through. Walking along the golf course has made me appreciate even more the depth of Wodehouse's humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely suitble for home use.","review":"Purchased to replace aging 10-key for our bookeeper.

But when I put in old tapes they looked terrible but when I used another DVD/VCR combo that I have had a few years the tapes looked much better. When I used this RCA to record from the TV either to a DVD or Video tape they looked very bad so now I had to hook-up my older Combo to the TV to record from the TV onto Video tape and if I want to record to DVD I have to use the older combo to play the tape in then I can use The RCA DRC8300 to record onto DVD.

The VCR part of this combo does not work too well. The quality of VCR play back of old tapes (10/15 years) is poor. However, the same old tapes play quite well in another stand alone old RCA VCR. So I am using my old VCR to play the old tapes and using the DVD part of the combo to record it. The manual is neither well written nor well organized.

Hopefully RCA will respond to this flaw or Sony's unit doesn't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handsome indeed","review":"Moving, melodic and abrasive enough to stay out of the mainstream. Purchased this one after a friend played it for me. Just thinking about the chorus on 'thrown away' makes the hair on the nape of my neck stand up. \\"we are built upon false foundations, we are built upon misplaced expectations\\" invokes despair and hope simultaneously. If you're familiar with guitar work from Tom Capone from Quicksand's album 'slip' it will be recognized here, but with greater conviction. Similar sounds also heard on Helmet's 'aftertaste' album which, seems odd, made it's debut the same year ('97).

It is sort of fun trying out all the things that it can do but when it comes to actually playing a song it seems only 1 or 2 keys can be pressed at the same time to play a song. It seems of good quality. It is very portable and rolls away, it plays different tones and rythms, it just isn't easy to play songs unless you like to play a song with one finger just trying to play a tune. It is quiet (no motor noises) but it just isn't what I thought it would be. It would be good for a child who wanted to pick out tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"long","review":"It was a book.

Literally 3 or 4 events occurred in this book - Nothing is happening in the series since book 6.Please Mr Jordan, give us a book like books 1 - 6 and let us know how the series ends. Some suggestions... Moiraine returns from limbo where she was sent (book ?), Lan unites the north behind Rand, Perrin unites old Manetheran, Matt is the general, they all meet to fight the Trollocs, etc., and Rand and company win. Rand writes a book entitled \\"From there and back again\\" and sails off with the Seachan. The end. Please, please, finish this up versus making me read through endless details of no value to the series. The last few books have felt like reading the phone book. These books aren't cheap and you are close to loosing me."},{"rating":"1","title":":::groan:::","review":"It's official, the WOT series ground to a screeching halt in book 8. The characters kept me involved in the first seven despite the pacing, which runs slower than a bottle of Heinz Catsup. But in book 8, Jordan has lost me. The man must get paid by the word, that's the only explanation I can come up with for the level of detail he goes in to. It is completely unnecessary, especially EIGHT books in to an endless series.And I must say, from the beginning all of the comparisons to Tolkien struck me as laughable at best. It's not bad for brain candy (which we all need sometimes, right?) but is nothing particularly intellectual, insightful or meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinking about it gives me headaches","review":"After all the reviews here, my worst fears were confirmed. This series will NEVER end. Jordan has obviously lost his ability to bring a plot to conclusion. It would be MUCH more interesting for him to conlcude the conflict and then move on to backbiting subtwists that show that the story didnt actually end completely. No movement, extremely slow to change characters, it has taken him 10 books now over many years to move at best a year or so into the future.. Has it even been that long????Save your sanity... dont expect a conclusion. He's milking for a living and not actually writing for entertainment.. or any other purpose for that matter as far as I can see.I will skip to book 20 when he gets there and see if there has actually been a shocking conclusion to the series... none expected at this point. And just expect the series to get slower and slower by then...On second thought, save your money. That is what I am going to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"plotless male bashing in a fantasy environment","review":"From the dismal looks if things, it seems that WOT has lost all the characteristics that made it so memorable.The plot, always interesting and unpredictable, has degraded into a meaningless string of sparse, spontaneous, and unconnected events. The prose, once flowery and vividly realistic, is now laced with teenage-level idioms and grammatical errors, and the characters, never very realistic to begin with, have broken down into paranoid, depressed, sexually frustrated and self-aggrandizing 10-year-olds.What happened here? WOT was such a remarkable series - up to book 5 I was a die-hard fan. I know that Robers Jordan can produce a much better book that this garbage. Oh well - I guess when you have 13 volumes to fill, you can afford to make a few mistakes - about 600 pages worth of mistakes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan: Is Jordan Being Paid By the Word?","review":"I loved the first few books in this series because Jordan had a wonderful idea, but Jordan's latest volume exasperates me. I finished Path of Daggers, but it was agonizing.Good writers know when to bring closure to their epic sagas. Bad writers continue to write long books with too many characters and leaving too many questions unanswered - even in its eighth volume! Such irresponsible is not warranted.J.R.R. Tolkien and Herbert Frank represent hallmarks of the fantasy/science fiction genre. They were able to convey their epics in the time-honored three-volume trilogy. Jordan presumes that his Wheel of Time series is worthy of 8+ volumes (and his volumes are long). Sorry Jordan, WoT is not worthy.Jordan's writing reminds me of a time when writers write because they were paid by the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"am i alone?","review":"am i the only person out there who liked this book? i say read it, and if you expect every book in a series to be as action packed as the first you are being totally unrealistic -- especially if the series is ten or more books long. the whole point of writing a lengthy series like this one is to develop characters in depth, which cannot be done if someone needs to be blown up every five pages. my only complaint is the \\"disappearance\\" of a few characters (what ever happened to poor mat? ) but other than that, i was well pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Way Past Time to End This Madness","review":"How long must this Series go on? Mr. Jordan seems intent on taking what should have been a Trilogy (ok, 4 volumes at the most) and turning it into a Baker's Dozen of books.Nothing original here. It's the same old, same old, again and again. Rand almost goes mad again (surprise, surprise) but can't quite get over the top. What a shame to see an excellent premise turn into a sham by churning out meaningless book after meaningless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! How low can you go? No stars for this book if possible!","review":"Jordan has finally cured me from his serie. The first 6 books were pretty good(3 or 4 stars) but then came book 7 and this pitifull excuse for a book. This is the last WoT book I'll read. I don't care if Rand wins, I don't care where Mat is I don't even care anymore if Moiraine is still alive. Thanks RJ! I won't waste my money on your stinking books anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Path of Daggers","review":"I Have just read the 8th book in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, and I have liked it a little more then the last two. However, I don't think it should have taken us 8 books to have gotten this far. Mr. Jordan has been way to wordy. I can read everyother page and not loose any of the story line. I didn't feel this way in the begining of the series. Also, I do not feel that Mr. Jordan and Tolkien should be mentioned in the same breath. They are totally different writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is enough - Get on with It.","review":"I've been reading this series for a few years now and really enjoyed the first 5 or 6 books. However, Jordan seems to be milking this series for everthing he can get. Case and point, The Path of Daggers. The only significant event in this book was that the Aes Sedai fixed the weather. This entire book could have been contained in that one chapter. Jordan goes into so much detail about the most useless things, that I found myself skipping paragrahs with no dialogue. Afterall, how much can you possible say about a wooden bridge or a hawk. Skip the useless details please. Also, he has introduced so many characters in the last few books that's it's difficult to keep track of everything going on. I don't know if he reads these reviews or even cares what his readers think, but enough is enough Jordan. Finish this series. I know I'll never read another one of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen.","review":"When I first started reading Robert Jordan I was amazed. His story was epic and intriguing. All the way to Book 6 it built in a crescendo of power and wonder. Then came Crown of Swords. Oh my God that was such a disapointment. I felt that for sure Path Of Daggers would be better. Every author has mistakes. Unfortunately this book is awful. Pointless. Wandering around without a clue. I count myself a devoted fan but I can't absolve Mr. Jordan. I can't be that forgiving. What an awful novel. The next one I'm not buying till i've read it from the library.

However the plot and the characters could be developed much more quickly. I think that Jordan has sold out to the promise of big bucks if he keeps the story running.

There were little things that bugged me, but I considered it to be a masterpiece.A coupld of things have caused me to completely give up on this series after this book.* Detail is great and all, but please make something happen. There are very few books that I haven't finished, but I was close with this one due to the lack of real events furthuring the story.* ENOUGH with the 'Men are stupid, tug on my braids' mentality! RJ likes to infuse his charecters with the inability to understand the opposite gender. When will they learn what most mature adults learn? If I didn't know better I'd say that RJ is a feminist man-hater.I could overlook these annoyances when the rest of the story was fantastic, but that just isn't the case with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send a message - don't buy the next one","review":"Having been an avid reader of TWOT in the begining, I have given up and plan not to buy another book. The author has either run out of ideas or decided that he is just going to profit from the stupidity of the gullible population hooked of the previously good work. No new developments, no plot to speak of, boring repetetivness of phrases used in previous books, just plain cheap imitation of fantasy prose. Perhaps if no one buys the next book, it will send a strong enough message to the author - I for one hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention Robert Jordan","review":"This message is for Robert Jordan.

Zero stars for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Mat?","review":"Let me just say I don't intend to buy another volume in this series. My favourite character makes virtually no appearance in this book. Jordan seems to have written this book just to see how many suckers there are in the world. In fact, I'm getting tired of this whole series. There are too many characters to keep straight. I think he's done a masterful job of creating a world and cultures (or adapting those of Earth) but I think it's time for him to end it. I'll keep reading the books; I'm too vested in the characters by this time - but I don't recommend this series to new fantasy readers anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointing","review":"Sadly this once so promising series has deterioated into what can only be described as writing for the sake of writing (or perhaps a bigger bank account). It ranks as the single most boring - not necessarily the worst - book I've read in years.I was skimming chapters continually and still I had difficulty in actually finish the thing! His characters have all turned into one dimensional cartoons and his female portraits seems to be carbon copies of each other. Reading this series stops here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good transition book for the series","review":"This book did not seem to have as much action or non-stop reading as the other books. It seemed like it was used as sort of a go-between for The Crown of Swords and the book to come after Path of Daggers, just introducing new settings and not acting them out.I do, however, feel the last chapter was one of the best from any of the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This books takes an inovative series to new hieghts.","review":"The book opens a little after where the last one ended.

Nothing built, nothing happened, nothing new was discovered. Only a bunch of filler added, new people who are flat, with no details, lots of new names, but nothing happened. It was a waste of money and time. Skip it and wait for the next book, you'll miss nothing.

I hate to rain on your Parade Mr. Jordan, but I kinda think that is a major event. Ishamael is obviously Morindin, by the way he speaks of tha past and cyndain is Lanfear, but where is Osan'gar?How does Faile being caught by the Shaido endanger anyones soul?

But folks, its time to admit that Jordan is no longer in Tolkein's league. With Tolkein you feel every word has its place. Not so with WoT. For the fourth book in a row we slog through reams of numbingly pointless prose to pick up too few worthwhile plot developments. The characters, so fascinating in their early development, have now largely stagnated. The plot inches forward book by tedious book. At least the torpid middle volumes of the Covenant trilogies were confined to one book. Enough already. I now feel my time (and my money) are being wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Sad","review":"This book, in a pattern much like the latest few books, demonstrates why authors should be paid for content rather than word count. The plot could have been reduced to Rand losing it, people plotting against Rand, Perrin not accomlishing much and the girls have been doing NOTHING as they have been for the last 5 books. One notices a disturbing trend in his books, in which the action is drawn out longer and longer, with more and more irrevelant talks of Neyeve tugging on the braid and Elaine flittering about while the main characters , the tar'varen s if you will, are barely mentioned. Take the Eye of the World, read the Great Hunt, skip the third and fourth books, Read the End of the Fifth one, the very end of the Six one as well as chapters with Mat in it, and the very end of the seventh one. This one is not worth reading, except maybe the parts about the Seanchan.

I could hardly put the first books in the series down and found myself caught in the magic, history, humor and fun of those books. I found the process of reading this book a drudgery. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. It didn't.Here is my plan to improve this series:Gather all of the insignificant minor characters in this series (we all know who they are) and balefire them. Burn them from all our memories. The first books had 3 major plots to advance, centered on the three main characters. Let's get back to that and skip all of the page filling garbage of the last two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm getting board!","review":"I've read all 8 books and I have to say \\"I'M GETTING BOARD! \\".

I think the begining of the seires was great, but I'm starting to think he's lost his talent. I have to amit though, that I am hooked. I just wish he would hurry it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan has lost it. This is the worst of this series","review":"This series started out with a superb book Wheel of time , then the next 2 where good, then three and four were so so and then Lord of Chaos was very good, Since then the last two books seem to have lost focus. Too many charecters and too many issues and subplots. Somewhere down the line Robert Jordan has lot focus. Where is Mat Couthan in this book there is no mention of him. Rand and Perrin dont do much. Only worthwhile event is Elayne getting the Sun Throne. The Break Away Aes Sedai are delaying things too long. I think its time for Jordan to get grip on the situation and save this series from a disastrous end instead just lengthening the number of books,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sod the story, let's grab the money","review":"Damn I'm glad I didn't buy this one. I got it from the Library, and only my dogged tenacity persuaded me to do that. I was hoping we might at last get a satisfactory finish to this series, but no. Same old characters in the the same tierd patterns of behaviour. Too many names and mounds of tedious fantasy politics. So much potential, so little pay-off. I can only assume that the Book Co. have persuaded RJ to spin it out so they can cream off the mega-bucks, and that RJ is a little tierd of the whole business, and doesn't have a clue how to finish it. Maybe I'll skim Book 9 in a shop one day, and check the last page to see if there's been any movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"x-fan","review":"goes nowhere.

I wouldn't even buy the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is a greedy, cheating SOB.","review":"As anyone who has been reading this series knows, each book begins with a series of short scenes from the various camps involved in the plot of this story. Book 8(this book) ends in exactly the same way (the only one which does). The jacket of book 5(TFOH) says this series is a probable 8 book series. TPOD is the shortest book in this series. All of this tells me that book 8(TPOD) was split in half so there could be a book 9. Why not? The series is so popular, people will buy book 103 if he can keep it going that long (and with the amount of nothing that happens in this one, he may be able to). In my opinion, anyone who buys book 9 is just plain dumb. Yes, I do intend to read it(I'm as hooked as most others), but this guy(greedy Jordan) is why we have libraries. The 2 stars is for past remembrances. For those who are just beginning this series, I envy you. Right up to the point where you have to wade through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story has been lost in the detail","review":"Even though the Path of Daggers might not be a great book in and of itself, the series is still pretty good on a whole. So my 2 star rating is for this book alone.I think that Robert Jordan has got caught up in a style of writing where every plot element and sub story has to be presented to the reader in extreme detail. How huge is this cast of characters going to be before the series is over? Robert Jorden needs to focus a bit more on the primary characters.Has anyone noticed that Nynaeve's personality has now reached such extremes that she seems to be going insane! And does every women who channels have to stare at each other with \\"eyes like daggers\\" Give me a break. How often do we have to see the female characters in the this novel argue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just started to make for the second climax in the story","review":"Robert Jordan has been putting a lot of work and thought on this story. It is so detailed sometimes it gives the feeling that even he loses track of it. So it is quite normal to get lost among those names. I think he gave the gradual improvement of the personalities very well. The characters were new to the world around them and the world didnot know about them before. This caused the Pattern to be affected by them easily. Later on especially in the last two books the Pattern accepted them and they found their places in their own society. This is why things are going a bit more slowly. I don't know if Mr Jordan thought that way but I think he gives the Pattern of Life well and his characters continue to live. It is life and the Wheel weaves. Path of Daggers is a turning point for the upcoming events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience is a virtue","review":"Like most of you I was disappointed with this \\"work\\". I have spent countless hours reading this storyline only to watch the plot advancement slow to a crawl. I am also becoming confused with the overload of minor details as well as character names and roles. The series has started to test my patience, but I still have faith. Robert Jordan has provided me with MANY hours of enjoyable reading that I am truely thankful. I am not going to turn on him now and I will see this series through. Although I think that Mr. Jordan needs to realize that the patience and loyalty of his readers are not never-ending resources. Keep your fingers crossed for book 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is like your sophmore year....","review":"It's right in the middle and completely forgettable. I really enjoy this series but boy it's dragging. Nothing monumental happens here, and there is NO information on Mat ( same thing happened with Perrin in a previous installment, errrr). I had actually re-read all the books and vowed to NOT read this until the series was finished. I ordered the book and left it in it's mailing box for months, then had to take a cross country flight and took it along. My advise to anyone out there who is into the series is to wait until the NEXT book comes out then read them both at once, you add to the chances of something substantial happening to move the gang along. One question before I go - What is the DEAL with the women in this series? They are so annoying it's getting hard to care what happens to any of them (except maybe Min). I hope they actually get fleshed out and more believable going forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book to leave you wanting more","review":"that darn Jordan..

Mr. Jordan has go to learn that even a great series as his will have a threshold of time for it's readers....if we wait too long, we will move on...the Path of Daggers took two years ..if I have to wait another two years...I think I will move unto another author...No I won't...but I would like to think I could...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel taken advantage of","review":"Now that RJ has us hooked on his facinating world, he can squeeze our wallets for all they're worth. 8 books?

Calling recent offerings ponderous is kind. I am forced to take notes as I read this book in an attempt to keep track of all the characters and plots. I find the writing repetitive and dull. As others have noted, how many times can you tolerate scenes of Nynaeve pulling on her braid. I long for the writing of the early books where there were fewer story lines, faster paced plots and characters that you could like.

Robert Jordan seems to have cashed in the fact that readers who have read this far are going to keep reading no matter what. This book is about 570 pages of filler and 20 of set up for the next book.

Reading through customer comments, I have to agree with some things. I rate this book 2 stars, as he still has talent in writing, though his editors suck. But in all honesty, i think its mostly males who read his WOT books, and males like action...not reading about women doing this and that. I know its IMPORTANT to set up the plot, but it could have been done better, and only the last 80 or so pages caught my attention. As a reader of much literature, i predict the next book SHOULD be much, much better...if I am wrong, I think that is when i will stop buying his and all TOR books. Also I think RJ should listen to his readers and not take his sweet ass time writing...unless of course he is \\"all dried up\\" which is what on the surface it appears to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRRRRING!","review":"Could it be that Mr. Jordan has been taken over by Darkfriends? Who are the people he's writing about? No one in this installment of the WoT is true to character.I don't think Jordan likes women much (a hunch I've had for a while). The women in this book are always swishing their skirts or wearing silk or showing the slope of the breasts.....Who cares. Tell us what they're thinking, feeling, wanting - not what they're wearing. And I really think he hates the Aes Saidei. He isn't positive about them at all.I waited for so long to read this book. I'll get number nine from the library or second hand shop-if I care at all.Come on Mr. Jordan-you owe more to your readers than shallow pictures of the people in the story tugging on their braids or showing their ageless faces. You owe us the characters we know and love- characters who surely want the wheel to move off dead center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment","review":"I gave this book 1 star because it is a far cry from the other books in the series. The plot barely moved. The battle in the mountains was disappointing because Jordan did not place the reader in the battle. Instead, he hid the fight behind trees. The story resembled a soap opera more than anything else. Bye the way, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE PATH OF DAGGERS? That misleading title was the biggest disappointment. The time I waited for this book to come out was the biggest waste of time. Jordan should have taken more time. I would rather wait longer and get better quality. The book stunk. Pee-yew. p.s. What about Matt?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurry!","review":"I agree with most people here, book 8 did have a much slower pace than any of the previous books in this series. It is obvious to me however that this book is simply a transition and another book (hopefully to be release within the next year) will follow shortly thereafter with a nail-biting finish similar to those of the previous 7 books.

The fact that this particular book isn't as fast paced as the earlier titles doesn't detract from the depth it has added to the story overall. I'll definitely be lining up for the next edition!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging, but oh so slow...","review":"The WOT series really could have been one of the best--a true classic, if only RJ had settled on, say, six books instead of twelve. The plot started losing momentum after book four, and is REALLY slowing down now. As much as I enjoy the characters and the world RJ has created, I'm more than a little frustrated with the ever-slowing pace of the story. Not much happens in POD to push the plot along. Hooked as I am, I won't quit now, but I'm not certain I'd recommend the series to someone else at this point--at least not as wholeheartedly as I used to. Perhaps the final three books will change my mind, but nothing short of a serious abridgement will return WOT to \\"classic\\" status. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and uninteresting","review":"the first books where very good, the last few have gone downhill quickly i think mr.jordan is drawing the series out for money reasons"},{"rating":"1","title":"the wheel of time needs a little oil id say","review":"RJ seems to be quite lost as his caracters become more and more transparent as their world becomes an unending soap opera (days of our lives?) Rats, i really liked the first ones, he worked hard on them, the last ones just seem uselessly diluted. Oh, and really, please stop citing Tolkien, there are two very different categories here (MacDonalds vs a fine french dinner, id say)"},{"rating":"1","title":"How much?!","review":"I've finished reading the book, after I have waited about a year and a half, and I have been greatly disappointed. Why does keep doing that? Aren't there enough characters, plots, sub-plots and mischief for several parallel universes? I love the series, know it by heart (as any human light-loving being can) and I hope that RJ will bring us a big (obviously), finale that will leave us with wide-open eyes. I certainly hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot does not seem to be going anywhere","review":"I have read all the Wheel of Time books now and have found them entertaining reading up to number seven (Crown of Swords), However it now seems as if the series is never going to end.There are a lot of loose ends hanging around and it looks sa if it will take a further three books to tie them up.L Ron Hubbard also wrote a a ten book series (Mission Earth) and the last three where an agony to read. I hope Robert Jordan is not going to put us through the same pain.In this book we get to see the main character way to little and it seems as if he(Rand Al Thor)is stagnating. In the first few books everything happened at a fast pace now it just seems to drag along.I would love it if the author could rap this series up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrrinnnggggg......","review":"Time to wrap up the series Bob. Your main characters are getting stale and the ones you are introducing are lame. The plot is too long and again very boring. I love long stories but this is ridiculous. Lets bring it to a close huh? If I could give this no stars I would. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of the series. Drawn out & confusing.","review":"I have really enjoyed this series, but this book was disappointing. Where was Mat? Why after all this time, hasn't something definitive happened? I am ready for the conclusion of this series and thenon to the next. Too much tiny detail and not enough real action. Rand is too powerful to stumble around for all these thousands of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is WTF.","review":"I have been reading the WOT books from when they started and its been 9 years now. I still love the books and yes I will buy the next one. But I also buy trash novels because I am hooked on them. I dont want to think of the WOT as trash novels but a 2 year wait for this!!!!!! Meanwhile having to subsist on is mediocre Fallon books. What are you doing to us Robert Jordan? I am a majorly disapointed fan. Maybe a I year wait I could take, but no, you have to do less interesting books and make all of your fans wait. In closing I would like to say that this book traveled nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost, and wandering in circles.","review":"With Path of Daggers the last in the list of titles for a very long time, I thought that this would be the climax. I think the author is lost, and wandering in circles. Major disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the WORST book in the series","review":"I am a die hard Robert Jordan fan. I have purchased all of his books, including the books written under pseudonyms. What he wrote in this book could have been accomplished in 4 chapters minus all the rubbish. The story was not advanced, just cluttered. I waited for 2 years anticipating each move in the story only to be severely disappointed. I sincerely hope the next book is not a contract book and has more meat on its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the next installment will be out when?","review":"I've had a few favorite storylines in the past that led to disappointment because the author died without finishing a series of books, but this is the first time I've become worried that **I'll** die of old age before a series gets finished. As good as this series has been, each additional book seems to introduce more plot lines than it resolves, seems to cover a shorter and shorter slice of storyline time, spends more pages re-hashing old details, and uses entirely too much paper and ink in an endless character costume fashion show. Convoluted plot lines are fun to untangle, but not when you need an encyclopedia just to keep track of who's who -- for the (inevitable) next book I challenge Jordan and his publisher to include just a single line in the glossary for *every* named character who has appeared in this series. I'm just glad I borrowed the book to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much filler, not enough substance","review":"I began reading the WOT series shortly after it came out and was thoroughly hooked. Great story lines, fascinating characters, and a lot of action. Now I'm bored reading his books. The last two or three entries have done nothing but ramble. It's time for Jordan to put some substance back into this series and wrap it up. Stop milking the cash cow and get on with the final battle. Path of Daggers did absolutely nothing. Where's Mat? What the hell happened with the Seachan? All of a sudden that story line ended with some guy crying. Jordan needs to wrap this series up. For those of you writing great reviews I have to disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I've been a Jordan fan since the first Wheel of Time Book. The last book wasn't on a par with the others in the series, but the Path of Daggers is a real disappointment. Frankly, it's boring. I couldn't wait for the book to come out to find out what happens next for Rand, Eqwene and Elaine. Unfortunately, I don't think I care any more. His other books were anticipated eagerly, and read quickly. I can't finish this one. I fall asleep after a few pages. I feel cheated. This book reads as though it were written only to seduce faithful readers into spending their money. Save your money and wait for the next book. I promise you won't miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words - too little content","review":"This last installment of the WoT tale is a huge dissapointment to me. The author seems to be aimless and drifting. If the next book is not billed as the final episode, I won't waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Crap","review":"I sort of expected this after the last book, but even I couldn't believe the depths to which Jordan has fallen in this book. Utter crap doesn't begin to describe the tripe that is contained in these 900 or so pages. Out of consideration for his readers Jordan should finish off with the series before he completely decimates an initially interesting series. This last book has shown that Jordan doesn't even belong in the same universe as J.R.R. Tolkien. Even a single star is charity in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"No end of this \\" Wheel of time\\" series in a lifetime","review":"TWO YEARS of waiting for this book! Nothing really happens, the story is completely at a stand still. With this pace, it will take at least eight more books befor all loose ends are coming together. And why all these long descriptions of matters of no importance for the story,(like what the surroundings look like, what thoughts about nothing are filling somebodys head) while nothing ever happens. I do not think there ever will be an end, \\"Tarmon Gaidon\\" or not, to this once promising story. I will not buy book nine if it ever comes, if I will have to vait more than a year. And I will read the critics first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, a boring continuation of volume 7.","review":"The Path Of Daggers is definitely a continuation from volume 7, but I get the distinct impression that the storyline has become jumbled and a bit lost. It almost seems that Mr. Jordan was forced to crank out this book under some sort of deadline, making the storyline disjointed and somewhat incomplete in its furthering of the cycle. Very unlike the first 5 books, which were engaging and well-paced. I'm helplessly addicted, but that doesn't prevent my disappointment at this volume. I'd rather wait the extra time to have a more engrossing read. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABOUT TIME HE FINISHED.","review":"I like the wheel of time series but is'nt it time he wrapped it up ,the story and character's are great and imageinitive still after eight books it is geting slightly long winded.Jordan is just trying to milk money out of it, and fair juice to him but the dragon rebon [rand al'thor], should decide which he loves most or decide to live with all of them except elayne 'cause she gets up my nose but all in all; good book but long winded!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop whinning Rand Al'Thor","review":"I didn't even read this one - the last one (or two) were so drawn out that I began to loose interest. This could have been a better series if Jordon would stop stretching his character development out over several books. The Two-Rivers boys are still that, boys. Even though much time has gone by and their experiences have been diverse. What's the matter Jordon, need a new boat or something? After turning this promising series into so much puttering droll don't ever think that any but the most immature reader would again compare your writing to the likes of (any good writer).

Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan please come back","review":"Its amazing I've read everything else in the series just because of how good it is 11 times each and now I only read it 1 because I wanted to hear from matBut it seems Jordon has let money go to his head and is going to extend it on till he retires and if Jordon does this thing again with the next book as he did with PoD then I will just wait till they apear in paperback or read it in the library if they find it worthwhile to carry them......

I just hope that his next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was waiting for this?","review":"I don't mind the wait between books if it is justified. This one was not. There are some out there that say to be patient, but that is not why I fell in love with this series.

Ditto to every scathing review and I swear this book should have a warning label......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it","review":"The Path of Daggers bears no relationship to the derivation of its name and bears little resemblance to the rest of the series. Nothing is resolved, little takes place and the progress of the story, slowed already in LoC and ACoS, grinds nearly to a halt. There is a difference between crafting a good story and telling one. Jordan has crossed the line dividing the two and the series is floating rudderless at this point. Get to it, Mr. Jordan, and move things to a greater resolution. Given the disappointing finishes to numerous \\"Doorstopper\\" fantasy series (the Malloreon, Death Gate cycle, Memory-Sorrow-Thorn) the likelihood that the promise of the first 4-5 books can be reached by the end of the series decreases with each unnecessary page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Approaching the end, and who doesn't know what Mat's doing?","review":"Mat is meeting his SeanChean wife.(the daughter of the nine moons mentioned in the Shadow Rising.)

There is no action at all. It is just useless conversation, who said what... I think that I could write a better book. It looks that Robert Jordan needs money desperately so he wants to write 20-30 more books on this topic. At least, I was lucky to get a copy of this book from the library and not pay 40$ (can) for that! My final conclusion is that this book should be used in the most shameful way the paper can be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No.","review":"Go look at the reviews for the hardback.The reviews that were given *after* the book actually came out, not the hundreds of anticipatory five-star ratings. Alas, the anticipation proved in vain as far as most readers are concerned.If you must read this book, get it from the library first. If you still like it after having read it, then go ahead and buy this with our blessing. Otherwise, don't say we didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Nothing happens during the entire book. Some of the main characters hardly appear for more than a brief chapter or so. Save yourself a week's trouble and get a friend to tell you the little that happens, then wait for the next one. A MAJOR letdown after waiting several years since the last volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, but hooked..","review":"I read the first book, Eye of the World, when first released. I was hooked. I have loved every book since then... except for Path of Daggers. I waited and waited for its release and the disappointment was crushing. Where was the intrigue, the sense of mystery? Why write this filler book? My advice to Mr. Jordan is to finish the series, give up the money he makes by waiting to release a book (hoping we will convince our friends to begin the series), and salvage his place in literary history. I no longer respect the work, but as I said, I'm hooked. I'll buy the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an unbelievably bad book","review":"Let's face it, this series is dead, let's put a bullet in it. I have been a loyal Wheel of Time reader for close to 7 years now and all I can say is that it really does seem as if this author is writing just to make money now. There is no doubt in my mind that the last 2 books could have been combined as so little happens in each book. That would be bad enough but it also seems as if the characters are becoming very two dimensional. Try to figure out who I am describing, she is petty, vain and in competition with every woman in the book. That's right, you guessed it, I have described every female character in the last book. It makes me so angry that I can't write because I'm too busy putting my fists on my hips! This book is a sad testimony to money driven publishing, I feel like I wasted part of my life by reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I became a Wheel of Time junkie years ago and have eagerly awaited each new volume. Unfortunately (since vol. 6) Robert Jordan has progressively lost the edge. I will most likely read his books until the finale, but I'll wait and get it from the library. I don't feel he is earning the money like he is capable of doing. I am disapointed in the quality of his work as of late...hopefully the trend will stop with this last episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jordan is remarkable in his ability to develope plot.","review":"Although Path of Daggers was only 600 pages(I was lookink forward to a 1000),I thought it was full of intrigue and humor. Jordon's wit cracks me up! He's giving us time to realize what forces need to come together and which ta'veren is going to lead them to Rand. The only real complaint I had against the book was: NOT MIN! I want AVIENDHA to have Rand's heart. Other than that one small important detail, I hope the author doesn't make us wait two years for the next book.And I ask again,\\"when is someone going to grab these books for a movie\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teeth grindingly slow","review":"Time is compressing horribly in the most recent book. The incident with nynaeve and friends trying to escape from Ebou Dar was so detailed it made me want to scream in frustration. A great writer, but get on with it. Also the story is getting too complicated, unless all the books are reread it is impossible to keep up. Another side effect of this is that so many plots are running in parallel that many of them don't even get mentioned in a whole book. This means it could be up to 2 years before a plot resumes. Turgid and disappointing, time for Mr Jordan to relearn all he has forgotten about narrative pace. Still a fan but I'm getting shaky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointement yet again","review":"I found the Eye of the world a great but Jordan's later books don't seem to advance the plot at all! I just hope Jordan's next book will be more interesting then this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Departure into the realm of infinite drivel","review":"I once believed WoT was THE best fantasy series ever written. You actually became a part of the world that RJ created. However, with this book and the last, it has become nothing but a backwash of purple prose and mindless drivel. No plot movement(well, maybe at a SLOW snail's pace), no excitement, no AURA. That seems to be what's missing, the need to read further to see what happens to the characters we came to care about. The mystery and enchantment is gone, replaced instead by endless descriptions and repetitions of plot lines and character traits we have heard so often before. Please RJ, return this series to the form that made it impossible to put down. Resurrect the mystery and the clearly defined points of good and evil rushing toward the ultimate climax. You've developed the characters enough, now it's time for the points to meet and be resolved. I'll hang in there for book 9 but please don't disappoint again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"author must have taken a vacation on book 8","review":"I am a big fan of The Wheel of Time Series. But, was very disappointed with The Path of Daggers. All of the planning in the 7 previous volumes have gone to waste in volume 8. It seems Robert Jordan took a vacation while writing book 8. Hey Robert: Please read your first 7 books of the series and let's get back to the good stuff!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all a very good book, but didn't resolve what I'd hoped","review":"Path of Daggers was a great read and well worth the cost of a hardcover. It continues the excellent character development that a Robert Jordan fan has come to expect from his stories. The only disappointment experienced was that many of the issues that I expected that Mr. Jordan would resolve were not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"Nothing happens in this book. The plot development could have been reduced to one chapter. Jordan introduced no new conflicts, resolved no old issues, and did not developany of the characters. Becides being a good diversion, this book was a waste of Jordan's energy. He accomplished nothing and seems to be floundering. Get back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIll I live to see this finished???","review":"I've been a fan since the start - breath-taking adventure, panoramic visions of a world not our own, promises of the battle to end all battles. But I'm 25 now - and starting to doubt the likelihood of me living to the end of the series (much less actually working through all the sub-plots and figuring out who the hell killed Asmodean).Although it's a joy to read a series I know will keep me spellbound, I need some answers!!!! Path of Daggers didn't supply any. Do I seriously have to wait another 2 years to hopefully gain a few more crumbs?Please, PLEASE give me something substantial. Is Verin Black Ajah?!?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawfully boring Eurocentric uncreative mierda","review":"I decided to see what the deal was with this series. God in Heaven, it sucked. First off, don't people ever get tired about reading about fairies and dragons and witches and all these other pseudo-Teutonic fairy tales? Valiant warriors, evil magic - ridiculous. I got more of a feeling of awe and wonderment from reading the back of a box of Special K. Robert Jordan is a hack, nothing more. When he puts something in that's not completely white and English, then I'll give him some credit. I know there's no such thing as magic, but come on, can't you be just a little creative? Put down your copy of Grimm's fairy tales and think for a while. The series is awful, and reads like a novelization of Dungeons and Dragons done by a 8th-grade kid who never goes outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is terrible","review":"this is the single-most obvious attempt by an author to pad his wallet. rj has disregarded entire characters and plotlines in the pathetic effort to lump together 500 pages of worthless words. the only thing that stinks worse than this series right now is dunn"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story continues","review":"The main characters are again placed in difficult situations.They must use any available means to escape the darkness that approaches the land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't milk this series for money and ruin it any more","review":"I was truly disappointed with how incredibly boring and uninspiring this book was. This was the book I left next to the toilet in case of long sessions... I was very excited to get this book, yet it was so anti-climactic that I was disenchanted with the whole series. If the next book is this gruelling and pathetic, I will have to stop investing in Mr. Jordan's writing career. So sad to see such excellent talent wasted in what appears to be a book made to fill contractual obligations to publishers, not true inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new or imaginative and it drags to make jordan money","review":"I cant believe I anticipated reading this book. I find the Wheel of Time series, origonally to be 8 books, now stretched to 24 books, about as unfullfilling as they come. The story never takes off. Nothing left unanswered in the previous book is really answered in this one. I do not keep track of 200 different characters, not because I cannot, but because so few of their stories are interesting. I enjoyed reading about 15 minutes of this book, and I loved the series. THIS BOOK IS A BIG LET DOWN. Do I have to read a book for every country Rand takes? What a bore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressively dissappointing","review":"Like most other Jordan fans I anxiously awaited PoD, and like most I was very dissappointed. It was 500 pages of braid pulling, talking to oneself, and pondering the complexities of the opposite sex. I'd have been better served buying \\"Men are from Mars..\\". If you're into soap operas.. long drawn out pages of filler then this book is for you. It's just a shame how such once great writing could deteriorate to this completely lame excuse for a story.

However, I am somewhat disappointed with this latest offering. While I recognize that sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice some action in order to properly \\"set the stage\\" so to speak, I found the absence of virtually any resolution to any plot line disheartening. It is clear to me that the next book could be the best in the series, as Jordan has set several of the plot lines up to climax. However, I believe he should have spread out the plot resolutions better between the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"101 uses for a path of daggers","review":"Well, there are none, actually. It is ironic that Amazon's Review Guidelines forbid giving away the plot because there isn't any. I prefer watching a character develop by watching what they DO and not by listening to what they think (they will do); in particular when their thoughts centre around clothing and teenage sexual angst. The \\"females\\" have gone from irritating to galling while the males have either disappeared or remained, merely, hen-pecked. Other readers believe that all of this typing resulted in realism; however, the name of the genre is Fantasy and from that I expect the fantastic. I'm afraid that in the Path of Daggers Mr. Jordan has slain the goose that lay the golden egg.For all of those who believe the WOT is the greatest fantasy cycle of all time I have but three words -Arioch awaits thee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does not stand on its own merit.","review":"Sorry folks---the main problem with PoD is not the missing characters, the overly complicated plot or the late introduction of new themes. It is simply that this book cannot stand on its own the way the first 4-5 books of the series could. Path of Daggers continues a trend, generally down, in the quality of the entertainment. True, Mr. Goodkind can write whatever and however he pleases. The same is true of his readers and reveiwers.The final word: I am lending out my copy of Path of Daggers to anyone I know bored enough to read it. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...Now I'm depressed","review":"It all began so well, with the first book, The Eye of the World. It got better, and it climaxed somewhere between book three and four. Then it got worse. By the eighth installment (too many books!) of this series, the main character is so powerful there is hardly any adventure anymore; the peasant-boy-discovering-his-magical-abilities plot was more exciting somehow than the sorcerer-king-gone-mad.

I really like Robert Jordan's writings and I suppose I will convince myself to buy the next installment of this series. This book is so bad though, that the only explanation I can come up with is the greed of the editors and publishers to make money on this otherwise phenomenal fiction.

This series shouldn't ended long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"The sad tale of the demise of the WOT series is a great literary tradgedy. Everything seems to be moving backwards. The pace is decelerating, the focus is blurring, and the characters have evolved from complex people to cardboard cutouts with one-note personalities. What on earth has happened here?I really believe that RJ has a deep-seated dislike of women. He has made all of his female characters so immature, annoying, and controlling that it is impossible not to side with the \\"boys.\\" I think that's very deliberate. Even Min, my former favorite character, somehow lost all the personality characteristics that made her distinct from the other three (and therefore tolerable). How depressing.I'm not sure that I can stand to read any more of this drivel. I feel so ... used."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the story?","review":"If you leave out the parts where RJ is describing the hills, trees, well known characters, castles and all other unimportant or well known facts (he seems to have forgotten that we read 7 books so far, and know everything about everybody important) you end up with nothingIf you just read what's on the cover and add Min having a great sex life with Rand - you have read the book.Of course I will continue to buy the WoT books like most of the others, but I won't recommend it to any friend of mine. If you are thinking about starting now - DON'T!

PoD jumps from one event to another without much of a direction whatsoever. There was no coherence in the story (if there ever was a story).

I hope the succeeding titles are not as bad (or worse)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit to long","review":"When I say that I think the book is to long, don't get me wrong. I love Jordan's work, but he has the tendence to describe scenerys too much, especially in the later books of the serie. I think this serie is the best even better than Tolkiens, but that is a (fiver) to. I can say that I got very dissapointed when a learned that Mat, one of the main characters didn't show up, he was only mentioned once of twice and that troubles me, cause I think he is the best of them all. But please, read this one, and all the rest of the cycle, it's worth it, belive me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of a book","review":"Reading this book felt like some publishing executive took Jordan's latest work and said, \\"this is just too big for a novel, but don't condense it, add more words and we'll make two books from it.\\" When I got to the last page, it felt like I had just read the first half of a very padded book and that there should have been at least another 500 pages of storyline. The book barely keeps the overall plot ticking over and nothing of any real consequence happens other than to provide extra threads for the series to follow over the next ten or fifteen books. I would suspect that a person could read the series up to this one, skip this one and not lose their place in the story at all. All in all, a big disappointment from what is otherwise a very enjoyable series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hummm......where's the meat?....","review":"I am a devoted fantasy fan and The Wheel of Time is among my favorites. But the latest book in the series was more filler than anything else - i assume that it was only written for one of two reasons: either his publisher needed a book($) or the author doesnt know where he's going(!)...maybe i'll get the next book in the series when it's available in the library - i am very disappointed with Mr Jordan as i thought he had more integrity than that :(/ag"},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me the money!","review":"I had my suspicions after the last poorly drafted WOT book, but this pathetic storyline cinched it. Robert Jordan is in it for the money folks! This book had at least 800 pages of pure fluff. Guess how many times the leader of the knitting circle gave people a stern look and they quivered. If you guessed less than 100, you aren't even in the ballpark. These books have no drama because Jordan is extending the story with claptrap to drag out the WOT and provide additional dinero. I have two regrets: 1) I encouraged him to continue milking his fans by buying this Path of Dull Daggars; 2) This site doesn't allow a zero star review which this book deserves. I will never buy another Jordan book again. Do NOT buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"Jordan has delivered in the past.But my jaw dropped at the let down in this book. Looks like they are just trying to soak the series for extra money. Jordan began incredibly well, but really dropped the ball with Path of Daggers. It read flat and linear. I hope 9 is better, but if it took 2 years to write this, I'm not holding my breath.I actually went out and bought 2 copies of vol 1 for some friends before finishing this one. After finishing it, I wouldn't have.If the book were alone and not part of a great epic, I would have given it 1 star. So Path of Daggers gets 1 star, and an extra +1 pity star because the other books were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"I am reminded of the song, author unknown, whose title I am using as a one line summary. Definitely not worth the price nor the wait, If as I, you pester the clerks at the special order desks as I have done trying to find out when the next installment in the series is due. I expected more from an author who definitely has given what I want in past episodes; a large complex alternate reality. I hope for better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough With the Spanking Already!","review":"The flaws I hoped Jordan would improve on have gotten worse. I don't want to read the life history of every minor character who crosses the page! The heroines who kicked butt in previous novels are now being \\"put in their place\\", and is there a single character who hasn't been beaten within an inch of his or her life? The endless torture scenes are getting stale and depressing, as are the tiresome descriptions of power struggles between minor characters. No one is doing anything useful, we've learned nothing new about the world of WOT. For the first time it was a chore to finish a Robert Jordan book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This book Stunk!","review":"After book 7, I wrote a review telling everyone to lighten up, Book 7 was obviously being used to set up the ending of the story and Books 8 onward would be high paced epics like 1 through 6. Man was I wrong! Book 8 stunk, it went nowhere slowly. For those of you who haven't bought it yet, wait for the paperback or skip it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs \\"The Princess Bride\\" Treatment","review":"Here's the plan: After Robert Jordan dies someone will extract the good parts from the sea of wasted words. The result would be a 5 star 1500 page epic rather than an unreadable 4000+ page morass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Cow Dung...Ok slightly better than dung","review":"I just want to know how all the people that said aCoS was a set up for PoD can use that same line again. Both books were crap. These 2 books make you wonder why he just doesn't finish already. It's obvious that RJ has lost the edge that he and this story had. Go read Tad Williams or George R.R. Martin. The Girls find the bowl and it takes them almost the length of a whole book to use the damn thing. Every female charactor seems to be the same craby, stuck-up person. As if we didn't all ready have to many of that type of girls now we have more. Mat was totaly left out. Rand is even more of a boring monster( but at least he kills the bad guys). BUT the Bad guys he kills wont stay dead. Whats the point... You might get more plot advancement in just as many pages if you read the phone book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"It's official: I no longer care about this series. Mr. Jordan, the well has run dry, the tale has become stale...the only reason to continue this is because your legions of blind followers will buy the forthcoming books, decent story or not. And that's why you'll continue to write this worthless nonsense.The Path of Daggers features, among others things, no plot whatsoever. After trudging through the entire book, you come to the realization that nothing of note happens. Rather than deal in the main characters, a full half of the book (at the very least) is consumed in describing the minute details of every minor characters clothing. The \\"Epic\\" plot for The Wheel of Time does not move but an inch forward.I, like so many others, am now done with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"I haven't really been looking forward to reading the next book in the series since the weak ACOS, but I've finally read POD and it's extremely disappointing.The plot goes absolutely nowhere. The story switches abruptly between the various groups, with little connection between the plot threads. Absolutely nothing happens. Minor characters are described in painstaking detail -- but who cares? Men and women are described with simplistic caricatures. And there isn't a single interesting or memorable \\"moment\\" in POD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a move on!","review":"In a word, this book was frustrating. The author has too many story lines going, so progress on any of them is almost imperceptible. It is imperative that this story get more focus and start moving toward a conclusion. There were some interesting bits, but to return to the greatness of the past volumes the author will have to fold some of the story lines together into a main thrust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not he best","review":"I didn't like anything about it. It felt like I was listening to a story with to many holes. It was long time ago that I listened to this one, but it was so chopped up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What just happened?","review":"I picked up the series less than a year ago and finished book 8 a month ago and I can not even remember what of significance happened in the path of daggers. It must of been a challenge to fit a chapters worth of information through-out 100's of pages.I stand watch at night sometimes from midnight to 4 am and the book did keep me awake so it can't be all that bad it does keep you busy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring...zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"This is surely the depths of the series - it can only get better now - by way of perspective though, 50 pages of the Great Hunt had more action and told us a lot more than the whole of the Path of Daggers. A tedious and pointless exercise, Mr.Jordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Path Of Daggers.","review":"Granted,not the best book in the series,but still a good book.He's done almost nothing different in this book than he's done in his other books.I believe he has written this books beautifully,and the way he write's is smart,he leaves you hanging so you'll come back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series are getting worse and worse","review":"Read book one and two, the books after is just getting bigger without going anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Are you all going on about boring!","review":"This book advanced the plot lines away from just Rand and let us go more in detph with more of the other characters like Egwene. Not as great as the others but sets the stage for number 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a book?","review":"I don't know what this was. I suspect it was a couple of months mortgage payment for Jordan or Oliver or what ever his name is. When an author treats his audience with such contempt it means something: he hates his characters (can't say that I blame him at this point); he is sick of the series (so put a bullet in it, already) or he's been through an ugly divorce and is trying to eek out some alimony.Hmmm. Maybe all three?I see Winter's Heart is already on Amazon's best seller list. There IS one born every minute! Me -- I'm waiting for the reviews and the paperback edition. After slogging through Path of Daggers and Crown of Swords I'm not going to fall for a fool's gambit again.I notice Jordan has endorsed George RR Martin's books. Maybe he could ask for some pointers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very amusing.","review":"I stopped reading this series after the travesty that was \\"A Crown of Swords\\", and judging by most of the intelligent reviews, it was a wise decision.One thing amuses me: many people have been excusing Jordan by proclaiming that this book is a 'transitional novel', setting the stage for some grand action in the coming book. That may be, but I would like to point out one thing--if you take a good look at the customer reviews for Book 6, you will see people saying EXACTLY THE SAME THING. And if you look at the customer reviews for Book 7--again, the common wisdom ran, \\"It's a transitional novel, and Book 8 will be the BIG one!\\"Now, as I look at the reviews for Book 8, I cannot help but laugh. THREE transitional novels in a row??? Hmmmm.And one other thing--people are recommending George R.R. Martin, but they fail to mention his equal (if not superior) in crafting a fantasy epic: Tad Williams. His \\"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn\\" trilogy never misses a step. And the best part? It's finished!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"Listen folks, just because a series is great (or in my opinon, WAS great) does not mean that this particular book is great. Almost all of the reviews that gave this book 4 or 5 stars did so because they said that the series is great. Then they go on making excuses for this book.Be honest! This book was not well written. No need for excuses. No need to focus on the overall series. Hopefully future books will be better (although I have my doubts). But that is no reason to rate this particular book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"The only reason that this novel merits two stars instead of one is because of its association with the first five books in this series. The Eye of the World through The Fires of Heaven were phenomenal! The problem is that after that everything went to hell. The plot simply imploded upon itself! Mr. Jordan should go to the Vatican and beg absolution for the enormous sin that was the last three books! After that he should put out a press release telling his fans that those books were just jokes and that he's going to release the real ones any day now. I've discussed this with my friends and we're still not convinced that Mr. Jordan is dead and fearing a loss of revenue Tor has hired a ghostwriter to keep churning the series out. By the quality of the drivel turned out I'm assuming it's Terry Goodkind..."},{"rating":"1","title":"read only if you want to grind your teeth in frustration","review":"interesting sections from the crown of swords to the crossroads of twilight, meaningful to the orginal story, can be contained in one single book! the rest is all about hair tugging, description of clothes, anotomy etc. robert jordan is probably dead - the publishers are milking it for all it is worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless boring story","review":"I found that in his eighth book, Jordan was totally losing his storyline with useless chatter and very, very boring long segments that add nothing to the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just very, very dissapointed","review":"I have been reading this \\"epic\\" since 1990 and have loved it. This book is by far the worst of the series. There are too many new characters being introduced, and none of them have an easily discernable name like Mary of Frank. It is impossible to keep them all straight. I have two pieces of advice for Mr. Jordan 1- Stop introducing 15 new characters in each chapter. Instead, why not use the novel approach of DEVELOPING THE CHARACTERS THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. Matt, Perrin, Fain, Loial. These are great characters! USE THEM!!! 2-As has been stated ad naseum-GET ON WITH THE DAMN STORY. Hell, I wouldn't mind 5 more books if they moved the story along. The tripe that you are publishing now is, or at least should be, an embarrasment for both you and TOR.I LOVED this series as much as anyone, but I will not buy another book until it has been favorably reviewed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Rating","review":"My pet Guppie, could have written a more lively story. I was waiting for Mat, I was waiting for Rand to Kill Mazrim. Shoot I was waiting for the week to end, this whole book took place in about a week. And so many tangents, a College Geometry teacher would get lost in about two point seven seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Comic Book Would Be Better.","review":"I agree with all of the brief critisms that I've read about this book. However, I too am hopelessly enthralled with discovering how this epic series might end. It is a fun story. A wild fantasy ride. It is not good literature. The characters are poorly developed, and the plot has colapsed under the weight of its own magnitude. I am beginning to worry that Jordan cannot possibly end the series with a decent amount of closure. But we wait for the next installment, like addicts for a high. \\"Tune in next year, when Rand continues to begin to go insane, and everyone else takes another step forward.\\" I'll be the first person in line to buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the originals","review":"I have read the Wheel of Time series through Book 8. I have enjoyed the story even though it has gotten bogged down and I find it somewhat troublesome that Mr. Jordan has borrowed so liberally from other works of fantasy, most notably Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Herbert's Dune, and Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. The parallels between Jordan's characters and those of the other named authors are too close for comfort--Aes Sedai and Bene Gesserit, Ents and Ogiers and reluctant but determined and dedicated messiahs. Frankly, Tolkien, Herbert and Donaldson have done it better without losing sight of where the tale was going. It's time for Mr. Jordan to get to the point and complete his saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm getting tired","review":"Part of me wishes that I discovered this series when all the books were out or at least an end was in sight (if any of us live that long). Don't get me wrong, I love Jordan's work and would recommend TWOT series to anyone (as long as they have a good memory for all the characters and different adventures, situations, and especially travelling that they do, and a large store of patience for a tale that at least I see no end in sight). While POD contains its fair share of incredibly interesting and exciting events none of them gets resolved (it just keeps going and going). My biggest complaint is that once a secondary villian is defeated let him stay gone, especially when you have so many. I don't look forward to reading another 700 pages, so that a baddie that was beaten earlier can be killed again. I would like closure to some of the minor plot lines and characters at least. I'm hooked like many others, so I'll keep reading and so should you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I read 5 1/2 books then I got kinda bored with the plot slowing down so I took a 2 year break. Now I read the 7th and 8th books I did notice not much is happening. I hope something happens soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"This is an installment only a hardcore WoT fan could love. Some other reviewers have talked about world-building and how it takes time and imagination to make a believable fantasy world, but eight books and counting is getting ridiculous. One more like this and I am going to quit this series(Really!) and re-read The Lord of the Rings to remember what a real fantasy series is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book really let me down!","review":"After so long a wait I was really expecting something much better from Jordan. It seems to be a few short stories combined together. And the lack of Mat in this book is horrible since one of the first things that happens can be directly related to him... I hope that the next book doesn't focus almost entirely on him because of this. Though I believe his story may well be 10 times better then tPOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book in the series. This book does not stand up.","review":"I was very disapointed with this book. After waiting years, nothing hapens in this book. It jsut drags along. Everyone just teleporting from one place to another, and getting no where. Rand dosent apear untill chapter 13, and then has mabey 4 chapters, Perrin has about 2, and Matt none. Nothing hapens to move the story along at all. There were a few good scenes in the book I will admit.If you love this series like I do, you have to read this book, then you have to wait with much longing to book 9. If you are new to this series, start at book one. The firest 5-6 books are wonderfull, take your time and enjoy them like I did. Then join me in the wait for the next book that hopefully will be what we were waiting for. Path of Daggers should have taken about 4-5 chapters to tell.Jordan is still then man, and I beleave he will make it up to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of words, but nothing happened","review":"Fans of the series could skip this book and never know the difference, because the trend established by the last couple of books in the series continues... A lot of pointless chatter and very little action. Elayne and Nynaeve chatter mindlessly for most of their portions in the book (which seemed to be half the book). Perrin wanders aimlessly and accomplishes nothing. Rand worries about going mad and talks to Lews Therin some more. Mat is hardly mentioned and never appears. Egwene hassles with the Hall some more. I just hope Robert Jordan isn't milking the series. At least the end of the book contains some action and provides a good setup for book nine. Unless you must have the hardcover edition, wait for the paperback. Or just read the last chapter or two; they contain the only bits of any consequence in the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can it get any slower???????","review":"After I was disappointed from the Wheel of Time book(7) this was just a dagger tords my Intrest.I Show no mercy!.!."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book stands only by support of the whole.","review":"Of course Robert hasn't lost his touch. Of course the series is the greatest ever. But \\"halting\\" is a very good way to describe this book. I can't help but feel that Robert should have waited until he could build some sort of resolution before publishing The Path of Daggers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real page turner! I had to skip a lot just to stay awake!","review":"The only reason this book rates two stars is that it came into print at all, and I was beginning to doubt it would. Good writing and some interesting scenes but major sections of story going nowhere. If you just want to pretend you are really in this make-believe place, fine. But if you want to READ a good story, more progress please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad.","review":"I notice that many reviewers have high hopes for book 9. After reading the slow-and-going-nowhere plot of book 7, I too had high hopes for book 8, thinking Crown of Swords would lead to something great here. I was very wrong then, as this book was worse than the previous one, so I won't be entirely surprised if book 9 will be even more terrible. I'm not even sure if I will read it. At least I have the earlier books to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm getting too old for this...","review":"...and so is Robert Jordan. I hope he dosen't expire of EXTREEM old age before finishing this series. If you look at this well written book carefully, nothing really new happened. My predictions for the next book: Elayne has trouble controlling Nynaeve and dosen't want to hurt Aviendha's feelings. Nynaeve moons over Lan and loses her temper with everybody else. Egwene continues to have trouble convincing everyone that she is the REAL Amyrlin Seat. Perrin searches for Faile without success. Faile learns humility. Rand fights himself and someone else to a draw. And Mat, Mat? Who's he??? I think that telling this story is going to take longer than the original events took. Please, Mr.Jordan, surprise us and give us some meaningful advances in the storyline. Tie up some of the loose ends, hopefully in less than two years!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan passes on his chance to be mentioned with Tolkien . .","review":"I understand that Robert Jordan has been offered a large amount of money to write each book. If so, this explains why the series is really going nowhere fast. I thought that the first and second books really put him in a position to be mentioned at the same time as JRR Tolkien -- a true master of the fantasy genre. Obviously, that is no longer the case. Whether from greed or a severe lack of creativity, Jordan has lost his touch. There are some good chapters, but overall this book is a serious disappointment. Lots of words, little resolution. At this rate, he'll be writing this series for another decade. If you must read it, don't buy it -- borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another huge letdown...","review":"I was anxiously awaiting this book, as I had been doing for the previous two. Another letdown, I must say. I actually purchased the hardcover version of this novel in anticipation of the forthcoming events. In retrospect, I can't remember one significant thing that happened in the book, as far as the major plotlines go. DO NOT purchase this book...take it out of the library or something....it was a complete waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment from a great series fizzling out","review":"If the first books from the Wheel of Time could be visualized as an epic 70mm movie, this last offering is like a TV weekly episode. Poor on plot, character development and new ideas it is carrying through the same tired theme never ending one branch before sprouting two others. Hundreds of new names to digest with little involvement in the plot, whatever of that remains. Pity to see such great series being dragged on for the sake of continuing the exploitation of the loyal fans. I myself have taken this series one book too far. It ends here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time-out for the Wheel of Time","review":"I waited two years for this! If this is where Jordan is going, it's time to end this series.

Wrap it up Robert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan lost in the world of his own making","review":"With the first five books of this series Jordan created a rich and intriguing world with engaging and unique characters, so much so that many i know who've read them would stay up for nights in a row to find out what happens next. Gradually through the next two, and now in the last book it is very clear he is lost in this world. So lost that nothing really happened at all. In addition it feels like he wrote only half a book...where is the rest??? I can only hope that in the next book, he finds his place again.

I bought all 8 books and lost 2 months of my life. It was a fantastic and wonderful journey until book # 8. It just stood still. Robert was trying to weave to complex a weave and the \\"Gateway\\" just did not materialise. Rand should send him to the Wise Ones.He has such a rich story to tell, but Robert's style failed badly here. What he needs, and we should demand, is a collaboration with Tom Clancy to deliver the remaining books. Even the Aes Sedai nees to link to accomplish great things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a hamster in the Wheel of Time ...","review":"The 8th in this monumental series seemed like a 591 page stalling tactic. The characters had little growth, and the plot lines moved forward too slowly. Favorite characters (i.e. Mat, the Ogiers) were ignored, as was the history and culture of his world. Instead it was the petty politics that got the attention. A shame. Maybe in book 9..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already! Please get this series over with!","review":"I started reading this series when I was in my mid-thirties and I was engrossed in the early volumes. However, it seems that I will die of old age before Mr. Jordan will see fit to put this thing to rest! I can understand writer's block, Mr. Jordan, but please quit writing this series if you can't submit any better writing than you exhibited in the last two or three books. I would recommend that anyone interested in reading this series to wait until the paperback has been released; don't spend your cash on a hard cover book in the series unless the writing improves."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"Jordan wasted my time and his on this stale, boring, verbose sleeping pill. I know it has to be difficult to sustain the quality and satisfy the fans desire for more, but this book was low on quality and failed to advance the plot at all. Like most of the reviewers I was disappointed that Jordan spent so much time on the women while ignoring Matt completely. I really wish he would stop the endless explanations and rehashings of the past books. Make new readers start at the begininng. I know Nyv has a temper. I know the Wise Ones are tough. I know about the feeling of saidin. Finally, it is ridiculous to belive that no one would recognize Elayne's mother. With all that royalty and Aes Sedi running around surely somebody would know her. I beg Jordan to get back on track. I will not be preordering the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"REAL AVERAGE RATING","review":"WAIT!!!The rating for this book is all wrong since 200 fools gave it 5 stars before the book was even released. The real rating is about 2 stars and only because of his previous great work. Buy this book used (mine is available for $5) but don't support this terrible turn of the series!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait or the money","review":"Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series begins wonderfully with the same feeling of legend that one gets from reading Tolkien or watching Star Wars. The eight book in this series however, only continues a downhill trend that began after book four. Jordan's caracters have become increasingly and frustratingly flat and undynamic. Rand especially has gone from a confused but very human young man on an adventure to a bitter and completely static caracter. And the same holds true for the rest of the cast. Perrin and Mat have become shockingly immature in their inability to recognize or feel adult emotions. And the women have all become singleminded in their respective tasks. What Jordan needs to do to revive this epic is to show us some kindness, bravery, and love in his angry, duty bound plot, and to start answering the myriad of questions that have been raised and left hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only bought it because I've got the first seven","review":"What in the world of time has happened? Most of the time I'll read a book in a couple days (most of the first seven books I read in one or two sittings), but I've been struggling through this one for almost a week and I'm only halfway through. Why, may I ask, do we have to wade through 240 some odd pages of no movement whatsoever in the plot until we finally get to see Rand? And where is a little action? Dialogue? Hopping around to see what ALL the characters are doing? I have to say that if the next book (which I guess we'll see sometime next century) is like this one, I may have to wait until it goes on the clearance rack before I buy it. Unfortunately, I'm hooked, and this series will eternally have space on my bookshelf. I'm disappointed, but I shall persevere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel of Time takes a vacation","review":"First off, I have absolutely loved the first seven book of WOT. Secondly, Book Eight is a disgrace to the previous seven.The eternal struggle between good and evil seems to be on vacation. The plot lines have hardly been advanced and the climatic scences that have closed the previuos books was sorely missing. Mat is competely missing from this book, which is a shame. It felt like this book was meant as a placeholder, setting up all of the storylines to continue in book nine. I felt robbed that I waited 2.5 years for this. I am hoping that Book 9 picks up where book seven left off. For the first time in this series, I won't re-read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Worthless.How can people call his series an \\"epic\\"????Just worthless.Stop milking the public, Jordan, and stop killing trees.

But will this stop anyone from buying the next book? Not a chance!

Jordan uses this technique to differentiate different story lines within the same chapter, so it gets a bit confusing at times. Interferes with the flow of the story. Minor formatting issue, I know. Still worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"RJ seems to be spinning his wheels","review":"It kinda seems as if RJ ran out of lunchmeat but decided to make a few sandiwiches anyway. I really enjoyed books 5 and 6, but I thought that aCoS was basically filler. Little did I know... I feel that if George R. R. Martin had gotten his second book out remotely on time that RJ would have already been dethroned as the King of SF fantasy. As it stands, I'm still hooked on Jordan's books, but one would have to admit that \\"A game of Thrones\\" was a LOT better than either of Jordan's last two efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Padan Fain when you need him?","review":"Each book in WoT is progessing toward unfathomable chaos. What started as a straightforward excercise in character and high fantasy has spiralled into a literary version of Rand's madness. All form and no content.And what's up with that prologue?Those who rate PoD \\"5 stars\\" are practicing conscious dellusion. A refusal to recognize that Jordan cannot even master the beast he has created. The only way of paring this \\"plot\\" down is to kill-off the characters, which, thankfully, PoD begins to do.Time to resurrect Moraine, remove approx. 95% of all characters, and let the core cast--Rand, Mat, Perrin, Moraine, Lan, Nynaeve, Egwene, Min, Aviendha, and Elayne (any more...?)--determine the fate of this age. I'd recommend Padan Fain for mass-assassination duty. And throw Bela into the fire for good measure. And all those epithets ad nauseum."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only want action... go watch Armageddon","review":"On the other hand, if you are interested in the characters and the evolution of one of the most involved worlds ever put on paper then devour this book.Yes, the book is slower than the last couple but is essential. Remember the majority of characters in WoT are kids on the verge of adulthood. RJ is maturing them, just as he is the world around them. What we are reading is perhaps one of the most 'realistic' fantasy tales ever written, where characters along with their fears, hopes and guilt are addressed instead of put in the too hard basket and hidden in cataclysmical action."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other seven were a little better, but Jordan still rocks","review":"There's a lot of stuff going on in this one, perhaps the author could have pulled it together a little bit more, but after the wait I'm definately not one to complain. Keep of the good work Mr. Jordan and I'll be the first to pick up book # 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even potentially good authors sometimes sell out","review":"Jordan's latest opus has proudly joined the ranks of the X-Files, Twin Peaks, David Eddings, Frank Herbert's Dune series, and others who inevitably milk something beyond it's worth. Any structure of a story from the beginning has be callously cast aside while character development has become both contrived and erratic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Jordan's Best But Still Good Fantasy","review":"I will admit that POD is not as good of a book as RJ's earlier works, but it still is much better than a lot of other generic fantasy on bookshelfs these days. The major weakness in the book lies in the multitude of female characters who all channel and all have a severe additude. How many female characters need to have the \\"if looks could kill\\" stare. On the same note, too many of the Asha'man have a super-arrogent brat attitude. Although the first half of the book drags, the last 200 pages held my attention very well. I thought that the conflict with the Seanchan army in Altara was well narrarated. Overall, POD might not meet expectations, but it still is a decent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete balderdash!","review":"Having followed the series as a faithful fan for past nine years I want to find the TOR editors and hang them high and dry. I cannot believe that Robert Jordan would on his own publish such a pile of crock that it can only be described as a very ugly attempt to coax more money out of the dedicated fan troops. Shame on them for publishing some 600 pages of a prologue to the next book. If there were a money back satisfaction guarantee on books, this is the one I would send back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Dollars","review":"This book is obviously an deadline pleaser for Mr. Jordans publishers. This is the most boring book that I have ever read. What happenned to the action. This great series has turned into a ridiculous soap opera with too many minor characters that are useless, Jordan probably has to refer to a list to remember them. The series should have ended 2 books ago. If you must read this please get it from the Library or wait until it is on the clearance rack. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book and, as noted, necessary","review":"While this isn't the best in the series, as others have noted it is necessary to keep the timeline moving and the complex storylines tied together. I also recommend some other books-- a series that is developing to be something very interesting is Robert Doherty's Area 51 books. The next one is due out soon and I'm looking forward to it. Also Stegier's Alien Rapture is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A barrage of names, unimportant charactors, pathetic.","review":"I once enjoyed this series, when it had a decent pace, before it lost its direction. It was never a fast paced series, and was usually to descriptive with to little action. But this book has take these attributes to a new level. Jordan tries to introduce way to many new irrelavant charactors, expecting the reader to keep up. I could bash this book for hours but it's not worth my time. This book sucks and I won't buy another. But after reading 10000 pages I must see the end. Thank GOD for the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is RJ GRR Martin?","review":"If you compare the styles, they a VERY similar to RJ's first few books, fast paced, page turners. Could Jordan (everyone knows that is not his real name)actually be writing a parallel series? It could also explain why he takes so damn long to come out with each successive book in WofT and maybe even taking some of his reader's criticisms and improving on his writing in this \\"new\\" world. Its just fun speculation,....or is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't he get a move on?!?!?!?!","review":"An apparent attempt to stretch what could have been an exciting and enthralling 4 book series across 8 books (and more to come). Release the parking brake and floor that accelerator Mr Jordan, your fans are losing (have lost) patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read George R.R. Martin Instead.","review":"I decided to read the Path of Daggers after coming straight away from George Martin's smashing Clash of Kings. And as I read, I kept wishing I could read Martin's next book instead. Robert, you've run out of steam! Maybe you should reread A Game of Thrones so you can remember what good fiction is. If I have to read one more paragraph about Nynaeve tugging on her braid or threatening to box someone's ears, I'll throw up! Get on with it, already!For those who want a fast-paced, well-written series that _will end_ in six books, read George R.R. Martin. His Game of Thrones will astound you. In the meantime, Robert, I think it's time to vacate the throne. You're just keeping the chair warm for George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone could write junk like this.","review":"TEotW was the best fantasy book ever, yet PoD is the worst WoT book to date. How can this be! Mr. Jordan you have established over 1,000 characters now--but half do nothing more than play with themselves. Give us action, fighting, war. We don't want tel-a-something dream land mumbo jumbo.Do you really need to talk about sa/normal angreal in every book.? Who is who, why can't you tell us. You don't even tell us who is dead or alive. We have a right to KNOW. No other author hides his characters ID from his readers. No one has a clue as to what Verin is all about and its madning."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for the input, guys!","review":"I have not bought the book yet. Thanks to you guys, I probably saved over $15 not buying the hardcover. I was thinking, since Mr. Jordan is not trying to finish this story, maybe we should. Here are some thoughts I have so far... 1. The guy that calls himself Taim right now, is most likely Demandred in disguse. Remember Bashere did not recognize him when he first present himeself to Rand? The real Dragon inside Rand's head screams murder everytime Taim is near. 2. As with male and female halves of the Source, I think evil is also divided in the similar fashion. The evil in Shadar Logoth is probably the female half. 3. I think the real importance of the character Min is that she will be the one who puzzles out the key to the final victory. She has the note from Herid Fel.Let me know what you guys think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer and utter disappointment","review":"I remember one critic calling Jordan the next Tolkien. What a joke. The Wheel of Time started off with so much promise...what happened? All I know is that absolutely nothing happened in this book! The only way I'll pick up Book 9 is if Robert Jordan posts a letter of apology to fans on the Internet. It's the least that he could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending seems cut off.","review":"All of you old time Robert Jordan readers, you pick up the eighth installment of his Wheel Of Time series and take it home to read. The imagery is spectacular and the details exquisit. The middle builds in pace and then nothing. It was decidedly a cliff hanger unlike any of his previous books. It seems like the book should have been longer and then was sliced in half. No resolution and no satisfaction. I hope the ninth is much better, but hey we are already hooked so what can you do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The entire book was one HUGE cliff hanger.","review":"I say if you haven't started RJ's series don't start until he's finished, maybe another 6 years. When I read the cover of the book, I thought that the problems on that cover would be resolved. I could've only read the cover and known as much as I know now. That's so disappointing. What I don't understand is, if you're going to take 2 years to write a book then why give us a filler? I would rather have waited another two for the quality I'm used to from his books. They are addictive, but like a drug, after the first bad experience you wonder if you should continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"No action, only character interaction","review":"Total disappointment! 1. No review of the story so far (I am not a WOT fanatic, so don't remember the details of the plot, had to skim through COS before starting this one). 2. Too many characters with similar names and the reader expected to know everything about all of them. 3. Almost 80% of the text is devoted to what each of these characters says to or thinks about the others. 4. No direction to the plot. 5. No sense of anticipation (in my opinion an essential ingredient). 6. No conclusion or feeling of achievement. 7. In short, NOTHING HAPPENS!Sorry, Mr. Jordan, but you have let us down. After so long a wait, we deserve more. Sure I would have bought the book even had I read these reviews earlier, but that is a measure of our need to see a conclusion to this saga and not an endorsement of your own plans to milk it to the maximum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Eight WOT stands for Waste Of Time","review":"Jeez, what a tedious, overly complex, well you get the idea. We could expect one book of a series to lose momentum but two in a row is not acceptable. Some one else can suffer through the next two years in the making disaster, it will not be me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, needs a bit more to the plot tho","review":"I liked the book, the book heats up a little in the second half, but the book is really justr a transition between ACoS and the book Following APoD. Robert Jordan and Tor would have been better off to release the two in close unison (but I am glad I don't have to wait the extra year or more for that to happen). Can't wait for the next book (another long wait....man...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Painful","review":"We are just holding on for the end now. Not quite ready to write off the series, however we will be able to wait for the softcover next time, even at an estimated 4 year wait--the pain of reading this volume and tracking all the subsidiary characters will be remembered for some time, although the plot won't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan must be dead","review":"I have finally figured it out.Jordan died after Fires of Heaven. Yep. That has to be it. He died and Tor got Goodkind, Rawn or some other plodding fantasy writer to finish up the series. Only it was such a cash cow that they won't finish it. It will just go on and on and on until there are no more trees left on the planet.Or maybe a computer is writing it. You know, one programmed to write sentences like \\"Rand would know what to do, he understands women.\\" or \\"Egwene smoothed her skirt.\\" or \\"Elayne hugged Avendha and realized that she loved her like a sister.\\" Or endless descriptions of the weather and where the characters slept and what they ate and Nynaeve's PMS.But Jordan is dead. Has to be.Hey -- the best thing about the last couple of books are the reviews on Amazon. They are GREAT. Witty, fun, succinct, clever. Everything the series is not. Worth reading. 5 stars for the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?, Great Good God Why?","review":"why is so much time, even at the tail end, of this series spent on insignificant subplots at the expense of the main characters? when was the last time we had a decent chapter on Rand, Mat, or Perrin? What ever happened to Perrin's Axe/Hammer thing or Mat's scamp nature conflicting with the general's instincts in his hand? Why have the stupid broken White tower plots taken 4 books, why have they been marching for so very long with no other change? Why are have the forsaken become so far removed from the plot that Jordan had to just disjointedly throw them all in durring the last chapters to abruptly reveal to the reader exactly who they have been hiding as? What happened to The White Lions or Gawain? Everything from 6 on has been drivel that ruined the character focused plot developed in the first 6 books. I just hope there is a swift end to these painful sagas, that way my time in the library reading them will be satisfying at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the rest of them!","review":"While the consensus seems to be that this volume of Robert Jordan's epic is not as good as the others, I disagree. There are some unforgettable moments in this novel. The novel does have the feel of a prologue for the next book, but it did not deter, for me at least, from the greatness of this epic series. This is a landmark series, and seeing how this one wraps up is going to be a lot of fun.Don't keep yourself from this volume of the series because of some sarcastic, unrealistic reviews from other readers. It's better than most other fantasy out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll go crazy before Rand does if this pace keeps up!","review":"After two years of waiting, this book is a big disappointment. The parts that further the plot towards Rand's final conflict are few & lost among a huge amount of detail that have me worrying that I will die of old age before Rand ever gets there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"much ado about nothing","review":"Jordan's epic saga has ground to a halt. This installment featured the character development of bit players to the exclusion of everything else - certainly to the exclusion of moving the plot along. Instead of focussing on the protagonists we've come to know from previous books, we got page after page of meaningless characters we'll forget about tomorrow.To make matters worse, the dead aren't really dead. In an attempt to bring back some of the Forsaken Rand killed off in the earlier books, the Dark One is now reanimating them and giving them different names. Sheesh. What's next? Moiranne rises from the grave in book 29, titled \\"I doubt we'll see the end of this series in your lifetime.\\"Seriously, Jordan risks the entire series by meandering about aimlessly. And, at $28 for the hardcover, I think I'll wait for the next one in paperback. A reader questioning the value of what he reads is not a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NO FUN!","review":"This book is no fun because: 1) The characters regress, not progress 2) Despite the fact that Jordan has created umpteen characters, the first 25-30 pages are devoted to NEW characters, 3) Nothing of note happened in this book; 4) Mat, an interesting character, was not even mentioned. If his next book is this bad, or even close, I doubt I will buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is too short!","review":"First off, I love this series. Jordan is a genius and has created, in my opinion, the best fantasy series of all time. That said, I'm highly irratated that the books keep getting shorter. Jordanites, pull out your book six, seven and eight and compare them side to side. Tor has used larger type and fewer lines to create the illusion that the books are similar in length. When you calculate the average characters per line with the average number of lines per page and number of pages, you find the following: Book six-- 3,015,360 characters. Book seven-- 1,861,704 characters. Book eight-- 1,493,115 characters. Book eight is less than half the length of book six! Well, at least it costs more. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't wish for this story to ever end. This has been the best read of my life. But c'mon Robert, let's get with the program. You are too good to spend two and one half years to write half a book. How about a whole book next time sometime late in 1999?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm badly disappointed with the pace of the story","review":"Although I discovered the series only recently I have enjoyed reading through from book one to seven in no time. So I already ordered book 8 some couple months ago. Amazon delivered and I started reading by the minute.The story itself still is as fascinating as it's been starting at the first book, and I also like the style of Jordan's writing, but I expected way more from the story. Sure there are some significant events but I have the feeling that it turns more and more into some sort of a soap opera.There's one hint here and another unresolved action there ... You'll know the answer to that (hopefully) in the next book.So well ... after having read the proloque only I expected to rate it at five stars. However after reading the whole book I can't give more than two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the wait, but not worth the effort","review":"I expected Rand to take one more step towards Tarmon Gai'don, but it seems that Robert Jordan left most of what is famous about his books out of the series. Elaida is mentioned once, and All of the main characters seem to do almost nothing throughout the book. Mat is completely gone and the deal with Perrin is described but not started. Not worth the effort"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-lease!","review":"This is definitely an alltime low.. I cannot believe how this series is going down the hill. It took me forever to pick it up and start reading because I knew it was getting bad reviews, but it was worse than I expected. I think it has been deteriorating since book 5 anyhow. What is most irritating is how the women are being portrayed once again. They're all thinking about sex all the time, Nynaeve with Lan - Min, Elayne and Aviendha with Rhand - Berelain with Perrin etc. etc. Furthermore they're all in either a bad mood or pouting, sulking and complaining the day away. Yes, we all know now what an incredible hunk Rhand really is, how powerful and handsome, bla, bla. Could Robert Jordan please go back to his original high standards or write one more book to tie up all the (thousands of) loose ends? My new hero is George R.R. Martin with his 'Song of Fire and Ice'."},{"rating":"2","title":"never ending goodness","review":"ya ya, I know the series never ends, and that many people are tired of reading it. But I read the series straight through, with little to no pause between the volumes. So, I cant really distinguish the different books, and different points in the plot. The characters and the world Jordan creates are engrossing.When I think of the series, it always seems to me like its one long book. That is why I find one book no better than the next, they all are equal in their part of the story. If Jordan could have released the whole series as one book, then all the moaners would be mute.If you have started the series, I urge you to continue reading it, it has the most complexe and twisted plot of any fantasy series I have ever read, and beleive me I have read a lot of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Robert Jordan has woven a very tangled web in the WOT and now is apparently a fly trapped in that web. Let me begin by saying that I have read and enjoyed most of the series. However, after reading Path Of Daggers it became painfully obvious that Robert Jordan has tired of the series much more than I have.In looking at the characters we see people who are being written into tired old patterns. These are good well developed characters that the author is losing touch with and therefor so are we.Jordan needs to learn to tie a knott. Every book leaves more unanswered and uninspired questions, while avoiding any real resolution. Obviously, this series is in peril of ever being concluded.Unfortunately, this book is a must read for the series but I would suggest the paperback version. Although it may look small next to all those hardcovers it aptly describes this book's place in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was the worst book in the series, there is no doubt about that. Robert Jordan's fans had to read through this long and boring book. They had to put up with Elayne chapters that just would not end and listen to her whine and complain. Mat the best character was not even in the book. This book went on forever but nothing happened until the very end. Jordan's next book is better but not by much. His new book coming out had better be better then his latest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced to read","review":"Someone said no one is forcing us to read Robert Jordan. Well, Robert Jordan is forcing us to read. By giving us a feast of words and titilating our imagination he has much of the fantasy world hooked. We can't afford not to read for fear we may miss a plot line he has set up in the first set of books. Even after reading this book I am still waiting for those pay offs. And when the pay offs do come I can't remember the set up because it was years ago as well as many books ago.Thank God for the internet and the information we can turn to to review.As far as Path of Daggers is concerned, I enjoyed it, but was disappointed. It took well over one quarter of the book just to activate the silly bowl of winds and change weather from hot to cold. That should have been a chapter.I wish Jorden would stop milking us for all we are worth just because we had faith in him at one time. Talk about a god that failed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, no Matt, no action","review":"Imagine my complete diappointment upon reading this book and finding Matt has been completely left out of it. In book 7 we are left with Matt getting caught up in the Seachan invasion and in book 8 not one word about his fate. The book concentrates primarily on the actions of the women. Unfortunately there is not much action, merely endless banter between the characters. This book could have been condensed into a hundred pages and would have been an improvement. It appears to me that Jordan is trying stretching himself too far in trying to give every character equal billing. At this pace, the series can be at least 20 volumes long. It is hard to believe that in 2 years time, this is the best that Jordan can do. This is easily the weakest book of the series. My advise is to borrow this book instead of buying it. Wait for book 9, you wont have missed much."},{"rating":"1","title":"who's he kidding?","review":"We may as well put our money in an envelope and send it to him, and not waste our time anymore. Thats all he wants anyway. The series has ended for me. the women are so annoying, its obvious Jordan isn't targeting a female audience, and isn't that brat Faile dead yet? Someone needs to kill her off and teach the other females some manners. I don't know what Mrs. jordan is like, but REAL women aren't like that. the plot of PoD is slow and frustrating, and how the heck does anyone keep up with all these different characters? I loved Jordans first books so much, they've earned him one more chance, but he better start pulling a few things together. And please, get rid of the holier than thou female attitudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!","review":"I never would have believed I could say this. But my once favorite series of all time has gone from excellence to garbage. Reading these last two books has been torture. When the series started out it focused on only one character now i am forced to read pages upon pages about whining woman. This series is on life support it needs a jumpstart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your bitchin'","review":"Everyone who's bitched about POD, keep it going. Maybe Mr. Jordan will actually get the point, and the next book will improve some. The person who write the opposite of this reviews seems to think that everyone who think this book is a bunch of drivel(which it is) is a stupid child. I suggest you read Amazon's review of the book, as well as Booklist's, because they didn't seem to much care for the book either. In closing, dont be so ignorant as to presume that everyone who didn't like this book is an imbecile. I can name at least one person who gave this book 5 stars who is severly lacking in the area of intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that this book is an Epic Adventure.","review":"I think that this book is great and I loved the other seven too but when will the series end? The end is becoming to predictable and there is becoming no point to read them. The books are good but the seris is starting to stink. When will Robert Jordan End them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"RJ should know when to stop","review":"Path of Daggers is filler, pure and simple. The grand wheel of time series, which has been hearlded as \\"the greatest fantasy series ever\\" by its rabid fans, screeched to a stop years ago. What we have now is an author and a publisher that have realized (correctly) that all they need to do is put Jordan's name and \\"The Wheel of Time Book number so-and-so\\" on a cover and it will be a bestseller. Path of Daggers is an insult to his readers everywhere, full of maudlin, soap-opera developments and so many new characters that no one even can remember who's who. And the thing is no one, not even the author, knows how long this series is going to last! A famous author, Margaret Chittenden, said it best: \\"Be sure you stop when your novel reaches the end. Bow out when your story is over. Put the cover on the typewriter or turn off the computer.\\" It's a pity that Mr.Jordan doesn't know how to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending, disrespectful","review":"I am so disappointed in this book. I personally returned all three copies I got for Christmas. Nothing happens - except that Mr Jordan met his deadline for another customer-fleecing and made an already wealthy publisher some more much-needed pocket money. I feel disrespected - I was hoping that after 7 (in which very little happened) the plot would get revved up again and I could experience the excitement I had felt reading the first 5 books. What a clever trick - get your stupid readers hooked with the quality of the first few books, and then churn out some absolute drivel to keep them hanging - take their money but leave them questioning the wisdom of ever having started to read the series in the first place. Mr Jordan, we are the ones who have put you where you are, and have made you as well-off as you are now - show us more respect, stop being so lazy and start writing in the manner we know you can. Your integrity is seriously challenged by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Disappointment","review":"An awful book. Let's face it, the previous seven were not great fantasy literature, but they were addicting. Book 8 cured my addiction.In fact, I plan on taking all of the previous books to a used book shop and selling the lot of them, I'm that frustrated. I won't buy another in the series.Its one thing to rip off Dune and a host of other classics, but its another to grind your series to a halt in hopes of selling a few more books. Nothing happens. We learn nothing more about the major characters and a confusing set of new characters are introduced to slow the storyline down even more. Don't waste your money on this one, folks, even if you have read all of the previous seven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicksand","review":"Just finished the book and had the feeling I was swimming around in quicksand. There is alot of action but in the end you find that not only have you not advanced anywhere but in reallity you are further away from the destination. The problem I have is that since I'm hooked I will not be able to avoid the next book unless I do some serious therapy. It is a real pity beacuase I was trapped in the begining by something different and well written. I realise that this is being drawn out bok after book for purely comercial reasons just like a television soap opera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is all the action?","review":"I think that of all his books this one is most frustrating to me because there is no conclusion to the events that he built up in the 672 page book. This series has been great at hooking me in and I have found it hard to put the book down at certian points. When I finaly finished the book I was so dissapointed that I threw the book down. You should not be allowed to end a book without concluding at least some of what has been going on throught the whole series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second worst book of the series","review":"While we finally get a conclusion on the Bowl of the Winds (which started in Book 6), we unfortunately get a new situation with Faile and the Shaido (which lasts an ungodly 3.5 books!). While Crown of Swords started the downturn in the tight exposition, this was brutal in some spots. The Elayne chapters, along with the annoying bickering with the Windfinders, were nigh unreadable. What's worse, Mat is missing from the entire book (after a cliffhanger ending for him in Book 7). While Rand's scenes were interesting, there was really no movement for him in this book. A weak entry, and sadly, not the worst book of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain wrong","review":"I bought path of daggers on cassette and have been both confused and upset with it. I have enjoyed listening to the well done and unabridged first 7 books read by Kate Reading and Michael Kramer. For some reason on the 8th book Jordan decided to have somebody else narrate it although the original narraters pick back up in book 9.What I dont understand is why if you are being paid to read a book, the eigth in a series no less, that you didnt at least listen to some of the previous narraters so you could pronounce names and places the same.Mark Rolston seems to go out of his way to pronounce EVERY name differently. It is hard enough in this series to keep up with who is who without trying to figure out which person he is talking about because the pronounciations are completely different."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring stale old tale written by a greedy author.","review":"Would give this book 0 or negative stars if that were at all possible...This book is full of useless descriptions which have no relation whatsoever to the book and about 2% of the whole world actually care about. Time after time when you encounter a certain person, a whole page is literally devoted to what the character is wearing. The continuous plot and character add-ons are going nowhere except to lengthen the span of this continually bad series and has no purpose whatsover except to earn the author extra cash. Enough is enough. This worthless pack of dirt has brought me to the conclusion that the ONCE actually interesting series is now dead and cold. If you are interested in fantasy, I suggest Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Tolkien, Robin Hobb, or any other fantasy writer who thinks about the story he/she is writing and NOT his/her wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"responding to A reader from Canada , April 25, 1999","review":"yes, but...

It did reveal a few interesting things which I'm sure will be useful to know later, but all in all, this book could have come out a lot sooner, and I still would have been disappointed. Jordan has done an incredible job in keeping non-fantasy fans interested in his work; now he has to do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this garbage?","review":"After the first couple of books the series has been going downhill fast. This book certainly continues that trend and reaches all new depths. While reading, I kept waiting for literally anything to happen to either advance the plot, provide some interesting diversions, etc. The Path of Daggers did do one thing for me -- I'm now convinced never to buy or read another Robert Jordan book. But the reviews here have proven that RJ has enough of a cult following to keep producing trash and making a living at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last one but...","review":"still not even close to the first few books. Sometimes it seems like Jordan just drags things out to make the book longer, other times the pages fly by. IMHO this book is much better than crown of swords. I'll read the next one now. I was close to stopping after reading crown. Now I have to keep going..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Procrastination in Prose","review":"The first book was predictable, but most of this genre are so. The next two or three entries in the series were however quite good. Since the fourth book though, almost nothing of any interest has occurred. This book is a particularly egregious example of an author attempting to milk a concept for all its worth. If one waits almost two years between installments one would hope that something, anything, might actually occur in the latest entry. No such luck. I have never come across a series where main characters disappear for entire books. Is the author being paid by the word? Or is he more caught up these days in \\"being\\" a famous writer than actually writing famously?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the set up","review":"While \\"Path of Daggers\\" is just a bunch of fluff compared to books 1-7, Jordan used it to set up book 9. Will Elayne get her throne? Will Egwene get the White Tower? Is Mat dead or a Seanchan prisoner? How will Faile get herself out of the mess she's in? Will Rand stop hating Aes Sedai and realize that he and the Asha'man are male Aes Sedai? Who is the Daughter of the Nine Moons? Will marriage soothe Nynaeve's grumpy soul? We wouldn't be able to ask many of these questions without book 8. Jordan has had two years to ponder the plots of book 9. Let's keep our fingers crossed that \\"Winter's Heart\\" isn't a set up for book 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop","review":"Listen, I'll read a cereal box if there is nothing else around, but I didn't even finish this novel. I read the earlier books while waiting for Goodkind's next work, and steadily began to regret not taking up TV.Mr. Jordan: I DO NOT NEED TO KNOW EVERY LEAF THAT FALLS FROM THE TREES. The pacing of these books is MISERABLE. For the LOVE OF GOD SPEED IT UP. I swear to GOD in Crown of Swords NOTHING HAPPENED. I'd invite Mr. Jordan to review the 3 act structure just incase he has become lost in describing to us the rustling sound mice make when they walk across the broken dried leaves of falls past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars...what happened in this one?","review":"I read this when it first came out, hoping Jordan had finally decided to tell a story again. I was disappointed. I honestly don't remember what happened any longer, except for the Bowl of the Winds thing. Yeah, that's good writing. I'll stick to Robin Hobb, Martin, Glen Cook & The Black Company, and a host of other GOOD writers who can tell a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be worse","review":"Although I agree that \\"The Path of Daggars\\" was a little slow, I think that it was laying an important foundation to come. In a saga this huge, you cannot expect everything to be utterly perfect. Exercise a little discipline for heaven's sake. Jordan is not through yet. I do not doubt that what comes next will be as breathtaking as anything that came before. I, for one, am nowhere near ready to throw in the towel. Since Mr. Jordan is willing to put in the vast amount of effort needed to make this series come to life (and it does), I am willing to put up with whatever framework he considers essential to completing the story. Once the series is finished, I have no doubt that all the information presented in these two books about which so many people complain will be used to the utmost. Remember that with Jordan, no detail is insignificant, no matter what it may seem to be at the time. By the way, does anyone have any idea when book 9 will be released or what the title will be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropping the habit...","review":"I bought the first 5 books at a used book store last summer and enjoyed 1-3. Number 4 was slow and number 5 dragged miserably. From reading the other reviews I see that 7 and 8 drag even more. Folks, I have been reading fantasy and science fiction for 40 years and I have to say, this material is not worth anymore investment of my time. Women glaring and intimitating each other is not a good example of \\"stronger\\" female roles in fantasy. If I knew at the time that this was going to be a 10 volume series that would be completed in 2010, I would not have bothered in the first place. I am taking the advice of others and dropping the WoT habit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This series should be called \\"Stalling for Time\\"","review":"Take a review from someone who has READ the book.I'll admit, I pre-ordered the book about 3 months before it came out, anticipating a wonderful sequel. I was quite disappointed when I read this book. This book was book 8 in \\"The Waste of Time\\". If you're looking for a Fantasy Series to read, avoid this one until Jordan figures out how to finish a series.Only a handful of new events took place in this book. The remaining 450 pages were merely rehasing of old events that have been with us for the past few books. I agree with a previous review, which said that the past 3 books could have been compressed into one book, with no loss of storyline.All-In-All, it was a decent book, but not worth the money, or time that I have waited for it. If you're not patient, don't read this series. It's on year 8, and doesn't look like it's going to finish for at least another 4 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, But where's the rest of the book.","review":"I am rabid fan of this \\"wheel of Time\\" books.It seems the books are sliding down the \\"meat to fluff\\" sclale. The last two (in my humble oppinion) could have made one of the previous books and still not stood on it's own. I still eagerly await #9. P.S. WHERE'S MATT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn...more of the same","review":"What started out as a great series in books one through three as degenerated into a soap opera. There's a lot of words but not a lot happens. Jordan needs a good editor to get him back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Jordan think he's writing for a daytime soap?","review":"Well, all I have to say is I'm clearly very disappointed with this latest offering. Although, some parts were interesting reading, most of it was just plain boring. Path of Daggers lacks action, focus, and most importantly, it lacks Matt...What in the world happened to Matt? Matt had been built up to be one of the, if not the most interesting character in the series, and he wasn't even in this book. Mr. Jordan has to realize his diehard fans may be very vocal and voice their praise even if he writes 1000 pages of rubbish, but his READERS are slowly finding it harder and harder to shell out the dollars for his endless soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disapointing","review":"This has to be one of the most disapointing books I've read. I can't believe I've waited 2+ years for this! I wish I would've barrowed the book from a friend than wasted the money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Path of Daggers, Cumbersome","review":"I had not read Jordan, before and wanted to get into some of his work. I had just finished reading several of Martin's books and they were fantastic. I figured Jordan's would be of the same type and I could continue where I left off. Not so. Jordan's Path of Daggers is one of the driest, most cumbersome works I have ever picked up. There is so much reference to people, places and names for which there is no association to relate. I found the book a real chore to read. Wheras Martin's books flowed, Jordan's bogged. I do not recommend this one. It's like reading a dry play. Maybe if I had suffered through the previous books he wrote, I might have a little better idea of where he was headed with it. As it was, I just could not get into it. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longest Train Wreck in the History of Fantasy/Sci-Fi","review":"This series is a disaster and I can only hope that this latest installment means we're nearing the end. The first book MAY have been worth 3 stars, if you're feeling charitable. The series has gone downhill steadily. Previous reviewers nailed the exact troubles with this book so read them. The biggest shame about this book and the series is that it serves as a massive distractor from other better fantasy writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If #1 was this poor, I would not have continued.","review":"The slide into irrelavance continues. I had noticed that the two previous entries into the Wheel of Time tended to drag out the minutia and compact the plot developments. The Path of Daggers continues the trend. Out of 591 pages, 25 are relevant to a few plotlines. The balance is annoying fluff. I am finished with this series and this author. Congratulations TOR and Mr. Jordan on publishing a really big paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money- check it out from the library.","review":"After waiting for 2 1/2 years for this book, I was horribly disappointed. Nothing happens. 591 pages, and it's all prologue for book 9. (Or, the way the series is going, book 12, perhaps.)I'll be checking out the next book from the library before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loosing Interest fast - Please save me","review":"Dear Mr. Jordan, you are losing me fast. I have gone from your most advocate reader to a person that will passingly consider your next volume of STUFF. Whatever happened to the fast-paced nail bitting story built and told during the first three volumes and the now ridiculos pages and pages of banter and chatter amoung the characters ? If you are bored, then please knock out the SET, complete the story within two volumes, finish them over the next 18 months, and then we can all get on with our lives.You might consider a project that interests you after you complete the one that seems to so disinterest you now!!! Please don't lose me... My heart beckons to return to the EARLY WOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a true cliffhanger!","review":"Well, while the plot was not advanced a whole lot... this book is much better than the two previous releases in the series. Mr. Jordan has finally figured out how to end a book in true cliffhanger fashion. Plus, the book was written in better fashion. Although small, only 500 pages for two years of work!!!, this is a great edition to the series. Hopefully we won't have to wait 2 more years now. Only one bad thing to say, Where the heck was Mat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"it simply stinks","review":"Robert Jordan you should be ashamed of yourself by ripping us off.This book has no plot, no storyline, it simply sucks. I had admired and loved your other 7 books from the series.But you have sold us out, your loyal and devoted fans ; by giving us something that could be considred a two chapter novel. I had admired your writing,even commpared it and clasified it with the great work of The Hobbit and as far as grat as Terry Brooks.I'm sorry to see that you have abandoned your loyal fans.It seems all you want is to make the easy money by delivering junk, and instead of finishing the series in 2-3 more books, plan to extend it to 8 more. We, the readers may like the story,but we may and will refuse to be ripped-off. Think about this when you plan your next work. If anybody out there reads this, and knows Robert let him know.Readers DO NOT BUY THIS ONE . SKIP IT . YOU WILL NOT MISS ANYTHING ."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay and very slow","review":"I am currently reading PoD, and it is very slow going, where as in the previous books you were hooked right from the start, with this nothing appears to be happenening much like Lord of Chaos which only took off in the last 2 hundred pages. Lets HOPE book nine get the series back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"well once again nothing happens","review":"I assume that Robert Jordan has somed pretty serious personal expenses. That is the only reason I can fathom for this excrescence of a book. Nothing happens!! We have one battle that is not fully described. We have one loosing of the winds that appears to bring destruction to the world, with no explanation of why. We have one asassination attempt of Rand by some emasculated saidan chanellors. Net.... We spend about a thousand pages trying to figure out why Rand cannot be a man. Most of the book is spent with various types of women in various types of duress or triumph. This author has been compared to JRR.Tolkein. What a joke. Tolkein at least mangaged to get the story done in three books (not including the hobbit)END"},{"rating":"1","title":"tripping","review":"I guess what i miss the most is the wit and the (almost effortless) imagination of the early books. The courage, existential bewilderment _and_ sincerity of the characters which gave the series its power have been superseded by the neurotic and the petty. And by special effects which often dilute the story. Looks like Jordan and Lucas Travel on the same ship...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow progress with the story.","review":"This last book was dreadful to read. Nothing happens. Why not put an end to this story now. There is enough stuff already to start another about e.g the time of Lews Therin, the original Dragon. Or why not about Arthur Hawkwing or somebody else of the ancient heroes mentioned in WoT. That would be enough for more than a lifetimes writing if the author still is interested in this kind of \\"litterature\\". This WoT is not an adventure any more. Maybe mr. Jordan has lost his interest in it. Or lost the thread. Or has he hired a ghostwriter? At least I hope he will find a way out of this hopelessly tangled web and finish the story as boldly as it started nearly ten years ago. I would like to read the last chapter of it while my vision is still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews!","review":"Like many, I read WOT 1 to 7 and eagerly anticipated book 8. But enough is enough! I stopped at page 306, promptly forgot about it (read KSR's Mars series instead .. good job, KIM!) and then picked it up again, only to stop after another 10 pages. Good grief! NOTHING HAPPENS! Its supposed to be a STORY, Bob! In a STORY, THINGS happen! Think MOVIE, not (excruciatingly detailed) PHOTO.The most pleasure I got out of this book was reading the hundreds of reviews posted here (some of these REALLY cracked me up!) I really recommend 'em!HAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After???????","review":"There are too many reviews out there that say the same thing about this book. All I can say is that what the heck was the final chapter?To me the final chapter sounded like Mr. Jordan got tired of the series, and wanted to try and finish it without finishing. Wrap up everything in rumors.I started reading the series 2 weeks ago, and have read everything except shadow rising. It is a great story, but this . . this is disapointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't please everyone","review":"I thought that this book did a lot for the story as a whole. There are just some things that are worth the wait. How could you wrap up so many sub-plots with just a few books. If you want to have the story the way you want... day dream. Robert Jordan is a master at his art you however (everyone who complained about what they thought should be there yet was not there)are just novices readers. I want more. About every aspect of the world the people the places the thoughts of any and every person. To sum it up...9 books or a hundred I want it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are neither beginnings nor ending to the P of Daggers","review":"Mr. Jordans very famous line is how he has begun almost every book in this series. But in the Path of Daggers, there really isn't any beginning nor ending. It was just lackluster ramble about a bunchof women who cackle about and feel insecure about their own part in the book.There is only one other series that I was even bothered to see how it ended - Raymond E. Feist's \\"The Serpentwar Saga.\\" While the Wheel of Time as a series was a fantastic effort until now, I very much fear that a repeat of the Path of Daggers will only bring about an early Tarmon Gai'don to the series.Pleas sir, as so many of your faithful readers has already put it, \\"Get on with it!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it, RJ!","review":"I feel disappointed that Robert Jordan hasn't been able to make this book up to those standards that he has advocated in the past. The Path of Daggers suggests that he has lost his focus on the storyline, because the emphasis is on human relation and talk. I don't mean that this is a bad thing in itself, but when nothing happens and the same things are repeated over and over again, it just loses momentum. The epic story that RJ is telling deserves a more balanced approach on action and human interest. The series is, surely, one of the best that I've ever read, but this chapter is the low point(hopefully). I hope that RJ will pull his story together in the next episodes, or else the series will end far short of the promise it gives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and empty","review":"Dear Mr. Jordan, if you are reading this, please don't get insulted, but this is how I feel. I didn't give it 1 star, just because I have read all WoT books and I know you can write and I wanted to encourage you to finally do a good job ( It used to be great, but after last 2 books I am not sure you can do any better than good).It took RJ 2 years to write 500+ pages. It is about 1 page per day (not counting weekends, sick leave, long vacation, family crises, and those days when author simply has a lack of inspiration). It would have been OK if the final product wasn't so empty. I guess RJ wants to write as many books possible just for money. I would gladly pay 20 or 30 % more for a book and get some good stuff like the first 4 or 5 books.If you have never read any of WoT books it is a bad time to start now. You get hooked by the first few books and have to keep on buying some really boring stuff later."},{"rating":"1","title":"PoD is well written but is not a fantasy novel","review":"Jordon continues his annoying habit of dwelling on character development while ignoring the story. PoD can not be considered a fantasy novel because a story never occurs. Events are described (thouroghly) but a consistent thread does not exist. Female characters continue to be unable to co-exist with one another and male characters continue to be overly concerned as to what the females are thinking. Multiple plot lines increase geometrically with out resolution or hint of resolution while pages upon pages of descriptive narrative pile up with out grabbing the readers interest. It would be much more fair to the buying public if this book was marketed as a prologue to book 9 rather than as a continuation of a stunning fanatasy series. Mr. Jordon, at least a couple of the plans being hatched by the multiple characters involved in the series must be progressing in some substantial way. Please bring them to our attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave Disappointment!","review":"Boring Book. Not at all Jordan's typical style. No sarcastic humor, no exciting parts, no intrigue worth mentioning. Don't bother buying this book and just wait for the 9th one to come out, you wouldn't have missed anything but the pain of loosing interest in this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just be patient guys....","review":"I think a lot of people are forgetting that Jordan is writing an Epic Fantasy. Before you can get to any fast moving plot, you need basic character development. Hence, this book was primarily exposition and background for the next three. I am very confident that the seeds he plants in this book will make the rest of the series live up to the first group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author and editors have no respect for readers.","review":"No imagination. No action. No depth. Poorly chosen conflicts. Narcoleptic sub-plots of evil minor characters, that will be deleted, along with collateral damage from the friendly fire of Jordan's word-processor, later on. No delicious anticipation of meaningful chemistry with the truly nasty. After thousands of pages we have ancephalic stick figures runnning a great confrontation with evil like flat ink stains on paper. Is this all Jordan can come up with in better than 2 years? In his once magical world, passion and fear and honor no longer feed the action and dialog. Why didn't someone at the publishing house ask him why he wrote this insipid book? He will be booed on the street for this. It is a slap in the face of buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze-ville","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The pace is agonizingly slow. Again, the women are much smarter than the men, and all this nonsense would stop if only the men would realize they were idiots and kill themselves.This book also continues Jordan's penchant for introducing new characters with names that are similar to other characters. I read an entire chapter thinking one of the characters was one of the Chosen, when they were actually on the side of Light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert you owe us big time!!!","review":"I had to read what other people thought of \\"daggers\\" before I put my two cents in. After two and a half years of waiting, this is what R.J. gives us? ROBERT!! you owe your fans an apology. I, like many readers, have read and reread the WOT series from book 1 to book 7 because it is a great story. Book 8? Who cares? I didn't think I could say enough about this book,I do not have to. Read the other reviews that are listed for \\"daggers\\" and you will get and idea how disapointed fans of WOT are. Robert Jordan you owe your fans BIG TIME. How about Book 9 in 6 months. A story line we could care about,or a hint that you are not milking this story so you can make more money(not that hold that against you... much). If anything I am hurt that I wasted so much enthusiasm for a \\"chapter\\" that, while written well and with the expected detail, left me disapointed and not caring if there is another \\"chapter\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I'm not alone","review":"After waiting over two years for this book, I was really disappointed when I finally read it. Total filler without any significant developments or movement to a conclusion. My advice to RJ is to please get on with this story and no more 2 1/2 year delays for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback unless your a big fan.","review":"I didn't find this eighth book of Robert Jordan up to the standard of the first seven. This is the first time I have read one of his books and had trouble staying interested. This book could have been written in 150 pages without any noticeable change in content. There were to many extraneous characters with little significance. The main problem though was the lack of any sort of Climax. Each of the other books has had a great climax but not this one. There were two minor pieces of excitement with the Asha'man and Callandor, Otherwise it was a big yawn. This is a tragedy considering all the potential this book had.I sure hope the next one has a little more excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Eight Adds little to the story","review":"The Path of Daggers is a disappointment - I feel as though I bought tickets to a football game, and instead found a chess match in progress when I got to the arena. The previous Wheel of Time books at least made an attempt at being complete stories unto themselves, but this one takes us from point A to point A.2 without much new information given in the ~600 pages it takes up. In addition, many of the fanciful elements and characters are gone from this one - making it about as exotic as a faculty meeting.I am not entirely sure if this is the fault of Jordan et. al, or if it is because I've become a big fan of Kristine Kathryn Rusch's The Fey series in the time between the last Wheel of Time book and this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"...a long wait to be disappointed","review":"Initially it sounded too good to be true, the book eight of WOT has been published...I asked my cousin to courier the book to me from US. My disappointment knows no bounds after I went thru the book. There was no mention at all of Mat (my favorite character) and the story was in a total mess. My head is too scrambled for me to even write a decent review, so I'm ending this pain with a prayer that the next book will be more readable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 2 Stars, Series 5 Stars","review":"While I'm a fan of the WoF, upon picking up \\"the path\\" I found myself extremely disappointed, the book fails to live up to Jordan's previous work. Furthermore it's only about 1/4 the size once you adjust the margins and font size. Several of the main plot lines simply diappear, Mat. After \\"the crown\\" started picking up the action that was dropped in \\"the fires\\" I thought maybe the series was going somewhere again, however this book was an incredible let down. Jordan fails to continue the minor plot twists that you would find in the first couple books and now create further twists in the later books. i.e. Paitr, prophetic images, and the dramatic irony that keeps myself and many other fans captivated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the Cheerios guy","review":"Jordan is running...out....of.... steam.I was a big fan of the series until the last couple of books.

Mr Jordon has asembled a very good cast, locations and theme but the series seems to have a life of its own, focus on the main characters more. This book is worth reading but PLEASE Mr Jordon, tighten up some !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. . .","review":"I absolutely devoured the first 7 books of this series, and waited anxiously for the eighth. To say that the plot in this book is slow is like saying that the Pacific ocean is pretty big. Had there been some character development, it would have been better, but the characters change very little, and those that do do so in ways that are entirely too predictable. I will probably buy the next one, but THIS time, I'll wait for the paperback. Thankfully, this one was a gift, so none of my own money ws wasted on this disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never been so disappointed in a book.","review":"Do I care if Nynaeve pulls her braid when she gets mad anymore? This book is definitely the worst in the series and shows that Robert Jordan is just milking the series for more money. Could we end this story or at least further the plot more?

I will not read another book in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little slow for Jordan but still a wicked good book!","review":"PoD starts out pretty slow for a Jordan book but don't let it fool you. He packs a lot of action into the second half of the book. Onle four stars because I'm starting to realiz just how long it takes him to say something.

The rest those folks who have no life(and who maintain that this was actually a good book!) can then sit around waiting for Jordan's next installment of swill!

Then I read COS, which lacks the plot and character development of 1-6. Path of Daggers is even worse! The story's not progressing and some of the six main characters are barely mentioned. What happened? Has Jordan died and his publishers hired freelance authors to finish the series? Either that or Jordan's just burned out from writing eight 700 page books in less than ten years.

The only reason to read this book is the faint hope that Mr. Jordan will get out his copy of 'Eye of the World\\" (or better yet, Martin's 'A Game of Thrones') and figure out how to write decent fantasy again.

I have been reading this series since 1990. The excitement begins to pale, the description becomes repetitive, the characters whine a lot more than they did when they first left Emond's Field. Oh, yes, my favorite part...Why was it that after the prelude did we never hear from the border monarchs again? That was just unneccessary. I always thougth that it would be great to have a series go on and on and never end...and for the most part I still feel this way, but if dear Mr. Jordan doesn't pick up the pace he's going to lose a loyal reader. I didn't even buy PoD, I borrowed it from the Library. Slogging through that book, I knew how Rand and co. felt slogging through rain soaked Illian. No one should pay money to experience that. I'll borrow book nine from the Library, give dear Mr. Jordan one last chance, but if its not up to par...it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting frustrated, still hooked.","review":"Yes, this book does not live up to Jordans earlier books,(like 1 - 5) but then again this is no ordinary series. I was realy bored with the bogged down female on female interplay. And I am so sick of the Perrin's I AM NOT A LORD! crap I could die. Thankfully, that may be over. And what is wrong with with sleeping with three women Rand? Like he is going to live long enough to have to deal with it? Please Robert Jordan, enough with the byplay, there is so much left unanswered, you could write a dozen more book still. Let the character building lag. I waited almost two years for very little reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greed over Greatness - the tragic end of Robert Jordan","review":"This series has hit rock bottom and is beyond salvage. I don't know how anyone could possibly give it more than 2 stars (2 is generous and probably only from Jordan's relatives). The first four in the series were great. I became hooked. It has gone down hill rapidly since. Five and six were boring and after Crown Of Swords (another awfull Jordan novel), I did not think things could get worse. POD proved me wrong again. I'm kicking the habit. So long Robert Jordan. You were within grasp of greatness. I hope you enjoy all the wealth accumulated from this series because respect and greatnes is no longer possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many books!","review":"There's gonna be at least nine books in what was supposed to be a seven book series! My advice is to read every other book. Jordan spends at least 30% of his book stating what happened in his previous book. I got the books from my library and they only had the odds. Sometime later, I filled in the gaps. I wanted to see if I had missed anyhting. Nothing at all! For those who think it may have been the way I read the books, you're wrong. I did the same with Goodkind's books and I love them. Too much wasted time reading 3000+ pages. Skip a few of the books. It's more exciting and a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is little to no progression in the Story line.","review":"I found The Path of Daggers a waste if time. Robert Jordan's attempts at explaining the inner emotional termoils of his charaters stalls the story line to a extent that nothing ever happens. This book could be summed up in a couple of pages not 591. For those of you who don't want to waste time or money...The is no mention of what happened to Mat in Ebou Dar. Elayne escapes with the bowl of winds and corrects the weather. Leaving Ebou Dar for Caemlyn (nothing really interesting happens on the way). Egwene consolidates her position as Amyrlin Seat by Declaring War on Elaida. Parrin unspectacullarly obtains control for Rand in Ghealdan. Perrin also meets up with the Prophet with no conclusion and Faile is captured by the Shaido with no conclusion presumablly to follow in another book. If Jordan Treats Faile like Mat, we should be hearing about her again in another two or three book.In short This is a Disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Did Jordan forget that Rand is supposed to be the principal player, or did he not mention Rand until chapter 13 because he is more intent on writing about the terrain and weather and bickering women instead of the storyline. Truly devastating to have to wait all this time, fork out the big dough to buy the hard bound edition, and get a book that did nothing for the WOT series. However bad this book, I have become addicted and will continue to read if it will bring closure to a wonderful storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing - repetitious- and at times downright boring.","review":"I resent it bitterly when Authors with Jordans gifts take believable and although not always likeable characters and turn them into simple minded unbelievable jackasses who could never survive in the world Jordan portrays. There is an end to every story and I think it is about time the readers reached the end of this while there is any interest left in the characters involved. Mr Jordan may write untill they nail him into his box but, that doesn't mean people will continue to read his books if he continues on the path he is now following. How many more books will have to be read to reach the end of the wheel Of Time series. I am 67 years old. At this rate I won't live that long so perhaps I will quite while I am ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the NBA strike: who cares?","review":"Nothing new since book 4, although I really enjoy long, good books. Some fans take umbrage about the negative comments others have written about the length of the series, although size doesn't matter (at least that's what my wife says!. However, I want some character development, some progression of the plot and would it kill the fabulously wealthy Mr. Jordan to include a synopsis with each book? I am not going to read another book in this series until he has written the concluding book, and then I'll probably end up only reading the final 100 pages. Luckily my local library carries this series so the only thing I've wasted has been my time, not my money. I sum up the series with the following analogy: books 1-4: the movie \\"Jaws.\\" Books 5-8: \\"Jaws 4.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DUDE! IT SUCKED!","review":"I waited for about two whole years for that book to come out- and it was a big waste of time. I'm not going to sit around and wait anymore so Jordan needs to sit down and start cranking these things out. If Jordan had been trying to ruin the series- this was the book he would write. I'm terribly dissapointed in it and I agree that I'm not going to revisit the series for some time until its complete and I don't have to waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready for some plot advancement? ME TOO!!","review":"I bought Path of Daggers immediately upon release, convinced against all evidence ( 7 books of it) that at long last Rand would begin the final approach to his great battle. I was sooooo wrong. Mr. Jordan, if I may address you directly, your soap-opera pacing is inconsiderate of the readers who have invested so much time and money to vaulting you to the top of the fantasy genre. I was left feeling like I'd read fifteen minutes of actual story--and it only took three days."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very disappointing","review":"I was born and bred on heroic fantasy. I love the genre, and have thoroughly enjoyed Robert Jordon's work. I was introduced to Robert Jordon through his Conan stories, which are terrific. In 1994, I became aware of WOT, and digested the first 4 books as fast as I could. What a wonderful story this was. Book five began to drag just a little, but I eagerly awaited book 6, knowing that the story would surely pick up. Book 6 was slow, book 7 was bad, and I can't finish book 8.I am more than disappointed in the series now, I am a little sad. I feel that Mr. Jordon has lost his vision, and I cannot continue with him into the depths. I expect book 8 will remain unfinished; I can't bring myself to pick it back up. For those of you who might be discouraged from reading Jordon after reading the ever-increasing bad reviews of books 7 and 8, don't be. WOT is remarkable, but I suggest you stop with book 3.So long Mr. Jordon. I enjoyed it while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly worthless","review":"slow, boring, pointless, which is exactly what the series is becoming. i dont understand how anyone could give this book five stars, unless you've been brainwashed by mr. jordan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the amazon review;that should cover it","review":"After reading COS I just decided to read the amazon reviews and summaries and skip the book all together. COS and LOC dragged on so much that I'm moving on to something else. One specific comment-ditch nynaeve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of 8 books .. this one is the worst.","review":"Narrow and deep. This has to be the most plodding book since the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. For goodness sake what happened to the story??RJ has introduced more characters than I can keep track of. At the same time his glossary and character index has gotten smaller.The only reason I bought this one is I'm hooked.If #9 is awful you can find my collection in our next yard sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed break in the action.","review":"Unlike many I thought this book was a fitting eighth book in the series. It has further developed the characters of Nyneave and Egwene and allowed their adventures to catch up with Rand's. Further I believe that Rand had to slow down since he has done so much so fast. This book slows down the pace while still setting up further action. Although I do miss Mat I believe that the next book will have Mat as one of the main focuses as he will inevitably have to meet the daughter of the nine moons (the Seanchan Emperess)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the average!!!!!","review":"As I write this, the average number of starts for PoD is 3.5, which is misleading. The vast majority of recent reviews have been 1 star. The only reason the average is that high is the fact that all the fans started giving 5 star reviews before the book even came out (in anticipation I guess). Don't be fooled folks. The book only deserves 1 star. RJ, you are losing your touch. Perhaps talent is lost with age?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated","review":"This book was attrocious. I thought the first seven were great (well, the seventh was a little weak) but this was a waste of paper. The idea is supposedly that each book in a series can stand alone on it's own merit. Not this one. Read the jacket cover(interestingly enough more happens in the jacket cover description than in the actual book. What was up with that?) and wait for book 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Addition to a Great Saga","review":"This book was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, Books Seven and Eight of the Wheel of Time have been the weakest entries in the series. What's worse is that the waits between books have been getting longer. Which means that the momentum that had been building up through the first six books has slowly faded away. The only silver lining for Wheel of Time fans is that this book ends with promise. If Jordan can't deliver the goods in Book Nine, it will be clear that his reach exceeded his grasp. Fans expect more after such a long build-up than countless pages describing a trip to a farm, or women squabbling like hens. Give us something to get excited about RJ! This just ain't gonna cut it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Illustration versus Photograph","review":"Bob... buddy... a couple of words of advice. Wrap the damn series up before half of the fantasy fans in the world commit ritualistic suicide out of sheer frustration at the snail's pace the last couple of books have crawled along at. More importantly, in regards to your image appearing on the cover; stick with the sketch over the photograph my friend, you look like Anne Rice's love slave."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series could have been one of the greats.","review":"I loved the first four books of this series. I was completely enthralled by the imagination of Robert Jordan. Now, I feel let down by the author. This series is going nowhere. The sad thing is that I will probably buy the next one and the next one and so on. If there are any new readers out there thinking about reading this series, I would say prepare to be amazed for a few books and progressively discouraged with every successive volume. The only possible reason for dragging out this series is money. Maybe in about ten years if this series is over by then someone will condense this series down to a big great volume and future generations will be spared some of the meaningless garbage that has so littered the last two books. Very bad Robert Jordan! Bad! Now you go and think about what you've done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, but i'm still hooked","review":"Nothing at all happend. It was a huge dissapointment. I really hope that the story goes forward in the next book. I'm really tired to read about the male/female problem all the time. Does'nt they have anything else in their mind. I have really enjoyed this series very much. I'm still hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot-boiler par excellence!","review":"I have been an avid reader of the ongoing Wheel of Time series but this was pap of the worst sort. A more overt exploitation of his frenzied readership could not be imagined. To have a plot hardly progress over 600+ pages is terrible. It appears that Jordan has set himself the task of writing the longest fantasy novel ever and in doing so has sacrificed all narrative integrity. Even as an addict I find myself prepared to walk away though I suspect that if you are considering buying this book you are already in so far it will be almost inevitable that you go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Path of Daggers was an amazing novel in an amazing series.","review":"Path of Daggers, the 8th book of the Wheel of Time series, lived up to the previos masterpeices in the series and made me crave for more. Although Mat was not really talked about in the book, the return of Logain made me want to laugh with joy. Robert Jordan rules!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this fellow needs a good editor","review":"Unfortunately, Path of Daggers is far inferior to the other books of Robert Jordan. While I have great respect for him as an author, I think that this book would have benefited from a serious re-write. It is fractured with very little direction and no conclusion whatsoever. We are given snippets of each character's motivation and experience. But nothing ties them together (at least in this volume) and Jordan doesn't even try to bring the novel to some intermediate conclusion (as he did in No.7). I felt like he had some work in progress (pre-edit) and slapped a name on it and put it out to the public. It's reminiscent of the difficulties Stephen R. Donaldson had in his second trilogy of the IllEarth War. Sometimes more is not better and I think you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you buy this book. Borrow it from a friend or the library. I regret spending the money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reason to kill a tree","review":"I was very disappointed in this installment of the series. I don't have time to wade through so much detail of so little importance. Mr. Jordan should re-read his first 4 or 5 books and note what he has obviously forgotten. Good characters and plot lines bring in readers, detail does not. If I want the type of detail he provides, I'll read the dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woops! May our wait for #9 not be in vain!!","review":"A disappointing read at best. Lacks the usual subplot intertwining that moves the main plot--reads like filler. If you've been with the series from book one, buy book 8 and scim it. If you're new, start with earlier books; they're much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"Jordan is so confused about his convoluted series of plots that he doesn't make any headway toward wrapping things up. The characters just sit around and bore us. No action, just boring, boring, boring. Jordan should read some Goodkind to see if he can rediscover how to move a plot along."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would be Zero stars if allowed","review":"Seriously, I'm tired of Jordan. As many have stated, it's just momentum keeping me reading this tripe. ALL the characters have become like Eddings; mere parodies and caricatures. The women all sniff and look down their noses at the men; the men all wonder why the other does better with women (and they all snort). PUH-LEEZE!Read Martin, Kay, Hobb or Glen Cook for true fantasy masters. Martin is writing what may become the definitive magical epic. Read it, instead of wasting your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 600 page vacuum","review":"The intriguing world of the first several novels has deteriorated into noisy office politics punctuated with troubling fetish-like mental fugues replete with spankings, silly empty threats of skinning people alive, and throughout the S&M world of the Seanchan lives in the background. From my POV, Jordan is free to dream of his sexless bondage fantasies, but I sure don't want to read the result when they print through onto paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah. Very blah.","review":"First thing: the synopsis and dust-jacket blurb have very close to nothing at all to do with Path of Daggers. Second: c'mon RJ, this epidemic of chronic stupidity among characters who used to be fascinating is disgusting. Third: Hello? The book just STOPPED out of nowhere. That's not a \\"cliffhanger ending\\", that's an UNFINISHED MANUSCRIPT. Fourth: No tension, unless you count \\"You're a bully!\\" \\"No you're a bully!\\" YOU BULLY!\\" from the civilized women, with \\"Oh dear, what color goes with my eyes?\\" from the oh-so-fierce Aiel. Fifth? It's not the world that's falling apart under the Dark One's touch -It's this series that is falling apart. If the next one is this abominably wretched, I for one am finished with the series. These last two books have been well below the level of the other novels. Buy it if you have faith in the series, but don't get your hopes up. It wasn't worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapoint!","review":"It was with great expectations that I looked forward to reading this books but as it went along I got more and more disaapointed. I really like the series but RJ seems to repeating all the thigns that we already have seen a thousand times. Especially this book is thin. It ends with no climates worth speaking of and it just seems to be a stop between one book and another and RJ couldn't get any good stuff in it because the publisher decided to make more money by publishing two books! I rated it 2 stars - in respect of the previous books which i really liked and have read many times. I really hope that RJ gets the next one better or I will stop wasting my money on them and find another favorite author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Its been about a 2 year gap between reading book 7 and reading PoD. I can honestly say that in these two years, I have forgotten most of the storylines and characters. I have ceased caring for them. Everything has gotten so complicated and boring that keeping up with this series has turned into a full time job. What started of so magnificently and with such great promise has crashed and burned. And it continues to burn. I hope that Jordan can display some of the magic he had in the first 4-5 books and rescue this series, even if it means ending it and not milking his fans for all their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had its moments, but...","review":"There were a few chapters here that were really good, reminding me of the great excitement I felt as I read through the first 4 books. But on a whole, Book 8 fell short of my expectations, as did Book 7. The story is dragging so slowly now that it's hard to keep reading, and there are so many seemingly-inconsequential characters here talking about nothing that I sometimes can't help but skim foreward looking for Mat to appear. I'm crossing my fingers in hopes that the next book gets back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"This one is not worth your time, read one of the great new books out this summer, like \\"The Triumph and the Glory.\\" The author obviously CARES about his readers and is passionate about the theme of his book, WWII. It is quite apparent that Jordan didn't care much about his latest book, so WHY SHOULD WE ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loosing the grip!","review":"Unfortunately this book is not in any ways as good as the first 5 or 6 books. It's going downwards! I do wonder if Mr Jordan is just writing his books to earn more money or if he really has a good idea of his own story. I hope the next (last) will be much better then this one.It's easy to see a pattern among fantasyauthors: they write long stories with less and less content, the longer the story goes. And my question is: when will the last in this bookserie come?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unfulfilling","review":"Some people are saying that RJ is writing an epic but you must realize that an epic is quality not quantity. This book did nothing for me and after 2 of them I no longer feel the need to wait for #9,#10,... I would rather read the first four books in the series and let my imagination finish the story than waste my time with 7 & 8. It's been a couple of weeks since i finished the book and I can't remember the details anymore. The books I read are for my enjoyment this wasn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan's Winning Streak Ends With #7","review":"Robert Jordan, one of today's best fantasy writers, has lost his first battle with his recent release of \\"The Path of Daggers\\".

The fact that he does not even include Matt should clue you into the incompleteness of this book.Lets just hope that he will try and make up for this poor effort in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars!","review":"Here is the content summary: Nothing, followed by nothing followed by 2 pages of a set up scenes to make us buy the next book. Read the cover in the local library and assume you can safely wait for book 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Definitely not one of Robert Jordans best. It usually takes me under a week to read one of his book, this one took a month. I am a fan and would not have skipped this one but I should have waited for the soft cover version."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a complete waste of time! A mercenary exercise","review":"I got nothing out of this book at all. Has Jordan lost the plot? Did he write this get-nowhere tome just as a money grabbing exercise? I think he should get a move on with the narrative, and stop playing with us. A very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books as always, but a little slow and little to read","review":"As always Robert Jordan delivers a great story line on the continuing saga of Rand al'Thor's fight against the Lord of the Dark. This book contains fewer pages and a larger font than all the other books. Ih he slowng down or what? I think he is slowly leading us into a major battle by building up anxiety and tension over what is going to happend next. The actually plot of the story is thin. There is not much action wise. Rand's army going insane, Elayne working on her quest, Forsake meddling, etc.. None of the hard and heavy action. Overall I like it for what it contains, but not the length and slowness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get this moving...","review":"Okay, don't get me wrong. I've been addicted since book 1. But, sadly to say, I'm waiting for the paperback from now on... The story had all of the elements I've come to expect and enjoy, but just didn't go anywhere! Never thought I'd hear myself say this, but let's wrap it up already. Vamping for time just isn't working as well anymore. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book from a good series","review":"I do not usually post reviews, but I felt obligated because Path of Daggers had an average review too high in my opinion. If you take this book as a single entity it really isn't worth reading; but if you have read so far in the Wheel of Time series, then read it and hope that the next books will be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This book is garbage. Jordan is a horrible writer and this book proves it. I have read the whole series over the course of the past decade, but no more. If you like fantasy, check out Eddings, Martin, McCaffrey, Anthony, or any one of a number of new authors. You don't need to read this series, there is so much better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A PATH OF DAGGERS\\" IS, SADLY, NOTHING MORE THAN A PROLOGUE.","review":"I have always thought of Jordan as an artist who writes for the pleasure it brings to himself and to others. After reading \\"A Path of Daggers\\", I begin to doubt his commitment towards his fans. PoD is a startling disappointment. 75% of the book does not advance the plot, the reason being that most of the book is spent in petty, monotonous character development (if you can imagine an entire chapter devoted to Nynaeve's squabbling with the Knitting Circle). The book seems to only have more plotting and schemes but no ground-breaking events occur--as if Jordan meant this entire book to be nothing more than a prologue for his next book. Also, the disappointing number of dramatic events and the uninteresting climax subtracts from this book's value. This installment is just another \\"build-up\\" book for Jordan's series.IT MAKES ME WONDER IF MY FAVORITE AUTHOR, ROBERT JORDAN, IS UNDER A DARKER INFLUENCE THAN MONEY..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reprise","review":"I already gave a review but I wanted to add these last few points that I forgot to mention. I purchased the hardback version of book 8 \\"The Path of Daggers\\". I will not do so for the next \\"several?\\" books. With so many other soft cover fantasy and sci-fi books of very high quality around I find it difficult, no impossible, to purchase a hardback version of a book in a series of books that has become so ho-hum. In fact, I may not even purchase another until the final book is published."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be the same series I started reading in 1990","review":"I could put up with Jordan writing one very bad book (A Crown of Swords) since it could possibly be an exception to the rule. However, the degradation of this series (starting back in Book 6) is now rearing its ugly head. No plot movement, endless and useless descriptions (especially about clothes), weak characters (more like archtype than indicvidual characters). It is strange that since Jordan has taken more time to work on his books, they've gone down in terms of length and quality. Well, I have no choice but to move Jordan off my \\"By Hardocver on Sight\\" list until (if ever) he returns the series to what it used to be. Here's hoping George R.R. Martin doesn't follow the same pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK book.","review":"I found \\"A Path Of Daggers\\" to be tedious, and not worthy of being published. If the quality of book 1 was like this, there would not have been this terrible fervor over Robert Jordan's books. The only reason I finished this book is that books one through six were very good, and book seven was fair. Also I would like to see the story to the end. But if Robert Jordan keeps writing the way he has, it will take another 28 books to finish the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this book","review":"I have read all of the previous seven books in this series, and found them very pleasant reading, except for the previous book, book seven, which suffers similar faults as this one. In Path of Daggers, nothing happens. No enemies are disposed of, no major battles are faught, nothing even interesting happens. All the characters just mill around repositioning themselves geographically and making you feel like something momentous is about to happem - but it never does. It reads like the first half of a novel, but it's too tedious even for that. If things proceed like this in future books in the series, there could be hundreds of volumes before anything happens! No matter what the next book is like, you can skip this one and never notice it at all. And you could spend your time better reading something more interesting, like your car insurance policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is fading","review":"When I read the first book, I fell in love with the style. I thought it was like Tolkien or Herbert. But the plot has been becoming incomprehensible. Mat was barely metioned, and Nynaeve, once my favorite character, is now no more than a spoiled child. Perrin sits looking at his hands. What was comical five books ago is tiring now. I advise RJ to reread his own books before writing another like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Jordan Selling Us Out?","review":"I hate to say it, but this book is among the worst I have ever read. I have avidly read and loved every word of all seven of the other books over and over, but will probably never waste my time with this miserable book again.Only one or two plot lines were closed off, and a dozen new ones opened. When will this series end? I was hoping for a good, fulfilling close by book 12, but now see that Mr. Jordan is milking this for all it is worth. If the next book is similar to this, or takes as long to come out, I will give up on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"The main problem I, like many other have with this book is that nothing happens.P.S. The only reason I gave it one star is you can't give it lessP.P.S. For those of you who give this book 4 and 5 stars, think just about this book and not the series. If you only read this book by Jordan would you ever read anything by him again. I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed by this book","review":"I had suspicions that book seven seemed to be filler to prolong the series. But after this lastest book, Jordan must be under pressure to write a certain number of books in the series because the pointless nature of this book is incredible. More subplots and very little progression towards the end that must come."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"A lot of people seem to be reviewing this book based on plot but it's very simple to me. This is the first book in the series that I didn't read a second time. In fact, I read the first couple books over just to remind myself of the magic that was once in the series. I have great faith that the next couple books will be better but the last two have left me wondering if Jordan would have been better off not taking his time. He was on a roll...now, I just don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing. Downright bbboorrrringgggg!!!!","review":"Of all the books in the series, \\"The Path of Daggers\\" was the most disappointing of all. I really enjoy the other seven books, and found them quite engrossing and rivetting, that I read each book several time. This book, however, was real struggle to read. It was boring. I was really disappointed that the plot wasn't going anyway. When I found out that the title of book was tPofD, before the book became available, I thought that Mat would be in the book, since he was only major character to use a dagger. But he was nowhere to be found. The next two books need to be lot better than this one, and plot need to pick up the pace bit, otherwise Jordan will lose even more readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Robert Jordon has a gift for describing people and places with such great detail that one feels as if they were walking with his characters. This book, however goes overboard in this. You get all this great detail about things, but the plot's entire progress suffers due to it. I was excited throughout all of his other books, but this one made me wonder why I spent my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Jordan, please heed my plee!","review":"To: Robert JordanFrom: His frustrated fansMr. Jordan,Less is sometimes better. If nothing significant is happening to a character or group of characters, then please do not waste pages writing about them. I have read all the WOT books, so obviously you have me hooked, but I don't know how much longer I can take it! The plot line that is selling these books is the adventures of Rand and his compatriots, not, those god-awful, boring Aes Sedai characters. Speaking for myself, and every WOT fan that I have conversed with, we would be much happier with a 400 page book that moves along at a reasonable pace than a 900 page monstrosity that, at times, I feel my eighth-grade english teacher is forcing me to read.

Jordan' problems are that he creates too many plots and charaters without following through and he does not want to let go. His storyline his now so scrattered, that as a reader, I can't see how he can bring it(plots and characters) all together in the next novel. If the next novel is as \\"The path of daggers\\" in the end, he'll not only lose Rand at Shayol Ghul, he'll lose his faithful fans as well. Can the Dragon be reborn in his next novel? I do hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I think WOT is the best Fantasy world that I ever read. The characters are described so that you understand why they are doing what they are doing.So many people are coplaining about the the many details but if you read it carefully you see how they hint at future events. I hate waiting for the next book for two years just as much as you do but a 800 Page Book takes some time especially with so many characters and storylines. I can't waint to read the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me!!!","review":"I picked up the first Wheel of Time book back in 1991. Book after book, I have been astounded by what Robert Jordan is able to accomplish with a pen and paper. The Path of Daggers, however, is quite possibly the worst Wheel of Time book ever. Except for a few interesting developments with the Asha'man, nothing happens in this book. You could have read Crown of Swords, then skipped the first 600 pages or so of The Path of Daggers without skipping a beat. The next one better be good, but we won't know for another 2 years!!:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Like getting underwear from Santa Claus","review":"I've waited for Path of Daggers like my 3 year waits for Santa Claus at Christmas. All I can say is reading this book is as exciting as getting underwear for Christmas. I wonder how many more filler books Jordan plans to write before he gets back to the story. I know he's keen on history - Path of Daggers is the parallel to Moses wandering the wilderness for 40 years - nothing happens until Joshua comes along. Will the promised land be book 9, 10,11, 12, or ????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross your fingers that Jordan doesn't make a habit of this","review":"After such a wait, what a disappointment! Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but nothing happened! Two years of waiting for another book of setup? The other frusteration I had(aside from the notable but perhaps understandable absense of Mat) is that plenty of stuff actually happens in the book, but RJ glosses over it all. Sure plenty of setup for next time, which will probably have us all begging for forgiveness for our lack of faith, but did it really take that long to write? Things were just so vague. He continued on with his grand tradition of greatly detailed character work, but that's about it. My biggest disappointments were the brief description of the battles with the Seanchan, and the sketchy description of what happened at the end. Ah well, lets just all cross our fingers that the next one (which will probably knock our collective socks off) comes much more swiftly."},{"rating":"1","title":"First volume in the WoT \\"Slump\\" Trilogy","review":"The Path of Daggers is the first volume in what I consider to be the three-volume Wheel of Time \\"slump trilogy\\" -- that is to say, the three volumes of the series where nothing of particular importance happens. Events set up in this novel will not be resolved until Knife of Dreams, which means that readers are in for a very long wait. Outside of a resolution to the Bowl of Winds arc, there is very little to report on here. Rand and his army take on the Seanchan, but the outcome is not as epic as one might expect. Perrin sets out to deal with The Prophet, but ends up running into the Shaido Aiel. And Egwene inches ever onward towards Tar Valon.My recommendation: skim this volume in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is enough is enough...","review":"I can't go on.

The two written by Sanderson are pretty good. Sorry, Robert."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will abandon...","review":"after reading this boring drivel, i've decided to abandon this never-ending soap opera of a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mo Money, Mo Problems","review":"Mr. Jordan had decided with his latest two books to drag out the story, create new characters, make the old characters do stupid things to make you want to hate them, just so he can generate more income for himself. Does it take over 100 pages for two people to ride a stupid horse to a farm so that they can use the Bowl? Come on, they're on a stupid horse, I can get there faster if I was walking! I really hope that Jordan can tie up this series in the next installment! I don't want to waste my money on another slow and meaningless book. Did anything significant happen in this book...yeah Mr. Jordan made mo money and he gave his fans mo problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disapointment","review":"It took us two years to get HERE? This book doesn't offer much in the way of plot development, and leaves most of the major characters more or less where we found them at the end of Crown of Swords. More than ever before, I felt that this was half a book, padded out with an inordinate amount of meaningless (and often annoying) filler. If the series continues to \\"progress\\" at this rate, we're looking at a 15 to 20 volume work that Jordan may not live to complete! It's almost as if Jordan is deliberately spinning out this series, because he doesn't have confidence in his ability to create another concept. I'm afraid I've lost patience with this. It's time for Jordan to wrap this series up and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"600 pages of pure nonsense","review":"As a fan of this series from the time the first book was released, I was highly anticipating (for some time obviously) the release of PoD. I had high hopes for it. Without giving any spoilers, my hopes and expectations were not even close to met. The book rambled about, closed one plot line while introducing four more. One major character had no time devoted to him and the book in general was loose and hurried. A very unfortunate turn for this series which needed a bit of action instead of this yawner. Any fan will want to read it of course but don't set yourself up thinking you'll be satisfied. How long now until the next disappointment? :("},{"rating":"2","title":"The best...","review":"I think this is the best series I've ever read.

No big revelations and the storyline barely advances. I think RJ knows his fans will buy the books no matter what he puts on the shelf and will milk this series as long as possible. It came in with a bang but will go out with a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll wait until it comes out in paperback","review":"I've only given this last increment 1 star because I haven't read it yet. Like most reviewers of Amazon, and a lot of fans, I also get quite engrossed in the series. I loved all the drama, magic and suspense. But let it end already. Give Rand a break - let him stay home, marry Elayne, have a few kids, rule the kingdom and have a few parties with his old friends. Doesn't anyone think they're all pretty tired by now? Having to think that Jordan is gearing up for a 9th book leaves me to wonder what else is there to say about these characters and will it be worth it? For those of you who have not read the series, wait for this last installment to come out in paperback. It's more economical, and you won't have to wait another 2 years. It'll also be easier to remember - if I want to start PoD, I'll have to start from book 1 and I don't know if I'm up to reading some 4000 pages yet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A false dragon","review":"It seems that Jordan started to believe he is the dragon reborn. However he is not and as a false dragon he should be stilled. Honestly WOT is great, got to its climax around books 5 and 6 but now it is just repetitive and boring; worst it is starting to show the flatness of some of the main characters. Hence please Mr Jordan, a bit of modesty or at least mercy towards your readers, still yourself: cut it short."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dud of a great series","review":"The first 120 pages of this book was the most boring fiction writing I've ever read. Fix the weather with the Bowl of the Winds and get on with the story. Where's Mat? He's one of the most interesting characters in the series. Perrin is one of the dullest. When do Rand and Elayne meet again, the last twenty pages of the series? The ending showed some promise. I hope Taim attacks Elayne in Andor. Maybe the Dark One will finally break all the seals and heat things up a little bit. Maybe the Seachan will attack Tear. I just hope something interesting happens in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was no 0 star rating","review":"How bad can it get? Much, much worse. Word is that 11 is the minimum. I have resorted to checking them out of the library and skimming them. My suggestion is that you simply keep book 6 in good condition and, every time he comes out with a new number, you simply read book six again and act like you've read his latest instalment. If you want a long series that goes astray, drags on, but actually ends in your lifetime, try Stephen R. Donaldson."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many more of these things does he expect us to read","review":"- or where's an editor when you need one! I feel like I've been reading these books forever. From the beginning I thought they were too wordy and could use a good editing. Still I loved the concept and the characters, but enough is enough. Just recently I discovered that I didn't read book #4 - and I barely missed it. I definitely could have missed this one. What a waste of paper. We know the characters - their flaws, their strengths. We know the layout of the world. Let's get on with the story.

Why did you bother releasing this one RJ? The conclusion of book seven left a lot of unresolved issues that had me eagerly awaiting book eight, i.e. What happened to Mat or Oliver and what about the hints that perhaps Morraine isn't as dead as she appears? I found book eight incredibly slow reading and disappointing, please someone explain to me why RJ would introduce new characters at this stage in the series, without so much as a hint of them beforehand.

Sure, there were only about two or three big events in this book, none of which where what I personally had hoped would occur, and Jordan did introduce some new \\"puzzles\\" without breaking up old ones. But still. Even though he is a little too fond of describing curtains, fashion and necklines, the WOT series is still enjoyable, and this book is good, even though it's not my favorite in this series...A good buy, in my opinion. Worth the money, and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"now he's really due for a good one!","review":"After reading CoS i was disapointed. It hurt to read a great series and then pick up a stinker. But feeling every cloud has a silver lining, i couldn't wait for PoD. After all a writer as good as R.J. would only write an entire book of prologue for a really good reason. PoD came out and I finally had it, the gem I had been awaiting. then i read it. Another 700 pages of prologue. That's about 1500 pages of building up. Please R.J., Please give us that which we desire. Show us the way, for only you know where this is leading. Please end the prologue and start the book. Just in case you ever read this R.J. here are a few things i never want to read about again: stout shoes, chewing or pulling on braids, domani dresses, and helmets looking like insects.That's enough salad Mr. Jordan, give us a T-Bone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow-moving, pointless book.","review":"I have recently re-read the wheel of time series and have noticed a steady decline in the quality of Jordan's work. This book is definately the worst. It's like Jordan just threw this book together in a hurry just to appease his publisher. Plus, it seems that Jordan has lost intrest in this series. He wrote a Conan novel while writing a Wheel of Time book, you can't just do 2 books at once and still expect quality work. He needs to conclude this series, and quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"By leagues, this is Jordan's worst book.","review":"I love the Wheel of Time Series, but I detest this book. My primary complaint is the sluggishness of the narratives involving Elaine et al. and for that matter, nearly all of the female characters in this book. I don't care about them anymore.

This book fails on almost every literary level. The story moves nowhere, the characters are static and whiny (and I mean they ALL whine), and repetitive themes abound. Case in point:Rand: \\"Man I wish I knew how to handle women, I don't know how Matt and Perrin do it.\\"Perrin: \\"Gee, I can't figure women out. How do Rand and Matt do it?\\"Matt: \\"God women annoy the hell out of me! What is it that Rand and Perrin do that I don't?\\"...Or some very close derivative. Unless I'm slightly mistaken, this happens in EVERY book by each character, that is if the character is mentioned ever, specifically Matt. This equals no character development. Again I say, for epic fantasy read Martin which is, instead of mind-numbing, mind-blowing. Best...ever...period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan Milks His Cash Cow","review":"Okay, so I was a big fan of TWOT series in the beginning, but the books have hit a new low. Whatever respect I had for Robert Jordan as an author (and his first few books in the series were very, very good) is long gone.

The first few volumes showed great promise, but in my view, the quality has been deteriorating. After finishing The Path of Daggers, I had the same feeling I had after reading A Crown of Thorns: I was amazed that the author had managed to fill 700 or so pages without very much happening. I'm finding Jordan an increasingly undisciplined writer, lingering needlessly over various subplots without notably moving the overall story forward. I am also finding the characters stale and increasingly uninteresting (particularly Rand, who seems to do little but rage at everyone). Although some people admire Jordan for giving women a prominent role in his story, I am getting fed up with his corny war-of-the-sexes style of portraying relationships between men and women. Although I'll probably read the next installment, if there's not much more improvement he'll probably lose me before the end of this saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same ...","review":"Unfortuanately for fans of the Wheel of Time series, Robert Jordan is still up to his money grubbing tricks. Here's another large book filled with loads of detail about everything except the action - well, if there was some action, I'm sure he'd write loads of detail on it as well.This book continues the story of our heros spread all over the face of the world. With so many sub-plots, the book can only spend 40 or 50 pages each. With such a skimpy amount of material, we again are ripped off and left frustrated with the lack of progress.Don't waste your time with this book or this series any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, get on with it.....","review":"The last 2 books have been frustrating to say the least. I wade through tedious and uneventful situations to be rewarded with brief but brilliant sections that have me glued to the pages. RJ seems to either be searching for a decent conclusion to the WOT or milking it for all it's worth. As far as I'm concerned, you could have made this book 200 pages by just including the stuff that really advances the story. Part of RJ's talent is in character development but I REALLY don't need to read about Nynaeve tugging her braid anymore.So why am I eagerly awaiting #9?? Sucker for punishment, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Wheel of Time book yet!!!!!!!","review":"This book may be one of the shorter wheel of time novels but it is by far the best out of the series.

Jordan is a good writer but he's moving to slow. The book, the way it's going couldn't possibly be ended with any less than five more books. And is Rand going to go crazy or cleanse Saidin, becuase the way he's going he'll kill himself and everyone around him before Tarmon Gaidon ever comes, and Morainne, will she return when the horn blows or is she stuck in that wish world with Lanfear? good story but taking tooooooooooo Long"},{"rating":"1","title":"End the Torment!!!!","review":"Robert Jordan has put out 8 books in the WOT series.

I hope Jordan uses the money he \\"earns\\" from this book and takes some time off to consider the future of the series.

In this book our hero Rand Al Thor comes closer to meeting the \\"dark one\\" for the final showdown. Mr. Jordan has no problem with killing off inactive or even very active characters in the story. More and more Rand is compiling support for his final showdown. I think Jordan is saving the encounter for SHAOL GOULD although I could be wrong.

I read through the first 7 books in about 5 months and I loved every single one of them. The first book was the best, but the 5th and 6th books have been a drag to get through. The 7th book was good though. I expected the eighth book to be great too, but I ended up getting bored reading it. The story isn't that refreshing and exciting anymore. Maybe the reason that I don't like the 8th book is because my favorite character isn't in it. Matt, by far, is the best character in the entire series. He is funny and entertaining, but he doesn't get that many apperances in the series. Robert Jordan, put Matt in more scenes!

I started the series enjoying every book. But alas, I now curse the 'friend' who introduced the series to me. Jordan turned one of my favorite characters into a wimpering shadow of herself, and is taken up repeating himself. Has anyone noticed how even the picture of Robert Jordan has changed? I do believe he's a little too involved with his book. Has he taken on the ego of his main character? I'll take up reading his books again when I hear he's winding it up.

Much to my chagrin I had to leaf page after page reading fake girlish bickering looking for a resoolution of some conflict. Instead all was a mess of events. Did somebody edit the book as to make it more structured? Is Robert Jordan exploring his feminine side and oblitarating it? Is he writing only to fill pages hoping the quality of his first three books will carry him over a few more titles? That, ladies and gentlemen, is what was in my mind at the end of the book, and not at all the fate of any of the characters who have become mere cartoons in a mire of sameness.

The previous books were also set-up books to a great extent, but at least some things got resolved occasionally. In PoD RJ introduces a bunch of new plot lines and 100 new characters (most who will never be mentioned again). And he finishes off only the bowl-storyline which was dead to begin with.

Incredible!The first half of the book was pointless plodding, and introduction of a slew of minor characters we don't need to know about that cloud the issue. The Forsaken had maybe one chapter combined in this book, everything else was so much politics.The second half got a little better, but not by much. It picked things up a bit more, with some surprises thrown in, but it mostly read like a prologue to the next book, especially coming up towards the end.All I have to say is, if Jordan's Book 9 isn't any better than this, you can count me as one less loyal reader, with one less favorite author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the series","review":"This book literally made be stop reading the series. I did not pick it back up again for eight years, and can clearly see why I stopped on this one. There is no clear line of events in this story, it completely skips over continuing the most important events from the previous book, and has no climax, of any sort, at its end. The enemies are not clearly fleshed out, and when they do appear, you are left wondering what the heck they were doing before, because they just suddenly appear in the story out of nowhere.I am hoping this series picks up in the later books, because this is a far cry from the early books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"a load of rubbish","review":"This book is an absolute load of rubbish.

This series barely deserved to be a trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot go lower than one?","review":"Apparently my first review was far to strongly worded so they cut it. Nothing happens in this 'cash cow'.

I thought the first books were excellent and I have read them all more then once, but the last couple just don't have the same quality. That,and the fact that the wait between them is ridiculous in my opinion,will have me reading the reviews before I buy the next one. Hopefully the reason the latest edition is taking so long is because Mr. Jordan is taking the time to do it right,like he did in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complain,Complain,Complain","review":"I have to agree with Kalissa, this was a good book. For those of you who just like fast mind numbimg adventure with no plots or cant read over a 10th grade reading level,go read a Star Wars book for that kind of mindcandy. This series maybe long but it is not boring. Take the time to read and savior all the books in this world for you wont get this type of writing again...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and, for the most part, uneventful","review":"Jordan's latest is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise amazing series. The plot progression is painfully slow and most of the characters seemed to have learned, matured, and, in fact, accomplished little since the end of the last book. Regardless of the high quality of Jordan's past novels, I found that I was only struggling to finish this one so that I might have some continuity for the next in the series. After the last page of this tedious and sometimes even poorly written adventure, I am not sure that there will be a \\"next in the series\\" for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Are you ever going to finish this story? The first 3 or 4 books in this set are pretty good. But the last few,,,. How long is it going to take to finish this yarn, or yawn. I waited very patently for this one to come out, hoping this would be the last one, or at least a little more to than the last one. But no such luck. I will give it one more book to finish this tale, or I aint going to buy no more. I think Jordan is dragging this out for the money now and has lost sight of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it was a good series","review":"The Wheel of Time has been one of the most entertaining and engaging fantasy series that I have ever read. Path of Daggers, however, falls short of the high standard Jordan set with the first few books of the series. It seems that Jordan is unable or unwilling to complete a storyline; he jumps from sequence to sequence without resolving anything. While each storyline continues to be interesting, the sheer number of loose threads left hanging by the last three books detract from the story in general. I will continue to read the series, because it has shown so much promise, but this book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sales ranking 692","review":"And that is exactly what the publisher wants.

Characters that we care about have gotten mired in the growing complexity of the plot. This was an exceptionally vibrant series that I looked forward to the next installment with eager anticipation. Now it is just another series. If The Eye of the World had moved at the same rate as The Path of Daggers we'd still be waiting for our heroes to leave home and of course none of the other volumes would have been published because we wouldn't have cared. I still have hope for the next installment, the story can be saved. Mr. Jordan please listen to what your fans are saying in these reviews. We cared about this story but we are moving away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"when will enough be enough?","review":"Robert Jordan's style seems to be one of word counting, like he has a small plot for a book sets it down and then overfleshes it to bring up a word count.

Anyone got a spare silver bullet..might need that too....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get with the programe","review":"Mr. Jordan, please listen to the maoning fans who were longing for this book. Listen to the prayers of countless fans to do something with the interesting characters. We hoped for something good and snappy, not for a description of every grassy hill in West-by-South-West Nowhere where a group of non-personality women are walking to a place where they do something at the end of the book what they could've done in a paragraph of the first chapter!

Doctor Jordan, don't just stand there, operate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wall-denting speed record.","review":"I didn't even make it past the prologue of this book before it went flying toward my wall. Jordan's detailed descriptions have deteriorated into endless infodumps without relevance to the central story. One minor character looking at a group of other minor characters produces paragraphs of mind-bogglingly unnecessary factoids about each one.I pulled the book back out of my wall later on and randomly flipped through, only to see more of the same wretched wallowing in plotless \\"ambience\\".

Even the characters who supposedly serve the Light no longer communicate without brutalizing each other. Eventually they won't speak at all, they'll just spank out Morse code on each other's backsides. Is it asking too much that our heroes smile once in a while? All the joy has gone out of the series. Rand is acting more like the Forsaken than the Dragon Reborn, and his friends are focused on intimidating their companions. Where are the friendly Ogier, with their beautiful steddings? And where's Mat? No doubt spanking some Seanchan princess and getting involved in Seanchan politics about which we will read 700 pages worth in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Okay, this one put me to sleep and there's only a few weeks more to wait for #9. The cover is bad as usual, with this hobbit-like creature tramping through the snow. We are told it is Perrin, and at long last proof that Jordan's been putting us all on. Perrin is so often described as having shoulders so wide they make him appear shorter, but there's certainly no evidence in the pic of this little dude on the cover. Check it: Ogiers are 10' tall, but a foot in WOT is ten inches. So, that makes the average male Ogier 8'4\\" or so, and since we are CONSTANTLY told they stand at least half as tall again as the tallest male Aiel...this makes a tall Aiel 5'6\\" or thereabouts. Rand is therefore about 5'2\\" or 5'3\\", and Perrin and Mat well under five feet tall. Hobbits. Tall hobbits to be sure, but hobbits nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"POD Shocker","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. It's the only book I have ever had to chuck in the bin. It's a shocker! I got to about page 400 and had had enough, unfortunately, I chipped the paintwork on my wall where the corner of the book hit it. This author needs a good editor very very badly. Maybe this guy thinks he doesn't need an editor,that every line he writes is pure magic. He's sadly wrong. The book is boring, agonisingly detailed beyond reason and he repeats himself over and over and over again.I can't believe some people are giving this 4 and 5 stars. It should get none! This book could have been written in about 100 pages and that would have been to long. The series looked like it was going to be a classic - what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?","review":"After a few hundred pages of this one I just got fed up.

My brother now only reads WOT when someone else buys it.I used to re-read the entire series to date whenever a new title was released - about once a year. Re-reading Book 7 & 8 last took almost a month each - compared to an average 3 nites for a new book and a week for re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the whole flaming series, use your imagination","review":"What Jordan wrote in 600+ pages, I can write in one page. For those who haven't read PoD, I have given exactly what happens in the next few lines--- ............................................................................................... ......................................................................................................... That's it, NOTHING! It is so irritating to find that you've waited 2yrs for a book and nothing happens. The book spans about 1.5 weeks (WoT measurement). I read the reviews saying it was pathetic, but nevertheless being a die hard RJ fan (not any more) I bought the book. The people who gave it 4 *'s or more say he's building character, actually they're losing it and becoming people with zero personalities. The main element of humor in the story - Matrim Cauthon - is forgotten This may be explained that he's on his way across the Aryth Ocean. I suggest you use your imagination to finish the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"reread the book again","review":"ok, i like everyone else was very disappointed in jordans lastest addition to the series when I bought it. However, after I read it, decided to go through all over again and start from book one and go on. For the next month and a half I was literally immersed in Jordans series as I picked up one book after another. I got to the last book and it was good. Because I had read it immediately after putting down the seventh the plot was all very fresh in my head and everything fitted together, i know its time consuming but try it, you wont be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up.","review":"While I never thought the Wheel of Time series was anything utterly extraordinary, the first three or so volumes were a fairly good read.

This is the last one I'm reading, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurry up & end it already!","review":"The story is getting stale & redundant.

I wished I'd never gotten the first book, because my insatiable human curiosity now drives me to see if Jordan ever recovers his initial promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a big author now I'll sacrifice my writing to make money","review":"It seems to me that Jordan no longer cares about his the wheel of time, that is why he keeps drawing this series out, just to make more money. Now that he is a popular author he even prolongs releasing his books so he can write a bunch of garbage books for people to buy while waiting for the next book in the wheel of time. I hope he hurry up and finishes the series, before it gets worse, because this series used to be my favorite since tolkien, and I would recommend it to everyone, now its just a bunch of jumbled crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is like LAAAG","review":"I'm a fan of the series, but this one sucked. It is a plug in between books, an attempt to drag out the series to the 10 books Jordan wants. If he didn't keep introducing sh!t it could have been done in 5 books. THAT is a good lenght. The only other author i know of that did 10 is L. Ron Hubbard, and most people finished that just so that they wouldn't wonder what happened to the characters, not to read a finalle to a good seires. That is what I think is going to happen to Jordan.(Expalining the comment above, the lag thing, it's like playing a really good game of quake2 on the net then being interupted by a period where nothing moves, then everything comes back and you find that you've been killed twice.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the WORST","review":"This book was terrible in every aspect imaginable. Im done with this once innovative and interesting series. It's turned into worthless drivel.

To name a few, RA Salvatore, Allan Cole and Chris Bunch, David Eddings, Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, and of course, Jordan. His first six books were gripping masterpieces. However, in the last two, his story has gone downhill. I would not recommend Path of Daggers to ANYone. Absolutely NOTHING happened with Mat, the most interesting character, and nothing really happened with Saldaea! Jordan tried to substitute introducing some new characters and new concepts (untying weaves? That was just contrived.) for an actual plot. Raymond E Feist's magical realms of mystery, Terry Goodkind's interesting characters, and Allan Cole and Chris Bunch's sweeping epic fantasy worlds all now outdo this series. Sorry Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty filth","review":"boring, pointless waste of a book that could have been condensed into a couple chapters. hope the next one is more like the earier books in the series. if not, then im through with this soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Interesting","review":"Perusing through the hundreds of \\"Customer Comments\\" I've realized something very interesting. If PoD is so bad, and the Wheel of Time series is going so far down, why is it that there is 1100+ comments on it, when the legendary Tolkien only has 290. R.R. Martin's latest has 30+, Terry Goodkind's 50+ There sure are a lot of people taking time out of their days to comment on this book. That in itself is indicative of how influential this series is.Something to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Satisfying Weekend","review":"PoD, like all of the WOT series, is immersed with creative imagery, enticing plots and a wonderful medium in which to lose yourself. Unlike the preceding books however, it lacks character development and the story lines, which normally progress quite nicely, are slowed to a crawl. Many of the characters are in the same standing at the end of the book as they are at the beginning. Despite that, I gave this book 4 stars. It is just as intriguing and entertaining as the first book, and like all of the rest I will read and reread it over and over. Besides, Robert still has credit from the preceding books. And to all of the cynics out there, you wouldn't have read this book if you didn't like \\"something\\" about the preceding. This book has that same \\"something\\", that is so hard to explain. If it's not up to the usual RJ standards, neither are all of the other books that are being released today. Keep up the good work RJ.Eagerly awaiting the next,"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a Dagger in the back.","review":"I have now made myself read all eight of Jordon's enormous books and still have not found one character I can say I truly care about. What even surprises me more is the great reviews he has gotten in the past as well as the comparison's to Tolkien which are a complete travesty to the fantasy genre. The only thing that has kept me reading his books is the wonderfull concepts and great description that Jordon applies to each book. If he had characters with more depth then I could honestly say this series was a classic but sadly he has written another flat book in a tiring series. I would recommend anyone looking to see what real characters are like, combined with great ideas and description to check out George R.R. Martin's, A Song of Ice and Fire, which is the best series of the decade and the only fantasy series I would even mention in the same breath as J.R.R Tolkien."},{"rating":"1","title":"==-- More like a 604-page prologue to book 9. --==","review":"You can just tell from this book that Robert is either A) trying to milk the series for the full 12 books, or B) dropping a subtle hint to TOR that he's sick of writing this series. The book was slow, sluggish, and painful. Where I may have finished Lord of Chaos in 2 days, It took me 3 weeks to finish this, having to convince myself several times that I wanted to finish it. It was more of a : \\"The sooner you read it, the sooner you won't have to deal with it anymore and you can stick it on your shelf to forget about it.\\" He spent more time describing horses and cleavage than writing an interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to all of the characters???","review":"Okay RJ. I like your books. Really. I just can't help getting bored or lost. Even in the 2nd and 3rd books (which I really enjoyed) I could skip a few pages and not miss a thing, but now...I'm kind of confused. I just can't keep up with all of these characters. I always end up looking in the glossary of the old books to identify the returning characters because you went and shrank it when we needed it the most. WHERE IS MAT? WHERE IS MOIRAINE(sp)? HOW COME NYNAEVE IS ACTING SO STUPID? SHE USED TO BE KIND OF COOL. I really love your books JR and you've totally hooked me. Can we have some kind, any kind, of conclusion to any of the little plots now? I'm losing track and, from the looks of the these reviews, lots of other people are too.

I have turned dozens and dozens of people onto the once great epic of \\"The Wheel of Time\\". Unfortunately Robert Jordan is obviously beginig to milk this best selling series for all it is worth, simply because he knows that people will buy it. What is worth more Mr. Jordan? Money, or your reputation as one of the worlds greatest fantasy authors? Hopefully the next book will come a little sooner, and make a little headway into the plot.

Where was I going with that?","review":"It seems as though Jordan had no idea what he was getting himself into when he started this series. I think that it is apparent that he certainly had no idea how this series was going to really end. Really what has happened here is that he's spread himself too thin. If you're an author you know that you don't introduce charicters, develop them and then never talk about them again. As I was reading this book I just kept thinking to myself \\"he's bumbling around... Trying to figure out where he's going.\\" Think about it, the book took almost an entire year longer than expected and then it just plain sucks! Talk about a writer's block.

I'm getting really sick of reading about how tough Rand is, and how cold Lan is. I don't mind a good plot, but nothing at all happens in this book! It's all talk--nobody does anything! Try George RR Martin, or anything, but don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use your own judgement","review":"It seems Robert Jordan cannot do right by anyone. People praise him for writing and developing interesting characters in complicated plots and then turn around a critize him for introducing the many secondary characters needed to have these complicated plots. They praise him for his attention to detail, but berate him for the few extra words needed to have that detail.This is a good book! It definitely could not stand alone, but that is only because it is the 8th book in a wonderfully coordinated series. If you enjoyed the series so far, you should enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but Jordan is a D*MN sight above the rest.","review":"I have read all of Jordan's books several times. This book is a little slower than the others, but he is clearly setting the stage for the next book. For those who want to cry about it, GROW UP!! Life isn't always one crisis after another.

Robert Jordan is head and shoulders above any other fantasy author out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was ripped off!","review":"I believe I have been ripped off by both Robert Jordan and TOR Publishing...This book deserves the title (coined by an earlier reviewer) \\"Path of Dollars!\\" I will not buy another hardcover from this publisher.Mr Jordan's imagination for this series is obviously exhausted. He has lost the sparkle and enthusiasm of the earlier volumes.To quote another reviewer, the WOT series has become the 'Waste of Time' series."},{"rating":"2","title":"how's it going to end","review":"originally the series was only supposed to have 8 books. However jordan decided to extend it when the plot became too complicated or possibly when the books started to make money. Now it does not look like all the loose ends can be tied up in less than 12 books. It is slow reading. Rand isn't introduced until halfway through the book. Mat never even made an appearance. Although the book was very slow it did provide a level of detail and complexity that is wonderful. The series would probably be better if all the books were written at this pace. However I don't know how much longer the series can hold interest. And I fear to predict that the series will end abruptly without any clear resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ultimately frustrating reading experience","review":"Reading the other reviews posted, I felt that many of Robert Jodan's fans feel the same way I do. That is I wish he would just get on with it. The first 2 or 3 books in the series were rattling good yarns, full of excitement and adventure, and populated with appealing characters you could really relate to. However the last couple of books seem be to little more than an exercise in literary torture for his long suffering fans. Basically PoD does little to further an already convoluted plot. The main characters are increasingly irritating and unpleasant(or left out all together)while the plot, such as it is, just goes around in circles, with out really achieving anything. Robert Jordan really needs to look at what has happened to the series over the past few years and work at restoring it to the intreguing tale which sucked us all in some 10 years ago"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to my expectations","review":"Jordan did not continue the plots that he had set up in the earlier books, and instead laid new ones out. He, as most have said, could have written it in about 1/10 or less of the pages he used. It seems as if he is just trying to make people buying the books to find out what happens instead of doing it to continue the story. It lacked very much but if you have been following the series then you should but it just so you learn the little bit that he reveals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrath of Raggers","review":"Two words perfectly describe this book: women talking.

Geez! I could say this all in two words--Where's Mat? My favorite character has disappeared off the face of the earth! The plot goes nowhere! The only thing new happening is there's a snow storm and Rand's going mad. I was SEVERELY disappointed by this junk. Frankly, I got more out of reading the dust jacket than the book. The plot goes nowhere, only leads to more complexities, and nothing is cleared up. AND WHERE'S MAT? You leave him dying and maybe captured by Seanchan, and everyone's hanging onto what's going to happen, and DON'T EVEN MENTION HIM! I was lucky I got this book at the library instead of wasting money on buying it. Frankly, the only use I can see for it is to burn it. The other seven books were wonderful; this one, a five -year-old could have written better.

All the women have become the same annoying, bickering, snooty idiots. Rand is nothing but a moody, unpleasant person. Where's Matt? Perrin, like everyone else, is doing nothing in meaningless, wordy splendor. All the women continue to cross their arms under their breasts, sniff, look down thier noses, and pull on their braids. Hey Robert, how about having them do something interesting, like in the first books of this series? It started out so great. Now it is a sad, pitiful, bloated, aimlessly wandering monstrosity. Mr. Jordan has clearly lost his edge. I am greatly saddened that I just don't care what happens to these people any more. Probably because nothing has happend for a long, long time. I have great respect for TOR. I am greatly suprised that they published this sorry excuse for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"A story has a beginning, a middle and an end. For the WoT series we've got an 8 book begining, no middle and no end in sight. This book has 600 pages of character development. It has no plot and does nothing to advance the over all storyline. A storyline which has become so bloated that I'm not sure Jordan will ever be able to resolve all of the plots and sub-plots. If you're hooked, wait until it's out in paperback, or better yet wait until it's in the library. If you haven't started the series, DON'T. Personaly I don't intend to buy another WoT book until Jordan finishes the series, assuming that ever happens. For now I give PoD and the WoT series zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, Please let it end.","review":"Do not buy this book. If you have to because like me you got hooked on the previous books, wait for the soft cover. Send the difference in price to your favorite charity. I bet you'll feel that your money was better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Path of Daggers Disappoints","review":"While I love this series, I did not like this book. Jordan spent too much time describing how foolish and childish Nynaeve has become with her constant pouting & worrying over Lan -- 50 pages of this would've been more than sufficient rather than the 500 to which Jordan subjects the reader.I agree with many of the other reviews that Vol 8 fails to advance the series. The ending lacked any drama -- Egwene's troop should've strung her up by her heels if she'd decided to trek across the face of the planet rather than to Travel to Tar Valon. Instead, everyone thought her decision to Travel some suprising stroke of genius. Let's see, drag an army across 1000 miles of snow & ice or get there in an instant, REAL tough choice.I can't believe I waited 2 yrs & paid the hardcover premium for this book. While I'll read #9 (if it ever comes out), I will not buy the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfullfilling","review":"Robert Jordan is my absolute favorite writer. His ability to perfectly translate what his characters are thinking and feeling on to common paper is, to me, amazing. I must have read the first six books a dozen times. The last two though, and in particular The Path of Daggers nigh on put me to sleep every time I looked at them. Jordan alienated me from my favorite character,Rand, by making his actions and thought prosses so distant from those he had in the other books. It was as if someone else stole into Jordan's office and ruined the most important character in the book. Also, almost NOTHing was said about Mat, my second favorite charater. So, all-in-all, i'd have to say that this book failed to deliver the kind of story we all expect from Jordan. Especially after making us wait for close to TWO YEARS for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Too many boulders to a false summit\\"","review":"Reading this latest episode reminded me alot of climbing a mountain made up entirely of very large boulders that are both tiring and tedious to climb over.It is obvious that Robert Jordan knows his stuff, but the episodes are beginning to read like the scientific journals that students have to plod through for their extra credit papers. Even the beginning of the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series was very detailed with considerable jumps from one situation to another, but the whole of the story was distinct. I found it an engaging read once I \\"got into it\\". The problem is I no longer can get into it. I am eager for this author to finish the sequence and to write something fresh with the engrossing qualities found in \\"The Eye of the World\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start","review":"I'm 100 pages in Path of Daggers and slogging painfully through it page by page. I thought I'd check with my fellow Jordan fans to see if this is a shortcoming of mine. Apparently not. Reading time is too precious to waste on something so unsatisfying, but if it's a part of the big picture, I may have to slog on. What to do, what to do..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't hit a homerun every time.","review":"After an eternity of wait the eigth installment of the world of time series has got to be the worst out of all the books in the series. I remember thinking when I recieved the book I wanted to finish as soon as possible. After the first hundred pages it was a pain to keep reading it, I put it down and forgot it for a few weeks and finally got around to reading it. It was a chore to read and I think that RJ is beginning to think it's a chore to write. If your a fan you hope the next will redeem the series. If this is the first book you read in the series, please don't let it stop you from reading the greatest series of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-read the friggen books!!!","review":"I haven't read all the reviews, but some people have probably mentioned this--Start at the begining and read all of the books in order. You will see that this novel lacks in action the most--but in character and plot set up it is the best. this is the beginning of the end. this will be the most important book in the series because all events from this point on will have there crux in this book. So what if no major phrophases (can't spell) came true? No Mat in this one? Where was Perrin in Fires From Heaven?All books up to this one have been getting us to the top of the first hill on the roller coaster, we're now at the top boys and girls, hang on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually two hundred pages short!","review":"TPoD is the most disappointing of the WoT series because it had potential that did not get realized. The Rebels v. the Red Tower, the Black Tower v. the Aes Sedai, the unification of the Borderlands under the Dragon banner, the (probable) abduction of Mat to Seanchan; all these plotlines were left dangling but at least some should have and could have been, to a degree, resolved. This chapter also had the weakest ending of any of the WoT books, weaker even than ACoS. If you're going to write the longest fantasy epic ever, put some more meat in it as we head (hopefully) toward a conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Who are all these people? I forgot. I've read this entire series twice, and by the time I get to Path of Daggers, I've already forgotten who everybody is. Most people don't even make it past Fires of Heaven, the legendary \\"most boring book in the entire series.\\" The man's descriptions and syntax are disturbingly akward for an author who has put out eight books. Jordan's got me \\"chasing the Dragon\\", so to speak, and I must read on to the end, but please, god, let the end be soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neverending story","review":"There is absolutely NOTHING happening in this book. And it is a real letdown after the previous seven books in The Wheel of Time-serie. Robert Jordan has done one thing: written 650 pages to satisfy the most eager 'fans' until he can come up with something interesting again. The pity off all this is that I know I will buy the next book too. But if he does not come up with an ending to this saga of his in the space of two more books, I promise to spend my money on something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring boring -just get on with it Robert!","review":"The least the author could do for us hapless readers (why oh why do I keep on reading them) is to supply a decent and updated cast of characters for each new book. Frankly I've forgotten who is who and why etc etc. The timeline is depressingly slow, a day's reading and barely a day has gone by in the book. There is such a thing as too much detail. My only consolation is that I have never bothered to acutally buy any of the books - accessing them from my local library instead. With Path of Daggers I find I am forcing myself to finish it. Dull as ditchwater - I really don't think I could be bothered to read anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough is enough","review":"I started reading the Wheel of Time series in 1994, and I have remained a devout follower ever since. Robert Jordan has a gift with words, but now, even his gift is floundering. The tale is old and stale. Ever since his fifth book, nothing has really happened. This series was supposed to end in eight, but now I do not know if it will ever end but I must say that this serious is like a sick dog--it needs to be put to death. I doubt that I'll bother with the series now. If you are interested in good writing, there are several talented authors out there. Robin Hobb, Terry Goodkind, Elizibeth Haydon, JV Jones. . . Robert Jordan is a good author, but the tale is old and stale, and we learned absolutely nothing in this latest installment. It seems that he is more interested in making money than writing good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is boring, and at this pace who rememb. the prelude","review":"I expected more from Jordan, if he wants to expand the plot to such a threadfull pattern, than he should publish his books a little faster. Maybe concentrating on one main character for the length of the book is a better recipe for success. Since it seems that the tapestry Jordan is weaving has too many multicolored threads that pull at the eye first one way and then another without ever focussing on the complete pattern.Mr. Jordan, put the flair of the first four books back into the series or lose a great deal of respect from your readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"Like many of the other Jordan fans, I was anxiously anticipating the arrival of this book, only to find that it was a waste of time and money.The storyline positively stagnates. There was nothing in this book that required an entire book to be written about it. This book was about 600 pages worth of bun, but \\"where's the beef?\\" Where was Mat for that matter? (not that having Mat in this book would have saved it, but it might have enhanced it in some ways)I can only hope that in the remainder of the series Jordan can recapture that special !umphh! in his writing that drew his fans to this series in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, enough is enough","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer, who said Enough is Enough. This is the last book I'll read in this series. Nothing happened in this book. Even if you plan on reading the following books in the series, skip this one.Read the fantasy series by Terry Goodkind, instead. It's far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review by a 12 year old kid","review":"I thought that this book and the whole series was great! Some People in my class think that I'm weird because I like reading these big books,but I don't care because there so interesting. The books were so good because Robert Jorden always has something new happening. He always had it were as soon as something in the story finished some new devopment would appear,such as the Seanchan(the decendents of Artur Hawkwing's armies sent across the sea)invading Ebou Dar. And Rand Al'thor(the Dragon Reborn)had to go and stop them. Also someone would never expect that he had Callandor with him. I've collected and read all the books in the series, and I can't wait for the next book,Winter's Heart, to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it!","review":"I loved the first 4 books, but the writing in the last two books almost seem as if a ghost writer has moved in. If Jordan continues making his women so ridiculous, stupid and cruel, I may never read past the next book. Does Jordan have an ending in mind or is he just going to keep making all women dispicable, all men crazy and introducing more boring characters that go nowhere?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not getting any better...","review":"I only read this book because a I like the overall series, (or at least the first 6 books), I really hate Nyanave, she's very irritating and hypocritical, and after reading the series 3 times, she's even more anoying than ever. I don't really mind that the series is so long but to wait a year and a half for each book is ridiculus and when the book does arrive it's not up to the previous standards is disapointing.All his female charachters should stop sniffing all the time. Please don't put Jordan in the same league as David Eddings and Terry Goodkind, those guys were such \\"child - young adult\\" writers.I do like Jordan I gave the whole series 5 stars but he just lost it in the last 2 books and i hope he will get better, but realistickly don't see it happening. Get the story moving already Jordan. I'll still read the next one the sucker that I am. Excuse my disorganized writing but didn't feel like writing any better for you guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop complaining!!","review":"What is it with you guys? What do you think, that the series is too long? From what I heard, that is exactly what you think. Well, I REALLY disagree. If you think that the series is to long, than stop reading or buying the book. I like the series, and I hope that it will last untill the 15th book or so. I mean, he isn't even CLOSE to confronting the Dark One. The Aes Sedai hasn't bowed to him yet. So STOP COMPLAINING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have loved all of the books in the Wheel of Time series, but what happened with this one? Only the last quarter was Robert Jordan in true fashion. The first 3/4 was dribble. This could have been one of the most interesting of the series, but he blew it. I hope he's more focused with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUITE POSSIBLY: \\"THE WORST EVER...\\"","review":"Well Mr.Jordan... You've really done it this time. Not only had I had suspicions of you having \\"writer's block,\\" but with this novel you have proven it! I must say I'am getting slowly drawn away from your series by Martin's \\"Game Of Thrones\\" and \\"Clash of Kings.\\" If you don't hurry up and end this series... you'll never write again! What happended to the good old days like: The Eye Of the World, or Fires of Haven, or any of the first 5? It's pretty obviously we love your writing, but, seriously, HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO WAIT. You must either end the series or start writing somemore of that quality that you use to write.NO MENTION OF MAT, WHAT SO EVER! YOU JUMPED FROM PLOT TO PLOT WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATIONS! YOU GAVE US NO NEW INFORMATION ON ANYTHING OR ANYONE (other than the Neblis) that MAKES ANY SENCE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bridge","review":"Not as good as the others. It simply wan't as big as Eye of the World, or Lord of Chaos. It was by no means bad, just not big. Much like the Dragon Reborn in that I think it links two larger things together. It seems like it is setting up for something big. This book wasn't bad, just not as exceptional as the others. Moved slower, but still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Yet","review":"I just finished this book and I feel that it was the worst Wheel of Time yet. I was immediately hooked by The Eye of the World and obsessively devoured each book since then. Halfway trough this book I was bored to tears. Absoutely NOTHING happens in this book. My favorite carachter Mat is only breifly mentioned. The plot goes absolutely nowhere. Get on with it already Jordan. I'm starting to wonder how long this series is going to on. At this rate I think we're looking at at least 12-15 volumes in this series if the plot keeps advancing at this rate. None of the major plot points are even addressed. Before I started reading this book I actually said to myself that Egwene better realize Halima's true Identity or I would be very disappointed and sure enough I was. If I hadn't ivested so many hours(and so much money)reading the other seven I'd Have quit halfway through. Iexpect alot more from the next edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move the Story Along","review":"Having seen other reviews, I was prepared for the worst. I bought the book anyway and read it on a plane. It was not as good as some of the earlier stories, but was still interesting. Jordan really needs to pick up the pace by either writing faster (2 more year wait?) or move the story along. I just can't wait until 2010 for the last book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Others have been a little harsh.","review":"I love the wheel of time series and this is the weakest in the series. Not because it is badly written but because it is incomplete, the first few chapters should have been in a crown of swords and the book should at least have had a definate ending like the rest of the series, I felt I had read half a book. Despite those faults it is very good and a lot of important things happen. I hope a winters heart resolves a lot of the hanging threads this book leaves as there are so many. Is Rand coming down with the wasting sickness what will happen to Faile. Will Gawyn stand with or against Egwene. And most importantly where is Matt. Path of daggers is excellent its also very irritating, roll on november"},{"rating":"1","title":"takes dogged determination","review":"Way back when Robert Jordan started this series with Eye of the World, it was great reading. A truly original, epic fantasy. I continue to plod doggedly through these dogs, trying to get to the conclusion, but really I'm going on sheer determination to finish the series now. I'd recommend Eye of the World very highly to any fan of epic fantasy. I frankly have forgetten where the series dropped into intellectual neutral, but I think the next two or three books were pretty good. After that though, you've got to be prepared for some tough going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel building the plot","review":"There have been a lot of relatively poor reviews for this book most of which are related to the length of the series and the tedious nature of the plot. The point is that this is a huge series and a book like this was necessary to bring some of the plotlines together. There is really little point in reading this book without reading the rest of the series first , and for those who think the whole series too long yes its hateful having to wait a year for the next part of the story but i also would like to see most of the plotlines concluded in some fashion and the only way this is going to happen is with 3 - 5 more books. Also if its that annoying then its obviously worth waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from someone who WON'T read this book!","review":"Thank all of you for saving me from wasting many useful hours of my life on more of Jordan's plodding work! I am glad I read the reviews before I went out and bought it... I am so sick of his characters, especially the annoying man-hating women. If you want to read a good fantasy book, drop Jordan and check out:Rhapsody: Child of Blood (by Elizabeth Haydon) or A Game of Thrones (by George R.R. Martin)You'll see from everyone's reviews on Amazon.com that these books are well worth your time!Do what I did - kick the Jordan habit! You'll respect yourself more if you never read another WOT book =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"What can I say? Nothing happens. Unfortunately, this is the Jordan standard now. Don't look for anything more after this. Only us psychos keep hanging on."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may read this book once, but probably never again.","review":"The Wheel of Time series keeps rolling, but never gets anywhere. But what is worse is that when you get to the end of one of the books you really don't feal any desire to pick it back up and read it again. I have read Lord of the Rings I don't know how many times, and will probably read it again. But having read every one of Wheel of Time books I feel little if any inclination to read any of them again. This seems to get worse as the series goes on. The books are long, and nothing happens. You are tantalized with hints and fore shadowing galore, but in the end you right back where you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan streches our Imaginations and his Purse","review":"I am a great fan of the Wheel of Time series, but Path of Daggers is without a doubt the slowest and possibly the worst book in the series so far. It dodders, stumbles and falls flat on its face mainly because about two incidents of any note take place in this story. The rest of the book seems to be just rubbish where nothing of any import is happening to fill up gaps. I think this was the reason the book seemed so laborious and slow-going. The story-line gave a feeling of being artificially stretched and the style of writting seemed different too. It was bleaker and there was a distinct lack of humor unlike in the rest of the series. I must admit the ending was rather promising but apart from that it seems Jordan is streching the story for the sake of streching it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty Pleasures","review":"Perhaps this is more of a commentary on the state of fantasy than the quality of Path but I quite enjoyed Jordan's latest . I would like to see more coherant plot development and dread the ever increasing liklihood of falling into the Star Trek syndrome (The rush to tie up all the loose ends in the final 1000 pages - give or take an order of magnitude). But, I got my moneys worth (In hardcover even). As an admited fantasy junkie I'll keep buying until my friends perform an intervention. But, hey, It could be worse. i know people that actually like Steven King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst WoT book Yet","review":"I started reading this series about two months ago, and got deeply hooked in the first few books. Then, the quality degenerated rapidly. The novels got shorter, and the plot development by page went down. Trivial matters are given dozens of pages while the important issues are either put into a paragraph or stretched out beyond belief. If you've already started, you might as well read to this one, if anything will put you off the series, this is it. If you haven't read WoT, I would recommend you read the first book, then stop there since the ending is conclusive, and you won't have to read through the pages of drivel inherent in the later novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I am an avid fan of the wheel of time series and literally drove the local bookstore owner mad asking when this item would be relaesed so you can imagine my disapointment upon reading it.This book does not add anthing new to the story nor does it resolve anything. After seven books building up the story I am starting to wonder if Jordon is just going to string us along forever or if he is going to give us the monumental disapointment found in another (lets not name names) that builds up the story over a number of volumes and resolves 30 years of plot in a single final chapter.While this book might be good in itself as some people have suggested. Fans such as myself know that it is a huge let down of Jordan's usual standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wheel becomes a downward spiral...","review":"The 1600+ reviews of this book are truly a tribute to Robert Jordan's popularity as an author. Unfortunately the last couple books, Path of Daggers especially, have merely been a tribute to his ability to write garbage and still make money, and I mean truckloads of money. After getting hooked on the first five books, most of us seem to be in it until the end, always hoping that with the NEXT book, this series will return to it's former glory.I use to love Jordan's descriptive writing and tangled web of subplots. Now it's just getting tiresome as each book moves more slowly than the last. PoD basically grinds to a halt. There's still enormous potential in the series. Let's hope Jordan reaches it before the end. Let's hope he reaches the end before he dies of old age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words, words, words","review":"Mr. Jordan should be grateful for the many young people who read his books. But he should make an attempt at writing as if he were still hungry. He might pick up adults who want intelligent, well-crafted stories. By about book five my fingers itched to pick up a pen and edit. The people of Tor should fire every editor they have if this is what they let slip through their hands. The Path of Daggers ground to a halt. Jordan is windy, his women are whiney, his men are boys, and I'm getting very tired of everyone with attitudes. Perhaps instead of a review I should have edited the book down to it's bones. One thousand words would about do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's only getting worse...","review":"I have always enjoyed this series, but this book has almost pushed me over the edge. I'm seriously considering not buying any of the rest of the series. The first 3 books were good; the second 3 were acceptable; and the rest have been a waste of the paper they were printed on. Save yourself the expense and just wait until your local library is throwing their copy out in another 5 years, if you're desperate to read it.Of course, I'm aware that if you're reading the reviews of a book that is 8th in a series, you've probably already read the others and are addicted. But I think you'd be better off spending your money joining a twelve-step program to overcome your addiction to Robert Jordan than you would be buying this book. Don't do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately the weakest in the series","review":"I looked forward to this but as much as I wanted to love this book- i just couldn't. As we've been seeing with the last few books too so many incredible characters it is like reading 5-9 books- and confusing! Jordon barely even touches on a few characters/topics that were so important in previous books. Plus nothing major happens! I hope the next book starts to tie up some of the sub plots so we can start focusing on a big finale. If number 9 doesn't do that, walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening continuation","review":"Frankly if you haven't started this series DON'T it isn't worth the irratation. After much thought and having reread of the entire series I find this book very disturbing. The writing itself is about on par with the rest of the series but it seems there is little chance this series will ever end. This is largely because for every piece of plot development there are two new twists or subplots developed; after eight books this is ridiculous. The lack of resolution makes this a very disappointing book. One has to wonder if the author has any real design or overall plan in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but can get better","review":"This is a great book but it can be a bit better. Rand is becoming a bit crazy and his male Aes Sedai are going crazy too. Nothing really happens in this book. It mainly tells you about what's going to happen or might happen. Hopefully, book nine will finally tell us what the hell is going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the story is...","review":"It would appear that Mr. Jordan is letting the Wheel of Time go 'round and 'round. It's time to either change the wheel or let it come full circle. It's been fun and exciting, but this one has a few broken spokes. I must agree with previous readers...it's not what I had expected and I'm truly disappointed that there wasn't some conclusion to any of the mini-dramas. Even the ending was so so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read","review":"Robert Jordan has a wonderful knack for drawing his readers into the epic nature of any tail. When things happen, the reader beholds them as events that thunder as they unfold. I love his style, and I love his character development. Path of Daggers exceeds my expectation, as is usual for RJ's WoT series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Another great book in the series. I powered through this without wanting to put it down. On another note it is a bit slower than some of the previous ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Path Of Daggers Book 8","review":"I loved this series up until book 7 then it seemed like Jordan decided to stretch it out for more cash. I got halfway through this book and closed it - never to read another book by Jordan. Very sad, it could have been one of the best series ever if he would have kept it to 7 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let your frustration blind you","review":"I admit I was as dissapointed and the rest of you when I didn't get the earth shattering revelations and events that I had been waiting for in this book. That does not however take away from the fact that this is a really great book centered around the politics of the land and full of intrigue and character development. If you haven't already read this book, you won't reget it.And to the people who would critisize this book I would say reread the entire series and you will see that this is by no means a filler book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed yet still eager for the next book.","review":"I read the book before reading a single review and am sad to say I agree with the general feelings about this book. We can't all be wrong Mr. Jordan. After reading it I was very disappointed. Seemed like nothing more than an 800 page set up for the next (and hopefully better) book. Sadly I would have gotten as much out of it to just read a brief synopsis of the plot and saved myself some money. And for God's sake do something about the cover art, not to mention the pitiful illustrations of \\"The World Of\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series continues to slow...","review":"I expected to be disappointed with this book, and was. The series gets progressively worse with each book, with nothing noteworthy happening in the eighth volume. Sometimes I think the only reason I continue to read them is because I already have so much time invested.Hardly anything of importance takes place in this book. Mat, one of the central characters from the series, despite being in a precarious situation at the end of volume seven isn't written of at all. The only good thing is there's much less rehashing of prior events than in past volumes.I come away feeling ripped off after a lousy book with a lousy beginning, middle, and end. The book makes me want to say \\"blah, blah, blah\\"! Jordan cheapens himself as the money continues to roll in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it...read it...filed it...bummed about it.","review":"I look forward to all of Jordan's volumes in this series, but I must say that this is his \\"Search for Spock.\\" Nothing much happens and what does happen is a yawner.

Oh well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fer Crying out Loud","review":"All things considered, if I wanted to make a book exactly the same. I'd take one of the great novels, rip out pages at random, and then chop it in half. His endearing charecters have lost their spark, and his emerging creations are more deformed than a straw through a meat grinder. I mean, for TDR, I was really hooked! This one I would rather put through the spokes of my bike, except that would be a waste of a perfectly good wheel. I pity the trees that were destroyed for this bunch of crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no end in sight.","review":"I like Robert Jordan's writing, but this is too much! What happened to the plot? In his last couple of books, almost nothing has happened! The first three books in the series were masterful, but now, I get the dreadful feeling that Jordan is merely trying to milk it at the expense of his series. A book needs to tell a story, on its own, and this book, like his last three, failed to do that. He needs to remember that these should be stand alone novels, each linked to one another, yet having a plot, a theme, a climax, and a conclusion all on their own. He, like David Eddings, seems to have lost his edge and his imagination. Only his characters and writing ability have kept me to this series, but to be honest, I am running out of patience. End it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Boring, cliched, derivative. The first few books in the WoT series held marginal promise, but PoD is ridiculous. For literate, intelligent Fantasy, try an author like George RR Martin or Stephen R.

He has created a world with such detail and definition that it is believable. When I pick up his book at night, I am quickly engrossed in Andor and forget I am on earth in my bed. To a author of fantasy, I would see this as the ultimate in compliments. No other book has given me what Jordan has in this series. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's just a prelude to book 10","review":"a book should be able to stand on its own two feet, reguardless if it's part of a larger series. this book, obviously can't do that, and anyone who thinks it can is dilluding themselves. for a better series check out terry goodkinds's 'sword of truth'. it's a great series, but also each book can stand alone and be a wonderful read. instead of wasting your time on these 'chapters' of the series, which jordan calls books, move on to an author whom isn't so influeced by the process of milking-money. anyone wants to argue with me: bring it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with this empty book because it was BORING!!!!!","review":"The book was completely pointless the characters did even move it was one the most boring book I have ever read and I am not sure if I will buy the next. It made the bestseller list but if you want to look at real writer. People should check George RR Martin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent drawing with words. Makes mind views easy.","review":"\\"The Path of Daggers\\" is a perfect flow from \\"A Crown of Swords\\". Mr. Jordan has again proven himself a master word-crafter. His sceneries are all excellent examples of drawing with words. Whether he is describing a street in \\"Ebu Dar\\" or a palace in \\"Andor\\" the mind can easily view his characters in detailed surroundings. His ability to take you back in time to scenes from previous books just when your mind needs a little reminder is unsurpassed. And as always you begin missing his characters as soon as you close the back cover. Waiting for the next book is never easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I may have not read it but...","review":"OK, Joradn wrote over 10 thousand pages in all these books. I understand why he is maybe getting sick of it. I believe he can slow down if he wants, take his mind off for a month or two. Then get back to it with a renewed power to write his books as good as he has been! So give him a break so he can renew his interest in the stories. Although I do have to still read Path of Daggers and hope he continues the whole story to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded, boring and very disapointing","review":"After two and one half years, I eagerly picked up this book hoping I could enjoy it in the same way as I had the first six. Unfortunately, after I was halfway through, I put the book down and didn't pick it up again for several days. Only a long flight to the East Coast allowed me to gather enough interest to finish it. I thought the 7th book was rather bad, but hoped it was an aberration. I was wrong. It's too bad that so many people are starved for a good story. If the next one takes another two years to write, I really don't care. It could end now and I would never wonder what would have happened. It's too bad Mr. Jordan couldn't keep the pace going as he had in the first five of these exciting novels. I am certain that if Prof. Tolkein is not spinning in his grave over Jordan's theft of his ideas, he's more furious at the man for insulting his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the characters, hate the soap opera...","review":"I will admit that I am a Jordan junkie, and will faithfully go out and purchase number nine whenever it manages to make it to the shelves. For over a year I waited ever so patiently for the eight installment in this fantasy monolith and when I had returned to my comfortable sitting room with a bottle of wine and a full pack of smokes to lose myself in the world that Jordon had masterfully crafted in his first few works I was painfully dissapointed. Over a year of making excuses for Jordan's sluggish writing in volumes six and seven and the eigth provides nothing more than pulp fiction. Sure I love the characters and read on to continue to spend time with them, but I was expecting a little more than 900 page taster of events to come. I hope the ninth volume will vindicate my faith and hope in Mr. Jordon and the editors at Tor."},{"rating":"1","title":"It took how long to write this?","review":"This series started off so promising, but it gets worse with each book. The plot lines do not advance, its just a bunch of people jumping from place to place. The main characters never grow. If they are in the book at all. How can you write a book and not have one of central figures in it, did Matt get abducted by aliens and taken to another planet? Jordan writes like he has no idea where he wants to go or is just bored with the whole thing. Maybe he since he made his millions he just doesn't care any more. He is called the great one and the master and other such lofty titles but a master who takes two years to write a book should put out a better product than this. I am thankful for libraries so i don't have to waste money buying these books. I don't care when the next book comes out because i am through with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not start this series!!","review":"Terrible book! Jordan has build an incredible world, but does he have the ability and desire to do something with it? The problem with this book is not that nothing happens, but that you care less and less about what happens to anyone as you read it. I started out interested in what had happened to Matt, but after finishing, felt that he was probably better off not being in this book. I certainly wish that Rand, Minn, Perrin, Ny. had not been in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll bet the final book will disappoint...sometime in 2037","review":"For anyone that is still reading because you got hooked on the first five books (which were fairly good), you're probably wondering when something important is going to happen again. I say, stop reading. I won't buy another book in this series. I predict the final book will be a major disappointment. Some of us are still slogging along through the volumes because we're hooked, and hoping for an exciting resolution, and for all the answers to be revealed. I don't think it's going to happen. How could the series possibly get better, when Mr. Jordan has written 3 terribly boring books in a row? Mr. Jordan is just making a career out of this series, and taking us hapless readers on a very bad ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is drawn out. Get with the plot sometime. Don't waste your time buying it... wait for paperback or even better go to a library to read it. I've been a hardcore WoT fan for years now, but I'm not sure I want to continue after PoD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Predictable","review":"The first few books were excellent (4 or more stars). Since then, the series has become irritating. Only a few science fiction stories have become a legend, Lord of Rings, Star Wars and Blade Runner just to name a few of the best. Robert Jordan should save himself and end the series with no more than two more books. It's been so long since I read book eight I forget about the series until I came accross this Web site. I'm not sure I want to read the next book. I'll have to wait and see how nice the cover looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Book #8 in the Wheel of Time series was a terrible disappointment to me. Turgid prose, actionless, no plot development. Perhaps when an author gets very successful, the publisher may give him/her free rein and not bother the \\"genius\\" with any editing constraints. I certainly will not order Book #9 before publication--in fact, I think I'll wait for the paperback version, even if it's not 'til 2005. My holiday season was only saved by being able to get George R. R. Martin's \\"A Clash of Kings\\" from amazon.co.uk--now THERE is a guy who can write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan's done better.","review":"Jordan seems to be facing several problems right now. He seems to be working hard to establish several situations which (hopefully) will pay off in the next book or two. Unfortunately, they don't pay off now. The Seanchan invade. Egwene prepares to fight the tower. Rand struggles with his sanity while facing terrible choices between what he wants to do and what he needs to do to survive. The Dark One prepares to attack. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Been there, done that. The really sad thing is Jordan's recent prequel novella, \\"New Spring,\\" published in Legends, managed to push the plot further ahead. Want to know how firmly entrenched the Black Ajah really is? What was the question only Moraine could answer for Lan? What happened to the other Malkieri survivors? What is Cadsuane after? Who might that new forsaken in POD be? If you want a lot of fight sequences and a bit of plotting and angst, read Path of Daggers. If you want to know what's going on, read New Spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get back on track!","review":"When I read the first 4 books in the series, I realized that Robert Jordan is the best writer ever! But after that, each of the books has gotten worse, and finally, Path of Daggers is the worst of the bunch. In this book, Robert Jordan realized that anything with his name on it would be a bestseller, so he wrote a bunch of garbage and put it on the shelf, but he made the ending a cliffhanger so that we would buy the next book he writes! Unless Robert Jordan starts writing again instead of just trying to make a bunch of money, his readers will stop buying his books.-Luke Janes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving characters around without enough plot","review":"This was a major disappointment after a long wait. I had reread the prior books while waiting for this one, and once again appreciated what a great series this has been. But this one -- very little happens beyond bickering and moving from place to place. Keeping up with this many characters doing very little is wearying rather than enjoyable. Leaving out Mat is inexplicable -- one of the three t'averen. Robert Jordan is seriously risking the readership and reputation he has built up -- he needs to do some serious editing and get rid of the bloat. Show us through events; don't endlessly tell us details with little happening. This is an action fantasy, not Proust."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKEd","review":"there was no plot to it, and the characters...where was matt? i tihnk i maybe at max read 3 pages on him throughout the whole boook, NOTHING HAPPENED!! and u know what? his last two books have been his worse YET!! in the last one it took him 900 pages to say he got one morel ittle kingdom, at least then he said something and there was a plot, but not this time this novel SUCKED and to think that i had paid 25$ for it just pisses me off more"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment!","review":"This entire book could have been condensed into a 100 page update to his readers.This would have saved a lot of wasted time and frustration at realizing that nothing important was going to happen!Please Mr.Jordan,I,d rather be kept waiting for another year than be duped and robbed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor work from a great author.","review":"It seems that Jordan has Stephen Kind\\"idus\\", meaning he's in a contract and has run out of steam.

I want to know when the next one is coming out."},{"rating":"1","title":"more story, less spanking","review":"I wish Robert Jordan would work out his obsession with women spanking each other in some other venue. I am tired of reading repetitious fetishistic descriptions of female \\"discipline.\\" I'm also disappointed that the characters that once were so interesting have become so boring, petty, and flat, and that the pace of the series has become so excruciatingly slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring dissapointment. Good book to help you get to sleep.","review":"I've read them all, and this latest of the series is the worst by far. Ninety percent of the book seemed like an Act I, Scene 1. The rest was merely the rest of the first Act. I was waiting for something to happen. When it did happen, I had to reread it to figure out what was going on. It may be because I kept falling asleep.This latest installment lacked all the imagination and creativity of the earlier books. It was 600 pages of nothing. Its too bad I can't get my money back. However, I definitely won't buy his next book in hardback. I'll wait for it in the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely disapointed.","review":"I've been a devout RJ fan since the initial publication of WoT. The first book sucked me into the world of RJ and wouldn't let go. Slowly, as the WoT storyline progresses, the hold has been weakening. I am extremely dissapointed with RJ's new book. It reads like an extended prolouge. What's with all the stalling? Was it really necessary to have battle after battle after battle (no matter the significance) with the Seanchan? RJ is an amazing fantasy writer, but...this last book has provided me reason to question that statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Beverly Hills 90210' meets 'Little House on the Prairie'!","review":"A shame. As epic fantasy goes, RJ creates a great world in the first few books. In books 7 & 8 he does, well ... nothing. Nothing at all has happened in the last two books. Compare the earlier books with 'Lan' and 'fierce Aiel' to the current books with ... knitting circles ? Does it read like the same author ? No. If you are unsure, don't buy, read the first 6 books and maybe the 9th."},{"rating":"1","title":"nought","review":"What is there to say? i waited 2 years for a book that has no story. As far as i can see it nothing happened at all in this book. what a waste of paper and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Tedious","review":"This is a very fantastic series, but this book will put to you to sleep. The characters continue to add up which makes it next to impossible to figure out who's who in the field of secondary characters. Jordan continues to supply us with an over-abundance of extraneous information. This book is a must if you are a diehard fan. If you start out with book 8, you will be totally lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happened","review":"I waited for so long for this book to come out and when it did, I was ecstatic. But after reading it, I can't believe I was so excited. The only significant things that happened were only mentioned in passing (i.e. Elayne's retaking of her throne). I hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to find a new series","review":"I have enjoyed every book in the series except this one. I expected more. Now wait until 2000 for the next book? Perhaps not! I believe it is time to find a new fantasy series. When this series is finished, say when my 5 year old gets to college, I can begin again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on detail, short on plot.","review":"Reader, if you haven't already read the first books in the series, as I hadn't, don't even try to read this book. It's like opening up your door and finding that gravity is now at 45%. You are injected into a scenario where you are assailed with dozens of unfamiliar names and terms (in italics). Each scene is related in extreme detail, including the facial expressions and body language (and, sometimes, thoughts) of each participant in the scene-sometimes as many as a half dozen. There is so much detail that the main character (I assume), Lord Dragon, is not encountered until almost half way through the book. This author is undoubtedly brilliant, and there is no shortage of creativity in this work, but a goodkind of author has more action in 10 pages and Homer (Illiad, Oddessy) in 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to do?","review":"I have been waiting for years for this sequel, and read it in one go, only to end up with two questions: What is going on, or rather why are we standing still? and When's the next one due?

TOO SLOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for something to happen...","review":"Jordan's bookshelf-spanning epic just keeps getting better! uh hmm. Is it ever going to end?!? Nothing major (or small) was accomplished throughout the 6 million pages of this door-jam. I gave it two stars simply because i was able to read it, the book is not badly written, and because i've been reading the series since the Eye was first published --I can't stop now! did you notice the irony of the last real chapter? \\"Beginnings\\" that's NOT a good sign!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give this book zero stars if Amazon.com let me....","review":"This book was a HUGE disappointment. It took me forever to read - at times I found myself nodding off or thinking about other things while trying to read it. I appreciate attention to detail as much as the next guy (or gal), but after reading this rather questionable piece of literature, I am forced to agree with the general consensus that Mr. Jordan is stalling for time. I can only hope the next book will be better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it......","review":"I will be short in my anger. The basic story line has been drawn out now for two books, and this, the evil third, has simply stagnated. Mr. Jordan, get ON with it. The plot is a classic, but it needs to be concluded before I begin praying for the seals to be broken and Rand getting his hat handed to him..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully anti-climactic, truly disappointing","review":"After having spent several months re-reading all seven of the previous W.O.T. books and haunting my local bookstore in anticipation of the arrival of Path of Daggers, I am disappointed beyond my meager ability to express. Prior to reading POD, I also (like many of the authors of the reviews I just looked over) truly loved Jordan's previous works, and felt that the W.O.T. series might be the best fantasy series ever published. However, the Path of Daggers convinced me that my earlier beliefs were erroneous. The series has stagnated in the last two books, particularly in POD. POD did little or nothing to advance the plot of the series towards its alleged ultimate conclusion - Rand's battle against the Dark One. Given the lack of intelligence or common sense attributed to Rand and the other \\"good guys\\" in this installment of the series, it would seem that the world is doomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Path of Daggers: An unfinished Snore Fest","review":"I managed to read all of Jordan's books in one day each (they were mesmerizing), with the notable exception of \\"Path of Daggers\\". I hope to god that the next book is not the disapointment this one was. Not only did this book not go anywhere, but much of the discription in the jacket, just did not happen (when might Perrin have to forfit his soul to save Failie), it might as well have been discribing the next book.Finish what you start Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"If you have read the 7 previous books, no amount of words will convince you not to get Jordan's latest tome. My advise is to wait for the paperback and then be disapointed. This series is turning dismal, trite, and just plain boring. I don't see any conclusion on the horizon; for all we know, Jordan plans to milk the WOT for the next 10 years (5 books @ 2years apiece). Like other addictions, you will be better served to wean yourself from the WOT now, not later."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing happens!?!!!?","review":"I waited a long time for this, and nothing happens! Since I've really enjoyed the series (overall rate it 4 1/2)I'll read the next one, but, I too will look elsewhere if subjected to 800 pages of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"Since reading the first book of this series, my life has changed dramatically. Now with a family and bigger career, there is not enough time to be wasted reading this much fluff. Mr. Jordan, please get to the point. Your core fans will have outgrown this series before you wrap it up. You'll need good recomendations to get new readers. Let's see if you can make it hapen."},{"rating":"1","title":"*cringe* aweful","review":"i honestly can't think of one praise i can give to this book. all my complaints have already been laid out by other frustrated reviewers already. ill probably read book 9, but if things don't pick up, i'm through with this series. what a shame. it had such a promising beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn- next please!!!","review":"Robert, Robert, Robert! What are you trying to do to us! We are loyal and consistent, why can't you be? One would think 7 books was more than enough to develop characters and places. Do you want to keep creating a fantastic series for us to continue enjoying or have you just gotten used to royalty cheques we keep contributing to?

Stop being lazy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Series in Stasis","review":"It starts out slow -- 90 pages to walk through a travel gateway... by page 100 it starts to get interesting. Perrin has been sent off to straighten out the Prophet. Egwene is establishing control of the rebels. Mat's off who knows where doing something that Jordan doesn't see fit to tell us about. Elayne is on her way to claim the Lion Throne. Min and Rand DO _it_ alot. The Seanchan are back, but Rand defeats them with a small army and some Asha'man. Some go nuts. Lots of interesting things are going on but __nothing__ gets resolved! After reading the above you now have the same experience I had reading the entire book. It seems like the series has been in a holding pattern for 3 volumes now. Robert, if you're really getting bored with it, hang it up for a while. You're not doing justice to the Wheel of Time the way things are moving now."},{"rating":"1","title":"expected more from robert jordan--one of my favorite authors","review":"Could not wait till the soft copy came out, I was so excited with the last 7 books...to make a long story short, I was very disappointed with this book--literally had to force myself to finish it. The sad part is, is that I will probably buy the next book just to finish the series...hopefully this is not how Robert Jordan is going to continue with his career. Found absolutely nothing new, and the characters had something missing, as well as the story line. As a reader, it seemed to me, that even Robert Jordan seemed bored with the whole concept in the book---as a fan--let's hope this is not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is really dragging out the story now.","review":"This book has good parts and bad parts--mostly bad. My favorite characture, Mat, does not even have a role. Perrin used to be a good character, but the last couple of books have seen him become a hen-pecked shell of a man. Even when he tries to stand up for himself, he is not doing it for himself but only to please the hyper-domineering Faile. Very few loose-ends are tied up, but even more strands are tangled into the mess. At least Jordan handles magic well, but even some of the Asha'man have started going soft.This is not a series I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap! crap! crap! crap!(Am i being redundant?)","review":"Then you get the gist of this book.

The Forsaken, Ta'veren, Aes Sedai... thrilling indeed.Now he's lost it. Jordan seems to have lost the read thread alltogether.

A pointless expensive effort for the reader.","review":"If you need word volume to fill in your time, I can highly recomend this book.

You won't be so frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the story go?","review":"I have to say, after reading the first few books of the series, I loved it. After reading this book, it is becoming obvious that it was published strictly to sell books.

Robert Jordan provided quality fantasy in his first two books. After that the story went into slow motion. The once fast paced adventure turned into a long boring story. From the third book on, Jordan has dragged the story at an incredibly slow pace. I only read the 8th book because I wanted to see what would happen to the Dragon Reborn. My advice is to not start the series, because you will become a slave to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan's worst book ever. Skip it.","review":"If you are addicted to this series, this book might cure you. It was so poorly written that I worry about Robert Jordan. Maybe his health is failing. If you insist on buying this mess, I recommend you start reading on p. 421 if you find the Aes Sedai pompous, or start reading on p. 293 if you love them.

Since little or nothing happens, the book could easily be skipped. The characters used to be interesting and well rounded. Now they're very bland and unpleasant. If you like watching shallow, two dimensional female characters bicker and squabble, then this book's for you.

The only interesting and likable characters left are with Mat and are not seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch a soap opera instead, MORE action","review":"Jordan fired his editor then published his draft outline. He forgot to add a point to the book, and laughed all the way to the bank. Thank goodness I could exchange the book for some of David Gemmell's new work, which by the way was fairly good adventure.

At that price its worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jordan has done it again!","review":"The Path of Daggers in yet another masterpiece by Robert Jordan. Once again it combines a complex plot and flowing storyline to make this book one that people must read over and over, and that goes for the whole series as well. Who knows what will happen next (Well Jordan does but he doesn't count)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"What happened? I expected better from Mr. Jordan on this one. Crown of Swords was an okay read. A place to pause the epic and take your breath. I didn't realize it was the start of long snooze. Why Mr. Jordan spent a lot of pages on female drivel I couldn't understand. Granted he crafted strong female characters but you can only take so much. I liked the series because of its sense of mythology. That it could effectively convey its own creation cycle of fall and redemption. Instead we got sidetracked by Nynaeve being her usually silly and irritating self. And where's Mat? His escapades running away from his reputation as a great tactician was the most enjoyable aspect of the book. Look... I know the White Tower is an important part of the plot, but Mr. Jordan should have evened it out with other plot developments. I'm sorry for the rest of you who waited. It really wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give Jordan 2 more books.","review":"I must say, I, like many other Wheel of Time fans, was a bit dissapointed with The Path of Daggers. It seemed, like many have said, to be a setup for book nine, with nothing really happening and no conclusion that I could see. I understand that Jordan may have been pushed a bit for this book, what with it going over 2 1/2 years, but I really expected more.I'm giving Robert Jordan untill book 10 (which I'll probibly wait untill it's in paperback) to get me hooked again. If not, I'm going over to George RR Martin's Earth, Wind, & Fire series for my faviorite Fantasy series ever.I'm not like many others here, saying that Robert Jordan is a horribal writer or just milking it. I think that's just stupid. What I do think is that Jordan is taking a bit too long in this series and should really speed it up a bit. Because if he doesn't, his next book isn't even going to come close to the sales of the latest few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Jordan need money ?????","review":"I don't belive i'm still reading these books !!! The 3 or 4 first books of the stories were great I mean it. It's true Jordan has a lot of imagination and you discover something new evry other page but frankly I'm wondering if Jordan needs money 'cause nothing happened since book 7 or so..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a lot of fans, I was extremely disappointed","review":"I hate to add my voice to the cacophony of criticism that has preceded it, but I must say that I was extremely disappointed in RJ's newest. The two-year wait was extremely anticlimactic. RJ seemed to be struggling for a plot--and for the first time, I wondered whether he actually knows where the WoT series is going. This is the eighth book in the series; we don't need more character development, and certainly not without any plotline. This book was so lacking that I found myself questioning whether it was worthwhile to read book nine when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this book!!!","review":"Jordan once again give us a sub-par effort. However, the quality won't improve as long as people keep snapping up the trash he is currently putting out. If you are like me and miss the good old days when this series actually had books with conclusions, do us a favor and check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot lines left dangling in the Machin Shin","review":"Is it just me, or did anyone else think that the cover blurb wasn't written by someone who'd actually read the book? E.g. what was that about with Perrin's soul and Faile in danger? Or could it be that Tor has chopped this book into two in order to double its revenues....I hope that this is the case and the state of this book isn't entirely down to Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute and utter crap","review":"Undoubtedly one of the most annoying writers ever. Robert might be a good storyteller - if he didn't drag everything out as much as possible to pull in the dollars - but his writing style is pathetic. He uses the same phrases again and again. How many times have we been told about the 'cool gazes' of aes sedai, or women smoothing their dresses etc. Shut up Jordan, your'e just annoying. The first two books were 5 star material in my opinion but he's run out of gas. I actually found Asmodean an interesting character before he was killed but nearly all the others are infuriating. Leave the series unfinished Robert, and try to salvage some respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is loosing it","review":"This book is the worst yet. I unfortunately got hooked on this series long ago and probably will continue to read them. New readers don't start. The plot has not developed since the 3 or 4 th book. Simply The Book SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not start this series!!","review":"This is a very bad book, but my main message is to tell people to not start the series. I'll reserve judgment on the series until its completed, but it is painful reading it at its current rate and pace.However, I do disagree with many of the negative reviews. I think that a lot happens in this book and it does move the plot along. It just does so very poorly. I find it harder and harder to care about the characters or what happens to them. The plot moves along without development or tension. Gone are the hints and foreshadowing that kept you guessing about future developments. Most of the text is simply filler. He desparately needs a decent editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will there ever be an end to this series!","review":"I am a truly devoted Robert Jordan and Wheel of Time fan however, about the only good thing to say regarding Path of Daggers is that I finished it. It was pure torture. I know Mr. Jordan realizes that the year 2000 represents Armageddon, I can only hope he finishes this series before the end of the world comes. Hey Robert, stop dangling a carrot at the end of a string... GET TO THE POINT, FINISH THIS SERIES; YOU'RE KILLING ME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money!","review":"This in my opinion is the worst book in the WOT series. You could completely skip this book and read the next, and would not have missed anything! Nothing happens in this book. Well OK without giving it away, to be fair, two things of any importance happens, but they could have been told in less than 100 pages. There was no significant character development, just battles that were so long winded, that after a while I didn't care who won. Even these had little significance to the WOT story. It seemed like Jordan just pumped out another book to please his fans and he really missed the boat this time. I look foward to his next book, but hope that I will learn a little bit more about the WOT world in the next 500 plus pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a child tumbling over his own toungue...","review":"Jordan's previous efforts were some of the best books I've ever read, but Daggers, however, lacked consistency and momentum. A paragraph on this character, a chapter on that, a page describing characters that have no impact through the entire book, then back to other characters I had almost forgotten about. He should pick no more than three central characters and tell their stories, not narrate the lives of 8 distinct groups of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"This took two years !!!!!!","review":"As a dedicated fan for the last ten years, there has been a serious degradation of quality in the story line. The story hasn't moved in the last two books and frankly this installment was a chore to read. I also expected a longer book, but this one is eighty pages shorter than the last. Is it a sellout to the fans, maybe , money is important but you have to consider the needs of the fans and what they have come to expect in a product from the past. With authors like Terry Goodkind knocking on your door, you soon find that the throneroom is empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my time.","review":"I first picked up on this series when visiting America early this decade and, along with family and friends, have followed it ever since. I have now had enough and wont bother with it anymore. Don't authors work with editors anymore? Somebody needs to tell Jordan that what initially interested his readers was the way his characters were forcefully drawn in an intricate and well developed plot.This book has boring characters and no evidence of a plot. Goodbye!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I have been with the wot since the eye of the world first came out, i have just finished pod for the second time. Parts of this book do not even read like jordon. Almost like a ghost writer or he rushed it-- just to shut us up. The plot line with the women is really starting to get old--Rand is no longer a person you even care about very little on perrin and nothing on mat. unless you are a big fan of wot do not waste your time.of course i still want book nine. Pod is kind of like kissing your best female friend it's nice but does not do anything for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"In one word - awful. The women seem to spend most of their time standing arms akimbo, glaring at each other, when they aren't either simpering, or sniffing, or tugging on braids (how come Nynaeve has any hair left?), or rearranging shawls to the tinkling of bracelets. Hundreds of new characters, very minor, mere names ... Meralda, Selande, Famelle, Chilares, Kirstian, Dimana, Sumeko ... any one know who these people are? Nothing happens for hundreds of pages. When it does, torpor returns.The English say that one can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse, but RJ has managed to turn a silk purse into a sow's ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not dissappointing at all!","review":"This book was well worth the wait! I don't know why everyone is griping about how boring it was. I loved it! It went into great detail about the political machinations and had all the action and suspense you could want. True, Mat wasn't there, but so what? I really liked the way the plot stayed on one set of characters for a while then moved to another set, instead of skipping every chapter. Another good thing about it was that it didn't follow the normal format of building up the big battle at the end and then a short wrap-up. This book is also full of VERY gratifying scenes. You definitely don't want to miss out! Any other WOT nuts, please email me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not so action oriented","review":"This book felt very much like an epilouge to the last book and a prolouge to the next. It was not as action packed as some of the other books but it is definetly neccesary as a transision towards some of the more monumental events that are to happen in this book such as the confrontation between the 'rebels' and the 'real white tower' as well as 'the huminization of Rand' by the wise ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool, but could be better","review":"Robert Jordan (if you ever will read this)- I love your Wheel of Time books! However I've felt that the last two books were rather slow-paced and could be better. I still like them though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpeice","review":"The only words that can describe Robert Jordans writings. If you like this series you should also read his Conan Series, which I personally think are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not his best","review":"I have been reading the Wheel of Time since I picked up the first book at the library while living with my dad for the summer. When I first read it I was amazed at how good it was and proceeded to get the rest of the series. After reading all of the books and then doing it again last summer I am still not bored with it. I did find The Path of Daggers to be more of a filler book with no real signifigant happenings, along with the fact that Mat did not appear in the book made it a little disapointing. Overal I think it was a good book but it could of been better. Hopefuly the next book will be more interesting and contain a better story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but power struggle","review":"in this book the beauty, wonder, and friendship had been bred out. Nothing is left but power struggle: who could out-stare who, who outrank who, who is brought to heel. these are the basis of all relations in WoT. If you are not manipulating someone you are oppossing someone, or bootlicking, or snarling, glaring. Politics permeates everything. It is as grim as a real-life newsreel. I found myself caring less and less for Rand and the other heroes. Frankly, I don't know what to look forward to anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one in the series","review":"The Path of Daggers the eighth book in the wheel of time series continues Robert Jordans series of great books. It continues to develop the plots and it also begins to give Rand Al Thor (one of the main characters) a kind of super human humanity. And it also develops Rand's relation ships with both friends, enimies, unknowns, and of course women. The only things that keeps the book from getting a perfect five stars are the facts that. One, the book does not mention certain caracters much if at all. And two no ofence ment the series is getting too darn long. Overall this is another great book by a great writer, and is a must read on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan Stalls Again","review":"This is the most disappointing of all of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books. When I first started this series a number of years ago I was sucked into Rand's world like a straw in a tornado. I was no longer in control, I HAD to read every book I could get my hands on and awaited each new addition eagerly. However, with the last two volumes I have developed several sneaking suspicions. Robert Jorden doesn't have a clue where this series is going and he is drawing it out for as long as he needs to: a) make money and/or; b) figure out what to do with the series. Judging by other reviews, I have only one recommendation for Robert Jordan if he wants to keep his readership: GET ON WITH IT MAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a fitting sequel","review":"While the last two books of this series seemed to drag compared to the first couple, this book picks up the pace again. It combines the intricate plot expansion of the later books with the action and adventure of the first few. People who complain about the slow movement of recent books, are merely products of the MTV generation who cannot appreciate the finer points of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing - where's the other half of the book","review":"Path of Daggers was better than Crown of Swords but is woefully inferior to the first six volumes. Basically, the reader is left wondering where the other half of the story is. The story is relatively simple and does not answer the hanging questions from the earlier volumes. Robert Jordan, if you are reading this, please-oh-please publish the next book soon (less than a year +) and address the questions we all want answered.A loyal Wheel of Time fan..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this book!","review":"Books 7 & 8 are destined to become known as the biggest pile of hackneyed trash ever to come out of a publishing house since the last dozen Gor novels. Jorden wraps nothing up, dumps until the next 2 years my favorite character {Mat), is becoming far too interested in female S&M, and drags a short story amount of plot to an agonizing 600 plus pages. Where's Glen Cook when you need him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan marks time in a slow-paced yawner.","review":"After waiting two years for the sequel to the wonderful \\"A Crown of Swords\\", this book was a huge disappointment. Jordan spends most of his time dealing with peripheral issues and introducing an endless amount of minor characters. We do not see Rand until midway through and Mat is not even in this book. Very few of the central issues get resolved; the White Tower remains divided, the Black Tower is unchanged, the Chosen continue to plot but do nothing, there is no movement in Rand's relationship with his women and we are no closer to the final battle than before. What we get is a brooding and boring Rand and little of anything else. Its time to end this series or move things along. Robert Jordan. Are you are you listening???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Setup for the final Battle","review":"I have read all of the books within the last year and feel with The Path of Daggers Mr. Jordan is starting to set the story up for the final connrontation between good and evil. Most peole have complained that nothing happened in the book but don't realize that alot did. Mr. Jordan had to end the book where he did becuase he would have went on for another 1000 pages for what comes nextin the story. The next book will probably be the most action packed of them all to date. The best part was the last chapter of the book, setting the story up for what is happening next and if you people who are complaining that nothing happened in the book you honestly don't know what you're talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterly Disappointing","review":"WOT is possibly the best fantasy series ever. But I imagine a number of those waiting for this one will be disappointed. As others have mentioned, this book reads like a 600 page prologue. First we wait nearly half the book for a glimpse of Rand, then read the rest futilely for a look at perhaps the series' most engaging character, Mat. I suppose one cannot expect Jordan to produce a Shadow Rising or Fires of Heaven every time, but frankly most of this reads as filler. There are a few bright spots, but this is otherwise an unremarkable step towards what will hopefully be an exciting book nine. The Light send we get something better after what will surely be another interminable wait for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it, Best one yet!!!","review":"I've read all the Jordan books, WOT and most if not all the Conan books, this is his best work yet. He ties all the rest of the WOT books together with this one. I'm now reading it for the second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, felt a little shorter than the rest.","review":"The 8th book is an exellent book for any WoT fan. The story is well done with a few surprises and new questions. Why does everyone believe book 9 is two years away. PoD was delayed because RJ had some other projects to do, such as New Spring. I suggest PoD for any fan of WoT! Thankyou Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not able to stand on its own","review":"One of the maxims of a great novel, even a novel in a series, is an ability to stand on its own feet without the support of previous or later works. The first 5 books did this easily, The Path of Daggers does not. It is clear that Jordan has much to say, but his prose is getting sloppy, derivitive of himself, and is not engaging. I am not a writer, but have sympathy for the creative process, so if Mr. Jordan wants to end the series short of a climax, he should issue a press statement and let people know. Otherwise, return to tighter, more dynamic style written for the earlier books.This for his publisher, I WILL NOT BUY ANYMORE NEW BOOKS WRITTEN BY MR. JORDAN UNTIL HE ONCE AGAIN PROVES HIS ABILITY TO WRITE. I wanted to return Path of Daggers, but I'm willing to give him a chance. NO MORE HARDCOVERS, I'M NOT KIDDING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"I have read all 8 of his books and I think they're awesome, but this book has to be the most boring I've ever read! RJ needs to hurry some things up a bit - it's the exact same as the COS except a few new things happening in different places. Nothing gets solved except that they use the Bowl of Winds or whatever that was. Where was Mat?!? Don't leave me hanging, RJ - get the next book out soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile","review":"An excellent book which keeps the narrative going, although judging by the other comments, this is a matter of much debate. The lack of excitement and battle scenes is unimportant. The character development is terrific, and the world just keeps getting richer with each installment. I for one, would get bored if the series consisted of unending action and battle scenes. Jordan is a veritable master at keeping his ten thousand plot lines moving.As for Rand doing stupid things, well, that's part of the appeal. He's not a ludicrous character who matures from callow farm boy to general/statesman/politican extraordinaire in the course of a few novels. He is human, he makes mistakes, and screws up. The characters' failures humanize the story, and make it far more readable. Highly recommended, I look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please give us completion.","review":"The long awaited vol. 8 in the never ending series arrives. I personally think it was well worth the wait. Then I've only been reading this series for 18 months, to some who have been reading since the begining of time an ending is long overdue. As far as epic series go, I believe Robert Jordan has a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slowwwly-turning Wheel of Time has broken spokes....","review":"The slowwwly-turning Wheel of Time has more than a few broken spokes. The series has devolved into pro forma hack prose marked by totally stagnant plotting. Even the normally-annoying misogynistic female characters have turned BLAND and only irritate out of habit, as it were. If there is a pattern here, then the next one should probably be entitled Road to Limbo . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"It is astounding how this author has taken an interesting, fascinating and imaginative story and turned it into a boring piece of drivel. If this series was a horse, it would have been shot long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"The time to bail is now...","review":"For any who have been considering bailing out on this series for the last several books, and have hesitated in picking up this latest installment, I say this: you have made a wise choice. This is the last Wheel of Time book that I will be reading, and I whole-heartily recomend that anybody who has been getting tired of the same old boring garbage that we have been enduring since the middle of The Fires Of Heaven skip out on this series and give up on it now. It just goes on and on, and there is no end to the series in sight! Damn...700 pages with about 75 pages of actual plot advancement. Bah!The only people who sing the praises of this are the die-hard, hopelessly loyal fanboys who would give ten stars to a page smeared with Robert Jordans feces...which isn't too much worse than the actual content of this book. So much potential, gone to waste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book. You have been warned.","review":"My advice to anyone that has not already bought this book is to borrow it or check it out at the library. The best advice would be to get a summary of what happened, (which is not much) and wait and see what the next book brings. I will finish the series, but not by way of buying the books with my money. If more readers would do the same, maybe authors would think twice about releasing garbage to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Had Enough","review":"Enough is Enough already. Has Robert Jordan completely lost the plot or is he getting paid by the word. This series started off promosing so much and this latest piece of dribble has completely shattered the illusion that this will be a great series. To all would-be authors out there - take note - it is quality and NOT quantity of writing that counts. Re-introducing characters and ideas OVER and OVER drives me to distraction. I'm just grateful I read this at the library and did not pay money for it. I refuse to read on in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel of Greed","review":"Book 1: WOW!! I can't wait to find out what happens next. Book 2: WOW!! This is fantastic, I haven't enjoyed a series this much since LOTR. Book 3: AMAZING! This one is the best so far. Book 4 : Good! I wish the plot would move faster though. Book 5 : Hmmm. Well, I guess everyone can have an off day. I sure hope the pace picks up soon and an end is in sight. Book6 : Uhhh. Jordon doesn't seem to want to let go. Book 7 : ARGGG!! Stop the infernal repetitive descriptions already. Book 8 : $%#?%!! Does Better Business know about this, it's a scam.My conclusion : This story will never end. Jordon has no idea where to go. Had this been a 4 book series, it would have gone down as a masterpiece. Instead it will go down as a MAKE MONEY SLOW scheme.I give up!!! I no longer care what happens. My advice is to save your hard earned cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible !! In Austria we have to wait until December !!","review":"I started to absorb those 6100 pages 2 years ago until I reached the end of Part 6 just-in-time of the \\"A Crown of Swords\\" release. I loved it, but couldn't believe it not over yet. Considering RJ's seemingly never-ending breath and therefore expecting a new 1000-pages-tribute to Rand and his friends, I enjoyed myself in the meantime with other Fantasy by M.Rawn, T.Goodkind, G.R.R.Martin and so on.But now I WANT THAT SEQUEL !!! I restarted the whole episode, because I can't remember a thing (not even the Seanchan!)and being right now with \\"The Dragon Reborn\\" and I hope to make it 'til December, where you probably have read it already and start moaning about waiting again (or does it end with #8 ??)!!Well, enjoy it anyway, I'm not too far behind !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love watching hours of C-Span...","review":"then you'll love this book! And I thought watching politicians prattle on and on about some obscure issue that only people in their home district care about in an empty House Chamber late at night was boring, well let me tell you that POD makes C-Span seem like exciting television. Jordan needs to take writing lessons from George R.R. Martin, who is making a run at winning the title of best modern fantasy writer. (Okay, maybe Gene Wolfe or Orson Scott Card should get it.) There is a reason why, to the best of my knowledge, no book from the WOT series has ever won, or even been nominated, for a Nebula or Hugo Award. Sorry Jordan, I'm off this endless ride. Enjoy my money...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Action rather than Fighting","review":"A number of the reviews of this book state that it goes nowhere, or that it does not advance the plot - baloney!Much of Jordan's plot, in any of the books, is political - be it between rulers and countries, or just the Great Game played for personal advantage. This book's action, moreso than the other 7 books, is *primarily* political. Readers who are used to questing and fighting will be (and obviously are!)dissapointed, however my view is that this makes the book much more interesting and more human.This book consolidates and builds on previous books, and sets up the next one, but it still does stand on its own as a masterful peice of writing. I recommend the book and the WOT series as one of the best fantasy writings of all time - but it is not for the faint-hearted or those without endurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone is schooling this book for no reason","review":"The biggest complaint people have about this book seems to be that it is 8th in the series. So? I, for one, am tired of stories that wrap up tightly after 300 or so pages. That's boring. I want to reach the ending of the series as much as the next guy but what would people say if they would have gotten to the end of Path of Daggers and saw, \\"The End\\". RJ would be killed! He knows the ending, its just taking awhile to get there! He's not stupid! If he were purposefully adding on to the series to get money, where would you suggest he end it? Right after Faile is kidnapped? After Moiraine seemingly dies? After Rand is kidnapped in LOC? Quit whinning! It's a long series but its still good. I could see why people would complain about a 10+ fantasy series if it was written by Terry Goodkind or somesuch filth. Gee whiz! All I know is you better not read Stephen King's Darktower series. Do you know how long he keeps you wating between books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"really a let down","review":"I was really dissapointed with this book.

I think there is a requirement or something to explain everything as if you are reading the book for the first time. I find this good, as in many series i have to wait a while for the next book to come out. I am currently in about 5 series like that juggling books as they come out. This series is great and i reccomend it.

Fortunately, book 9 is better, though still not as good as the first six books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allusions","review":"I really have to say that I have enjoyed this series immensly and that I can't wait to see how it will all unfold. The story line is great and I have to hope that this particular chapter will just lead up to an awesome WINTER'S HEART. As a Chrisitian and a firm believer in the Bible, it is funny to notice all the Biblical allusions. Just simple names like Ishmael, or to name of events or descriptions. Some are very noticable, like Satan/Shai'tan or the identical Father of Lies title given to the two. Or take Armageddon/Tarmon Gai'don. I guess, seeing as the Wheel of Time and the Bible are sweeping epics involving Prophesied saviours and the battle between good and evil Mr. Jordan would need to look at the \\"True Source\\" for some names and ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's admit it, Jordan's lost it","review":"I think it is about time that his fan's recognized that Jordan has no idea where this series is going. The first four books were fast moving, creative, and truly epic in scope. In the last four he has spent something like 4,000 pages to advance the plot and character development about as far as he did in one of his first four volumes. Who has the time (and money) to keep Jordan floundering around until he finally decides to wind it up? I sure don't , not when George R. R. Martin and Jack Vance are available instead. Seriously, when reviewers are praising this book because they were able to skip the two previous ones and still understand everything, you know the series is in deep, deep trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIES O'PAIN","review":"Is it just me or do all the women in RandLand spend all of their time smoothing/adjusting their skirts? His series is now approaching 4000 pages and 25% of them focus on the status of skirts. This series has become one ridiculously huge annuity plan for Mr. Jordan. Greenpeace activists should be manning a 24-hour WTO-like protest on his front lawn for all of the trees he has sacrificed by drawing this thing out over 8 books. The number of characters has grown so big that the Manhattan phone directory must have at least 23,498 fewer listings than what a true WOT directory would show. The Dustin Hoffman character from RAINMAN would have a tough time trying to keep track of them all. I am sorely disappointed that the author seems to think he can ream his audience repeatedly and get away with it. Mr. Jordan clearly suffers from diarreah of the word processor. God invented libraries for a reason and that reason has a name: Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... those poor trees that had to die for this","review":"I have given up reading this series. I have been encouraged by many of the intelligent reviews written about this series. But to those who are still fans of Mr. Jordan, the art of writing also has an aspect called knowing when to finish a tale. And this series should have ended at about Book 6 at the most. \\"Oh, it's just a transition book, wait til Book 9\\". No no... We've been waiting since Book 5 and NOTHING has happened.I have to agree with the HILARIOUS review written by one person who said that Mr. Jordan is most definitely dead. He probably died around Book 5, but since this series was bringing in such money, the publishers brought in other authors to write the series, never actually planning on finishing it. This is the only argument that makes sense. No one can write such bad books; it's a sin against all the trees that it has killed in its 5000 pages.Read George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Now there's a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring!!!!","review":"This was almost as bad as The crown of swords. Why is Rand in one book almost Omnipotent, then in the next he is terrified of Cadsuane?? Sucks, JR make up your mind who Rand is!!! I'm tired of everyone's personality suddenly taking a detour or worse, regressing!! This book sucked, I don't want to read anymore WOT. Finish it up and be done with it. The first 5 books were good, after that it went to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"End My Torment!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought \\"The Eye Of The World\\" about five years ago, and caught up with Mr. Jordan's writing about six months later. Each time I buy a new novel, I anticipate some move toward closure and then spend a couple years waiting for the next book with a little less exitement. Robert Jordan has captivated my attention for over five years, but I think that he has \\"milked\\" this series for all that it's worth. Even an author of his caliber cannot imperceptibly drag out a story for such a long period of time. Mr. Jordan, please complete this work so that I can look forward to reading your future work!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-moving and Difficult to Follow","review":"The Path of Daggers is a slow-moving extension to the Wheel of Time fantasy. The author continually introduces new characters, usually in multiples, and the result is confusion in the narrative form. The climactic action of the book takes place at the very end, as in most of Jordan's books. All-in-all, a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I borrowed it from the library","review":"I share the same sentiments as others who were also disappointed by POD. 6 flippin' chapters to get those annoying women to use the damn bowl?!? I was *this close* to quitting after the 3rd or 4th chapter... Where's Mat? Perrin has basically one task this book, and he doesn't even get to finish it? At least the cover art is getting a *bit* better. I'm glad I found Guy Gavriel Kay while waiting forever for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am let down again.","review":"I have just finished Jordan's latest book, and feel I wasted my time. I found myself drifting off through most of the book because a surprising lack of interest on Jordan's part to actually want to end this series. I became thoroughly enraptured by the series when it first came out, but I cannot continue to read a storyline that just does not seem to get anywhere. The only reason I bought this last book, was because I believed he may try to end the series, or at least bring some of the situations to a head. Neither happened.I have invested so much time over the years to not finish the series, but I may not after this last book. I almost do not give a damn to what may happen to Rand and his cohorts. It has become a struggle to get through one of his volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book could use some action","review":"First of all, where's Matt? And what exactly are \\"the paths of daggers\\"? no where in the book is the title referred to (as in the others). I waited nearly two years for a book that rambles on aobut a bunch of old hens and Rand acting like a schmuck!! If Mr. Jordan ever reads this I only ask that either you write your books faster as you did in the beginning or you add more action (like the shadow rising). I will gladly read everything you publish if you just did one or the other. As for my review, WAIT!!! Read the others several times over a period of 2 years for his next book and buy this one. Or wait for the paperback, you'll save money and time that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be 5....","review":"But the ending was cut short.

I think the women in Jordan's books behave like complete aliens. I have NEVER met women like these -- not even the craziest, stupidest women I've had the bad fortune to run across. Jordan writes women like I have a p@n!$.I'm female and wasn't born yesterday. I have never, ever, EVER met a woman that resembles any of the women in Joradan's WoT series. EVER. Anywhere, anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip book 8, you won't be lost when 9 comes out","review":"I was disapointed with RJ a few years ago,when my son and I waited in line for 2 hours at a book signing in Charleston SC ... guess who was a no show? Yep just like book 8, RJ was a no show. Early on the first few books made me a fan. I once got to book 6 of a series by L Ron Hubbard call Mission Earth, before I couldn't take it anymore. Well I broke my old record, I got to book 8 of WOT, but I can't take it anymore. yep I'm the no show from now on. So RJ write all you want, take all the time you want, get as rich as you want. This X-fan won't be there. . . . . And remember what really made JRR Tolkens Hobbit & (trilogy) really good... it did come to an end. Even Mark Twain new that Huck Finn had to grow up, and couldn't keep going and going. ... thanks for the early books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one made me quit the series.","review":"I picked up The Path of Daggers after a several year hiatus from The Wheel of Time. While the distance between volumes certainly caused me to lose enthusiasm, and I realize my taste in fiction has changed somewhat, this book seemed worse than the others by far. After about one hundred pages of hair-pulling, ear-boxing, saidar-drawing, women grumbling about men, and vice versa, I realized I simply couldn't finish it. There's nothing wrong with a plotless novel (or plot-minimal, here) but they need substance otherwise, I wasn't getting anything from The Path of Daggers. Other reviewers talk of character development, but most of the thousand or so characters populating WoT seem to have changed little since they were introduced, and I find most unlikable. This is the only book I've completely given up on in the last five years.Thanks for the early books, Robert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sympathy for the Devil","review":"Speaking as an evil villain, I feel that the great Lord of the Dark has been getting a bum rap in these books. Hey, c'mon, he's been walled up for eons; how would YOU feel? Some of my best friends are Myrdraal; although I don't care much for trollocs unless they've been well-cleaned before cooking. Rand et al seem like very intelligent people; why can't they see that the Darkfriends have their best interests at heart? Judging by the way this book is bleeding to death I'd say the Darkfriends are winning. Is Terry Brooks ghost-writing this episode? Snore....still it's a rich, deep fantasy world, even for an omnipotent superman power-trip. Take a chance, Jordan. DO something soon. You're drawing too much tainted saidin from your 'fans.' Finish it, THEN compare yourself to old JRR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going nowhere fast","review":"The eighth installment of WoT is worse than the weak seventh and horrible in contrast with the initial books. While the first four books imparted a sense of wonder and had great action, the fifth and sixth books had momentous events, PoD is a mishmash of stillborn storylines without direction or purpose. Hopefully Jordan has not grown indolent such that he is only drawing out the series for his own fun and profit. Instead, he MUST pick up the pace and bring the series to a rousing conclusion within 2-3 books to avoid alienating existing readers and retain the ability to attract new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow reading","review":"I'm a very fast reader, and the first four books in the series zoomed by, and after that I was beginning to get sick of the repeatedness, the same metaphors and descriptions being used over and over. We the readers all understand that in Tel'aran'rhoid women's dresses keep changing when they think of their beloved. Speaking of women, why is it almost all the women are exactly the same??? Being a girl myself, I'm not complaining about the fact that Jordan makes in look like the women always have the men under control, but why can't we have a female who isn't unusually pretty or unusually strong in the Power?This book, like the last (though it was decent--Mat was in it) is very slow reading. I've been reading it on and off for the last few weeks. It has really gotten nowhere, I'm losing track of characters, AND WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT HOW MAT IS DOING???I apologize for the harsh review, but it seems to me Jordan has lost his enthusiasm or something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterbeat Winter Party 2006- Don't Bother","review":"Take a pass on this album, absolutely no energy at all, nothing memorable about it. This should never have been released by Masterbeat, commercialism has replaced all artistry here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I just had to write in on this one because this novel exasperated me!On the surface this looks like a good novel-some stunning writing,lovely descriptive passages and of course it is technically assured-so why didn't I like it?It's taken me a while to answer this one and I think the answer lies somewhere in the fact that I don't really care about the characters.To boot there are some really forced characterisations (such as Narouz)and there are times when I feel Durrell is not in control of the material.The freaky people in the novel are just that -freaky and uninteresting ,unlike say in Proust where they lend incredible resonance to the plot.For all the touted technical delivery and supposedly exotic location this novel is ultimately very flat and empty.Forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Have Missed Some Footnotes","review":"While Justine was certainly well-written, I have rarely had a more difficult time sorting out the relationships among a small cast of characters and understanding their past histories. Durrell offers his reader no assistance whatsoever, tossing off references to events and individuals as if we are all magically in-the-know. I kept flipping backward and forward, expecting someone or something to be explained, and finally realized I was on my own in Alexandria with no guidebook. I was left with no desire to move on to the other three novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise - Execrable Execution","review":"The premise of this work is to tell the same story from four different viewpoints to demonstrate the role of the narrator in fiction - it would have helped enormously if there'd been a story to tell from the beginning.Instead, we're treated to a fantastically dull narration of an incredibly mundane and ordinary sequence of nothing-really-happening, and to add spite to injury, when done once, we must traverse the same static space of lack of events three more times, told from very subtly different viewpoints, not really doing much for the original premise.The idea is very interesting and could have been a marvellous work - instead its entire lack of a story to tell leaves one with the feeling that it could have been done much, much better. As it is now, it one of the most incredibly boring books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexandria Quartet: The Endless Waste Land","review":"Unless you are one of those people where only the unconventional and impossible amuses you anymore, stay away from these books. Durrell writes without any clear point, grasping at the most blurred edges of pointless metaphors, such as the repeated use of \\"mirrors\\" in Justine, to appear clever and witty. It is clear to this reader that Durrell has only vague ideas about what he is trying to convey and probably sits behind his word processor laughing at potential readers knowing that through unsolvable puzzles comes respect. The only thing slighty interesing about this book is you learn something of the wonderful city of Alexandria."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic exploration of the human psyche.","review":"The Alexandria Quartet is possibly the finest literary work of our time. It moves the soul to search itself for answers to timeless questions about emotions which we all experience. -Jelousy, love, fear, greed, hatred, insecurity, the need to posses another...etc. Justine is a great novel on its own, but The Quartet allows it to be a part of a masterpiece, and thus all four books should be read in sequence. Durrell's command of the English language is not easily paralleled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your brain will never be the same.","review":"This is how an old friend convinced me to read Durrell's stupendous \\"The Alexandria Quartet\\": Picking up the book and flipping to a page at random, she let her finger settle on a line, which she then read out loud. And whatever the line was (I don't remember) I crumpled inside. And so she flipped to another page and read another line. And damn me if it wasn't better than the first! A desert island book if there ever was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work that will always remain with you.","review":"I read the Quartet before, during and after a trip to the Middle East. I think it would have an equally powerful but different impact upon me if I had not read it there, but the added proximity to the site of the fictional events added a great deal to the power of the novels. I can only say someday I will have to read them again. The works are too rich, too complex, too powerful to grasp in one reading. I felt like I was only skimming the surface of a great sea of emotion, action and thought. So much remains a mystery, and I suspect it always will. Perhaps that's part of what makes it such a great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Quartet Must Be Read.","review":"Durrell is a master with the word and the mind-- his creation of four separate books are united by love, deceit, and desperate measures, wrapped in sensual language and the exotic backdrop of Alexandria. His machinations take the reader by surprise, with multi-faceted characters that appear destined for one obsession, yet consumed by another. His vivid descriptions of expatriate life rival those of his contemporaries Evelyn Waugh or H.E. Bates. Engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALexandria Quartet is the novel of the millenium","review":"It is not a Masterpiece. It is the best book ever written. Full of characters poetry and love. Lawrence durrell said that it is an inquiry about modern love. This book is perfect in every sence. Alexandria the city with its beauty and decline is the inspiration power.

It was a humourless movie - were we supposed to laugh or something at Alicia's irritating whiny voice, and bad one-liners? Okay, if Alicia's such a 'great actress', then where is she now? Oh yeah, she made that 'gem' of a movie - Excess Baggage (what a bundle of laughs that was) and she also made that 'hilarious' comedy - Blast From The Past (make me barf).Don't waste time or money, or even review space, giving this pile of crap more stars than it's worth (shame I couldn't give it nought - but then again, the one star is for Britanny Murphy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"The fact that so many people liked this garbage is a real portrait of our moderns society.

I must say, I have never gotten up and walked out on a movie before, but I guess there's always a first. There is no plot throughout this movie except for the trivial 'living life'. I have never felt this bored about a movie ever, sitting through it, there was no feeling of wanting to see what was next, probably attributed to the lack of plot. I got probably an hour into the movie when it struck me that I have absolutely no desire whatsoever to find out how the story plays itself out, how the movie ends.I guess this movie has a small targetted group that finds this such a marvel of a hit, but for the other 99.97% of us, be very cautious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valley dumb : like totally lame","review":"Boy, I miss the Emma parallel here: Jane Austin's girlhave a little class, this little dork b-tch is a shame on us all?A valley girl with a vacuum isn't a good role modelfor anybody.Make over into a human is what she needs?The head kid seems to have more humanitythan the lead actress.I lost my sense of humor here about the time shegot A's for setting up her teachers...She needs a parent of some sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I read the good reviews, saw it was a hit, so went to see it.

Alicia Silverstone is radiantly impressive as Cher, a soon to be 16 year old whose main focus in life seems to be her clothing and her matchmaking skills. Silverstone never comes across as truly obnoxious, though, and she seems to really be in to the mechanisms that went into making a cell-phone oriented teen. Stacey Dash and Brittany Murphy are perfect as her comrades, and Paul Rudd is handsome and charming as Cher's step brother. A strong supporting cast of adults including Dan Hedaya, Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplin are also good in their \\"older folks\\" roles. Although CLUELESS is rarely plot-driven, it is merely an examination of a whole new class of youngsters, and it is Silverstone's performance that anchors the film and supplies the impetus for an overall entertaining romp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall fun movie","review":"This is such a great, girlie movie. It's the perfect movie to watch when you've had brain overload and don't want to think anymore. This movie pokes fun at the stereotypical Beverly Hills kids. You'll see kids in school with bandages on their faces from recently done nose jobs, endless BMW's and countless shopping trips. This is a fun movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!","review":"If you like Clueless this is a cool copy to own because of the bonus features. It has some interviews with the cast (from recently! perhaps 2004-05? talking about their experience- obviously they're much older, experienced (some haven't been in any prominent roles since then...) so it's really interesting to see what they had to say.This movie is a classic. The jokes are so subtle at times, I didn't remember how funny this movie was. There are a lot of jokes I never understood when I saw this film when I younger that I appreciate and understand much more. At the same time, I wouldn't not recommend younger audiences to see it. There's nothing extreme.Pretty light-hearted film. It doesn't really leaving you asking yourself any meaningful, philosophical questions but it is very entertianing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny,Sexy,WHATEVER!!!","review":"Cher and her friend,Dion are real bettys.

So my advice is skip CLUELESS I know I wished I had!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless is humorless.","review":"Just because this movie is a modernization of Emma does not excuse it for being as funny as an episode of Mad about You -- it's not funny.Maybe if Silverstone showed a little more skin, this movie would have some redeeming value.

But it also can deliver terrible motion pictures like this \\"CLUELESS\\". I don't know how Alicia accepted to shoot this picture. It's totally pointless, fruitless, no meaning at all, a pure MTV style product. The main character who is a \\"cult person\\" sometimes give a good critic, but in the end he stays with Silverstone's character, which passed thourgh a \\"deep\\" transformation: she did a single charity campaing !

The show is even worse. The only reason worth watching is to see what clothes you would like to buy. The high school is so fictional! Everyone in Bervely Hills in high school does not carry a cell phone and all the girls aren't always into the mirror. The fact that Cher's and Dione's dork outreach program flipped on them shows they can't dress anyone else but their ownselves. They act so ditzy it makes me want to puke!!!

This is good news since those early releases came with little in the way of special features. It seems the studios just didn't think about bounus material then.But now, I guess because those features have become so popular, they've decided rerelease many of those films on DVD.So in addition to this witty comedy, you get an inside look at what went into the making of it ten years after it's release. Though Alicia Silvertone is missing from the new bounus material (except for onset interview footage from 1995), I found writer/director Amy Heckerlings interview footage insightful in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rarely you find a movie like this...","review":"Hehe. I just saw this movie for the first time a week or two ago. And man was I surprised, never have I seen a movie like it. So the story goes: Alicia Silverstone stars in this romantic, comedy, as young Cher Horowitz. Shes got everything, good looks, good grades, and good friends. So now she starts thinking of helping other people improve their life. After playing matchmaker with one of her close friends, Tai Fraiser (Brittany Murphy), a new man enters her life, Christian Stovitz (Justin Walker). In the next few days everything seems to go wrong with her decisons, and she finally comes up with the conclusion that when it comes to love she is well.... clueless. Directed by my favorite directer, Amy Heckerling. Defently a movie worth renting, if not buying.Roles were also played by Stacey Dash, Paul Rudd, and finally Breckin Meyer.--Best Actress/Acter in the film--Alicia Silverstone - Cher Horowitzand Paul Rudd - Josh.Each very good, watch them closly folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, loved it , loved it","review":"By the time Cher discovers her true feelings towards her stepbrother, I fell in love with the movie and can't stop ranting about it.

It was delivered when it said it would be and it was better than ever with all of the special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showing my professor what I've learned","review":"A cute, humorous movie that illustrates the ideal woman, who acts, dresses, and looks the part that many women wish they could be. The film almost appears to critique the stereotypes set on women, objectifying them ideally for the \`male gaze'. Cher, who is of the white, upper class economic status, is beautiful, blond, thin and well dressed, and her friends are of the same economic status... until Cher meets Tai. Tai represents the woman who goes unnoticed, who does not reflect the feminine woman that Cher is, until Cher makes Tai a commodity; objectifying her for all men to see and allowing her to be surveyed. At the end, Cher must realize that she is smarter than people take her for (they must look beyond her blond hair, thin body, and \`valley girl' attitude), but Cher must work to prove she is not so stereotypical after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie But I want more from a DVD","review":"This is probably the best Emma adaptation out there (and yes, I did see the Paltrow version). Fun to watch again and again. One quibble is that the DVD doesn't have any \\"extras\\". Hopefully, this one will get re-released soon with some more material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh! I wonder if they have this in my size?","review":"Ok, so maybe I'm a guy and just don't understand these things - that's a perfectly acceptable explanation to my mind. But I found this movie extremely boring except for one tiny little line where Alicia says (thinks rather) \\"Ooh! I wonder if they have that in my size?\\" I found that line really funny because of its stereotypical portrayal of an American teen. I dunno, I just found the movie was dummer than \\"Dumb and Dumber\\". No way is it a good movie, but, hey, maybe some girl out there will like it - I know I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"Like a so so TV comedy.

The main character is a rich sixteen-year-old girl who not only is vacuous and spoiled but actually takes great pride in living her life in this pathetic way. Most or all of her friends have similar attitudes or lifestyles. In short, this movie was not good; it was bad and it was ugly. If you were intrigued by the few redeeming qualities of Cher, such as her interest in helping other people find happiness, read Jane Austen's novel Emma, which Clueless is based upon. Emma is full of well-mannered, cultured characters and dialogue; it contains none of the offensive mannerisms or sick humor of Clueless--the worst film of 1995, and one of the saddest, most pathetic movies you will ever see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely an \\"Emma\\" wannabe...","review":"This movie tries to duplicate the charm and wit found in Jane Austen's novel \\"Emma\\", but it fails miserably. I recommend eschewing the film entirely in favor of \\"Emma.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets More Boring With Age","review":"I saw this in my junior year of high school. I liked the film then but watching it now makes me break out in hives. The so-called hip Beverly Hills lingo in the film is very dated now. Watching Silverstone go ( As If! ) reminds me of being back in high school but those days are over. The plot is okay though it gets lost in between Silverstone's endless wardrobe changes. This was her breakout film, why I don't know because she was better in The Crush than she could ever be in Clueless. This used to be the film that all girls, rich and poor idolized. Now it's a strained bore. But if you are a Silverstone fan and haven't seen this ( must have been buried alive somewhere if you haven't ), by all means help yourself. Just don't expect more than Silverstone struggling over worthless, old-time lingo."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Emma\\" goes Beverly Hills!","review":"As an \\"Emma\\" fan, this movie is an obvious modernization of Jane Austin's book. Bringing today's youth a classic in a medium they can understand, the lessons of Emma remain true. That is why so many young people love it. Cher's charitable intentions, despite her self-absorption, is a timeless scenario, finding place in both Victorian England and Beverly Hill's 90210. The moral of the story remains, stop meddling in the lives of others. Charity, like all virtues, can be taken to extremes. This book is a discovery of self, and so is the movie to a generation seeking the same self-awareness all generations have sought. So lighten up and give it a break. It is cute, fun, and don't take it more seriously than it is meant."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this film is totally cool.","review":"This must be the best film I'ev ever seen.

I \\"got\\" this movie right away. Its making fun of the snobby Beverly Hills rich kids and their shallow, materialistic minds. Like when Cher's Dad asks her what she did at school that day, and she says \\"Well, I broke in my purple clogs.\\" But it also cleverly shows that even in Cher's shallowness she shows up Josh's college girlfriend by correcting her that Hamlet does not say \\"To thine own self be true,\\" but that Coloneus (sp) guy does. Because, as Cher says, she knows her Mel Gibson. Another thing I enjoyed was learning all the different sayings the kids had.

My wife and I were really looking forward to some of the movies featured on this set, especially \\"Life With Father\\". Oh what a terrible disappointment it was to see such TERRIBLE quality audio and video. We only made it through half the movie because it was so disheartening. The audio is horrible. Many of the lines spoken are unintelligible. The video quality was so bad it was not watchable.

Purchase the movies individually if you can find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I am a classic movie fan and saw this collection as a way to get several very good movies for my library. It was on sale at Sam's for about 15 bucks, so I thought,\\"5 dvds with 10 full-length films-GREAT!\\" I found out that it was not what I hoped at all. While it does include some good classic titles like \\"Life with Father\\", \\"Meet John Doe\\", and \\"The Little Princess\\", it is ruined by the fact that the sound quality is VERY POOR! and since it does not have an option of subtitles, it is very difficult to even understand what is happening. The sound also goes loud and soft a lot. The picture quality is not great. I realize that these old movies, especially black and whites are kinda dark anyway, but this was exceptionally poor quality. There are no special features on any of the discs either. The shiny metal tin to hold the collection in is a nice touch, but it seems to be falsely giving the idea that there is a real \\"treasure\\" inside. This collection is NO TREASURE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash","review":"The quality is about what you would expect of someone video taping old movies with a video camera on a tripod from a TV screen.

I was excited to see such a great looking collection, but what a disappointment. I actually trudged through most of the movies, since I love the stories, but it was painful. At first I thought I had just forgotten how bad other prints of the movies looked, but after a while it was clear that they couldn't have been that bad. \\"Farewell to Arms\\" was just about unwatchable, and \\"The Little Princess\\" wasn't much better, and so on for the others. What a pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dare you not to dance","review":"Speed garage, a house/drum & bass hybrid, first surfaced in Europe in the early nineties. DJ's/groups like Armand Van Heldon, 187 lockdown and Serious Danger were among the first pioneers of this hard-hitting form of dance music. With their third release, 'The Program', Serious Danger return with an album that serves as a reminder as to why speed garage caught our ears in the first place. 'The Program' is by far their best album to date and stands among their best work including their remix of 'God is a DJ' by Faithless. There really isn't a weak song on the album. Highlights include 'Hardrockin' and 'Battleplate' both of which are funky grooves that ride on basslines straight out of hell. Speed Garage isn't for everyone. It's much more aggressive than traditional house. However, if you're interested in checking it out, 'The Program' is an excellent place to start.

Imagine my delight when I found that they dove-tailed into the full length musical tracks with such graceful intent.

Christmas is about Jesus, the perfect, the one and only holy Son of God. This movie was surrounded by Christmas trappings, true, but it is all about venerating the devil, it portrays sleeping around, it portrays drinking and violence without redeeming virtue, it is studded with foul language and inexcusable degrees of undress. I confess I didn't watch it to the finish, I'm trying to clean up my mind, not pollute it. I wound up taking heavy scissors and cutting this thing up and filing it with the rest of it's ilk. My advice, if you value your spiritual welfare, don't waste your money or your time with this thing. Excuse me, I'd like to get on my knees now and ask forgiveness for watching as much as I did.

One of the best available on DVD. If you are a Dead fan, this is an absolute must. Face it, Jerry and Brent are dead, so the only way to see this era of the Dead is on DVD, and how many times did you see them live in the first 10 rows, anyway? The sound quality is excellent, and some great versions of Stagger Lee, Row Jimmy, Bertha, Cold Rain and Snow and many others. Get it, stop thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous Performance","review":"I just recently acquired this DVD, and it is truly awesome. I saw the Dead only twice, both times in '88, and I think this show probably has both of those beat. Of course, nothing can compare to the live Dead experience, but this movie comes pretty close to capturing it.The band is in VERY FINE FORM, playing tightly together, but also having fun. Every member shows their inspiration in a different way, from the typically animated Bob to the apparently glacially cool drummers, but if you close your eyes and listen to the interweaving notes and rhythms, you will realize just how involved every player is in making this incredible musical tapestry. Oh yeah, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is unbelievably well done.5 stars out of 5, no doubt about it. Nothing from the 80's time period even comes close. Easily beats Ticket to New Year's and Dead Ahead.

The first two words says Knitters Stash so I thought that the patterns would make use of odds and ends of yarns or allow for easy substitution. But flipping through the patterns, it uses yarns which hides the stitches which may be good for beginner with uneven tension or use specialise yarns not readily available. So not very sure I can find a good substitute for the yarns stated. Otherwise, it has alot of patterns that may interest people but nothing too exciting. It is comparable to pattern leaflets that may be available outside in the shops. Look through the book in your library before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pay off","review":"I really love the idea of this book -- yarn store owners are great resources for good, real-life designs and use of interesting yarns to make them. And I loved Melanie Falick's book, Knitting in America. But I hate this book for its design. It's an awkward shape (why haven't more people caught on to the brilliance of the purse-sized VK Knitting on the Go series of books?), and the faded pictures of the yarn stores and owners...they look like the printer printed the blue line proofs by mistake. I mean, knitting is nothing if not about color and texture, up close. The patterns were disappointing to me too. Very few I would actually make. Maybe the store owners didn't want to give up the rights to the really good, classic patterns, the ones that really sell? I hope someone else takes a crack at this great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dissenting vote.","review":"I'll be the one who doesn't think this is anything more than another knitting book. Disappointingly, it is filled with typical ho-hum projects; odd sweaters, ugly shawls, uninspired baby ensembles, and for some reason, many of the projects are felted, not knitted, which was not made plain in the reviews. Add to that the fact that only a few of the projects are written with changes for plus sizes and I am stuck with a book of color photos and anecdotes about projects I will likely never make or wear. I wish a project list had been available, and the drawbacks were pointed out as well as the glories of this book. There are lots of instructions for specialized techniques (like the I-cord bind off) but these are available in books that in my humble opinion contain better instructions and projects at a much better price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book sounded wonderful, and I anxiously awaited its arrival. It did not take me long to decide that I had chosen poorly in my purchase. Like one of the other reviewers, I prefer sweater patterns, not do-dads or gee-gaws. Also, more description of yarns, yarns weights, or substitutions would help those of us who cannot purchase or find the listed ones. Oh well, I will think more carefully before ordering another book unseen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those with $$$$$","review":"This is yet another \\"catalogue\\" written primarily to sell expensive yarn. It has NOTHING to do with using up yarn you may already have from other projects. There is no information on yarn substitution, and there is a lot of blank margin on the pages, which makes the book larger than it needs to be (and necessitates extra page-turning). A good knitting book needs to be useful beyond the lifespan of the current yarns available, and this one doesn't really pass that test.As another reviewer stated, there are more projects than clothing patterns, which is not necessarily bad, but look before you buy. Even with the Amazon discount, this book is 'way overpriced for what you get. I'll wait until this one is remaindered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful gift","review":"Knitter's Stash, filled with informative sidebar tips, offers a myriad of project ideas from sweaters to stuffed animals to a felted carry-all. I especially love the small projects -- caps, mittens, tea cozy, and the like. They provide a refreshing change from simply knitting sweaters. The projects are beautifully photographed and the directions are exceptionally clear and easy to follow. Several projects include design charts which are really helpful. This book also includes a nationwide list of yarn shops. Knitter's Stash makes a wonderful gift for knitters of all levels and interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on the Knitting Edge","review":"I was disappointed with the book. I found some of the patterns to be old fashioned...and not quite retro yet. I am planning to knit the rug, but have not chosen a project from the book yet.This is a book you should check out of yoru library before you commit. A long list of knitting stores is at the front of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Virginia?","review":"The first error I noticed was that Virginia is missing from the comprehensive list of yarn stores.Next, the rug Mom wanted to knit does not give adequate directions; just a color chart, not a stitch chart.It's a beautiful coffee table book but I don't plan to knit from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book, Good Patterns","review":"I've had this book for a couple weeks now and am quite pleased with it. While I don't think there is anything unique about the patterns included there are some interesting yarn shop blurbs. A nice book to pick up and look at from time to time. Not just a pattern book."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Just Gotta Have It","review":"To borrow a line from Spike Lee. I love my books of practical advice, but sometimes you need a little art too. Sure for some, when you divide the cost of the book by the number of patterns it might not seem cost effective, but what a book !! It's lovely and a fitting tribute to our craft. I fantasize about traveling to the stores featured. (I was lucky enough to attend a class at one listed in the Honor Roll-Mind's Eye Yarn) I think that several patterns are great and I love reading about people who love yarn. This a nice book to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Variety of knitting projects, Cardigans to Fish.","review":"This book is for someone looking for a variety of wonderful knitting projects. From basic children's clothing, to a Cottage Tea Cozy, to Felted Fish toys, this book has a little bit of everything. Some of the pieces are for the advanced knitter, but many are for the average knitter. There are many beautiful sweaters, including Marie Louise's Lace Sweater and a men's River Run Pullover. A good addition to my knitting library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy it","review":"There are only few patterns available for such big book, and they range from odd-looking vest to no-use-felted-fish. Unless you can preview the book and find some of the pattern attractive, I think you shouldn't take the risk buying it.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it might be an OK book, if you don't care about the undesirable patterns but you wanna learn about different yarn shops in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Although you can find a better version of Thomas Tallis with Marriner and the ASMF, this is probably the definitive London Symphony.

It taste just like homemade - even better than some of those fancy coffee shops. It is a very rich hot chocolate and doesn't give that watered down taste. I now have a very hard time drinking anything else besides this. I am not a coffee drinker, so I take these packets with me whenever I think they might come in handy. I fixed little giftbags for Christmas last year to give to the kids' teachers and they talked about how much they enjoyed the hot chocolate also."},{"rating":"1","title":"contains hydrogenated oils like the cheap brands do","review":"the brand labels itself as premium and the ingredients listed on the web suggests it contains only cocoa, milk powder and sugar, so imagine our surprise when the ingredients listed on the packet include hydrogenated oils. we had bought the products because we thought is was better and were disappointed. the seller would not respond to our e-mails for return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague!","review":"A conceptually solid intro to AJAX plagued by errors in the code samples -- see http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/headra/errata/headra.unconfirmed. Even some of the sample ajax apps running on the headfirstlabs site don't work! For instance, visit http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hrajax/chapter02/breakneck/pizza.html, type in a phone#, and watch as the php incorrectly dumps out all the addresses in the mock database. Did the author even bother to test out the sample apps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"But unfortunately not good for an experienced programmer. Headrush books are really good at teaching if you like to hear everything three times, each time taught a different way to you. That's the headrush style; They use cute examples, drawings, and text to teach.If you learn best by reading a reference book with concise examples, this book is the complete opposite. I'm one of the concise reference types, so this book was a poor choice for me. I have to dig to find the code examples, and when I do find them they're tied together with lines or hidden on the branches of a tree.Is this a good book? Yes, it's incredibly well written. But it has a very unique teaching style that works for some, but not for me. If you're experienced in HTML and CSS, and have used an object oriented language before, I'd recommend another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes my eyes hurt","review":"I was wanting to learn something about AJAX, and this book caught my eye online. I wish I had browsed it in a store, because I could have gotten a book that would have been more useful to me. I'm sure it is an excellent book, but I think it is targeted for people younger than myself (I'm 47). All of the \\"hand written\\" notes with arrows, the \\"thrown on the page\\" layout, too many different fonts, it all just makes my eyes hurt, and makes it very difficult for me to follow. Will either sell it, or it will collect dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great ...good for beginners","review":"I purchased this book because it was the \\"required\\" book for the course I am taking for Masters. But being a programmer myself for many years, this book is a waste of time. The chapters are lengthy and drags the content too much. May be a good book for beinners, but not for anyone else. The book lacks in-depth discussion and not to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book","review":"I checked this out from my public library last night, and now am thinking about writing a letter to ask why it wastes money on stuff like this.This book takes 30 pages to explain what other books would in a page or two. If you like lots of white space around your text and diagrams, this is the book for you. The entire book could be presented in a couple of chapters.But that's not the biggest problem. The book is solid on fundamentals but teaches nothing about Ajax design strategies or code refactoring. Many frameworks have evolved for developing Ajax applications. These can save programmers a huge amount of time and pain, but the book only mentions some of these in passing at the end. A better book, one like Ajax in Action, would make refactoring a big part of every chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This book doesn't teach you anything. Instead of telling you how to do it, the author is wasting your time explaining what you can do with AJAX.If you want to impress your nondeveloper friends, this book might be an asset."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Ajax book","review":"Easily the best Ajax book at the moment. The material is both entertaining and infomative. The asynchronous and client/server aspects of Ajax can make it tougher to understand, and the author does a good job of working through those issues in a way that makes it easy to understand.The book also covers the DOM and DHTML issues that you need to get the most out of the browser environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indirect learning - doesnt work for me","review":"The book spends about 20 pages introducing you to their genius learning methodologies that keep you interested and involved. That would be great if I was reading this book to kill time and had to be kept interested with pictures and games. In reality, I want to learn the material as quickly and directly as possible. If you are like this, skimming the book is about all you can do. I skimmed it in about 20 minutes (I have previous Ajax knowledge) and it was an OK Intro refresher. If you are serious about learning this and have an attention span greater than a 6 year old, you do NOT want to get this book. It's like playing Where's Waldo for relevant information among the spam of dialog boxes and arrows zig-zagging across the screen.With that said, if you are learning Ajax grudgingly and don't care how much time you spend, this book will be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! They've done it again.","review":"The Head First Labs crew has done it again in this excellent into to Ajax. The book really gives a great overview of Ajax for both programmers and non-programmers alike. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to pick this up. Although the book covers more PHP than I care for, and not enough of XML as I would like to see, it does an excellent job of covering their bases in a way that's easy to understand. I highly recommend this book to anyone with little to no understanding of Ajax. Let's pretty up the web, people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains some good information, but...","review":"The top-most declaration on the front page of Head Rush Ajax is \\"Get it in your brain, FAST\\". A more appropriate comment would be: \\"Get it in your brain after taking a tedious journey down a long, winding road\\". I found some useful information about Ajax, but only after being frustrated by having to wade through an excessive amount of fluff, even if the dog pictured so often is really cute. Head Rush Ajax typically uses about 20 pages to present and explain material that anyone with any coding experience at all can learn in a paragraph or two. So, if you are an absolute beginner, this book might be just the thing, with entertaining inserts to give you a break if you need one. But if you're even a little experienced with html, css, javascript or php you will probably find the pace to be way too SLOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"For me, all the information in this 400 page book could have been effectively presented in about 50 pages, using a normal page layout with illustrations. While reading this book, I felt like I was wasting my time. Eventually, I found myself skimming the pages for nuggets of useful information buried in all the fluff (handwritten notes, arrows, and pictures of dogs and guys in ribbed sweaters.) I am willing to consider that perhaps the style of this book is just not right for me. But even for someone who likes/is compatible with this style, I believe the limited amount of actual information contained in this book makes it not a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok if you like power point presentations in a book","review":"The \\"Head Rush\\" is very much like notebook scribles. Not really suitable for developers but maybe ok for understand what its all about, like a technical breifing. There are far better books for developers such as AJAX in Action and Professional AJAX.If you are a project manager and just want AJAX in 5mins then this is good one to read on the train, your deveopment team would not want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview and Introduction","review":"As my first HeadRush book, I was impressed. Their techniques for learning and remembering the material are sound and moderately useful. It's been a while (nearly a year) since the last time I've programmed and this book was able to quickly get me back into the mindset. Although it definitely leaves a certain something to be yearned for from an advanced programmer, this book is good for exactly what it says: A jumpstart into the language and style and an overview of why and when to use AJAX. This book is good for people who have at least some familiarity with scripting and web programming and are looking for a new technique to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"So redundant and so boring","review":"I bought 4 other head first series books, java, EJB, Design pattern, and Servlet. These books were fast, funny and of course, informative. I really love these series. However, when I read this book I was so disappointed. Most explanations are redundant and it made me boring and the reading pace was suspended. I think the author have to add more examples and shorten the explanation. I regret to buy this book. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward Introduction to \\"Ajax\\"","review":"This book is great a way to get an in-depth look at Ajax internals in a short amount of time.

Unfortunately, hard water (which exists where water is pulled from the ground, typically) reduces the usability to about 10 gallons of water.

I especially like his opening up of Rorty's idea of \\"cruelty being the worst thing we can do\\" to include animal cruelty--is Rorty a \\"species-ist\\"? In another area, Hall's discussion of the eastern philosophical tradition provides a challenge to Rorty's ethnocentrism, while also providing an empirical example of the success of Rortyan pluralism. A well-written and thought provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album From Dolly.","review":"These Are The Hits From 1989 To 1995. Dolly Has A Great Voice. I Have Been Listening To Her Since I Was A Kid. And She Is Still Around Today. I Like The Songs \\"Why'd You Come In Here Looking Like That\\" The 1989 Number 1 \\"Yellow Roses\\", \\"White Limozeen\\", The 1991 Duet With Ricky Van Shelton On \\"The Rockin' Years\\", And The 1995 Virsion Of \\"I'll Always Love You\\" With Vince Gill. This Is The Best CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the Video","review":"I listened to this CD and think it is one of the best I have heard from Dolly. Everything I hear from her is good to listen to but her version of He's Alive is great. I saw her sing this on TV and was amazed. I hope to see a video of this come out soon. Dolly your one of the greatest talents to appear in any genre. One day my Fiancé and I hope to meet you and tell you that in person (as if you don't already hear people say that to you. ~¿~ )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"Fourteen billion different compilations later and BMG/RCA continues to offer little of what as been out of print for years. Most of these songs are readily available elsewhere, but BMG/RCA is just too lazy to go digging for songs that are less common and more worth hearing. This particular compilation isn't the worst, and it actually has a notable highlight or two (\\"To Daddy\\" comes to mind) but by and large it is just same old, same old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Rocks On In True Royal Style!","review":"I own the original version of this concert on VHS and I must say the commemorative release of \\"WE WILL ROCK YOU\\" is a must have for all Queen fans, if not for the rare (not included on the VHS original release) of \\"Jailhouse Rock.\\" The band is playing at their best and this concert is only topped by their earlier 1970's stuff. Queen is at the top of their game. Music fans and players could learn a few things from Queen in this wonderful DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD Presentation","review":"Do not buy this DVD. It is very grainy with terrible sound quality. I love Queen and Freddy is great in concert -- but this does not do justice to Queen or the DVD format. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance of one of rocks best bands!","review":"Freddie and the gang give a great performance of their greatest hits. The sounds is great but the picture is on the grainy side. Nevertheless, a great DVD to have for all Queen fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't kill Fredy again","review":"This DVD has an exceptionally low quality sound . I'm sure that if Fredy Mercury where still alive , he could die again watching this DVD.!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not DTS","review":"The DVD that I received ordered from this page was NOT DTS.This is the main reason I bought it. Overall the DVD was ok but no comparison to professional DVD recordings by Styx or The Eagles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen was OK, but the quality is terrible","review":"Queen gave a good show, but the sound quality is very poor. Besides, the audience is pretty turned off, and the don't even sing along the lyrics. If you want a great Queen video, get Live At Wembley, or the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I got into the music of Queen this year, and became hooked for good when I bought the \\"Classic Queen\\" album, so I rented this video. It is unbelievable. It is a great glimpse of what they were like as a live act. Freddie Mercury is without a doubt the single greatest vocalist of all time, and a brilliant performer. The only disappointment is the version of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" They leave out the beginning, and for the operatic section in the middle, they just play a tape of the studio version, then come back and play the rest of it live. Don't get me wrong, I love that song (in fact, it's my fave Queen song), but it would be better if they did the entire song live. That doesn't matter though, because everything else totally makes up for it. I would reccomend this video to any Queen fan, it is a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concert, poor to average DVD","review":"I am a big Queen fan, this DVD is OK but nothing compared to my other DVDs in terms of sound/Picture quality. The people that think this has good sound probably dont have the system I have. Freddie exceded himself during the concert by singing with his mouth shut (I think the dubbing got out of control at that point)."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific if your a queen fan","review":"I believe any fan of this band will really enjoy this dvd . Sound quality is great, video quality is above average. if your a fan of the band or just a fan of this genre of music, for the price it is a good investment especially if you have a nice system and want to have a good reason to put it through a great workout. I'm a bit bias because, I'm a big fan. But still I highly recomend this dvd, it's a bunch of fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do Queen justice","review":"When I first saw this at the store, I wondered why it was released on DVD. This has always been the worst of the Queen live videos, but that's not their fault. Queen play as well as ever, but it seems that both the audience and the audio engineers were asleep for the whole show. Even in 5.1 digital audio, the sound is horrid. The drums and bass are completely lost throughout, as if you're listening to it through a drive-in theater speaker. And the audience...good Lord, they don't even know the words to \\"Love of My Life\\" (as Freddie dejectedly points out during the song). More than once he tries to coerce them to stand or even clap their hands, but to no avail. So avoid this one, as much as I hate to say it, and start bugging Hollywood Records to release Live at Wembley or Rock in Rio...tapes that do Queen justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I got this DVD expecting the full, rich sound Queen os known for. I was seriously disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey there, Queen fans!","review":"To everyone who has heard negative reviews of this DVD--don't take them too seriously. This remastered version is definately worth watching, as all the problems with the first version have been corrected. The visual and audio qualities are impeccable, and the bonus features (photo gallery, \\"Queenie\\" tour of London) are fun. Granted, the Montreal audience could have been more responsive during the show, but the band's performance is excellent, as always. I'm told that a true Queen concert, experienced live, far exceeds this recording. Nevertheless, while we wait for better things--Wembley? Live Aid?--to be released on DVD, this particular concert can satisfy our appetites for the time being."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boys Must Have Been Hung Over","review":"I bought this DVD to get a sense of how Queeen did a live performance never having seen them in person. After viewing the concert, I thought they performed at several levels below their best effort.Sometimes live concerts result in a more energetic and better product than studio recorded music. This live effort was spotty at best with Freddie doing a little too much improvising, and Brian missing some of his great guitar licks (badly) especially in \\"Bohemian Rhaposody\\". Also, what happened in the middle of that song? I think the great harmony part was \\"dubbed in\\" since one only sees a lot of smoke (and mirrors) onstage with the band nowhere to be seen.
