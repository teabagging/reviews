Training techniques were very useful; although be advised that it takes time to train a puppy. We found out quickly that Siberians (as the book says) are very playful and have lots of energy. Tiring them out will ensure a good nights rest for parents.Get this book first - and read others if you still have questions.

EVERY dog will eat anything!).so - my advice - if you're searching for a specific siberian husky book - try another one. it's a waste of money. sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information that I have not seen in other books","review":"My wife and I are VERY new at the Siberian Husky thing (we just adopted our first guy last Saturday from a rescue - a two year old named Yukon), but decided to pick up a few books to read up on them. Maybe we didn't buy the right books, but it really seems like this one has a lot of information that other do not have. I also suggest \\"Siberian Husky: A Comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring for Your Dog (Kennel Club Dog Breed Series),\\" as it is a great, comprehensive look at the breed, and includes information found in \\"Siberian Huskies Complete Owner's Manual\\" (which is itself a good book, but tends to skimp in a few areas).I would pick this book up as an addition to your library but, if you are going to really research these great dogs, I recommend buying one or two others to go along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut and Paste version","review":"Waste of money, The author doesn't even have a husky.

Taylor has done a great job of modernized the text without dumbing it down. There's a great historical introduction, a bunch of endnotes, and More Fruits of Solitude which the Applewood version does not include. For my money, the Taylor version is the better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penn is good but language is a barrier","review":"Penn had some excellent things to say and he said them well three hundred years ago.

It was two feet long, which, frankly, is at least two feet too short. I rigged it to my monitor's USB port and it would not work. I moved it to a USB port on the cpu and, no, it still would not feed the bus. Frustrated, I tossed it to the side and reconnected my 1.0 hub.

However, on both mini-hubs, I had to plug in devices several times, sometimes plugging them into different ports to get them to work. One I set up at one of my user's desks so I don't know if she is having problems. but on my machine, I've had to unplug/replug several times. And I'm only using simple devices like keyboard, mouse and USB flash drives. my printers (3) are plugged into the onboard ports. One machine has XP Pro (32-bit) and the other has Vista 32-bit. Plus, I don't mind the fact that each port is lit (and with a different color), but the flashing light that changes color is rather annoying (it is constantly flashing!) and it seems to serve no purpose at all. I usually don't have any problems with Sabrent products which is why I am so surprised at this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"USB Disco!..","review":"Woo, have I been tossed back to the 1970s or what!? This device would be just great if it were not for the inability to shut-off the lights. The lights are very bright and if you sometimes work at night the lights could pose a problem.On another note, when attached to either a Windows XP or Windows Vista/Windows 7 machine the device registers something less than High-speed USB as advertised. When used with the supplied power adapter or not the device will not show up as a High-speed 2.0 device. The transfer rates of this device have always been better than those of the earlier USB 1.x but never up to par as a true High-speed USB device.However, I would recommend this product to anyone whose needs aren't as demanding and wouldn't mind the Disco light effects.Thanks for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt Work","review":"Never worked for me.

I don't beleive it is supplying the correct power they need to work.... with OR without the supplied AC adapter connected.The lights don't even do anything meaningful. I had figured (before I bought it) that the LED's would correspond to each connection.... they don't! They just blink randomly. My three year old loved it! They got so annoying that I had to cover the whole darn thing with electrical tape so I wouldn't have to see them anymore!I finally gave up on it and it is now in my three year old's room as entertainment. He likes to turn the light out and watch it flash random colors on the walls of his room.So, in conclusion... don't buy this unless you are three years old and like to watch random colored LED's blink on and off in the darken room.... because that is all it's good for! :-P"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm 3 for 3 failed with this one.","review":"I'm on my third one of these and still haven't got one that works properly.

I enjoyed doing something different every day.However, this is NOT for beginners! I would highly recommend Yee's beginner DVD, or one that teaches you all the poses and gets you acquainted with the practice of breathing. I would consider myself a beginner, though I have done a few different DVDs and some classes. I was thankful for the background I had, but still felt I needed to know more poses and be in a little better shape to do some of the workouts on this DVD.If you are at an intermediate level and want some great workouts to do at home every day, this would be perfect. I will definitely be using this DVD after a little more experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying and confusing","review":"I didn't like the speed with which they moved through the poses in some of the segments, especially considering this video has been recommended for beginners. I'm not a beginner, and it was still difficult to keep up with the flow of the poses. If you're looking for a video where poses are held for any length of time, or one that's easy to follow along with, this isn't the one. I also found some of the verbal instructions confusing, and had to stop and rewind the video several times to figure out what they were talking about. Lastly, I didn't appreciate the use of English translations in full substitution for the original Sanskrit names of the yoga poses. I realize not everyone knows the Sanskrit names for the poses, but it's also true that there's no standardization of the English names, either. As a result, I never really knew which pose they were referring to, and this added to my confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Daily Yoga","review":"I'm really enjoying this dvd.

Many of the poses are traditional that you will find on most yoga DVDs, including previous Rodney Yee. HOWEVER, I was very happy to see that some poses were ones I've never seen before (especially see Day 2: ENERGIZE), and they were 5 all new yoga segments. Each segment is unique. Other reviewers have listed specific info about each sement, so I will just focus on my impressions of the DVD. I really enjoyed it. Even though I've been doing yoga for many years, I feel that I learned some new things about form and of course experienced some new poses. I requested the library to buy it, but I'm considering also buying my own copy because I love the DVD that much. I recommend it to both new and experienced yoga practitioners."},{"rating":"2","title":"once a yogi...","review":"I used to do a lot of yoga - before becoming busy with my family.

Every Julia Donaldson book we have read is filled with the same kind of poetry and cute storytelling - she is gifted.Both of our children, now 5 and 3, have loved this book. The different animal encounters make it easy to do some \\"voices\\" for each, although my Gruffalo voice sounds somewhat akin to Billy Bob Thornton in \\"Sling Blade\\".My favorite Gruffalo memory, however, occurred last night when I heard our three-year son \\"reading\\" this book to his bed buddies in the dark. The story is so easy to remember that he can pretty much now recite it, which as a parent makes you all warm inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our all-time favorites.

My key point to you (if you're a parent) - you won't tire of reading this book to your kids (unlike other books). The story/humor is very fun and great illustrations. The story is essentially about a mouse that goes for a walk in the woods, and how it manages to fend off other bigger creatures by being extremely clever.We fell in love with the book, that we've given this as a gift many times - and all our friends have thanked us heartily to introducing them.

I've been reading this book regularly to my son...who is now 18 months old...and neither him nor I have grown tired of it. I have since bought another one for a friend's baby shower and have recommended it to others. Since buying The Gruffalo, I have bought almost all of the books by Julia Donaldson/Axel Scheffler.

Pat, a Red Cross nurse's aid working in Hawaii shortly after WWII, meets Cam, an Army major who is in Hawaii on a secret military mission. Two years previously, Pat and Cam had been engaged after a whirlwind romance, but Pat suddenly disappeared. Pat is now practically engaged to her Aunt's very rich, very influential brother-in-law.A mystery, an angry red-head, stolen diamonds, and numerous misunderstandings abound in this delightful novel as Pat and Cam chase a nondescript black briefcase (reputed to contain a million dollars belonging to the U.S. government) through High Society on the Islands"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book about Friendships","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book.. The relationship these four women share with each other and with the Lord is so inspiring.. I laughed with them at their funny stories and cried when I read about the sadness some of them have had to share. You feel Peggy Benson's sadness at the loss of her husband. You share in Sue Buchanans triumph over breast cancer. You'll cry at Gloria Gaithers tender memories of her mother, and you'll enjoy Joy MacKenzies way with words. But mostly this is a book about friendships. You feel the love these woman have for each other, for their familys and for the Lord. Theres such a warm comfortable feeling between them all.This was given to me by my best friend, and I have to say it's such a wonderful gift for a treasured girlfriend. I could so identify with this book for I love my sisters in the Lord. If you do too you will really enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilder Napalm DVD","review":"This is a great picture and so under the radar.

But I mostly like them because of Jeff Martins voice. He has a beautiful voice, very lyrical and masculine. When I listen to him sing his ballads I actually get chills all over because it sounds so sincere and real--so virile. As opposed to the chessy and treacly songs that are put out by certain \\"boy bands\\".The only problem I have with this album is the song \\"Great Big Lie\\" which seems to be an attack on The Catholic Church/Christian beliefs. I think the writer has a very poor concept of what Christianity is about. But he is entitled to his opinion.But this is my only problem,The Tea Party is obviously a very intelligent and talented band. Any rock group who can make ME enjoy them is doing a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoid the import!","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a great album.

Definitely not worth a few extra dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triptych cliche ballad album plagued with synth","review":"Triptych begins with the energetic feel that dominated Edges of Twilight. However, even this is unoriginal, having kind of an STP feel. Quickly however, the tracks begin to slow and melow into less and less guitar, and more synth and piano. The lyrics and vocals that are strong and full in the previous albums are cliche and flimsy. The sound of the second half of the album is like a bad Queensryche album. It almost seems as if the Tea Party was attempting a more mainstream sound. If this is the case, they failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha...why...???","review":"The Tea Party is an absolutely amazing band; there is no denying that. For people who have little exposure, I HIGHLY recommend their first 3 albums(Splendor Solis, Edges of Twilight, and Transmission). One may note Triptych has been excluded from this group. The reason behind this omission is due to the fact Triptych is a POP album from track 1 to track 12. The Tea Party isn't POP. I cannot stress enough how much I despise this album. I have problems listening to a track to completion. At no point in time(with the exception of Samsara and maybe Halcyon Days; which may be the only songs I consider Tea Party worthy) does the Tea Party expose their talent or reason as to why they have been such a success. The music is overly mediocre and Jeff Martin's singing lacks what he is capable of. It's a shame what happened here and I direly hope the next album will be a redemption for this travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Release of 1999","review":"Of the 75 CDs I purchased in 1999, this one was my favorite. I still find myself listening to it. A great mix of songs with emotionally strong vocals and smart lyrics. Top songs include: Heaven Coming Down, Halcyon Days, Great Big Lie, Touch - all songs on CD are solid. TTP are a great group who's managed to blend many decades of musical styles including many different instruments from around the world. Lead singer Jeff Martin sings with a great deal of emotion. Other CDs to check out are Edges of Twilight (a great TTP release), Transmission (another great TTP release), and Splendor Solis or Alhambra [E.P.] (good TTP releases)."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent music","review":"The best of your albums.

Keep em coming boys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite Tea Party album","review":"I really can't say enough good things about this band. Triptych is another very worthy effort, perhaps their most mature work. Tea Party is kind of like a modern version of the Doors. The talent is phenomenal. It's really uncanny, but lead singer/guitarist Jeff Martin looks, talks, and sings like Jim Morrison; the organist (or pianist/bassist) looks, talks, and plays like the Doors keyboardist Daniel Manczarek; and the drummer looks--well, at least talks, like the drummer for the Doors. But Tea Party is COMPLETELY original, let me stress this point. The music is known for its many-layered quality--alternative/industrial rock, folks, Eastern music, classical--all wrapped up in one. This album has a lot of great songs, including \\"Heaven Coming Down\\" and \\"Gone\\", the latter being one you play for your girlfriend and she tells you \\"oh, thats so beautiful\\" <g>.David Rehakauthor of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentlemen Start Your Engines","review":"This is a game I played at the local game shop several times and had a blast.

It lacks anything that is not covered in documentation, and it is a very rare case when documentation is really better than this trash. I had to write a short program doing specific and simple speech recognition task and ordered this book. To say that I was disappointed is to say nothing. I still had to address documentation and found it much better. Moreover, the book is out of date. SAPI 5.1 was flourishing when this title was issued, and the title discusses SAPI 4.0 Besides, it is impossible to get ant actual skills and learn how to develop speech apps from this book.It is not very understandable why there is no good guide for speech programming using VB, it would be a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two movies for the price of one?!?!","review":"This direct-to-video release feels like two separate movies. Our heroes (the characters from the Robotech Macross saga) prepare to start a grand space expedition. In another part of the galaxy, an old scientist and his assistant fight for survival while giant space bugs (the Invid) invade their planet. The two separate stories never meet.This is four episodes of completed animation for a series that was canned during development. The footage is edited to make the two separate movies that alternate. There's alot of synthesizer music and recycled footage from all three Robotech sagas - another sign of the aborted production.

Made with the same attention to detail and quality as their industrial-strength toaster, this mixer has an amazing amount of power--my first use never took me past the first speed. The soft-touch really is extremely comfortable, and the mixer is light weight. The internal cord storage (one twists the back to roll the cord into the unit) is very handy for storage in tight spaces. You really can tell the difference between this mixer and those others that one can purchase at a hardware or discount store.

Also, it doesn't even come with a bag to hold it. Once you open the box, it becomes a big hassle to transport.

It's difficult to setup by yourself. I camp in the desert a lot, and high winds are always expected. Instead of staking the guy ropes into the ground, I used sandbags to hold it up. Since then, it has fallen over and the poles have bent. I recommend the shelters with the fiberglass (flexible) poles, as they flex in the wind, but do not break.

It suprised me with the subtle humor regarding sexual discoveries among the main character as he is going through puberty during his adolescent years. The writing of the film (basing myself from the available subtitles) was simplistic, sometimes corny, but the expressions conveyed enough to carry the movie through...The movie is slow-paced and quite of bit of pensive, no-dialogue, moments that could have been filled with some dialogue, e.g. the movie could have a stream-of-conscious approach to know the thoughts of the character, or to compliment his vivid stares of curiosity into women's breasts and vaginas in the many bathhouse scenes.It's a fun movie to watch on a rainy day...I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Dissapointment","review":"I loved the movie and the music. I read the previous reviews and purchased at great expense this CD.With apologies to the previous reviewers, I can't belive that we listened to the same CD.

Every now and then you can get lucky. The sound quality of this CD is so bad that my wife walked into the room while I was playing the soundtrack (first time ever) and asked \\"what is that horrible shrill.\\"The previous reviewer did however lead me to the Candoli Brothers, which is the reason I like the music in Bell, Book, and Candle to begin with.

I didn't feel that I came away with any more knowledge from reading it, and my theory is that even if I come away with at least 10% more knowledge then it was a good book to read.I have heard William Craig Lane debate, and he was succint in his technique, so I thought that this book would be like that, but for me it just wasn't.But for all those who enjoy a book with graphs and equations you will love it.For me though it was really hard going, and never really understood where he was coming from or indeed his conclusion.

It is an interesting collection in which he sings songs from shows that he was in and songs from shows that he was not in. He even sings some songs that are usually sung by a woman.

Light, fun, fast reading.In \\"The Logistics of Carthage\\", Mary Gentle describes a minor incident in an alternative medieval (Arian) North Africa, which is apparently part of the backplot to her novel \\"Ash\\". Unfortunately this rather drags as a standalone story, with a great deal of emotional agonizing and very slow plot movement.In \\"The Last Ride of German Freddie\\", Walter Jon Williams gives us Friedrich Nietzsche in the Gunfight at the OK Corral.

But at the same time I saw they were filled with brilliant social observation, great wit, a certain humor and an effort at putting the phonys of this world down a peg. Like all really sharp social criticism these works have an element of cruelty in them. So let's say it is really a matter of taste that I did not like them so much.

A very compelling read that I could not put down until the very end, and at the end, I was left with the desire for more.I carried these characters around with me wondering what I would have done in their place. Shamed at the way America treated the men who fought for it in the war; for the way the USA treated the migrant workers.

Some tracks drive you onwards, never wanting them to end, for example the Reprise of Full Moon in My Pocket has a childishly simple piano riff which gets treated with ever-increasing amounts of reverb, until the notes are totally blurred. And Gunboats, with the sound of someone ripping open a polystyrene-packed squeaky toy box and squeaking it whilst the eery slide guitar and rest of the track sound, giving it a semi-violent, semi-childlike quality. Wonderful stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album from \\"THE JUG\\"","review":"No surprise that \\"Bomojazz\\" reviewed this rare album that no one seems to know about...you're a legend man. Yes a good date for Ammons indeed. The sound quality is not perfect, but good enough to enjoy thoroughly. This band souns very big for a trio, but when you have a decent organ player on stage it always sounds bigger. Gene plays well thoughout the whole show, especially on C Jam Blues. There is a nice \\"flight of the bumblebee\\" insert at the end of his solo on that track. Don't know how many copies are left out there, but it is worth picking up. I tend to play it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for new teachers!","review":"This is a great book for anyone planning to teach, especially in a urban classroom where you are most likely to have diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books out there","review":"I had to read this book for an education class, and it seemed obvious that this was just the published research of one project.

Like the previous post said, it's not for people who are just merely curious but for someone who wants to really study the subject. There are A LOT of technical terms so that may tend to bore people.

Her voice is extremely choppy and forced, and she cannot handle those decending R&B inflections she's attempting on her songs. She is very unsoulful, and her guitar playing is mediocre, dragging out uninspiring solos for 3 or 4 minutes or more on this live disc. Compare her voice to Susan Tedeschi or her playing to Debbie Davies and she's KO'ed in the 1st round.

The JLA members are like blocks of wood inhabiting a world full of would be world conquers from outer space. There is nothing here worth while as far as story telling is concerned. Unlike what Stan Lee was doing with the Avengers, it seems that DC was happy just putting out pointless empty fluff with its big team book. I have to say this was horrible and might be great if only for the nostalgia but nostalgia is suicide so don't.

Loki isn't Thor's half-brother here - he seems to be some kind of evil devil totally unrelated to the gods. Anyway, after wiping out Asgard, only Thor survives - saved by a valkerie maiden with a mexican accent (lots of that in Nordic heaven, I take it).The fight then moves to Los Angeles, where Thor dukes it out with Loki in the same alley over and over. This could all be campy fun, but Thor is a whiny idiot who will grind on your nerves 10 minutes into the movie.

And the rest of the show was about finding the hammer of the gods. Oh and asgard, land of the gods looks like a cheap medieval setting.Coupled with bad acting and direction, the writers of this show should be hung and flocked, and the director should never be allowed near any kind of script with mythology.

I'll even curl up with this and read it on my free time."},{"rating":"2","title":"alot of good stuff","review":"This book has all the answers to your questions. Mom loves helping out but will be impressed you can do some things on your own and when you get married your wife will also be impressed you can at least do your laundry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home of the Obvious","review":"This book was touted to have all sorts of insightful information, but instead it is just many many pages of the obvious. The writing is good and the author is sometimes entertaining, but the purpose of the book is not met. I don't think anyone needs a book to tell them to use tile cleaner for tile, soap scum cleaner for soap scum and a dust mop for dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good topic but BAD book.","review":"My husband and I both have careers, and we both could use this kind of information for ways to keep our house better. However, this weighty tome is extremely difficult to use. You can't simply turn to a section and get the tips you need. Also, the author, who (to be honest) (...)has no background in this area, writes about herself, and, to be honest, I don't care about her thoughts or her life. I just want the information. I mean, if I have a stain in a sink or want some information on where to put the dessert spoon when I set the table, I don't want to wade through irrelevant ramblings from the writer. So, the bottom line is this: This is a good topic. But this is a BAD book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice Valentine Gift for my little Pumkin","review":"I have recently purchased Cheryl Mendelson's wonderful book \\"Home Comforts\\" and formally presented it to my wife and housekeeper. You should have seen their little eyes light up when I sat them down to review it with them. Yet another bonding moment...I found the book very readable, helpful and well crafted. There is a wealth of information on vitually every aspect of maintaining one's home within its covers. Since I am the more organized partner of my marriage I have found it to be a wonderful tool in helping my wife mend her sometimes messy ways.I highly recommend this book to other husbands as a gift for their wife. After all, a man's home is his castle and who wants to live in a less than perfect castle? Further, since valentine's day is just around the corner Home Comforts would make the perfect romantic gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those raised by wolves...","review":"This will be brief, but I hope helpful. Do NOT order this book, as I did (I'm returning it) unless you were raised by wolves less nurturing than Romulus' and Remus' wolf-mother. Save yourself the money and watch Martha reruns or go to her website, or spend about 5 minutes in ANY home magazine. The author goes on for pages about the simplest things--which might sound good, but there are only so many ways to fold a pillowcase--and only one according to them, same with t-shirts, etc. There is a lot of erroneous information in the laundry section! Do not follow directions in this book unless you want to set a stain for good. A HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words, not enough data","review":"I found this book to be too wordy. As a woman who works full time and keeps a house, I don't have time to understand, for example, WHY I'm eating lunch. I bought this book because I wanted an all-in-one easy reference guide, not an encyclopedic listing of impressive house related words.When I finally needed the book, however, it failed me. Living in a seaside community, I needed information on controlling mold in the home, and the book fails to describe what actions to take and/or whom to call with concerns. I'm sure this book works for true housewives who have the time to appreciate and read the author's beautiful prose, but I am not that person.I am going to donate this book to the local library in the hopes that someone else can benefit from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Martha Stupid Cleans House\\"","review":"Oh Puleeze! I was so excited about this book. Especially since I am \\"only\\" a housewife and it would be wonderful to have homemaking elevated to the status it deserves. But taking \\"joy\\" in ironed sheets! Get a grip. And as previous reviewers noted it is excess verbiage--give me the Reader's Digest version. It may have really good information but I couldn't get past that the Martha Stewart-type manual of housecleaning--now there's a woman with too much time and too little reality on her hands! On the book jacket it says the only manual about housekeeping by a single author-so! I'd like to see the multi-author books maybe they'd have some balance in their books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quad play","review":"I purchased 4 copies of the same title from four different suppliers. All 4 copies arrived promptly and as good or better than described."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it- hire a live in domestic","review":"This book seems even too elementary for a 20 something. The advice given is not specific in areas where one would expect it and need it. The time needed to employ many of her cleaning techniques would keep the average homeowner a prisoner in his/her domicile for eternity and beyond. This book seems more of a tedious romanticized historical book on cleaning then a book that would help on any specific household cleaning task."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"I was so disappointed. I thought this would have much more meat to it. If you know how to fold a fitted sheet, iron a blouse, or use lime-away on shower doors don't bother with this book. I was looking for different, helpful hints. Mom already told me to use lime-away. I have a book called something like \\"Yankee Home Hints\\" that is just filled with useful tips and hints on everything you could image. I guess I was hoping this book would be more like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running the middle class home","review":"Best book I've ever read on the management of the middle class home. More than I'd really need to know; great for the things I want to know. Great book on an underrated management art."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful book communicating a real love of home-making","review":"This is a book you will refer to again and again over the years and probably pass on to your children. On the other hand, you probably won't be able to part with it and you'll buy them their own copies instead! The author has a real love and appreciation for the value of home-making. She knows that taking good care of your environment is inseperable from taking good care of yourself and those you love. She expresses this in many ways, thus inspiring the novice and reinforcing the enthusiasm of the experienced. This book is filled with wonderful ideas and everyone with an interest in the subject will find something worhtwhile in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive achievement","review":"Home Comforts is a text book and encyclopedia on the art and the science of creating a clean, organized and comfortable home. You can read it from cover to cover like a novel because the author's humorous anecdotes and pleasant writing style make it fun or you can go straight to what your problem is. After reading the chapter of food safety I headed to my kitchen and made some important changes. I also discovered why my wood floors look so bad (according to the book I've been doing everything you shouldn't do to wood). The book also gets into the nitty gritty of insurance and accidents on your property and what should be in your safety deposit box. I can't say enough good things about this practical, wonderful masterwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference guide","review":"I borrowed this book from the local library and enjoyed it so much that I bought it today. It is great for answering the questions that some of have. I was not really taught the ends and outs of the \\"little\\" things that make a home. I found this book extremely informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical for the average homemaker","review":"Like the author, I've always enjoyed reading about housekeeping, cleaning, and organizing. Unlike the author, I am not naturally tidy or organized. I thought this book would help me move past these shortcomings; sadly, it did not. It mostly succeeded in making me feel bad about myself in the same way that Martha Stewart can make me feel bad about myself. I will simply never have the time or energy to devote to constant drain and mattress maintenance, wall-washing, sheet-ironing, etc. If you are the sort of person who would actually enjoy performing these activities, then get this book. It is comprehensive and very well-written. What it is not is practical, unless you are very motivated about deep cleaning and extremely detail-oriented about every aspect of home care. For those of us willing to settle for clean enough, I highly recommendHouseworksinstead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information Overload","review":"The book is very complete, but be prepared it has more information than you could have ever imagined.I probably needed something a little less complete to avoid information overload."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most useful book I own!","review":"I adore this book. It's a real page turner that is full of interesting tidbits about keeping a clean house. My hat is off to Ms. Mendelson for doing so much research and work on the subject. What causes freezer burn? What's the best way to iron a shirt? How many cups of sweat does an adult perspire in bed each night?Who wouldn't want to know the answers to these questions? Though the author probably wouldn't recommend it, I might suggest having this book available as bathroom reading material because it is so immediately interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine gift for a bride OR a groom","review":"I ordered this book after seeing roaches crawling around outside my apartment building. I knew immediate and drastic measures must be taken to prevent infestation. The book is informative and readable-- but at times I found her insistence that housekeeping is something you do for you own comfort forced (eating cookies in bed is comforting but I doubt she endorses that sort of behavior)The book has some chapters that may be extraneous, such as the depth of material on fabric but is mostly devoted to useful topics. Many reviews have suggested that this is a fine gifts for brides, but as housekeeping is no longer the sole domain of women, the book is just as suitable as a gift to the groom, as it is not directed a particular gender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home keeping can be an art","review":"This book is not just as a reference book. I was attracted to the idea that \\"home-making\\" is a serious and needed vocation. She was able to write without simplistic demeaning remarks, and without the idea of a \\"perfect\\" Martha-Stewardish home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honors a beautiful art.","review":"The art of homemaking, and the science, are the substance of this wonderful book. Making a home that is welcoming, nurturing, comforting and well-functioning is truly an art, and the author describes in detail how homemakers can learn the necessary skills. In one area only, she is somewhat lacking: making your own cleaning products. For that, read Karen Logan's outstanding guidebook _Clean House, Clean Planet._ There is such joy in making a home that works, with skill and knowledge. Ms. Mendelson lets readers in on how that can be accomplished. However expert, anyone can learn from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference on the Ideal","review":"This is a great book for those that want to know what the ideal housekeeping situation is. Even the author admits that some things, such as daily vacuuming are unrealistic for most people, she still explains why it would be the best thing if possible. I learned a lot from this book about what would be the perfect situation, such as proper place settings for the dinner table. I've successfully adopted and adapted several points in it. This has improved life in our home due to reduced allergens, etc. Of course, I have to pick and choose which things specifically are worth budgeting the time for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I was not raised to be a house keeper. I am mistified by the gadgets and chemicals involved. I am paranoid of damaging clothing in the laundry. I fear household chemicals.This book has taken 95% of the confusion and guesswork out of running my house. I now know how to properly clean my floors - what chemicals, techniques, tools. I can wash my clothes with out fear of damaging them. I know which solvents and detergents are appropriate for which uses. I also know the whys and wherefores of house keeping.I very much appreciate the intelligent and respectful tone of the book. It doesn't try to minimize housekeeping by including inane little lists and tips on avoiding work like many modern house keeping and orginization books. It is written to help the reader understand the workings of a house, how to keep it clean and fresh, and what to do when problems arise.And believe it or not, it is actually very interesting. Who woulda thought?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Housekeeping Reference","review":"While the author of this book is not someone I could ever be good friends with, she does seem to be the kind of person I wish I could be more like...the Martha Stewart type with a beautiful, spotless house that can whip up a five course meal with a few odds and ends from the pantry.That said, this book has made a difference in different areas of my housekeeping. For the first time in my life, I am able to effectively insert my comforter into the duvet cover. I know how to clean my woodwork. I am stocking my pantry better than before.I don't believe anyone could do everything in this book...at least I can't and have a life. But doing even a few of the suggestions makes a significant difference. An excellent book to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Art","review":"The book is inspirational as well as practical. It has made me realize that housekeeping is not necessary drudgery but rather an art which nurtures the family and creates the distinctive character of the home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Home Needs This Book","review":"This is a great book, for the working mother (like myself) and for the homemaker. I'm surprised at the reasons people give for disliking the book i.e. too detailed and tedious. It's a REFERENCE book, unless you like reading encyclopedias or dictionaries for fun, this is not the book you curl up with after dinner. It's the one you turn to if you're not sure of the best way to remove a cherry stain on your blouse. As for the working moms who sniff at the book because they feel their time is better spent with family, again this book is a REFERENCE. There is no person alive who could implement every suggestion this book makes. I've stayed at home and worked, and the simple fact is no one has the time to do all this stuff, but if you want to know HOW and WHY you clean you do, or should, the Home Comforts is an invaluable resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bible, just an encyclopedia","review":"This book is an exhaustive (some might say \\"exhausting\\") reference for everything having to do with housecleaning and keeping. I read this book like crazy when I first got it and instituted some of the recommendations. I felt guilty about some of the stuff that I'm never, ever going to do. Then I forgot about it. Eventually, I hired a cleaning service. But I still think it's a great reference. You can use as much or as little of it as you want. Sure, she puts forth some personal lifestyle opinions, but if I wrote my own book I'd probably do the same. She's probably a Type A personality, but maybe that's what gave her the drive to write such a huge tome to begin with. If the book changes your life, great. If it just helps you buy some good sheets, there's nothing wrong with that either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks but no thanks","review":"This was one of the most tedious reads I have ever attempted-some of the content is practical but I died laughing when the author droned on and on about tasks such as hand dusting your floor. Keeping a comfortable home is one thing-practicality is another. I doubt that anyone who works a fourty hour work week, cooks meals and keeps a relatively clean house would have time to read this book, let alone adopt some of the practices. Check it out at your local library before buying to make sure its for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Fascinating","review":"I devoured the first few chapters of this book within days of receiving it. From that point, I skimmed for time's sake. I found the book wonderfully informative and interesting. Mendelson is hard-core and old school about housekeeping, and I absolutely loved it. She reminded me of a paternal aunt, unabashedly sharing her wisdom and filling in the gaps my mother left. Some pieces of the book left me stunned yet giggling, such as this gem: \\"If you cannot avoid having only sandwiches one day, the rational response is to feel slightly sorry for yourself, not to blame yourself.\\" Reading this book gave me knowledge and background information in order to change some of my habits and begin a new lifestyle, even if I didn't go \\"all the way.\\" Thank you Cheryl for inviting me in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing not already on Google","review":"I was hoping that this book would help me run a cleaner, more efficient, more organized home, but it is just a dictionary-style book of information that is either dated, or already available for free if you Google them (for example, Googling \\"how long before meat spoils?\\" got me the same results as their chapter on food safety).For readers hoping for a manual on housekeeping, I recommend the (now out-of-print) books by Deniece Schofield:Confessions of an Organized Homemaker: The Secrets of Uncluttering Your Home and Taking Control of Your LifeKitchen Organization Tips and SecretsConfessions of a Happily Organized Family"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the July 20,200 review","review":"I had the same negative reaction to this book when I got it, but I thought I must be the only woman who felt that way. I can see that the book has struck a chord among women, but to me the chord was anything but harmonic. The title and content simply are not a match for one another, and I think people are buying the book because of the misleading \\"Home Comforts\\" title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combines the worst of Jane Brody and Martha Stewart","review":"I've always liked how-to-housekeep books, and this was so well reviewed I was really looking forward to it.\\"Home Comforts\\" is as guilt-inducing as Jane Brody, and as out of touch with what is possible (or even desirable) as the nethermost obsessive recesses of Martha Stewart. Examples: The author (a lawyer) tells you the correct footwear for walking up and down stairs. Her method for folding sheets involves having a cleared bed, or an equivalent clean, clear space, to do it on. There are 2 references to Christmas: one under electrical hazard, one under fire hazard (she tells you if your tree dries out before Christmas, get rid of it and get another).The only people this book would be useful for are obsessive-compulsives setting up house, and it would be a truly double-edged gift if you gave it to them. I wish there was a way to give this book less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and hard to use","review":"I received Comforts Of Home as a shower gift, and I have found it to be very hard to use. It's so wordy and comes off as hard to read and hard to use textbook. Just try to find something quickly-----you can't. The information could have been boiled down into a much smaller book if it wasn't so wordy in the first place. I also don't know who this author is, so her credentials are questionable. I hate to sound like an ad, but I also received Making a Home (by the Better Homes and Gardens magazine staff) as a shower gift, and it's great. Really useful and comprehensive. I can find the info I want quickly, and the writing is concise and to the point. Making A Home is far better than Comforts Of Home, because I like the looseleaf binder style with its tabs (just like my favorite cookbook). I'm keeping Making a Home on the kitchen shelf by the phone book because I know I'll keep referring to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of 3 CDs in 1","review":"As an avid fan I still bought this cd without getting any idea of what was on it. The cd is really just songs from 3 different cds TJT already released (Understand This is a Dream, Emotion is Dead, and Music From Another Room). If you own all 3 cds already it may not be worth the money to you especially since there are no new songs on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not support this cd","review":"Buy all of the REAL TJT cd's. Not this one. TJT got screwed over by record labels, that's why they finaly gave up and quit. It's in the letter Brett wrote to all the fans explaining why they quit. Knowing all their cd's, I would NOT buy this cd, simply because, The band did NOT put this out. Everyone of their songs is awesome, and people who buy this cd, might think they have all that tjt has to offer, when they miss all the rest. Just my opinion, I think that you should get the REAL cd's, and not a cheap compilation of SOME of their songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, that's 5 stars","review":"I'll keep it short. So many have avoided this simply because it came after the misfire of \\"Cold Lake\\". Don't be like them. This is only a hair beneath the first three releases in terms of overall quality.

It's a very slow paced suspsense thriller,which lacks the wit and \\"excitment\\" of other Hitchcock films such as \\"Rear Window\\",\\"North by Northwest\\",and \\"The Birds\\". I'm shocked to say very weak performances by two of hollywood's biggest stars(well,at one time anyway)Grant and Fontaine! And Hitchcock's directing isn't up to the usual hugh standard I expect from him. I really can't understand how other reviews can say so many good things about this film. I'm a big Hitchcock fan myself,but I chose to forget I every saw this film in the first place,and just remember Hitchcock for his several other great films. ONLY watch this if you want to see every single Hitchcock film ever made,or just bored. But stay away from this! Go watch \\"Spellbound\\",\\"Vertigo\\",or \\"The 39 Steps\\" instead.

He also calls his over-acting best-friend \\"Beaky\\", and \\"Beaky\\" refers to Johnnie as \\"old bean\\".Out-dated atmosphere where people \\"change for dinner\\", etc.Over the course of time, Lina has a \\"suspicion\\" that Johnnie has killed someone and plans to kill her, too. The ending seems tacked on, and makes a fool out of Lina, and us.Although it contains a few trademark Hitchcock elements, and was Oscar-nominated for Best Picture (and Joan Fontaine won for best actress), this is a dull, dreary bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchcock at his worst","review":"I hope this review will warn others before they go out and buy this movie.

I do like the fact they put \\"The Wrong Man\\" on here since some people may not know it or not remember it, and also it didn't/hasn't gotten acknowledgement, but is a pretty good Hitchcock film.I do wish all of them had the good extras.

I was surprised at how closely the movie tracked the book with the most notable exception of the ending, which of course was dictated by the studio. Lina was such a sympathetic character and beautifully portrayed by the lovely and talented Joan Fontaine. She is so aware, of both her faults and Johnnie's, that it's almost painful to watch. At times I wanted to shake her--she is drawn to Johnnie like an addict to their drug and unable to resist his charm. Unlike some others, I think Cary Grant was perfectly cast as the charming, handsome ne'er-do-well. We all know (or should know) that ugliness may reside in some of the most attractive packages and how weak, lonely people are preyed upon (Lonely Hearts Murderers, etc).For those who haven't read it, I highly recommend reading the book, it's also fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hello, Monkey Face.\\"","review":"A Hitchcock beauty in which Joan Fontaine gradually (and of course wrongly) comes to suspect that her husband (Cary Grant) is trying to kill her for her money. The beginning is slow and the ending a Hollywood code tack-on, but most of the movie is of great interest as the suspense builds and builds. Nigel Bruce is perfectly cast as Grant's crony, and his presence really adds to the suspense. Fontaine won an Oscar. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldnt get into this","review":"It started off well enough . . . the geeky beautiful girl who was tempted by a guy (I would say good looking but Grant appeared very tired and kinda aged in this movie even though he was also looking young [not so puffy of a face]) to awaken her quest to find a relationship.

After looking at Phillip's methods, we were able to add a bunch of functionality for other question types.The fact that it's not a beginner's book is a huge plus also.

I see in his reply that he says he never claimed to do otherwise, but you don't realize this until you have read two chapters.I would prefer it if he had given us less projects but gone over the code in his .as files for us.Also, the author should understand that no one buys a book to get ready-made projects. We are buying these books to learn how to do these things on our own.

His \\"introduction to actionscript\\" dsoesn't really explain much, and is remarkable in its superficiality. The author then then plunges into a series of lessons that are long on script, but pretty much devoid of any explanation of what you're actually doing.If you like following pages of directions, and not actually LEARNING anything, this book is DEFINITELY for you.

Once I get that, the rest should come easily. Also, good luck if you own a Mac.

The backgrounds and sets are gorgeous, but look created and not realistic.The story is about a reporter who will do anything to get the story about a mad plot by a genius who is kidnapping scientists. Sky Captain is a freelance crack pilot with his own airbase.

This time around, its a plot (aka purpose). The movie takes one on a shallow ride--literally--of look-what-we-can-do graphics. It does attempt to go \\"deeper\\" plot-wise, particularly by throwing in a similarity to Wizard of Oz at one point in the movie, but by the end of nearly two hours, we reach an anticlimax.On the collector's edition portion of the disc: Aside from commentary, the collector's edition includes the original 6-minute short of Sky Captain, bloopers, and deleted scenes, including one that should have been left in the movie. Let's just say the scene fills in a part of the story-line transition.

By the way, I enjoyed the brown tinting in \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" which was masterfully done, so I'm not simply someone who dislikes any attempt to manipulate color or film. But in this movie, the attempt was poorly done and failed miserably.As for the plot, I'm not the best one to evaluate it. It was so slow and so boring and so unfocused that I lost interest quickly. I couldn't make it to the end of the movie.The characters? I don't know them as people and thus I don't care.

The past? Nice attempt to create the feel of old crappy Hollywood serials, but it felt like there were only 5 actors (and people) in the entire film and the purposefully bad dialogue and characterization was pretty annoying after five minutes. It might have worked better if it actually seemed like the actors were in the scene when they were filmed, instead of pasted in from shots made in a broom closet. If you want cool footage of dirigibles and flying robots, go see Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky. I'm pretty sure the director did.Actually, if the critical faculties are turned off, this really isn't a bad time waster, even if the sepia-tone makes things look out of focus instead of creating a sense of nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spectacle","review":"Im at a bit of a loss on how to describe this movie, perhaps an action adventure, sci-fi, film noir.

Jude Law stars in the film, along with Angelonie Jolie. The plot seems thin, but there are airplanes, birds, hot-air balloons, WWII fighters, futuristic weapons, and much more! The cinematography is what really caught my eye, with a dreamy, comic-book like fantastic world approach. The visuals are spot-on with incredible CGI and flight sequences that put Star Wars to shame. Comic book or aviation fanatics, this could be what you have been waiting for. With this movie being the one I have been most excited about since Big Fish, which was incredible, this looks like it will break Hollywood ground forever.

Sadly, Sky Captain is the latter. While this film is luminously photographed, it doesn't contain one iota of originality in its threadbare script. Perhaps my sights were set to high, hoping for a loving tribute to films like Metropolis. But even if they were lower, I still might have balked to see a leather-uniformed, eye patch wearing Angelina Jolie giving orders to the \\"amphibious squad\\". Throughout this movie I was literally counting the films which it ripped off.

It has that old 60s classic look and feel. Like those old TV series with the tin foil robots. I suppose that's meant for nostalgic effect but probably not a compelling reason to go see a movie. I mean, if you have color, USE color! In the end, it just made me feel kind of dizzy.The CGI graphics are 2nd rate and the story is not very interesting. Maybe it would've been better if we got to see a Totenkopf. This movie is pretty short so not great value for your money although I'm not sure it would've been a good thing to make it any longer. Escepecially when I'm not particularly a fan of Jude Law nor Gwyneth Paltrow.Having said that, the movie does have its moments and I do like Angelina Jolie, although I'm not sure why you would cover half her face with an eyepatch.

This film is infinitely distant from films like Metropolis. This film is for dorks who excuse a film's flaws for the sake of the fact that it's particular to their interests.

Right down to camera angles, robot design, everything. And never is there a mention as him or the cartoon as a inspiration. Polly perkins is even a reporter like Lois lane. And the last comic ripp off I found was the Frankie character, who just like Marvel's Nick Furry, has an eye patch and comands a flying base in the clouds. And once again there is no mention of the comic or character as in inspiration. The mysterious woman character reminded me all too much of Darth Maul from starwars. And while the technology was a step forward all the charcters were a step backwards, with no credit to the origionals. Not origional enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little washed out","review":"That's the only way I can describe it; both the imagery and the actors seem to have been painted in watercolors, only with too much water and not enough color. As many predicted, the mostly-virtual sets don't provide much inspiration for the actors to, y'know *act*. Instead, the film sort of lurches from one improbable premise to another, with little or no basis in plot or anything resembling logic.Overall, I haven't seen such a waste of time & money (not to mention pathetic acting) since the \\"Dune\\" remake. Near the end of the movie, our hero is fighting an evil cyborg, and gasps \\"Why won't you die?\\" By that point, I was rooting for the cyborg. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is utter garbage","review":"I quite honestly have not seen a movie this bad since battle field earth! The story is weak and the characters are tremendously one sided. I was under the impression that Angelina Jolie would have a large part in this film, unfortunatly I and most others were let down by her ten minutes of screen time! visualy speaking, sky captain is not as amazing as it has been said to be, after about a half an hour the \\"vintage\\" filter that this was shot in becomes less of a novelty and more of a petty annoyance. the cgi is decent but by no means breathtaking or ground breaking. Not even the addition of A list actors could save this pitiful attempt, there is absolutly no chemistry between the the two lead characters. This movie had sooooo much potential and all it needed was better direction! I did'nt expect an oscar worthy movie, i did however expect a fun and entertaining movie, I had much more fun counting the people leaving the theater!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sky Captain Blu-Ray","review":"It is always a pleasure to comment on a movie that is so entertaining. From the outtakes in the Special Features, the actors looked to have had a great time during the filming. The special effect are more enhanced in the Blu-ray format. I have added this title to my special collection. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"Interesting movie... the graphic backgrounds are brilliant in a 1930's serial throwback kind of way, especially in the first 20 minutes, and it's worth seeing just for that, but the script is truly dismal, Jude Law is too bland to carry a movie of this type, and don't get me started on what I think of Angeline Jolie's \\"acting\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be!","review":"It's hard to believe that basically everything other than the actors was CGI. The acting was pretty good from Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow, but Angelina Jolie was a joke. This is worth seeing on the BIG screen to take in the visual wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, I assure you; It's a gimmick","review":"All right, so, I, a gay fella, fit only one gay stereotype perfectly - I adore art deco, Norman Bel Geddes, and modernist architecture/design. This also means I love the 1920s and 1930s. So, the look of this film is spot-on perfect for me and my aesthetic sense. The characters could have done been more effective if they weren't so close to being like characters from an earlier era of film. They were basically cardboard cutouts of film archetypes. None of them, except for Giovanni Ribisi's \\"Dex\\", are likable and the adventure aspect was difficult to enjoy because I didn't give a damn about anyone involved - - except for Dex. After realizing and saying all this, though, I'm quite likely to watch the film multiple times because of how much I love the look and feel of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic book fun","review":"This movie rather requires a mindset capable of using Saturday Matinee serials as a frame of reference. If you can accept that, it's a lot of fun. Yes, there are incongruities in the plot (and lots of them, for instance: Why evacuate by parachute the breeding stock from the rocket when it malfunctions if it's still going to incinerate the earth anyway?) . Unlike other reviewers, I don't really think the acting is anything to write home about, particularly Gweneth Paltrow. But, view it as you would a comic book and it's marvelous. The flying robots in the beginning are reminiscent of the Superman cartoons of the 1940's (worth a look themselves). The visuals and angles are also of a comic book perspective (especially the initial half dealing with the city shots). The whole thing is pretty much CGI and looks it, but it doesn't matter; it's just fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwback to the serials of the 30s/40s","review":"I really like this movie, I think that it kind of peters out towards the end but visually it is a stunner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I personally enjoyed the 40s camp style of this movie.

First, the good. The special effects are fantastic and the acting is top notch, as would be expected from the top drawer cast.The plot is disjointed and non-sensical. At times it gave me the sense that they were making it up as they went along. In order to compensate for the lack of a plot or any meaningful dialogue among the actors, the movie is absolute non-stop, balls out action.The movie is as frenetic as it is vapid - at least it is for adults.All that said, I probably would have loved this when I was about 8 or 9 years old. At its heart, it's a children's movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Cast/Breathtaking Art","review":"Where do I begin? The moment when Jude Law (as Sky Captain) bursts out in marvelous laughter, after Gwyneth Paltrow's stumbling camera-snapping mishap across a log bridge, is worth the price of this DVD and then some.With nearly the entire production photographed in blue screen, with backgrounds, effects, and even characters mixed in later, the actors in this film show their brilliance, from Jude Law to Gwyneth Paltrow to Angelina Jolie to Giovanni Ribisi to the late Lord Olivier.The extras on this disk that show the process in making this independently produced film are equally fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Sky Captain was a astonishing and fun movie. I especialy enjoyed the lovely scenery and the special effects. I also endoyed the acting.My only problem was the romance between Paltrow and Law.

It's like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and several other different movies(Batman, Superman, King Kong,Etc.) all rolled into one. Acting is very memorable(with Jude Law as Joe\\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan, Gwyneth Paltrow as reporter Polly Perkins, Giovanni Ribinsi as Sky Captain's loyal ally Dex, and Angelina Jolie as Capt. Frankie Cook, a loyal friend of Sky Captain's). As for everything else(visual effects, direction, even story was pretty good) was very good. All in all, a terrific film that is truly worth seeing. I can't wait for a sequal!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All pretty pictures and no substance","review":"Any fan of golden age science fiction will appreciate the concept of this movie. An evil genius, big machines with rivets, robots, a quirky sidekick and a romantic interest make this a cookie cutter plot of the H.G. Wells era of science fiction. Visually, this movie is spectacular and it has brought life to classic fantasies of how the future world looked like to the people of the industrial revolution.Unfortunately the movie falls flat in execution. The actors, normally dependable, are detached and disinterested in the world around them. I would describe the performances as \\"lazy.\\" It was as if Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and (Male Lead) were stuck on a boring carnival ride and couldn't wait for the ending so they could go home.This movie might be an important milestone in cinematic technology. It was the first (insert research here). However, it is simply impossible to ignore the weak plot and sleepy acting. This movie is a definite skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-class Science Fiction Excellent Story, Excellent Visuals","review":"This movie will remind many of the much anticipated movie 'Man Conquers Space'.This is the kind of story that would have been done in the 1940s or 1950s if they would had our modern technology for special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie","review":"This movie was a really fun movie. Cool gadgets. It was like Star Wars meets Indiana Jones meets Lara Croft.But the movie really had a crappy story line. Like the big bad evil in the end was disappointing.

It's the result of a dream combined with almost inconceivable determination on the part of Kerry Conran, who started work on it using a Mac IIsi in 1994. There were no sets for this movie. It was all blue screen with computer-generated digital backgrounds that were all created on Macs. The complete story is here and it's fun reading.http://www.apple.com/pro/video/conran/The film itself is fun. Not the best I've ever seen, but genuinly entertaining. Definitely worth seeing in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sky Captain is beyond belief","review":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow - This is a great movie. It is beautifully filmed and has a plot that will remind you of all those classic adventure stories plus sci-fi greats like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. The movie was almost 100 percent CGI, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all. Jude Law is great at playing the epic larger than life hero who is never beaten no matter what the odds. The gadgets are fun, and the robots are cool in a retro yet futuristic kind of way. I highly recommend this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HDDVD!","review":"I liked the movie on DVD and liked it even better in HD.

However, all it did was remind me of why people don't make movies like this and why Science Fiction Theater 3000 got many laughs from an implausible plot and horrible acting. The sad thing is... this seemed intentional.If you are looking for something different from today's science fiction, this might be for you. If you are looking to see what science fiction used to look at, you might like to take a peak at this. If you tend to like the direction science fiction is headed and don't want to look back, skip this movie.I fit the in the last category and wish I hadn't wasted money on this rental or the time invested to sit through it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice HD transfer","review":"While the movie is corny, the HD quality is excellent.

I found its look extremely distracting because it gave me eye strain. But if we cut through that, we find that, in fact, this movie sucks. Well, I admit that I only watched 2 of its 20 (I think) segments. It's a loving tribute to 30s radio sci-fi serials and 50s sci-fi TV, but I see no reason to pay tribute to either of those formats, because they're full of bad writing, bad acting, and bad science.

My doctor recommended meditation. I had no idea what to buy, so I bought 10 different meditation CDs. While the other CDs had nice meditations, this CD was BY FAR the best for sleeping. There is only one meditation track on this CD, and it is unusually long (30 min). It is the perfect pace for slowly drifting into sleep. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone with sleep problems. The only (small) problem with this CD is the second track, which is just music. It is dramatic and wakes me up after the great meditation. I usually program my CD player to just play the first track and I'm thinking about copying the first track to another CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"The first half of this CD is spoken, presumably taking you through a relaxation process.

It's sort of an intellectual's Dracula, because it was written twenty years prior to Dracula and features a fairly erotic & explicit lesbian vampire (at least by the standards of the time). The writing's excellent, and there are some brilliant moments in the tale (my favorite is probably the vampiress's blithe purchase of a peddler's charm against the \\"oupire.\\"So read it, and you'll not only get a fun vampire story under your belt, you'll also get to say you've read Important Literature.

Well, this is the story that started it all - it even pre-dates \\"Dracula\\" and is thought to have inspired Bram Stoker. Carmilla is a beautiful mysterious young woman who appears one day in the life of young and innocent Laura. Although she seems to be a stranger, Laura recognizes Carmilla from dreams she had as a child. After one such dream, Laura had woken up with odd puncture marks on her chest. Carmilla becomes close friends with her but remains secretive and moody. Also she tends to sleep during the day...Nowadays we can all see where this story is going from here but it nevertheless stands the test of time. When I first read this, I was amazed at the homoerotic elements, and a certain scene with a traveling dentist always makes me chuckle.If you are a fan of the vampire genre, this is definitely recommended reading and the Kindle price can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed kindle addition","review":"I HAD TO RETURN THIS VERSION BECAUSE IT WAS FLAWED AND DIDNT WORK ON MY KINDLE---PAGES KEPT JUMPING TO END ETC ---AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY WOULD REPORT IT AND FIX IT BUT I DONT KNOW, SO ----BEWARE---IT WAS A MESS AND I NEVER GOT TO READ THE BOOK---NO STARS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very creepy story","review":"I'm not into vampire stories, although I went through a phase of reading Anne Rice back in the 80s, but more for the complex world she built than for the vampires per se, but I enjoyed Carmilla. Carmilla is truly creepy, and it's a great psychological horror piece. The evil in Carmilla is beautiful, both repulsive and attractive at the same time, and just slightly out of reach until the end.The story is well-developed and yet not terribly long, and it was a fast and easy read. I really recommend it to anyone who likes Gothic horror -- or even to those who enjoy period fiction. The story was written in the 1870s, but takes place supposedly in the 1820s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Delightful","review":"We had to read the novella Carmilla for class, and at first I thought it would be entirely cheesy. I was pleased to find that I liked the story quite well, especially in comparison with many modern vampire-based pieces. There is certainly a more prominent sense of the vampire being a cursed, soulless being, rather than the romanticized versions we see on the big screens today. The setting is leaning towards gothic (remote, old castle home place, etc, etc.). I was slightly(okay, more than slightly) disturbed by the intimacy displayed by Carmilla to the young female narrator, but I realize that that woman-to-woman affection may have been written in a different context than what we today perceive it to mean.

Horror films are not my forté, but this piece gave me a newfound respect and admiration for those involved, especially the women. It was really very interesting to hear what they had to go through, from THEIR perspective as opposed to a more casual observer. I would highly recommend this documentary for anyone interested in horror films, scream queens, the film industry, and women in cinema.

Alexandre Dumas has great skill for describing the inconceivable. I liked how he intertwined history with his story and I liked that he would allude to other great writings (e.g. Arabian Nights). This French mini-series is the closest film version I have found of the Count of Monte Cristo. If you really like the book like I did, then you will find a way to track a copy of this mini-series down to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!","review":"OK, whoever thinks that this adaptation is acceptable has obviously not read the book. The only thing that the mini-series has in common with the book is the title. This adaptation has deleted about half of the characters and added a few more. Those that remain are the worse off--they're made so simple and ridiculous. It's understandable that any adaptation would fall short of the book. I'd suggest buying a copy of the book and enjoy every page of it. There are much better uses of plastic than to make additional copies of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unnecessary remake","review":"I was very disappointed by this version of Monte Cristo. Depardieu is everywhere to be seen, yet he doesn't really play Dantes: he plays Depardieu. Additionally, he as fat as ever, even though he is supposed to have spent 20 years in prison, with only staled bread to eat. The very day he escapes from prison, he doesn't even have a beard. Maybe he had his own private barber in prison...Even the direction is really uninspired. Josee Dayan is really not a great director. The scenery is mostly flat, and the camera is very static all the way. To add insult to injury, they betrayed Dumas in their changed ending.Not everything is bad though: for example, Jean Rochefort plays a very good Count of Morcerf.In the end, this is a poor remake, especially after the many cinema adaptations. If you want to see a much better version, turn to the 1955 version by Robert Vernay, with Jean Marais as Edmond Dantes, or Claude Autant-Lara's 1961 version with Louis Jourdan as Dantes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and engaging. Worth the time!","review":"One of the frequent complaints against filming classic tales, is that the film-maker did not following the authors vision. I will beg veiwers to remember that film is an art, just as writing is an art. The film-maker and the crew are working to convey an impression of another artists' (Dumas is this case) art work.This version of Le Comte.. is no exception. I feel the vision was fresh, engaging and fun. Depardieu is excellent, as always. Ornella Muti, as Mercedes, is ravishing and worth 20 years in solitude! It is easy to see why, in this interpretation of the tale, that Mercedes is the ultimate revenge!Good music score and costumes complete the film. Very good quality overall. I enjoyed the transitions and flash backs. I feel more flash backs would have added much."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I bought this DVD set back in 2000 when it first came out after seeing the original miniseries aired on Bravo. The scenery is spectacular, the acting is well-done and it remains fairly faithful to the original. If anything was changed, it was to streamline the story (the book I have is 1400+ pages) but there were a few creations that weren't necessary in my opinion.There are a few things about the book that made it better, such as the ability to disguise the identity of certain characters, giving the audience/reader a sense of occlusion. This isn't possible when you have an actor playing their parts, but it isn't fair to fault the filmakers for that.I'd reccommend it, especially if you're into historical pieces. I originally bought it to keep up with my French, and have watched it five or six times (which is a lot given that it's so long!) but I now watch it for it's artistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stain upon the book","review":"The plot loosely follows that of the book, but changes so much that it is nearly impossible to care about any of the characters in the story.

Despite the fact that it's been 30 years since then, I remember virtually every word and without a doubt every scene. This film reflects a desire of the director/screen writer to leave a track in literature more than attempt to pass the spirit of the book onto the viewer. Many key scenes are not included - I understand that it is impossible to include the entire novel but... - while many scenes/characters have been invented for no apparent reason. For example, at one point, Mone Cristo gets invilved in romantic relationship interrupted by arrival of the Ali's daughter. It's a totally unjustified fantazy - it does not show a new twist in character of the hero. Actually, it damages the idea of Count's preoccupation or rather obsession with his mission which Duma had managed to emphasize. Excellent actors, poor movie! Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Monte Cristo","review":"Now we have a Monte Cristo that is long enough to tell the story. The acting is stellar and while the story does not exactly match the book it is very entertaining.

I loved the movie and acting so much that I looked past it, but buyer beware! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An impossible task, well done","review":"The actting and sets were exceptional. The main problem is that the Count of Monte Cristo is too rich a story to fit in a mere 400 minutes. The book deserves a longer treatment, say on the order of magnitude of I, Claudius. The DVD makes the Count a much softer character, compresses the time between his escape and his revenge, downgrades the importance of the wonderful character Haydee ( while promoting the Ali Pasha to a Sultan) and rewites the ending. It's a 5 star production if you haven't read the book. My only complaint about the DVD is that you do not have the option of turning off the subtitles. Read the book; the 1400+ pages fly by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnificient production, classic plot made much worse","review":"The production is opulent. The contents is terrible.The original story is a melodrama with some silliness, and this was an opportunity to use just the best part of this classic. Unfortunately, the very great liberties taken with the original have had the effect of adding more absurdities and silliness.An example of a disastrous tampering with the original: The new version adds an irrelevant love affair for Dantes. The woman, not in the original, keeps groveling for Dantes to spend the night with her. He finally does as a favor for her, and she is ecstatic. Supposedly nothing would be more important for her than to spend the rest of her life with him. Well, he offers her that but she insists on his going back to his Mercedes, now much the worse for wear.

There are other little differences, but the ones just mentioned are the ones I feel the most important. Otherwise it is fairly faithful to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prof. C.R.

At one point, there are captions for actors who can be clearly heard and are not using that much vernacular. The characters say one thing and do another in haphazard fashions.Now maybe I just got a bad copy. But this had no menu. The film starts and that's it. There's no Spanish subtitles, no chapter selection options, nothing.

Imagine if he could haveplayed another 5 years, what he could have done! He holdsmany records that will never be broken. He is truly alegend! Gary Cooper did a great job playing Gehrig!

Gary Cooper, direct from his success (and Oscar) as Sergeant York, here portrays Lou Gehrig with sensitivity and humor (earning an Oscar nomination). Teresa Wright was nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress that year (winning Supporting for \\"Mrs.Miniver\\"). There's excellent support from Walter Brennan and the real Babe Ruth. Sam Wood directed with a nostalgic hand, putting this film up there with the great films of the 40's, and one of the best sports films ever. By all means, check it out. There are no extras on this 65th Anniversary DVD, but the film is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ANOTHER EDITION!","review":"How many editions are there going to be?

She and her husband have a very loving relationship but things get strained when his family gets on a boat to America and moves in with them. A complex relationship forms between the overbearing Mother in law, a trampy neice, and a sweet as pie sister in law.Overall I enjoyed the book, however I was a little put off in a few places where Charis refers to the American way being the only dignified and civil way to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery, Even Deceptive Publication Date","review":"The sub-title of this work is \\"Third Edition,\\" which apparently came out in 1997, based on the date of the \\"Preface to the Third Edition\\" but its publication date is given as 2003.

The only thing I had to consult the documentation for was the process of establishing the connection - the default worked, but it seemed to want reassurance- Push the button on the receiver, then on the mouse to set the channel; then do the same with the keyboard. Once I did that, everything was happy.The mouse button and the keyboard keys are stiffer than I am accustom to; hope this does not bode ill for the ol' carpal tunnels. But the mouse works from farther away than I can see the screen, so no complaints there.The One-Touch keys behave as expected. They seem to be lower on the priority stack - it can take a few tenths of a second to pause Media PLayer, for example. I have not installed the software that came with the thing, so I don't know if there is a way to move the interrupt request higher on the priority. All around, a decent keyboard and mouse. I'll just push a little harder than I used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This CD is everything that SYG is live that is lacking inMutiny!While the full length was a little over-produced, Reset captures the energy that is on full display at the show.

It's frighteningly easy to set up and administer and even backing up whilst users are running (with the Advanced Open File module included) has minimal impact on either the PC/Server being backed up or even on the network.

I did not find traditional japanese tsukemono in this book, and I was very disappointed. The author combines french cuisine with japanese pickling techniques.I made several of the recipes in this book and none of them were to my liking, usually too bland or too singularly flavored (too much sweet or too much salty, not enough mixing of flavors).The pictures in the book are excellent and the author does a thorough job of explaining pickling with rice bran. If you're looking for more of a western-eastern fusion type of thing, this book would serve you well. If you're looking for \\"traditional\\" tsukemono, go elsewhere.(corrected per comment below - thanks!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good if you have a major Japanese market close","review":"The recipes are clearly written and easy to follow and produce good to excellent results--the few I have tried.

That's the one star of this review. But as far as fiction goes, the rest is lacking in everything. Plot is ridiculous, characters are weak and unrealistic, dialogue is no stronger than a made-for-TV movie, and even more shocking.. there are countless grammatical mistakes littered throughout the novel.If you are an intellegent person, your reading dollar belongs in better reading. Consider \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown, as this series seems to be a retaliatory effort gone horribly bad targeted at that eye-opener. I strongly urge you to pursue a more objective (and less ludicrous!) piece of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon Rising","review":"Babylon Rising: ...This book was alright. This wasn't fast paced or thrilling. It is a wannabe copy of the da vinci code, with lame codes. There were some good parts.

But, if your looking for books like the Da Vinci Code, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a refund?","review":"If the authors spent less time engaged in bible-thumping, in-your-face evangelism...... they might've had a mediocre story.

As a freelance writer and journalist myself, I recognize good quality writing, and I have been a fan of the Left Behind series. So I had high hopes when I eagerly pulled this book off the shelf.

Great job again, Tim LaHaye! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon Flop","review":"I bought this book because that author stressed in his introductory message what a great book he had written...thrilling, gripping etc. Well, it isn't. Most of the action scenarios were ridiculous.The plot was predictable but thesituations beyond belief. Even in fiction, can anyone fly into a desert and in less than 24 hours find a biblical artifact that has been hidden and buried for millenia in an abandoned ancient sewer, under a modern day city. And later the hero is able to wiggle through an air shaft in a pyramid, that initially was barely able to admit a small remote control drone. And when he reaches the inner sanctum of the pyramid, the bad guy \\"Talon\\" is waiting inside with his trained killer falcons. Fortunately, the hero was able to kill one of the attacking falcons with his bow and arrow!Bantam published this book but I bet they won't run the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible storyline","review":"I just couldn't \\"get into\\" this book. I've read the Left Behind series and love it, and had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't suspend my disbelieve high enough to get over the totally implausible storyline. A guy who tries to kill Murphy (repeatedly) to get his tantilizing finds? What's the point? And why would Murphy consistently do it?A secret organization trying to convince the world that \\"evangelical Christians\\" are bad? I just couldn't believe it. And Talon. Totally couldn't believe anything he did. Killing people left and right when there were likely cleaner and safer ways to do the same things. It was more Hollywood than anything resembling reality. At least Left Behind told a plausible story.I put the book down when I was about halfway through and gave up.I'll give it an extra star for good writing style, but the complete implausibility of the story line was a real turn off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this one behind....","review":"This book is insulting.

Sorry, but there is no other word for it -- TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon Rising Series","review":"I am quite surprise by the many negative reviews of this series. I just completed the fourth book and have found the series highly enjoyable. Reviewers discount the storyline as unplausable. Well, no kidding. This is a fiction series written for entertainment. Perhaps, those reviewers are the type of people who will criticize every little detail in an action movie. Get over it and enjoy the story. I find the series very entertaining, filled with action and adventure and sprinkled with accurate biblical doctrine. Sure, it's frustrating to see Dr. Murphy's archaeological \\"prizes\\" being snatched from his grasp time and time again but this is the direction the authors chose to go. I find no \\"filler\\" pages boring nor uninspired. I applaud the series and look forward to future installments. Bravo for a job well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story!","review":"I borrowed this book off of a friend of mine not knowing what to expect. I, personally, enjoy the Left Behind series more, because those books have more action and more character development than Babylon Rising. Still if you're a fan of the Left Behind series, pick up a copy of Babylon Rising. You will enjoy it, rest assured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"This book is a Christianity-influenced attempt to recreate an Indiana Jones style adventure. The book is written in an infantile fashion. The protagonist succeeds at everything in a very cheezy manner. The book finished with a sort of \\"stay tuned\\" message that forces you to dish out more money to finish the story. Over all this book is very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment at it's Highest","review":"Having read the Left Behind series, and having huge respect for Tim Lehaye, this book was just awful. I am halfway finished and can't motivate to even read any more. First 10-12 Chapters are confusing, too many characters, places, events, all appearing unrelated, (maybe a 1,000 more pages will pull it together). I feel as if I should take notes so I can try to figure out, now who is he? why did they say that? etc... Worst book I have ever read and hardest to comprehend. I like to read at night. 1-2 Chapters daily. With this book, you can't keep anything straight. It just sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half way through and regretting that I ever cracked the book","review":"Run away now, while you still have the chance. At very least, check this one out at the library, don't buy it.While the premise is intriguing, the plot, dialog and character development are very poor. Definitely far below the quality of the 'Left Behind' series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written in the style of The DaVinci Code","review":"Yes, if you liked the writing style of The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, you'll like this book. This is very much in the same style and pace, though of course completely different plot and viewpoint. I thought it was better and more plausible than Soon by Jerry Jenkins. Let's all hope that this will be a follow up series now that the Left Behind series is ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Maybe I expected more from this - after the cheesy writing style of the \\"Left Behind\\" series (I could barely get through the first book!) I guess maybe I thought his writing had improved. Nope. The dialogue was trite and ridiculous. The situations way beyond believability - way too pat the way things just happened to fall into the protagonist lap. Very implausible. I can't believe I actually finished the book - I kept thinking that it would get better. Oh well. Waste of my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind Fan","review":"I read the entire Left Behind Series and have even started it over while waiting for book #12. This book was/is a great disappointment, I've been reading it now for a couple of months an am only in the middle of the book. I wouldn't let this book keep readers that read this before reading the Left Behind Series stay away from the LBS. It's an awesome series. I agree with many of the other reviewers the book was just all over the place and I'm sure if I were to continue reading it would make sense but I'm not motivated to do so. I struggled for a couple of months on making the 20 purchase because I'm on a tight budget. I should have read the reviews first like I normally do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible bore.....","review":"This, unfortunately, has to be one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure reading. The plot was typical, the adventure was lacking, and the characters were wooden. This book also had the misfortune of being a sermon rather than a ficion book. It was extermely preachy and definately Christian oriented. I found it to be quite offensive towards those of different faiths as well as my own (as a Catholic). Mr. LaHaye should think about ALL readers rather than espouse his evangelical christian beliefs. The book should be better advertised for what it is - Christian propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close!","review":"This was so far below an adult reading level that it killed the book. I agree with the other reviewers. The characters were not very developed or particularly believable. It seemed a little like a far-fetched super-hero movie. The timing was always perfect, they always guessed exactly where to find each item. Like I said to my husband....Tim LaHaye needs to stick to what he's good at....the research. The Left Behind Series is so good.....and this just isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bayblon Rising just fell","review":"Aside from poor writing and shallow character development this series is at best and outline for possible developments. We are introduced to Will Bingman who goes with Murphy to find the handwriting on the wall and miraculously escapes an earthquake. It shook him up so much his name is changed to Bingham as he pops up out of the rubble!(page 311) On page 320 he needs to go home to his wife and kids and again on 322 we rejoice in his survival! Sadly though he is again Will Bingman and apparently dead only four pages later... come come Mr LaHaye, we Christians have enough ridicule without simpleton material like this.. I remain however your loving sister in Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT \\"Left Behind\\"....","review":"I am a big fan of Tim LaHaye, so it kills me to have to write this review of \\"Babylon Rising\\". The plot line is implausible, the characters are, at best, two-dimensional. So much is thrown at the reader with so little effort to make the characters likeable or even realistic. At first I expected \\"Indiana Jones meets the Book of Revelation\\", but it reads like an old B-grade Hollywood serial.My disappointment is palpable - I so looked forward to this book!I recommend everyone to read \\"Apocalypse Dawn\\" by Mel Odom instead.I won't be reading any sequels in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typo's","review":"I would recommend this book, it helps one to see the prophecy's of the bible. The only thing that I didn't like was all the typo's in the Kindle edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"LaHaye fan","review":"I was so disappointed when the Left Behind Series ended. I accidentally discovered the Babylon series. Mr. LaHaye has once more written a fast paced \\"can't put it down\\" prophetic novel. I hestitate to call it fiction, because it is based on Bible prophecy, much of which has come to past as predicted.If you don't want to read the Bible, but want to put a big toe into Biblical Christianity, I highly recommend reading this series.Also, a great way to share Christ with friends and family in a non-threatening way."},{"rating":"1","title":"horror and gore","review":"This book begins where the Left Behind Series ended....going downhill! A real disappointment.Much like our modern day television this book accents violence and murder. I think the authors wrote from the \\"wrong side\\" of the meaning of Christianity. This book leaves me with a bad taste and I would not recommend it to anyone.In the beginning the characters are so unrelated that it is a puzzle to even read and until your almost through the book, do you begin to connect them. Switching back and forth from one character to the other and into different eras is totaly distracting and disconnecting. Hopefully in the future the authors will use their knowledge to promote the Love of Christ and not focus on using evil as a tool to \\"make money and sell books\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAUGHABLE - Was this meant to be a comedy??","review":"I have not read the 'Left Behind' series and was looking forward to listening to a gripping book with a Christian flavour. Instead I found an incredably predictable, shallow story which was nothing more than a poor patchwork of other more notable adventure books/films. The characters were very shallow and not credible in any way. I was continually wincing at the portrayal of 'Mr and Mrs SuperChristian' whos only emotions were gooey lovey dovey or holier than thou anger. GET REAL!!The narration was ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. I found the strong, nasal American accent grating to say the least and the attempts at foreign accents were pitiful. There were great Pakistani and Australian accents - shame there weren't any Pakistani or Australian characters in the book (I think he was going for Scottish and South African). Soooooo disappointed, won't be reading or listening to any more of his books.How did this guy write a best seller??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous","review":"I found the plot line to be ridiculous. The plausibility of basic events was far beyond my capability to suspend disbelief and enjoy the fiction. The Christian message is weak, diluted by several violations of the ten commandments by the primary Christian character ( stealing ), and painfully contrived at the story's end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written Indiana Jones + Evangelism = Bad Buy","review":"And I thought The Davinci Code was poorly written!This story made way too many unbelievable jumps to be serious fiction. The authors repeated positioning of evangelical Christians as downtrodden heroes in the world completely tarnished the whole thing. For example, despite finding one of the most significant historical artifacts, the hero was happier about converting a single Muslim to Christianity.The author should stick to his day job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book was quite good. I was kept intrigued during the whole reading of this book. There was never a dull moment and the actions happening left you in a blur. The message gets a person thinking about themselves and their faith with god. Having a \\"man\\" go after something with as much determination as \\"murphy\\" did. He even through difficult time did what he believed was what god wanted to do. This is just an over all good book that teaches and hopefully challanges the reader. I dear you to be challanged by murphy and become closer to god."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and action packed","review":"A little disappointed in the books editor - numerous proofreading errors noted!Overall a fast reading action novel with bibical truths mixed in. I do plan to read all the books in this new series."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"I ordered this thinking I might like it but was so disappointed. The characters were two-dimensional, their actions predictable, and their heroism not convincing. I thought the plot and character names were cheesy. The violence described was enough to disturb me and there was nothing to redeem that. I have read good literature with a message that honors God and this book, in my uneducated opinion, does not fall into that category. Maybe some of his other books I would like better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Boredom... Zero Rapture Here","review":"I just had to put this drivel story down after 25%. I like a good story but reading this felt like reading someone's slanted religious propaganda. I wish the cover had a warning. Christianity is fine with me but I don't want to be hit over the head with it on each and every page.Wooden stereotypical characters and impossible plotting with poor writting and dialogue sinks this one for me. Of course the super-secret-organization-deadly-out-to-get-Christians is laughable comedy. Gggeeezzz. The Rev Jim Jones must have written this one. DON'T DRINK THE KOOL-AID.If I'm in a religious mood I'll read the Bible--the writing is much better and so are the stories. If you like bad simplistic fantasy Christian ficton this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BOTHER","review":"LET ME START BY SAYING, I LOVED THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES, AND RECOMMENDED THEM TO EVERYONE I KNOW, BUT THIS NEW BOOK IS JUST NOT UP TO STANDARD.

UNBELIEVABLE. IT LACKS THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT OF THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES, WHICH I COULDNT PUT DOWN. I WONT BE CONTINUEING ON WITH THIS SERIES..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, awful execution.","review":"It's obvious that LaHaye has a gift for thinking of creative plots, and this one could have been a winner.However, the best word that comes to mind to describe the actual character development, interaction, and adventures is \\"Cheesy.\\" It's almost like he's trying to take a \\"DaVinci code\\" approach yet having a 9th grader write it. It's really unfortunate that it falls so short from a literary perspective, because the story idea is a great one.I pretty much agree with the first reviewer's sentiments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fair Read","review":"Having read the Left Behind series, I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I can firmly say and believe that Jerry Jenkins was the real talent in that series. The writing in this book was fair. The book was predictable and not up to speed in the suspense department. I do not intend to buy the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointment Rising","review":"I've read the Left Behind series. In that series Lahaye provides the biblical backup to a good writer, it's a great series. When I saw a new title with him behind it, I was intrigued and interested in what he had to offer with this new series.I had my first reservations when the back cover of the book tells of how Lahaye is excited about this book, about how it's faster paced and all that jazz.Basically, this book Sucks. He tries to make it quick, gripping, exciting - any number of superlatives. At the heart is a truly dissappointing effort. He's created a biblical Indiana Jones, without the panache.I kept waiting for the good story to come out, but it never did. This is fast-reading, simple-reading, naval-lint fiction that left me wishing I had never cracked it, because I can't get those hours back!If you enjoyed Left Behind, leave this book behind and keep that good memory intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Frustrating","review":"I picked this novel up at Costco before I left the States for China. I was glad to have something in English to read, but this novel just wasn't for me. I enjoyed the Left Behind series, and thought that since this was the first book in another series, it would capture me. Not this one.The book has just plain bad writting. There are lapses in logic where things don't make sense. There are too many characters as well. The characters are predictable and hard to relate to.Sorry LaHaye, I expected a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Soon","review":"I've read Soon by Jerry Jenkins and now Babylon Rising. I've been a big Left Behind fan for years. Tim Lahaye made his characters really come alive compared to Jenkins \\"SOON\\". I love Biblical Archeology and this book was perfect for those such as myself. There were some typo's, but they cause little issues in the flow of the reading. Great adventure book and does show a real Biblical influence. I recommend this book to all, but definently to fellow Christians out there as a subsitute to King, Koontz, and etc....fiction writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I greatly enjoyed \\"Babylon Rising\\" and was surprised by the negative reviews posted here. I found BR to be a fun, well-written book (certainly better written than the \\"Left Behind\\" books) that kept me engrossed in the story until the very end.I highly recommend \\"Babylon Rising\\", and wish it wouldn't be a year until the next book comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Out, Not Left Behind","review":"I am an Evangelical Christian Believer and read all of the Left Behind series. Bablon Rising was quite a disappointment. The relic searches were too easy and too much time spent with the evil villans. This is just a teaser to read more in the series, with no idea of how many books will be coming to reach a conclusion.The editors were lax...on page 20 of the hard cover editon, it states, \\"Murphy kept a touch light on the accelerator...\\", which should read, \\"Murphy kept a light touch on the accelerator...\\"Also, on page 231, first paragraph, the biblical reference shows II Kings 18:23, should be II Kings 18:4.Tim LaHaye is a wonderful person and author, but he did not get the help he needed from the coauthor or his publisher.Before spending $26 on the next book about Ararat, I will check the Amazon.com reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a bad Scooby Doo episode","review":"The other reviews of this book have been completely accurate. I can't believe this \\"wow, they fell in a hole and found the treasure\\" story was even published.

What happened to character development?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon Ain't Rising Here","review":"What a disappointment. Now we know who did the research and who did the writing with Left Behind. Where are you Jerry!? Oh, yeah; writing \\"Soon\\". Come on Mr. Lahaye, if you're going to write a book for a Christian audience, you should treat us with the respect we deserve. The plot lines here are fantastic! The writing is atrocious. Example:A woman with a crushed wind-pipe swallows a pill. Our hero shoots a falcon out of the air with a bow and arrow. A woman stops murderous cult members by screaming a twenty-five hundred year old language at them (what!?), and my favorite, Nebuchadnezzar calls Daniel \\"Daniel\\", not Belteshazzar. Helloooo?Get some help, Tim. This has the potential to be a great series, but you need someone to take off the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost so bad it's good.","review":"Ok. I've removed my previous one star review after re-reading the book (my first \\"reading\\" was listening to the audiobook).I still think the story (involving an Illuminati-type group launching a conspiracy against evangelical Christians, and an assassin who murders people with falcons trained to attack and kill people) is ludicrous, the characters silly and the dialogue laughable. But I've got to admit that these... \\"qualities\\" actually make the book rather amusing, in a \\"so bad it's good\\" kind of way.It's common knowledge that Tim LaHaye doesn't do any actual writing on any of \\"his\\" novels, and this time he's found another hack co-writer in Greg Dinallo.Anybody looking for a good adventure novel should look elsewhere. But those looking for an example of brainless Christian fiction at its worst may find \\"Babylon Rising\\" amusing, although it does contain some rather slow sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The blurb promised a great story with much excitement which the inside pages failed to deliver. I am a great fan of biblical archaeology especially when combined with adventure, but this was a thinly disguised sermon. In fact, this was sermon after long sermon interspaced with little bits of fragmented plot which seemed designed more for the launching of yet another sermon and did little to promote the story. This could have been one phenominal novel had the plot and action flowed more smoothly, the characters been better developed and the sermons MUCH more subtly woven into the context of the story itself. Better luck with the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I should have followed my instincts and given up on this book after the first chapter.It really is not written very well, the plot is lame, and the characters extremely one dimensional.The book doesn't really finish. It is continued in the next book in the series (Yet to be written).I for sure will not be reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Left Behind!","review":"I was eager to start this book after reading the Left Behind series as I felt LaHaye and Jenkins wrote a good series, even if it was a litte drawn out. I was very disappointed in LaHaye's attempt however. The story line is juvenile, full of holes, and portions of the story are totally inconceivable (e.g. how does a woman who has just been strangled to death at the end of the chapter, later, stumble into a police station interrogation room an collapse in her husband arms?). I haven't even finished the book yet and I'm not sure I'll be able to. A friend of mine said he gave the benefit of the doubt and read the second book in the series and it was written just as poorly. Oh well, I'll have to move on and and search for a decent Christian writer. If anyone can recommend a better Christian series, please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christian Indiana Jones Adventure","review":"Having thought the Left Behind series was a little overdone and drug out too long with very archtypical characters, I was a bit hesitant to read Babylon Rising. However, I found myself quite surprised at how enjoyable the book was to read. The characterization seemed more real, and the plot did not get bogged down at all.This book, and hopefully a series of books, will provide good adventure with a mix of Bible teaching. No, they aren't going to be deep works of fiction, but still very enjoyable to read. To me, it was like Indiana Jones, but with a Christian twist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck with this table","review":"I purchased this table and like the others experienced problems with the insert. It was broken on the corner and sags under the weight of a normal router. In addition, the table is made from MDF and has leveling screws set in the MDF. One of mine is stripped and would not allow me to level the table. I would save my money and buy some other type of table. Freud makes many fine products, but this table is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fence, horrible plate","review":"As others here have said, the fence is great, but the plate is horrible, especially when considering the high-precision purpose of the fence. I've spent the last few hours trying to mount my router to the plate, but now have concluded that the plate must be replaced, if any precision work is to be done on it.As far as I know, this fence is the only game in town for precision adjustment, short of spending about LOT more for the Incra precision-adjustable model. And so for now, it's worth spending the extra time and money to make it work right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous at the current price...","review":"It is a decent table at or below list price but completely ridiculous at the current available price of $456.71I suppose if you are a collector..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away.","review":"The product needs help.

I broke one during assembly, it just cracked in half when I was lowering it into the table. I called freud and they sent me out another. This time the corner of the insert cracked as I was tightening it to the table. I contacted Freud again and spoke with Troy who said they were out of stock for three weeks.If you purchase this table you need to budget another 50 dollars for an aftermarket insert from another company (like rockler).I do not recommend this table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I would not recommend this table. The insert did not come predrilled for any router even the Freud 2 1/4hp which I bought as a package deal with the table. The isert is very soft and sags with the weight of the router, which cause material to catch on the outfeed. The fence does not have a means to attcah finger boards. The miter fence track was to big for any of my miter fences, to much slop to be effective. Because of the insert issue with larger bits there is to much vibration and cause chatter mark on the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dis a di Boss","review":"Dis a di boss nuff said, once again Mr Pablo has shown his talents, from there humble beginnings , up to his untimeley passing.

From the lack of students in undergraduate programs to incoherence of work being done in the discipline, the writers' discuss the problems which workers' in the field face daily. Looking at both the academic world and sociology's place in social science research, editor Stephen Cole provides a wide range of critiques of the direction in which sociology is headed (or lack thereof)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodnight Irene","review":"The Los Angeles Times called this book \\"Tense and Explosive.\\" My question is \\"when?\\" This was one of the worst books I have ever read.The only thing that was explosive about this book was the explosion in the beginning and the end. The story consisted of dining with Frank at his house, the beach, the bar, etc. We know that he liked pastrami and bud. On page 213 when the tension should be at its peak.

I picked it up for casual reading but it became a one-sitting read that had me up late because I just couldn't put it down. From the opening chapter of the book, the plot does not stop barreling ahead(although in a movie-ish bang 'em up and shoot 'em out kind of way). The ending also has the obligatory twist that I normally expect, but just didn't see coming in this book.

I can't believe anyone ever gave this a good review. It is so bad! First of all, \\"Irene Kelly\\" is a very pale, bland rip-off of Kay Scarpetta without half her intelligence or personality. Second of all, the plot is completely predictable, trite and stereotypical. There is not one shred of originality in the entire thing. Third, the writing, as other reviewers have pointed out, is so bad it is unbelieveable that this ever went through an editor and got published. I think this is just someone who has succeeded in stealing Patricia Cornwell's formula, but without one tenth of her talent. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavier than I thought","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. But I do not agree with the reviewers who say it does not require more than a highschool level in mathematics.I have an M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, so I can safely say I have a good knowlegde of mathematics, but still there were parts I didn't completely understand.Maybe we don't have to understand it all at once, maybe this level is needed to keep it interesting.

However, as is always the case in such books the book is more formidable than it intends or than it looks. Still it is very friendly especially compared with, say, \\"Numbers\\" by Ebbinghays et al. The coverage is wide: primes, reals, Cayley numbers, Eisenstein numbers, polygonal numbers, catalan numbers, Stirling numbers of both types and of course Bell numbers. There are the cardinals and ordinals of Cantor as well as Conway's own surreal numbers. (And an earlier reviewer was correct about misprints and color problems.) I recommend this to anyone whose mathematical maturity is at least as great as basic calculus (and who is interested)."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice, but wishing for a clean up","review":"This is an 'almost done' type of book. I like the way the subject is handled. The pictures and the thoughts that go with them are really good food for thought. Still, when I read the text, I get the feeling that this book was rushed to press. One more review by the author could have helped. I get this feeling because the text does not always follow the illustrations.

It does read like a lengthy postcard from your pal who's passing through each city; the words read well, but they're just not all true. A couple of examples: New Orleans' French Quarter was pretty much untouched by Katrina (the writers say the hurricane destroyed the Quarter), and Houston has an Astrodome and a Reliant Stadium, but there's not a single facility called the Reliant Astrodome. The photos are gorgeous, and there are places \\"off the beaten track\\" included.

The print is not only tiny, but faint. They tried to save ink by making the letters skinny, small, and grey (not even black).

Which there really isn't time for when you're trying to describe New York City on two small pages, half of which is plastered with a giant photo.And why 2 pages for each city? Some cities require more than 2 small pages. Why should, say, London or Moscow, get alloted the same 2 measily pages as some backwater town? Why? What's the reasoning? Just to have a rule and stick to it? Nonsense.Bottom line: Just a very ill-conceived book. Almost pointless. If you're going write a book about cities, DO IT RIGHT!

There isn't a top ten sights to visit or any mention of secrets of the city (to intrigue) or short interesting facts about the city or internet links to find further info. I can't help it I am a guy, I like facts and I like to be visualy stimulated.Instead of those 1 to 3 huge pictures they could have placed an array of pictures. Even with the 2 pages they assigned to every city they could have done a lot more .

Province intends the reader to read one passage per day and reflect on it, almost like a devotional. But the “one-minute messages�?are Province’s writings, not Patton’s.

His work with Dylan will live forever in the annals of folk/rock. Then his fabulous turns on the first two Paul Butterfield albums propeled him to legendary status. The Ford Brothers do an effective job of trying to recapture the sound of this giant. Robben Ford and Chris Cain are two of the best guitarists in contemporary blues. Do they sound like Bloomfield? Who could... The playing is tight and crisp, with a terrific horn section... Groovin'Is Easy takes you back to that joyous time when the first Electic Flag album was released ... I doubt if Paul Simon envisioned Bloomfield's take on 59th Street Bridge Song(Feelin Groovy). As with every disk that comes from the Blue Rock'It label there is an unbridled love and reverence for the artist which makes this a worthy followup to their Butterfield tribute disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I've had this in my car CD player since I got it two weeks ago.

The violent and raw sides of \\"Fire Of Love\\" are over and the readings of american musics history from \\"Miami\\" and \\"Las Vegas Story\\" are behind him, so now the leader of the Gun Club can be more focus on his own way of thinking the music. Here, the songs are intense, sad and beautiful. It could be the soundtrack of a Cormac McCarthy novel written by Chet Baker (why not?). Actually, it's may be just a great rock'n'roll album, a buried treasure that make us understand why Jeffrey Lee Pierce was a charcater for people like Henry Rollins, 16 Horsepower, Nick Cave, Paul Westerberg, Peter Case, Mark Lanegan, Steve Wynn, Chuck Prophet, or Flea and Kiedis from the Chili Peppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Unqualified Genius","review":"I first read this astonishing work in a class on \\"Unusual Narratives.\\" I was not excited (although I had loved Stephen's sonnet sequences) due to the sheer amount of primary source material Stephens includes in this work.

The music genre is best described as synthesized techno/dance. However the songs are all very uniquely blended with themes.

If ever, you feel down and out, read this or any of Og Mandino books. You'll never feel the same way again. Sadly, Mr. Mandino left this world far too early. More than any other author I've ever read; he had the unique gift of providing enlightenment and self-help through the use of parables that are second to none. It would be impossible not to read one of his books and end up feeling a whole lot better about your circumstances. This particular book clearly shows that we all have choices; we just have to choose the right path. Og Mandino was a one of a kind author, the likes of which we'll never see again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story","review":"I just loved this book from the start and couldn't put it down.

I read more than a hundred pages of a guy's life only to find out that he'd be into a fashion dilemma later: a red tie or a less garish one? This is supposedly a \\"religion and inspiration\\" book, right, so did Mr. Mandino really think we'd hold our breath, fearing that his main character would say, \\"Ah, f*** it! Son or no son, a red tie is just too ostentatious for the occasion\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"This book is a good story, with a great twist. Although I found it to be a little slow in the first few chapters and I was expecting a little more in the PMA category (like: The greatest Sales man..), I found myself not only in awe of the decision he made, I was also moved by the unquestionable loyalty of his wife and children. Though I doubt that I would have the courage to do the same. The twist in the last couple of chapters gave me quite a chill up my spine and caused me to re-evaluate some of my views on life. I can't say for sure that I believe this story, but I am awe struck at the thought behind the idea of its potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"OG'S GREATEST WORK!!","review":"I also believe that this book is not only Og's finest but one of the most touching and inspiring book ever written.The main character in the story comes to life right off the pages.The book's lessons will stay with you for a lifetime.Og Mandino will go down as the greatest inspirational writer of the 20th century.His books will live on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Catalyst for change","review":"This book served as the catalyst for me to examine my life and find out what I really want to do.

For electronics as T.V's and DVD players we cut holes in the back of our Cargo boxes and shelves to allow electrical access. This Coleman Cable 03518 Flat Plug 12-Foot Extension Cord with 3-Outlet Strip is ideal for plugging in the covered out lets where we just do not want to cut a hole through the shelf.

It is a concise abridgement of a much longer work and a fine, readable translation of the original 16th century Italian. More importantly, the substance is priceless. This is nothing less than a guided tour of the amazing events of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, from a clear-eyed, surprisingly objective reporter who knows whereof he speaks. Guicciardini was, among other things, Machiavelli's assistant and an adviser to popes. Writing from the vantage point of his personal observation of the events of his lifetime, he discusses: the Medici, the building of the dome of St. Peter's for the jubilee of 1500, the related sale of indulgences, the ensuing \\"Lutheran heresy,\\" the discovery of the new world, Henry VIII's divorce and the ensuing separation of the Church of England, and the arrival of syphillis in Europe, among other topics.

This should be mandatory reading for all managers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shaman Speaks","review":"If any written word can shake corporate America's middle management from its \\"do it the way it's always been done\\" stupor, \\"Winning the Talent Wars\\" is that word.Tulgan recognizes the intertwined realities of a new workforce psyche, the technology-driven acceleration of information flow and the intense competition for knowledge resources. Unlike other authors attempting to demystify this subject, Tulgan is not content with a colorful analysis of these forces. He offers a host of innovative \\"rubber meets the road\\" techniques that can be applied almost immediately with little or no cost. Tulgan's book is a recipe for change, but the ingredient list within may be too tough for some middle managers to stomach. If you want to be a new economy chef, internalize this book.

The photos in the book are fantastic, and he actually had the full cooperation of George, Ringo, Paul and Yoko when he was putting the book together. A must have for any Beatle fan and certainly and any musician who is into the guitars etc used by the fabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your copy NOW!","review":"The Christmas present I never got--so I bought my own copy. This book meticulously covers a topic not widely known by a lot of people, even fans of the Fab Four. It's about time someone wrote a book on the instruments and equipment the Beatles used to craft their wonderful songs. The book is a must for a Beatlemaniac's library, those interested in rock music, modern musical instruments, and the recording arts. However, I wish the author could have hired better, more thorough proofreaders, as this edition had a few incorrect spellings (e.g., look for \\"Geroge\\" Harrison). In addition, I , too, would like a section that lists the gear they used on each album or song. Despite all this, it's a great read, but it could use a few more tweaks. Maybe the revised (2002) edition will do the trick?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I have been waiting for!","review":"As a lifetime Beatles fan and a amateur musician I have always wished for a definitive study of their instruments and equipment. This book is more then I hoped for. As another reviewer has stated, coupled with Recording Sessions, you have one of the most thorough studies of any artists at their craft ever done. This book is not just for musicians or techies either. It is one of the more interesting and accurate accounts of Beatlemania next to their own anthology. A far more interesting read then most of the \\"quick for profit\\" pulp that has come along over the years after the Beatles have had one of their many resurgences in popularity with each new generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything you've ever wanted to know.","review":"even if you're not a player, the wealth of cool, inside information on the instruments used to make some of the greatest music of all time from the most important group of all time is reason enough to purchase this great book!if you are a Beatles fan, it is a MUST for your coffee table! if you have it out during the holidays, I guarantee all of your guests will be flipping through it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Been Waiting For This One","review":"Ever since I read a quote attributed to this book back in 1999 (then titled \\"Beatle Guitars and Other Fab Gear\\"), I've been patiently waiting.

I bought this book on a whim and I have loved it ever since!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting frames...","review":"Apart from other theological musings, Merton develops rather profound thought, namely that \\"Christianity is not the religion of a law but the religion of a person.\\" (page 181 of paperback edition).The philosophical consequences of such move are profound, since the whole focus shifts from the logic of intellectual pursuit of knowledge to the mystical endeavour towards Truth by love.Being an atheist, I do not quite understand how presented approach could be in any real sense satisfying to the human mind. However, Merton's analysis renders interesting feedback on assumptions, presuppostions and mechanics of the religius mind. I feel like the outcome of Merton's writing is much more than satisfaction of his artistic ambition. The author seems to be congruent about what has been written, which makes it even more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully compiled","review":"If you are a music lover and researcher like I am, you will enjoy this book. It is beautifully compiled with great art direction, photos, and well written text. It is well researched and the choices cover both the expected (Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", The Beatles \\"Revolver\\") to the unexpected (Johnny Mathis \\"Greatest Hits\\").Definitely recommended for both the serious and casual music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"This is what I needed so I wouldn't run out of battery when I was taping using my camcorder, Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not forth the Digital Rebel XT","review":"I'm not sure what camera this battery fits, but it's definately not the Digital Rebel XT."},{"rating":"1","title":"batteries don't hold charge","review":"Perhaps I received bad batteries, but they don't hold their charge.

Strangely, the front cover illustration has nothing to do with any of the characters in the story. Being is a fascinating book. The plot takes some spiritual turns that are certainly unexpected.It was written in 1988, but takes place in 1998. It is interesting to see how Redfinn saw the future now that it is the past. Cars have triangular headlights, there are no cell phones, and computers still have black screens with yellow text.Redfinn's prose is delightful, especially his use of similes. His vivid descriptions and fast pace plot make the novel worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Kerouac Sampler","review":"Though it has been a while since I have read this book, I found it distressing that there were no reviews of it in this area.I know very many of you love Kerouac's works and styles, so I hope that this book will be given it's due attention. Its contents are five short stories or sketches that move around the central theme of travel. A sketch about the \\"railroad earth\\" written in spontaneous style is quite riveting, and here you will have a chance to read what seems to be an early sketch of the fire tower section from \\"Dharma Bums\\".I hope these suggestions will have you picking up a copy of this wonderful book"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be on speed!","review":"Jack Kerouac wrote most of his stories on drugs and this story is no different.

My favorite chapters are the ones of him wandering Paris and the one about working on the railroad. The railroad chapter is so realistic, realistic because he is recounting his own life experiences throughout. You get the nitty gritty, day-to-day activity of what life was for a guy working on the railway back then: getting the last bit of sleep he can before it's time to hit it; boss who pretty much terrorizes him; screwing up big time (in which the tension is terrific). All the other chapters are winners, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely stuff from Mali","review":"Another lovely set of kora-based music from Mali. Keita, a junior member of the highly regarded Keita and Cikkokho families, has for several years been an integral part of the lush, high-tech world fusion explorations of the Baka Beyond ensemble. Here he eschews the lush mixes and ornate, pan-cultural approach of the Baka band, in favor of a softer, more traditional sound. His kora work is superlative, and these songs float out gently to meet their audience. This album isn't ground-breaking, but it does show that Keita knows his musical roots, and can make an album fine enough to please the back-to-basics crowd. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I only used this product once and gave it away. I was nauseous for hours. Make sure you have taken this before you order."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overview of Western to Northern European dress","review":"This book is filled with pictures. The problems I've found with it are (1) it does not seem consistant in its terms with other historical costume history books so it is difficult to compare with other sources. (2) The writer tends to make sweeping statements that are true only for England, such as saying that hose weren't knitted until the 16th century because knitting didn't reach England until than. (3) Other statements are very frustrating since the author will state that so and so was dressed in a Persian or Arabic style and then does not describe that style at all. On the good side the pictures are helpful and some of the statements agree with other souces."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Japanese language with English Subtitles","review":"Nowhere is it noted that this is the Japanese language version with English subtitles.

After finishing it, however, it seemed clear to me that Stein's first novel had only been re-released in order to capitalize on his subsequent novel's success. An OK story, fair characters, but ultimately a poor and disjointed ending made this an unfulfilling read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Like many people, I LOVED reading The Art of Dancing in the Rain, so I sought other books by Garth Stein.

I kept putting the book down thinking, how can the writing get any worse. I liked the idea of the Kushtaka, but other than that the characters are never developed and the writing is so poor, I am wondering if an editor even went through the book before it was published. It is nice to think that you can go from such a failure to such a wonderful book as \\"Racing\\" which I will keep to reread many times. The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is because the \\"idea\\" of the book was a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting!","review":"If you're looking at this book because you loved \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\", it might not be your cup-o-tea!

Possibly, the technical aspects of phising do not deserve a book, but this is hardly a reason to spread 10 pages worth of content on 400 pages. The book I wanted to read was one with more emphasis on possible defense tactics and with further information on the people who engage in these activities.Furthermore, This book is dated, 6 years in the web industry is a long time.

I think they're dissappearing because they are mismarketed. Pet stores don't stock them anymore.

I put them on my hand and 'flick' them with my finger across the room and she just flies after them. She just loves them. And after one get worn down, I let her chew it to pieces, which she also loves - she doesn't swallow any or choke or anything like that. She just lays by me in front of the TV and chews it into little pieces. Then I pull out a new ball and play fetch all over again.... It can hit my lamp or anything and they're so light that they don't cause any damage or even tip it over at all. Now I could never do that inside with a tennis ball. So these are for inside play and tennis balls are for outside play. Try them - they're great!!

On the one hand, it's filled with some very lovely photos of some quite interesting greeting cards. On the other hand, there is no attempt made to identify the artists or publishers of the various cards. So the book is really rather useless as a reference book of any sort. But the photos are very well done, the colors bright, and if you know what you're looking at it's an interesting view at the collection of someone who managed to get theirs published somehow (it was published in Japan.)But don't buy this book if you're thinking of using it as a reference, as there's no info there to which you can refer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"Amazon should be embarrassed to sell this.

There was no style, no flair, no charm to this book. The lack of characterization and the absurdity of famous family members constantly asking each other, \\"But how did you ever find me?\\" was like an insult to the reading audience.

She and I like similar books at times, and she didn't think I would like this one. I must say I haven't read the whole thing, but from the beginning it was apparent it is for a crowd that prefers their sex scenes a little more on the vulgar side, not to mention the McMahon family is a little too dysfunctional to be believable. If you like rags to riches or riches to rags stories involving the English, by all means try Saffron Skies, very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judith Krantz on a bad day","review":"I had such a high hopes for this one. It had a glamorous premise, not the usual women's fiction urban fat girl in a dead-end job, and it was a whopper of a book with a lovely picture of the author on the back.What a disapppointment. Judith Krantz and Jackie Collins wrote this same book better on a bad day.These characters are so flaccid and formulaic that no amount of bad behavior, gratuatous profanity, or designer clothing can revive them.The cliched bookcover should have tipped me off.I guess I'll go back to pedestrian old chick-lit.

This novel indicates there is much more (besides fantasizing)other countries have to learn about America. I was disappointed while trudging through the first 99 pages of this tome, and had not the fortitude to proceed. Since there remains many good American writers to read, I shan't waste any more time on this one. It seemed a meandering, youthful flight of fantasy - more like the consistently bad Joan Collins, than the good Jackie Collins, who's been stateside more than a few decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not deep - but good, easy beach read","review":"If you are looking for an deep character novel - look elsewhere.

A third-rate soap opera.","review":"Beginning with the fact that the book is based on a famous Hollywood family of dysfunctional actors and movie producers, just gives you an idea of the parallel universe out there, and even though we know fairly well about such parallel universes, it's just impossible to like and commiserate with such a spoiled, egocentric, self absorbed and immature character as Bagshawe's leading lady.I swear I wanted to scream while I was reading, I just couldn't take it anymore!!!!!!! And my God, these people suffer such tragedies are so utterly out of touch with their inner self that you just want to drop the story.I honestly thought of throwing the book away or just leaving it somewhere to be forgotten but as a rule I never leave anything (much less books) unfinished so I had to take it until the very end.

This book has taken me 2 weeks to finish. There really is no character development to speak of. The players go from hating each other, to rolling around naked on the floor in under a 1/3 of a page. The writing seems forced, there is no chemistry between the players, and the whenever the author seemed lost as how to proceed, she jumps several years into the future.

It was a good story but I was throughly unimpressed with the lack of suspense. They billed it as a thriller but should have billed it as an out-of-body love story. They duped people into wasting their time. It was predictable and kind of stupid at times. Miraculous that she was shot and was able to make it to the hospital, that the guy who shot her was such a bad shot for a career criminal, when she shot him he automatically died and the guy who nearly dies forgives the girl who tried to kill him? If the police could have the dam shut off why didn't they do it to start with. I could go on and on. It is like horror movies when they go outside. I was continually scratching my head as to why they would do that. If you haven't seen this movie don't unless you want to see a crappy unrealistic love story.

Ok, so maybe the M-16 just fired 50 rounds without ever changing the magazine, or maybe someone was working in a job in a completely unrealistic manner. No big deal. It's just a movie.But this mess had nothing to keep me interested, or even remotely entertained. I felt like I had been sucked into a world of stereotypical teenage angst hyped beyond all reason. Honestly, I should have known to beware when the box called him \\" a great writer with a future as bright as he is.\\"Between the intrusive music, implausible storyline (I'm not talking about the ghost thingee, either), and acting so bad I have to wonder if they were doing so on purpose, I found watching it to be unbearable.

Bullet wounds jump from one side of the body to the other, a gunshot victim runs a marathon race against police and seemingly gets better with each chase scene, nurses in a hospital look up and ignore a bleeding girl who is being slapped by a distraught mother in an intensive care unit the list goes on. After a while, it gets ridiculously funny. Is this supposed to be a comedy? The final straw came when the wounded girl crawls onto the dying boy's hospital bed, which of course no one sees or prevents from happening. Remind me never to go to that hospital! The careful craft of a supernatural thriller, like The Sixth Sense, is nowhere to be found in this flawed endeavor.

If everybody in the movie died I wouldn't have cared, however on the other hand if everybody lived I wouldn't have cared either. Maybe with better script, actors that could compel you to feel something for them, this movie would have been better. Do yourself a favor and don't get this movie, don't even rent it.

There was no rating on Rotten Tomatos, and the previews gave it a \\"6th Sense\\" feel - a half-dead boy trying to unravel the mystery of his murder (or attempted murder).But that is not at all the case. There is no mystery. The movie tells you, from the start, who tries to kill him & why. Therefore, there is really no compelling reason to keep watching. You know who does, you know why, and you know that in the end he'll wake up from his coma.If you're into Ghost Whisperer, Touched by an Angel, and those types of shows, you might like this. It is a very teenage show, and very very low budget.I give it 2 stars for a nice idea, but I barely was able to finish it & would not watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has a potential plot but it fails because of poor execution","review":"It has a potential plot but it fails because of poor execution.The idea of a man's soul/ghost trying to tell any living person where his body was is interesting. In the movie, he was not completely dead yet. He's just half dead or unconcious. The problem is I don't feel sympathetic or related to any character at all.

Your illustrator is very good. I enjoyed his work. Somehow, I got the impression that Remus becomes the leader of the village. Am I correct. If so, that is not what Joplin was about. He was about female leadership. That is why she asked the question to the crowd three times in three different ways. That is also why the opera was not picked up by the publishers. Woman sufferage was a sore topic at that time, and would not have created a reason for another million dollar block buster for them. Joplin was way ahead of his time in that aspect.

There's not a lot of science in it or action, but it was anything but boring for me. The whole story is about ecological disaster brought about by humans colonizing an 'uncivilized' planet. The narrative stays fresh by using a writer that is constantly interviewing people that lived on the planet Peponi as a main character. In some chapters the writer is speaking, in others humans that used to live on the planet, in others natives that have lived through the colonization.I'll definitely checking out more of Mr. Resnick's books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and far from the author's potential","review":"Sorry. While I love the cover, this book is very similar to the author's Kirinyaga, the contents of which I did not like very much. I found Paradise boring, dull, and generally unsurprising. There is essentially no science in this fiction... it could just as well be classified under general fiction (and if it were I doubt it would be particularly well reviewed). The writing is pedestrian. The story lines are also. The parallels to the recent history of Kenya are so thin as to be almost transparent. It's almost as though the author has taken issues and episodes from Kenya and converted various words ands phrases to another place and time, and left it at that. I was, sadly, disappointed by Kirinyaga, and I am even more disappointed by Paradise. I feel this author has MUCH more to say than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez!

However, this was not an easy book to get through. Clary makes reference to so many friends and relatives that after a while it becomes difficult to keep any of them straight.

Nearly 600 pages of explicit, no-holds-bar sexual escapades have just about anything to cater to any taste, and the reader certainly won't put the book down unsatisfied. The eroticism is graphically descriptive, and the limitlessness of the imagination can offer images that no video can. More than same-sex physical contact, though, some of the shorts describe the reassurance of a simple human touch, especially if any human touch has been a long time coming. The sex is non-stop and certainly erotic, but the subtle descriptions of man-to-man emotional contact lifts most stories above the level of carnal lust. \\"Bus Stop\\" and \\"Big and Beautiful\\" are two especially worthy entries.

It is done well.Richard Gere is terrific in this film. HE IS Clifford Irving! Never does the viewer feel that perhaps he is lamenting his dishonesty. Instead, his character demonstrates how, after a while, we become exactly what we dissimulate being.

Faking Howard Hughes's autobiography is just one of his scams.- It is neither funny nor interesting.- Before watching this film, I knew nothing about this story. What annoyed me the most was I knew the scam would fail because Howard Hughes was still alive when Clifford was trying to pull it off. Of course, Howard would try to expose Clifford' lie.

I can't put my finger on it, but there was something missing in this film.

As far as the real story of Clifford Irving's shenanigans, it's hard to believe someone would go to such lengths to become famous and it's even harder to believe that he duped an entire industry. In the end though, while the subject matter made for some interesting history, the movie failed to fully flush out the characters and the reason for their indiscretions both publicly and privately."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a tangled web we weave.....","review":"Clifford Irving fools some of the biggest names in the publishing world, when he convinces them that the reclusive Howard Hughes has authorized him to write Hughes' biography. Determined to make a name for himself, Irving (played by Richard Gere) stays just one step ahead of discovery by a creating a tangled web of lies and deceit. Irving states that since Hughes is so eccentric, the more bizarre his lies, the more likely that others will believe him. His sidekick and \\"researcher\\" is ably played by Alfred Molina who himself becomes a victim of Irving's charade. As the movie progresses, Irving becomes obsessed with his deception and almost appears to believe it himself. This is a very interesting rendering of a pivotal point in history which implicates a president, as well as an author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag","review":"I have had this exact bag for over 4 years and have never had an issue.

I never forgot (Sir) Anthony Hopkins as the young Pierre, kind, considerate and rather bumbling. You can see the aspects of his performance that has made him an international treasure. The series is long - 14 1/2 hours, I think, but it takes that long to unwrap the story of Russian Society and the effects of Napoleon's invasion. For the time, the battle scenes are impressive, considering they had to use all LIVE extras (no CG then!), and the sets are sumptuous and the characters well-played. This was a typical program of the times, video-taped on set, and filmed in 16mm outdoors. In the set sequences, there seem to be the constant sound of heating and/or air conditioning, necessary because of the high light levels required for video then. Non-the-less, it's a compelling series, and the only negative aspect: there are no subtitles to help old ears along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made War and Peace accessible","review":"This was a wonderful series that I shall watch again and again. First rate casting, simply loved it. This made War and Peace completely accessible. I shall now attempt to read the book (with confidence--I did get the abridged version, which cut out all the French (thank you, all the French was irritating in Anna Karenina) and uses only one form of the Russian name throughout for a given character. Yes, I'm talking about Princess Alexandra Kropotkin's abridged version of the book.) The masterpiece theater series is priceless, the one to get. You will not regret it. Tolstoy is undoubtedly the greatest novelist that has ever lived. Pierre (played by Sir Anthony Hopkins) seems most likely to have been Tolstoy's alter ego War and Peace, so one gets a view into the author's own life and mindset as an added bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great portrait of humanity.","review":"This version of War and Peace is undoubtedly the best. Although Audrey Hepburn and Henry Fonda are great in the mid 50's version, the stars in this miniseries are excellent. I have seen the one made in the 50's, the Russian version, and this one, and this one is by far superior to the others.It is very long, but is very faithful to the book. It includes all the characters' thoughts and philosophies, and includes the many human relationships intertwined in the film.It is true, however, that it lacks music and scenery, although the inside shots of the houses are splendid. But this is very well, because it makes it much more realistic. The acting is superb, the sets are real and lovely, and I would highly recommend this epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"War and Peace, 1972, BBC","review":"This was a painstakingly accurate portrayal of a wonderful, meaningful novel. The brilliant actors were true to their characters and as dedicated to this film as I could have imagined. If you love the book, which it would be hard to believe if you didn't, you will appreciate the work done here. Thanks to the BBC and all involved in this dedication to such an important piece of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"War and Peace","review":"Saw this on PBS when it was new and have wanted to see it again ever since, but was a little disappointed. It seemed less great than I remembered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"How anyone can say that this is the equal of, or even better than, the 1950s Russian version beats me. Take the battle scenes -- Sergei Bondarchuk's Russian version used tens of thousands of troops from the Soviet army; the BBC version uses about six extras chasing each other over the South Downs. If you want to see a version of War and Peace that makes the book out to be an English drawing novel by someone like John Galsworthy (the televised version of whose \\"Forsythe Saga\\" preceded this by a couple of years) you might as well buy this. On the other hand if you want to see one of the greatest film adaptations ever made go for Sergei Bondarchuk's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low budget and old-fashioned acting.","review":"I watched this mini-series when it first aired on American TV in the 70's and thought it was wonderful. But I have to admit, by today's standards, it's hopelessly old-fashioned and hokey. The acting isn't terrible, it just belongs to a different era, when everyone was larger than life. All the speeches, and the gestures and mannerisms are so over-the-top. (Does Hopkins really have to drop or knock something over in every scene for us to know he's shy and clumsey?)The women are either giggling idiots or sobbing constantly.But the battle scenes are the worst, consisting entirely of men marching in uniform across fields, then someone fires a cannon or rifle, and a couple fall down. That's it. Really.If you strip all the philosophical musings and dialogue out of the novel (which they had to do to keep this at a reasonable length) all that's really left is a soap opera about rich people trying to decide who to marry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's that I hear?","review":"This version of War & Peace was looking good, but the sound was so bad that I had to return the tape.

This production has a so so cast, Natasha especially bad ...the others are rather bland , tho Dolby suits the bill...and lacks any of the Mosfilm\`s strengths.

It wasn't. W & P is tedious in the extreme and continuously put me to sleep. Unlike the powerful dramatic narrative that seized my attention in Claudius and pulled me relentlessly through to the end, W & P seems pointless - a prolonged upperclass Russian soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackout Squad is Off the Hook","review":"I first heard gotti when a 3-6 mafia cd had a sample of \\"reppin north memphis\\" on the LIFE cd.

She treats you as she would a good friend by telling both the good parts and the not-so-good parts of a real life; the highs and the lows, the wonderful and the embarrassing. The difficulty of trying to deal with her emotions regarding her different relationships with her mother and father is a constant theme that runs throughout her life, and clearly has an impact on how she also relates to friends and neighbors. One especially delightful aspect of the book for anyone who attended parochial school on the East coast during the mid-twentieth century is her recitation of daily events; you feel as though she was sitting next to you in class! After finishing the book, I felt that the author had truly welcomed me into her home and life and made me part of it. A very enjoyable read, and an impetus to reflect on my own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the \\"Bus People\\"","review":"We just returned from 18 days of independent travel in Alaska. We had three travel guides: Fodor's, Lonely Planet, and The Milepost. Fodor's is the most generic of the three. If you're on a cruise and you only intend to see what everyone else sees, this book is probably ok; otherwise, opt for Lonely Planet and the Milepost. The bulky section on Vancouver and Victoria is a waste. I love British Columbia, but I already have several BC guides and didn't need it with the AK guide. This may seem petty, but the paper quality of this guide is the worst (too pulpy), and it doesn't stand up to too much abuse - it's not good for backpacks.

The idea, according to Brent, was \\"to do something that's slightly better than...

I'm not sure if the fault lies in the delivery (pretty corny) or the material itself (pure Broadway SCHLOCK at its worst!).

Somewhat larger than I expected for the sizing, but it has drawstrings to adjust it somewhat and it means it will work over another layer and allows more circulation. Both of these came in handy for me right off the bat, as I'm surveying upland vegetation and birds, hiking from shaded canyons filled with fog and moving water up to exposed chapparel on ridges, several hundred feet higher in elevation. It's great to have something which can adapt and keep me dry and warm as well as remaining breathable and allow free movement when moving through many conditions. The many, many pockets are handy for storing anything from the size of a pin or fish hook up to a field guide in the front or even a rolled up jacket in the back.Now all I need is a waterproof and breathable shirt and I'll be prepared for whatever nature throws at me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great as a photography vest","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend to use as a photography vest.

I thought this movie focused way too much on the 2 stupid guys chasing them, and the maudlin of the 3 friends just talking amonst themselves about the death of a fellow friend.There were funny parts, and there were very bad formulatic jokes. and the overall drug part was dumb. I hate it when they bring drugs into a movie as something funny, I hate drugs. they are the abomination of this world. and just seeing htem onscreen makes me angry and ruins the movie from there on.the funniest parts of the whole movie was ina deleted scene which they cut, it was the parking space part, where this crazy guy just acts crazy to Seth green. it was hilarious.This movie had the actors to be really great but most of the movies plot was really stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comedy!","review":"Love this movie, it cracks me up.

On their journey they encounter many obstacles, including a bear, two pot-farmers, tree-hugging hippies and many other hilarities.

But for me the most fascinating character was Generoso Pope, the original publisher of the Enquirer. He had Mafia connections and was also a former CIA agent. A character right out of a movie. The chapters on him were worth the price of the book, at least to me. Mr. Sloan was a writer and editor for some of the tabs, and he knows the inside story. He's also a very good writer.And yes, the book does tell you how they come up with those crazy headlines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Providing insider's insights into the strange business","review":"We all let our eyes at least wander to tabloid newspaper headlines in the supermarket; but ever wonder who's behind them? Finally: here's an expose of the personalities who built the tabloids, with interviews by Bill Sloan providing insider's insights into the strange business. From roots of the tabs in soft-core smut to their current focus on celebrity sensationalism, pop culture is presented at its best - and most outrageous - in a zany story. I Watched A Wild Hog Eat My Baby: A Colorful History Of Tabloids And Their Cultural Impact is especially commended to the attention of students in Journalism, American Popular Culture, and anyone who has ever plucked one up while in a supermarket checkout counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"dinner time!","review":"So much more convenient - and polite - than shouting to the family that dinner is ready.

He has befriended a young neighbor girl who has cerebral palsy. When his old buddy X-ray comes up with a quick way to make a buck, Armpit never imagines it will lead to a brief romance with teen music idol Kaira DeLeon, and that he will become a hero for saving her life.This is another wonderful book from Sachar, combining humor and pathos in his inimitable way. The book offers a terrific positive portrayal of a disabled character, combined with a positive African-American male character who struggles to stay out of trouble. I found all the major characters in the story, including the teen rock star, to be believable and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Step in the wrong direction","review":"I was disappointed in Louis Sachar's sequel to Holes.

It deals heavily with issues such as racism, crime, and, to some extent, drugs and sex.The characters are also different. You won't even find Stanley or Zero's name in the book. It's all about Armpit and X-Ray. Armpit is trying to rebuild his life by working for a landscape architect, and X-Ray convinces him to take part in a get rich quick scheme, the results of which pretty much screw up Armpit's life.Just because you liked Holes doesn't mean you'll like Small Steps.

The two of them are attending a high school in the slums of Houston. When X-Ray tries to convince Armpit to join him in a get-rich-quick scheme Armpit is reluctant. Once X-Ray suggests ticket scalping, Armpit finally gives in and gets into a real mess. It just so happens that the tickets are fake and Armpit is caught by the police.

There are quite a few other individual errors of this type. In most cases the erroneous word is an actual word (maybe a spell checker was used), just not the correct word.Hopefully Amazon will fix the book and issue an updated version soon.

But not long after getting them, one of them started leaking water around the valve area on the lid. We figured it had something to do with the way our 6 year old was using it because our other sons bottle was doing really well. Then as I was sitting down getting ready to order myself one, we noticed the other one leaking the same way. We can't figure out why they would start doing this because they basically just sit out on the table or counter or sit in the car, no rough treatment. I was really excited to from such high reviews and was willing to forgive one cup as a fluke but not two. Sadly, I will be taking my business elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bottle","review":"I enjoy the size and shape of this bottle, and it's held up well to my clumsiness. The loop on the lid is very handy for a quick drink while still remaining active. The lid and straw do take on flavors pretty strongly. After washing the bottle with soap, it took about 5 soaks to get the soapy bitterness out of the plastic. After finding this out, I've altered to cleaning with apple cider vinegar, and have had no problems. I recommend this bottle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold.","review":"I loved the bottle up until one morning I went to go fill it and I saw mold in the bite valve. I cleaned it up thinking it must have been a fluke and maybe the temperature of our place mixed funny with some water, I know know, I tried to make up every excuse because really I love the water bottle.Well, today I think I've had a enough. I clean it every morning, only put water in it, and I'm not one to eat and drink. I feel like I'm doing everything correct, but I found some mold again today (after washing it this morning and drinking with it all morning. Can someone please help me here?

It's fun to drink from the bite valve, but you really gotta suck on it. Luckily, you can interchange other Camelbak caps. It's definitely spill-proof. Love the carry handle. A bit hard to clean the bite valve, but I take a q-tip and that works. Very happy with this bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it should","review":"Works very well, and is pretty durable. The best bottle i have ever had. Only complaint is that after a year of everyday use, it started to leak a little because of being over tightened.

I hand wash it, but i suppose it would be fine in the top rack of a dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Water Bottle Ever.","review":"I am not a water drinker. Most days I went 24 hours without having any water. Well I bought this water bottle at Target a week ago and I fill it up at least 5 times a day. I LOVE this water bottle. It's great, I take it everywhere with me. It does not leak, I love the bite valve part and it does not taste like plastic at all (another great part). I have already purchased another bottle because I just feel like this will stick with me for awhile and I might as well have two. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS WATER BOTTLE.

I heard a lot of good things about them prior to purchasing one and the big selling point for me was that they are BPA free."},{"rating":"2","title":"You really drink more.","review":"It doesn't seem like something as simple as a bottle/bite valve design would dramatically increase your water intake. But it works. Whether you're using it for working out, hiking or just at your desk, you'll find yourself constantly sipping huge amounts of H2O.I used to use a Sigg bottle. But the huge benefit this one has is that you don't have to unscrew and replace the cap every time you take a sip. So you end up sipping more frequently. Thus drinking more.The straw is wide and the bite valve flows freely, so that helps a lot too.It never leaks. It has zero taste. And because it's clear, you can see how much you're drinking.Awesome product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the quality?","review":"I'm jealous of all these great reviews here. Mine broke within the first month without anything drastic happening to it. One of the nubs that lets the bite valve rotate snapped. Until then it was a great water bottle, but really I expected more for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh","review":"So precious and it makes drinking water fun! I almost lost it today and was really depressed but I found it! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love them while the lid holds up!","review":"My family has several of these, and they're great right out of the package. The problem is, the lids don't seem to hold up too well, and you can't buy just a new lid. E.g., the backstop valve in the center has come off of one (so it spills through that hole), and on another, the drinking valve feels there's something stuck in it (so you need to be a professional horn player to actually get any liquid out of it). On other ones - and this is pretty common - the 'hinge' of the drinking valve has gotten loose, which, again, leads to leaking.So, at this point, I have about 7 bottles, and only 2-3 working lids. If you could buy new replacement lids, this would be 5-stars, easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bottle","review":"this is a great bottle i love it. the only problem is the lid does not stand up to a drop. we have had two of the little thumb tabs break off with one week of use, and when the bottle fell off the roof of my van the whole bite valve assemble broke off its pivots. obviously this is not normal ware and tare but i think if the thumb tab was made out of the same material as the bottle this would not have happened"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottle as long as you regularly clean mouthpiece.","review":"My wife and I have both been using these for a couple years now. They come in a variety of sizes, are extremely sturdy, and are BPA free.The bite valve folds down when not in use.Just make sure you're cleaning the valve about once a week or you will find a pretty nice chunk of mildew in there. We discovered this by accident because we didn't detect the taste of it in the water at all. When we finally took them apart to clean them, big chunks fell out. Since we both keep ice in them at all times or keep them in the refrigerator, we were surpised.Great bottle; just make sure to take it apart and clean it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sweats and is hard to drink water out of","review":"The sturdy construction is great but it sweats when you have ice in it and it is really hard to drink water out of it compared to our other water bottles that have really large open straws, so the main problem is that the bite valve needs to be much larger to be able to get more water out easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't use it with sunscreen or bug spray.","review":"This water bottle is great. It in unique with the mouth piece and straw, but it can't be used with sunscreen or bug spray on your hands. I just bought my wife a brand new one and after our first hik,e we put it in the dishwasher. She had used both OFF bug spray and Banana Boat sunscreen, and the bottle came out of the dishwasher with a cloudy film all over it. I called the warranty department and they told me that it is the only thing they have found that destroys the finish. The lady recommended that I not apply sunscreen or bug spray when using their product, or if I must to throughly wash my hands after applying. The warranty does not cover this type of incident. I don't know about you, but I usually use a camelbak for hiking outside where there are bugs and plenty of sun. Needless to say good idea for a product, but not the quality of a nalagene bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice bottle but leaks...","review":"This bottle is a great size, color...looks good, but unless you keep that weird nipple thing on, it will squirt up the straw and leak on you! It also feels kind of weird sucking on the straw...like a baby bottle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water pools at the top","review":"I've owned this bottle for about 6 months. Initially, I thought it was great since it leaked no more than the occasional drop. But recently, I've noticed that water pools at the top when sitting and gets everywhere when I go to reach for it. Also, I left the bottle in the cupholder of my car and when I returned found a large puddle below the bottle. I think that it is so airtight that the air inside the bottle expands when warming and the water is forced up the straw. Very annoying since I like to drink cold water that will eventually heat to room temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't purchase again","review":"There are a couple reasons I would not buy this again. First off, having a flip top design means there are lots of crevices for dirt/dust to gather. It's nearly impossible to clean it properly because of that. Second, the tip cracked open making it impossible to suck up any liquid through it because the opening was so big. The bottle itself is pretty durable, that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. Otherwise, this just isn't a good design and I'd urge you to go with a klean kanteen, much better design and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"moosejaw logo turnoff","review":"I purchased this water bottle as a birthday gift for my nephew.

In the past few months I've had trouble staying hydrated and I knew if I had this again it wouldn't be a problem and I was right! The bite is easy to use and fun, so I end up just casually drinking a bottle with no effort, when normally I NEVER drink water. I love this size because it'll fit in my backpack but still hold a lot of water, and the bite is just phenomenal. My older water bottle leaked if I put it in my bag, but this one hasn't yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first","review":"Does what it is supposed to do obviously. The top leaks though after a month or two. Also the bite thingy comes off and you can see all the dirt and grime that gets in there. It is pretty hard to clean. I am just going to stick with the traditional screw off top. I wont buy again or recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too big for my car's cupholder","review":"Love the capacity vs my 500 ml Camelbak bottle, but that smaller one is tapered at the base, so it fits in my cupholder, and this one is not. Minor issue because the security of the bite valve means I can lay it down on the passenger seat. The info with the bottle says studies show that people drink more with the bite valve and I believe it -- I got this .75 litre because I seem to drain the .5 litre in just a few drinks! However, the .5 litre is a bit more convenient to tote around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle!","review":"I got my fiance one of these from a retail store and the pivoting mouthpiece part broke after about 6 months of heavy use. She really liked the bottles and it helps her to drink more water during the day. She loves the color green, so having the green one available at a really great price lower than retail was a no-brainer. Amazon prime shipping got it here the next day for next to nothing. No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle","review":"I don't know why, but having a bottle that you don't have to tip upwards to drink out of it really encourages you to drink more water. At one liter, this thing holds enough water to sustain a person throughout the day, but not too much, which makes for a big and bulky bottle. The little carry handle is nice too. It's great for attaching to carabiners while backpacking. It's an all around good water bottle. We have around five or six of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"I love this water bottle! I use it all of the time! Only 1 problem, it leaks if you turn it upside down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best reusable water bottle I've tried!","review":"This is a fantastic water bottle! It doesn't have any of that plastic-y smell that I cannot stand, and you drink from it right-side-up because of the straw. Even, better the straw comes apart for easy cleaning. The \\"Hydrate or Die\\" is hilarious (but true!), and makes this water bottle look \\"cool\\" so even my 12yr old has one and uses it every day. The only con here, which another reviewer already noted, is that it does not fit a standard cup holder. I was hoping to use this while riding my bike but it does not fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bottle","review":"I really like the straw, so much better than tilting my head back to drink.

I never felt like I could get it clean, especially up into the straw. And after a while, in the mouthpiece part, it got all moldy. Granted, maybe that was my bad, just didn't use it enough. But I tried to clean it out, totally impossible. Once it's gone, it's gone. Which is gross because even if you don't have mold growing in there, who knows how nasty it can get if you can fully clean it. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design leaks no matter what.","review":"I ordered several of these and have the same problems with each one. The top somehow creates a vacuum and draws up water and actually bubbles up out of the bottle and floods my car's cup holder quite frequently. This happens no matter if the valve on top is left in an open or closed position. Very annoying and messy!! The bottles also leak whenever not kept strictly upright, and the plastic mechanism on top that open and closes can have one of the hinges broken pretty easily, which means the bottle leaks all over you every time you take a drink. I love the concept, but it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"great...for a while","review":"I have had a couple of these bottles and I've used them for a few years. The CamelBak concept works very well, but the problem comes after repeated use. Mildew builds up in the bite valve and in the plastic mechanism that holds the valve. It is very hard to clean because the mildew grows in areas that are too small to fit a brush or q-tip into. Soaking it in bleach doesn't work either. After a while the bottle becomes just plain unsavory. I've had to throw mine out and start over with a differently designed water bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome - Keep the nipple!","review":"Well i used my .75 during my travels to europe and it was my best friendused it all the time and not having to tip the bottle back to get to the water was awesome.so unlike some reviewers that felt that the nipple wasn't useful i felt the complete opposite.Anways i did lose mine during my overnight stay at an airport (THANK U VOLCANIC ASH CLOUD) and i'm buying a replacement!i do have a naglene and this one was way more functional - fits in cup holders etc.awesome product! buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy & Hydrated.","review":"Very happy with my purchase.

It was great a first, you could even store it upside down and it would not drip. Now if my bag gets slightly tilted it will end up soaked. Bummer! I never put it in the dishwasher or misused it in anyway, not sure why it is leaking.It was a great bottle in design - love the bite valve - although my jaw was sore the first day when I was getting used to it!Also FYI that the 1-Liter bottle will not fit in any cup holder which makes it a hassle - especially at the gym or in the car-the bottom of the bottle is very wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Dime!","review":"So, I've been needing to drink more water and this did it for me! It is incredibly nice looking, it is comfortable to hold onto and it works. I was worried that the straw wouldn't reach the bottom of the container, but you can pretty much get every drop of water out of it by just using the straw. In class, I no longer have to tip a bottle back and risk spilling stuff on my desk. It's all about the straw and this bottle's got it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and convenient water bottle! Worth the money.","review":"I had made a goal to drink more water, and the office I work in has a water cooler, but I was concerned about using plastic cups to drink out of, and having them spill all over my desk. I bought this water bottle because I thought that it would help me drink more water, and that it would also be more convenient because of the straw.It has been! The straw is great, it doesn't leak at all when it tips. It has notches on the side so you can know how much water you put in, and how much you have had so far. The rubbery top to the straw has a nice feel to it. I was concerned it would be a strange texture, but it isn't at all. All in all, I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"This bottle serves it purpose!","review":"I love this bottle. The main reason I bought this bottle was that it holds 1 liter of water at a time. Three refills gets me to where I should be in my daily water consumption. I drink better out of a bottle rather than a glass. I bought 2 so that I can continue drinking, just in case I get lazy to get up and refill my current bottle. Now I have a back-up!!! I would have given this a 5-star, but I do not like the bite valve. I don't like biting the valve inorder to drink the water. Since I was able to remove the valve and the straw is still functional, this a good back-up feature! Love that it is dishwasher safe. Another downfall is that it doesn't fit my cup holder in my car, but since I'm able to lay it down on the car seat without water spilling all over my car seat, since the valve retracts into the screw top. Easy to carry when walking since it has a large handle on the top. Ok, so overall a great buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome water bottle.","review":"i wanted a water bottle that i could take with me everywhere. this water bottle allows me to do that and doesn't spill a drop. the only downfall is that it only fits into one of the cup holders in my car, so it is not as easily accessible when i am driving. otherwise i have not had any issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Regrets","review":"This isn't a cheap flimsy plastic bottle so I don't regret buying this. I did have to get used to the bite valve because it's larger than an average straw. The best thing I like about this type of bottle is that when I drive, I am not losing sight of the road ahead or beside me. The other thing I like is that I've dropped it and it doesn't leak. Better than a \\"sport cap\\" because I don't have to twist it open. Just bite and sip!After reading the reviews in regards to cleaning the bottle, I bought the cleaning kit. The kit is well worth it if you are willing to spend the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camelbak Better Bottle is a good alternative to the regular, screw-top lexan-type water bottles","review":"Easy to drink from, convenient to transport since the bit-valve is retractable and seals closed.

I did a lot of research and although this may cost a few bucks more than others, it is really solid. It is very sturdy, and comes in many colors (I chose blue). The only doubt I had before purchase was how the \\"sipping\\" mechanism was going to work. I read another review which said that it can be removed without damaging it (or the bottle), and this is correct- I removed it and put it back on as a test. It might seems weird to think about biting and sucking on it to drink your water, and I assumed before I received the bottle that I would just take it off. But I was dead wrong, it is really great to use, and also guaranties that you never spill any liquid.

Used it every day and filled it a few times a day with filtered water. Recently I started developing problems with discomfort while biting down on the bite valve. Upon looking closer at my front upper teeth I discovered that I now have a front tooth gap that I did not have before. My bite is also different. Using this bottle every day is the only thing different that I have done. When looking at smile photos 3 years ago, this gap was not present. Then looking at a photo from 6 months ago it was very evident with the tooth gap although it did not give me discomfort so I did not notice it. I have since stopped using the bottle and feel that my only solution to this will be to go to an orthodontist to get this repaired.

And after about a month of use, one hinge of the mouth piece broke causing an awkward flipping of the mouth piece. Not very sanitary as you're constantly touching the mouth piece to flip it on/off.If you're looking for a BPA-free water bottle that is ergonomically designed, consider the KOR water bottles. That's what I switched to and am super happy with it.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"Great product. Excellent quality and easy to use.

I keep this in my car because i wanted a small container of water. the kids size is too small (perfect for bed side table though). the 1.0L is too big (perfect for home use though) so this was just right for me. I no longer have to worry about spilling water on my clothes or fumbling for a cap.

They are easy to carry, I use carbineers and the built in hook to attach it to my gear (backpack or vest, ect) I've never tasted anything funny, or had anything grow in my bottles, when ONLY water was left in the bottle. I have left water in bottle for at least 3 weeks and when I opened it and smelt it, it smelt like water, and I tasted it and it was fine. Though I have made the same mistake with other drinks... I don't know what I left in one of my bottle for an unknown length of time, but it smelt like death, and no matter what I did to it I cannot get the smell out of it, but they don't cost that much, so I just threw it away.

I've used it for a couple of weeks now, and while the bottle is lightweight, BPA free, has a great little handle for carrying around, and doesn't leak, I can't get past the straw. I drink 3 liters of water a day, and by noon my jaw is so sore from the effort to bite and drink, it's just not worth it. It may just be me. I don't chew gum either because my jaw can't take the effort. So if you don't have that problem, then this bottle is for you. If you are like me, though, and you have a sensitive jaw joint, then I'd look for a different solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bottle","review":"I ordered this bottle because it's BPA-Free. I'm a teacher and student and use it every day at both schools. It's been dropped a few times and banged around but never broke. It's great. My one concern is the sipping part. I'm afraid I'm shifting my teeth by sucking on the straw part."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad mouth piece","review":"I am a huge fan of camelback water bottles. They are a great size and are pleasant to drink out of. I lost the camelback that I had, so I bought another one online.The bottle that I received, however, worked horribly. Something is wrong with the mouthpiece; I can barely get any water out. To drink, I have to unscrew the lid and drink out of it like a giant cup.I'm guessing this was just a fluke. I don't think this distributor intentionally sent me a bad bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard","review":"I owned two of these bottles. The first one fell 16 inches off a bench and the lever that moves the bite valve broke clean off. It also contantly leaked around the seals when full of water and tilted on its side. Every time I'd throw in a backpack or gym bag my gear would come out wet. The second one leaks the same way the first one does. Probably the safest way to use it is sitting undisturbed on a desk or table. Face it, there's cheaper and more effective cups and glasses on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome water bottle","review":"Not much to say, other than its a great product.

You can easily drink with one hand, which is another plus. I've had my first one for about 2 years and it's held up well, even through some drops.

Have gone through 3 of these (under impression first 2 were defective). The bottles are not defective, just defectively designed and marketed.

After trying 3 different kind of other bottles, they failed miserably. Stainless steel gets rusty, some other plastic are cheap and/or not BPA free: This one is the ONE everybody is looking for.I was looking for 1.5 liter but 1 liter is already great for the quality of the product. The plastic quality is very good. You don't hurt or damage your teeth and/or gums while drinking, so it's all good for me. Drinking water with a bottle can be pretty damaging with time but this bottle is the real SMART one. I have enough water for 8 hours and I don't feel like drinking rust. BPA free is a must have though, if you think about buying a similar, cheaper bottle. The price seems right though. It's already worth it after 12 fill ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now my husband wants one! :)","review":"We recently moved to the desert southwest and immediately, my body began calling for more water (naturally!). I wanted to keep track of how much I drank, so grabbing this 1L Camelbak was the best thing I could do.I love the bite-valve (no spilling or dribbling - even my Nathan bottle dribbled!) and it's easy to keep track of how much water I've consumed in a day.My husband has asked for one for Christmas because he sees me using mine daily! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the office","review":"I use this water bottle at the office to avoid going to the water cooler all day as I keep getting thirsty. It keeps water fresh and the plastic used is BPA free. Not that I got this bottle originally for that reason but I guess it's good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"I jokingly refer to my Camelbak as my \\"sippy cup.\\" Even though it can leak if placed in the wrong position, it certainly isn't a big hassle. I tried a stainless steel water bottle and quickly returned to my Camelbak with its wonderful sippy seal. As some reviewers have commented, the ease of drinking provided by the straw encourages you to drink enough water each day. I does need to be cleaned regularly. My husband uses bleach to clean his. I have another method of cleaning mine. Soak it in hot soapy dish water and take a longed handle sponge and clean out the inside of the bottle itself and rinse in hot water. I also use a stir stick for drinks with a piece of paper towel wrapped around it to clean out the inside of the straw. Since BPA is very toxic, I also like that the new bottles are BPA free. Do yourself a favor and get a Camelbak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best water bottle out there!","review":"I have to say if anyone can have an addiction to a water bottle, this is the one that will cause it! I love all the camelbak bottles so much and the 0.75L size is my favorite. It is large enough to hold enough water for at least half of the day but not obnoxiously large. I love that you can drink from it through the built in straw without having to tip a water bottle over your mouth and risk spilling water everywhere (which I have done on many occasions) I especially love them for working out and I can actually drink out of it while jogging on a treadmill without spilling everywhere. You can throw these in a bag without worrying that they will spill as well. I also LOVE the purple color! This bottle is high quality and worth the money because it will last a long time. I also think it makes me drink more water because I always carry it with me and it is so efficient and convenient to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottle, but not easy to replace lid","review":"I've had my bottle for a little over 6 months but found that the nozzle which pulls down with the thumb tab is broken.

They need something clear so they can see how much water they have left and something they can't easily spill. These aspects of the bottle are great. Unfortunately, out of the 3, we have a broken bite valve (understandable with kids), a broken tab that's used to flip up the bite valve, and a broken hinge for flipping up the bite valve. If they sold replacement tops and at a reasonable price, it wouldn't be so bad, but I haven't located anything other than bite valves & straws. Maybe I'll check out Nalgene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy bottle that leaks all the time.","review":"I bought this bottle so that I wouldn't have to buy those disposable plastic bottles of water.

Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo leaky","review":"I was hoping to get a water bottle that I could throw in my bag and not have it soak all of my things.

I would not recommend this water bottle unless you exist in a waterproof world where things can get soaked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, but molds quick and leaks sometimes!","review":"I love this bottle, it is great for everything! Unfortunately after using drink mixes it began to mold inside the bite valve, on the underside of the cap (removed the straw and the rubber valve to find more also), and even on the inside of the straw at times.It comes out with washing, but of course thats pretty difficult with the straw. After a few months of use it began to just leak out of the bite valve for some reason and after I would wake up and take a drink it would spill all over! I use the water bottle for everything - its great to fill up for night time drinks too! Just be careful and wash it out often. If I didn't drink from it quickly or there was some left over in the bottom it would began to mold after a day or two.

Also no need to flip the top to take a quick drink. Just bite down and sip. No messes during your workout. These are very durable and with the handy tab at the top easy to carry several even if filled. I have since purchased enough for us to have 5 each-10 total. I did have one damaged one and amazon had it replaced to me before they even received the damaged product. No after taste at all. Better than Britta in my opinion.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"In an effort to be more environmentally friendly we switched to these instead of store bought bottled waters.

Ever since, I only seem to experience disappointments with these bottles. Maybe they could have been great if they first could hold the water in. The only way; keep them straight. Not easy in a backpack or in a car!Then it was for the straw to go; everyone in my family stopped using them. I guess we all graduated from sippy cups a long time ago.But the worse of all is the mold. After using them a few times, the rubber tops get really moldy inside; and when drinking sports drinks, the mold seems to grow instantly. So, we replaced those. Then (if you use them), the straws also end up getting moldy inside. And now it's the air valves that are all moldy. And cleaning these assures your bottle to always leak.

Therefore, I was so thrilled when it arrived before Christmas 2009. But today, incidently, just 11 days after I no longer can return it, it leaks all over the place. The little plastic valve inside the cap doesn't work and just let's water flow out of the bottle when it's upside down or sideways! I was surprised to find my bags wet and refused to believe it could be the bottle. Only when I tipped the bottle upside down did I see it leaking like crazy!! What a waste.

I am used to sit long hours in front of the computer and dont drink water for hours together. But now with this bottle, I finish up all the water within one work sitting vs previously there was no intake of water at all. So my water intake has significantly improved.

I bought the first one for college, but it got stolen. It is a great bottle for students because it doesn't spill and you can clip it to your backpack. Plus you can walk down the halls and easily drink since you don't have to turn the bottle upside. I liked always having a bottle of water during lectures. After the bottle was stolen I was lazy and just picked up an Eddie Bauer water bottle from Target. It's terrible and I regret waiting so long to order another CamelBak. I now have a blue .5L bottle for the gym and a pink .5L bottle for work. The size is perfect because it fits in my car cupholder and I like cold water so by the time I get through .5L of water, I'm ready to refill it with fresh, cold water anyways.

Camelbac sent me a free lid but then a month later it broke again. It also doesn't fit in car holders. It is very difficult to keep clean and if you have a clear bite value others can see the build up of scum in the bottle, yuck! There is just too many pieces to have things go wrong with. The bite value if you are not very carefully when cleanly can tear. Also don't leave this water bottle in your car. If you do you will have water spilled in your car. As the water or liquid heats up in the straw it forces its way out through the bite valve and will leave you a mess. It is also is prone to leaking as we found out when we bought the smaller version for our 2 year old. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks. A lot.","review":"I wonder if anyone at Camelbak ever thought to fill this bottle with water and turn it upside down to see what would happen. Water gushes out of it, that's what happens.

Curious to know if others experienced this problem, I went to Amazon. Not only did others talk about leakage/spillage, they also alerted me to a mold problem. I immediately got up, went to the kitchen and held the drinking valve up to the light. Well.. LO AND BEHOLD. With a small spoon I scooped out a black, murky substance from the plastic tip that you DRINK from. Can anyone spell yuck? The leaking was a terrible problem; however, finding this murky substance in the drinking spout (how on earth did I not see it before???) was enough to cause me to take these bottles (I have two) out to the dumpster.

But today I found mold over the inside of the straw!!! I was trying to get rid of it, but since the straw is so narrow, I could not do a thorough job. I always wash the bottle, the straw, etc. every night and leave them dry. Has anybody had the same experience? I still like the bottle very much since it is the ideal size and I found it easy to drink. But, I also don't like the idea that I am drinking water through the straw full of mold..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle, but size matters","review":"This is a great water bottle. I do have one issue with it in that it is too tall. I have a faucet mounted water filter and I have to tilt this bottle to fill it under the faucet, which means I can't really fill it all the way. The bottle is just a tad too tall. It's top-rack dishwasher safe, but again, it's a little tall and will only fit in my top-rack if I place it just right. I like the way the bottle works though and have ordered the 0.75 L and 0.50 L versions for use in other situations where I don't need a full 1.0 L. Great bottle, but size matters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moldy, Leaky Straw","review":"I loved the bottle when I first purchased it. I loved the fact that I could throw the bottle in my purse and not have to worry about it leaking. But after a couple months of use, I noticed that bottle began to leak if it was not upright. I also noticed that mold began to grow inside the straw. Due to the design of the straw piece, it is near impossible to ensure that the inside of the straw is actually clean and free of bacteria each time you attempt to wash it. I will be replacing my two Bite Valve CamelBak bottles for the old fashion screw cap bottle. I do wish that there was some kind of protective cap we could put on the mouthpiece. There were several instances where my bottle fell over into the grass/dirt, leaving the straw useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is he kidding?","review":"The slogan on the bottle is \\"Hydrate or Die\\".

I drink water all day and have several water bottles. I thought this looked like a good addition to my collection, but it didn't work too well.The bottle is durable, fits well in cup holders, and looks nice. My complaint is that mine leaks from the cap where it screws on. Every time I'd have this bottle in my gym bag, my items would get wet. Thank goodness I only had water in it.I find drinking out of the bottle to be a bit awkward. The blue bite valve on the cap is somewhat similar to a baby bottle nipple only with a larger opening (this is what felt awkward to me and I could barely get water out of it).The bottle works, but just make certain to keep it upright and not lean it on its side or your items might get wet like mine. Hopefully my bottle was just defective and they are not all that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"passed my leakproof test.","review":"this bottle passed the leak-proof test in my lunchbox.Dead On Tools DO-300 Killer Chiller Mobile Cooler/Lunch box, BlackI bought other water bottles that ended up leaking, but these bottles definitely don't leak. I bought about 10 of these bottles in different sizes and colors since. My personal favorite is the gray colored one liter with the bite valve. the main reason the bottle has a bite valve is so the bottle doesn't leak when turned sideways. also, the little doodad at the top is a handle that you wrap your pointer finger around.

Because as soon as I was turned sideways it would start leaking water onto everything else. Cameras, phones, coats, gloves, your backpack, your back. So I ditched it.Also, If I left the water in the straw it had a funny taste after an hour or so. My friend didn't think so, so maybe I'm more sensitive to it than other but it's something to think about.My advice?

One of my biggest expenses was buying drinks on campus. So, after lugging around a SmartWater bottle for a week or so and finding it not working out I looked to Amazon to find a water bottle to suit my needs. I settled on the CamelBak and I've been very happy so far. It's dishwasher safe, which was a big plus for me, and I really like the spill proof, bite valve design. I have the Black 1 Liter bottle and I find it to last a decent amount of time when it's filled all the way. I haven't had any drops yet, but I'm sure when that happens the bottle will hold up. It feels very study and well made and I especially like the loop for grabbing it; it's the perfect size and allows for a quick pick up when in a hurry. Overall, if you're looking for a well made, day to day water bottle, you can't go wrong with this bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT LEAKS!

I have two purses now that are soaked. I don't know what the deal is. It started leaking right after I had wiped off some buildup of lip-goop and who-knows-what, so apparently maybe my own gross sloughed off cells were plugging whatever hole is the culprit? Anyway, apparently it has excellent reviews from most, but just be aware that it could leak, and leak a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nay...","review":"It's difficult to clean the bite valve, and therefore you should think of getting it replaced rather than cleaning it.

I emailed the company about this on the first bottle that did this and they kindly sent me a replacement lid, but it leaks too. These bottles are not cheap and to have bought four of them only to have every one of them to leak is a big ol' kick in the backside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chewable 'Straw'!","review":"Great water bottle, this is my second one I'm purchasing. It's easy to use and the straw is chewable so you don't have weird bite marks on it. Although over time the rubber straw tip needs to be removed and the bottle washed, grime seems to collect under the rubber. But it doesn't get in your water, so I suppose it's okay to leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Water Bottle Ever, (but its still just a bottle)","review":"There is something about this particular water bottle that makes me drink MORE water. My kids love it too. I carry this water bottle everywhere I go.Just realize that it is still just another water bottle! There isnt a single water bottle in the world that will be \\"leak proof.\\" Reading some other reviews its amazing the high expectations people have for things. One thing about the bottle is pressure builds up in the straw and can leak out of the plastic bite valve and evenually the cap gets loose and can leak water as well. Because of how much I use this water bottle and how much my toddlers walk around with it and drop it all the time I have to buy a new one every 4 or 5 months. Which is fine with me because I can switch colors each time too.Its a fantastic water bottle and does what its supposed to do. Totally worth giving it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these bottles","review":"I love these bottles. I love that you don't have to open a lid and inevidently pour water on yourself (especially if you're trying to drink while exercising). You can also get them in so many colors and many times you can find them with university logos. They also come in several sizes, too.

Not a drop of water lost!-7/26-11 update-Changed my original glowing review from 5 stars to 2 stars.after about 2 weeks of taking this water-bottle everywhere, the hinges broke for the bite valve. I expected a bottle made by camelbak to be more rugged than this, but alas, it broke after 2 weeks of everyday use. I have emailed their warranty department twice and have heard nothing back from them. It still holds water, and the valve still works, (which is good and the reason for the 2 stars) but it no longer clamps down as it should.

AMAZING! i took all the way to israel and back and still works great! LOVE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bottle","review":"The Bottle is amazing and the bite valve is cool and it works. Even if you have the valve open and flip the bottle there is not one drop. It is a great bottle and I Would recommend it to everyone. the only cons: it does not fit in the car cup holder and sweats a little more than regular bottles. However I would not recommend getting the CamelBack insulator because I had a water bottle with a insulator that works pretty well, i just need it to remove the sweat. Even if the water in you bottle is cool with no ice it will sweat in about 5min at room temperature, so you need a paper towel or something on the outside to keep the places where you put the bottle down, not because of leaking but because of sweating. But overall good product you feel much better in the day when you are hydrated, I recommend this bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the idea... but leaks too much :/","review":"I love the idea of this bottle! After losing a laptop due to spilling water all over the keyboard, I thought I was saved with this Camelbak because there is no \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\"... so my computer would be safe from accidents.Unfortunately, this bottle is NOT leak proof, especially if you don't keep it upright. My purse, thankfully, is water-proof, but there's always a little puddle at the bottom when I put my camelbak in it. I've ruined quite a few notebook,s books, etc due to the spillage...I just wish that camelbak had created a straw feature that closed more securely. It's hard nowadays to find a 0.5L bottle that doesnt leak, especially one that doesn't need to be opened/closed (great for working out), but the spillage is quite a turn-off.Also, beware of taking this on the plane! The change in pressure will make water gush out of the straw once you bite into it.All in all, think about investing in another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, for a short amount of time.","review":"I love these bottles. This was my second purchase because I fell on top of the first bottle and it started leaking, I assumed that it was my fault.

It's starts spewing water out for no apparent reason...almost as if it had some backed-up pressure.This is also happens when I take sip. It just starts coming out.Not sure what's going on with that. I can't leave it anywhere because I fear it will spew on unwanted surfaces or myself.On top of that...the valve gets gunk build-up all the time.

It floats in the pool and is easy for her to take a quick sip from in between laps. It is very easy to clean.The bite valve reminds me of my grandfather's coin purse. When you squeeze the sides the slit in the top opens up and you can drink from the straw. I have found that if the bottle is left full of water and laying down in my gym bag, it will sometimes leak. I believe the small amount of water is coming from the bite valve. I have tried biting the valve to allow the water to drain back into the bottle and this seems to solve the leakage issue.I recommend it for kids and adults alike and for most sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating account of little-known part of Elizabeth's life","review":"Robin Maxwell is an excellent writer who brings her flawless research and sense of pacing to the high drama that was Tudor England.

It just spews energy and makes you want to sing out loud or just go and kill something.The best song on the album is the most underated song on the album, Dream another Dream.Another note is 316, which was turned into one of the best live guitar solos ever.If you want to hear solid hard rock with great vocals and better guitar, F.U.@.K is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"This CD is quite simply fantastic.

Eddie trying to write the perfect radio friendly song with Sammy Hagar adding another collection of goofy machissimo lyrics. The effort opens up with \\"Poundcake\\", a basically riffless song with Hagar supplying an ample amount of junior-high lockeroom lingo lyrics. The albums high point commercially was \\"Right Now\\" complete with a very un-Van Halen-like contemporary smooth jazz piano offered up by Ed much to the delight of soft-rockers everywhere. The video makes the song seem much better than it really is, and that in itself is very un-Van Halen-like. Overall the songs rank as poor as any in the post Lee Roth era where melancholy rules the day. Commercially a high point for the band as they make new fans in the early 1990s, but artistically a low point as per usual with anything Sammy Hagar touches.

Hagar = Heinous!","review":"As if the stupid acronym title isn't bad enough, this CD has Sammy Hagar on it and we all know that Van Halen was done for after Roth left. They should have quit right there and not gone through the shame of awful vocals brought to them by Hagar the imposter. Any CDs without Roth are awful because of the vocalists, and if you want to experience the unobstructed raw power of Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing then you need to purchase any of the Roth albums except for Diver Down. I most recommend \\"1984\\", \\"Van Halen (self-titled)\\", and \\"Women & Children First\\". Then comes \\"Fair Warning\\" and \\"Van halen 2\\". But those are the albums to look for, the classics. All other Van Halen albums are soiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Abortion!","review":"This is not just one of the worst Van Halen Albums, this is one of the worst Albums ever.

There are a few good songs to be found on this album...but my least favorite VH album for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if compared w/ other Van Hagar albums","review":"I can't believe how many people are giving this album rave reviews! Although Hagar's lyrics are more mature than Roth's, they are also much more bland. Eddie seems to have turned in to more of a rythm guitarist here as his crazy guitar solos and tapping segments are absent here. I can't even understand what Hagar is saying in Poundcake. Maybee this is a good album next to other Van Hagar music, but compared to the origonal Van Halen, and other relatively good rock and roll groups of the time, this album seems very plain. On the other hand, if you like Van Hagar, go for it. It's one of their better albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Van Halen, Van Hagar","review":"Wrong. It's like expecting cold Pizza in the fridge and finding old vegetables instead. If you like Van Halen skip this one, if you like Van Hagar buy it. For some reason most bands seem better when the members hate each other. I don't know why, I do know that Van Hagar was cashing a check that was drawn on previous achievements and Eddie V's guitar skills, he's still great, Sammy couldn't drive a golf ball 55 yards if he had a V2 rocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"The thrid time is the charm for Van Hagar","review":"I'm not much of a fan of Van Hagar. But I was turned onto this album during my college years in '92. And while Van Hagar's first albums (\\"5150\\" and \\"OU812\\") were a complete departure from Van Halen's six albums at least the band returned to its roots with a nice album that rocks just right in the right places.It's not the best album but it's still a solid listen. Gone is the over-reliance on synthesizers that marred the aforementioned albums. Aside from the piano during \\"Right Now\\" the keyboard is still used but far less on this album.Now there can never be a replacement for Van Halen. Despite that this album is a solid listen. It doesn't take many risks as if the band was unsure of itself. All the tracks are of high quality but the solos aren't as daring. It's still contains quality riffage which is the main reason to listen to albums like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagar the Horrible","review":"It was the best of times,it was the worst of times.

Unlike the traditional paper map you find in most books about the war, in Frey's book you can literally run your finger across the terrain and feel the high rise of Round Top and the low ground around the angle where Picketts' Charge took place. This 3-D map helps you to understand why Lee chose to attack that topographically shallow point of Cemetary Ridge. This book is invaluable.

I was floored to find that these books were being marketed to the Nancy Drew reader. Many naive parents who purchase this series would be quite surprised at their content. Do you really want your child to be reading how Nancy Drew \\"sexily smiled\\" at a stranger? Parents who fondly remember days snuggled up under the cover with a good Nancy Drew book will randomly pick up this series expecting the same good mystery and wholesome read.

It seems impossible for a \\"soft\\" keyboard to be this good, but it makes you feel more confident and quick. I miss it when I'm at work. The down side is that all the fancy buttons and sliders are not very versatile--they were obviously meant to work with one Microsoft product and you really can't change them a lot. For example, I'd like the \\"my documents\\" button to link to the folder on my network drive, but so far I can't figure out how to make it do anything other than its pre-programmed function. It is oriented toward Microsoft Office.

(I paid Amazon.com $27.99 total for the last one I bought in late 2008 -- a near $20.00 difference!) But, being able to feel the keys on the board is FAR more important to me -- and this keyboard is the best I've seen when it comes to that.

However, if you plan to use it for ANY applications where you need to press three keys at once, and none of those three are ALT, CTRL or the Windows key (i.e. in a game environment you may need to press \\"W\\" to move forward, \\"E\\" to turn right and \\"space\\" to jump all at the same time) then this keyboard will NOT work. It will only recognize two key presses at the same time within the standard keys. According to the Microsoft website solution center, there is no workaround for this because \\"this is not a valid key press situation.\\"The irony is, Microsoft Games publishes a ton of games in which this is a \\"valid key press situation.\\" Too bad you can't play even those games using this product, made by the same company.Although I love the look and feel of this product, I will be returning it.

The first several stories gave hints of his previous ability to craft quirky sharp-edged characters and satisfying plot twists. Sadly, the overall quality of these stories were poor. The writing was self-consciously intellectual and insularly English. I was unable to continue to finish the last story, a 100 page plodding effort that refused to show any signs of life. Would recommend Barcelona Plates highly and leave this tome in the remainder bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must try","review":"I bought this item a few weeks ago, and finally found a great place to use it.

Everyone should see this movie at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore","review":"Although not as racey as the novel, and now over two decades old, \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" remains one of my all time favorites. This movie leaves all that watch it thinking and talking and shaking their heads in yummy disbelief. (I dare not give away, too much. Okay, I'll give you a litte..) This is mostly bacause of the leading lady, Noel Page, who is a tragic, lovable, beautiful, powerful, victim turned ice-woman. Equally, the other minor characters are well developed with their own interesting interal and external lives. The movie is a bit slow in the beginning but once you get into it, you're with it for the long haul. This is great movie to watch with friends who've never seen it because it is so provocative, complex, clever and unpredicatble. What a plot Sydney Sheldon wove! This one is old but not cold by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME RETRO MOVIE","review":"If you are a reader of Sydney Sheldon - then you will appreciate this adaptation!

Perhaps 160min was not enough to dramatize the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reel Masterpiece!","review":"Love the movie and love the book!I can't believe that this movie is over 30 years old.It would be ashame for this movie to be a remark, some hard up studio spend untold millions to produce another version of \\"TOSOM\\" and the end would be an inferior piece of work! Also, if they tried to make this type of movie today, it would be considered soft porn. So, Hollywood, please don't try it!

And I am looking for a tearjerker - you know something that expresses the range of emotions involved with a wedding: from exuberantly happy to some strange sad moods. Anyway, this movie did absolutely *nothing* for me. Completely predictable, bad editing and writing and strange visual shots. Some of the actresses are cute (and some are better than others) but there was no character development. I hardly ever feel that a movie is a waste of my time. Why did I finish it? Because I kept hoping it would get better and it never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This was a good movie, but not the best of its kind.

However, in most such efforts, there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones. We found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters. Even the bride (who is supposed to carry the film) seemed fake and unlikeable. We watched about 20 minutes of this DVD and ditched it in favor of something else. For a much better \\"quirky family\\" movie, wait for \\"The Family Stone\\" to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss Mah Butt!","review":"No, I'm not a kid, but this movie was so bad that I actually wanted to throw it in our driveway and run it over about 60 times, or at least until it was nothing but granules of sand.

It lacks the fire of the artist and the genre.

It is easy to say he is no John Lennon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake that I did","review":"This is an all acoustic (no vocals at all) version of some of Neil's songs and is dreadful. I am a through-and-through Neil Young fan (from Hawks and Doves to Everybody Knows this is Nowhere to Trans) and I have loved everything that he has ever done -- but this is not him -- Not even close. I can't believe that the folks that put this out believe it is any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to Neil","review":"Why do some artists beleive that they can cover a tune? All involved in this one should be embarassed. Did the producer just pull some musicians off the street and give them some Neil music to play? Neil's music is more than words and tunes. It's harmony, soul, and a lot of feeling. By far the worst thing I've ever heard that had Neil Young's name attached to it. Pull it from the shelves and save anyone else in the future from being tortured!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"This CD is a conglomeration of studio artists playing a myriad of instruments which have been over-dubbed to the point of nausiation. The songs don't come close to resembling the originals as done by Neil Young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real characters, real insight","review":"I read few short stories anymore, mostly because they all run together in a blur of sameness, with an abrupt ending that is supposed to be mysterious and deep but instead feels obtuse and pointless. But Antonya Nelson's work is different. Her stories suck you in -- things happen. There's also the sheer beauty of the writing and her insight into human behavior -- women, in particular -- which is subtle but powerful, sort of like coming around a corner and smacking into an old friend. You instantly recognize the foibles and habits of her characters, who are real without being boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"They definitely aren't the next Cannibal Corpse","review":"I was very disappointed with this album like all other Mortician releases. All you can hear from the singer are grunts. He really has no vocal ability at all.

It never gets pretentious and always keeps me wondering what is hiding behind the next page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I just finished Quicksilver Moon. I had several other things I had planned to do this day, however none of them got done....but that's OK. I couldn't put the book down. As an aspiring writer, at first I was noticing format, character study, all the things I've been reading about in writer's magazines. I'm not sure where I left off being an editor and moved into being fully involved, but suddenly I felt like I was part of the story. When Quicksilver Moon was under siege and all the messages started coming in, I was in tears. I couldn't read through them for a couple of minutes. They were tears of Love....a feeling of real community. I also learned a lot from the book. Barbara Ardinger paints a picture of bigotry which is frightening in its truth, and love and friendship and trust, which we could all use more of.

But, at my request two other people have looked at what I was sent and each said they could not read it due to the extremely small print.With prior Amazon orders I might not have liked the publication in part.

This book is no different. What the authors are doing here is obvious: Because life is adaptive and evolves purposefully, these guys are trying to construct this reality onto a foundation of accidents. It's a truly laughable premise that is so funny it almost hurts. This book is almost worthless. If this book were a political persuasion it would vote \\"moderate.\\" And it's absolutely a joke that any book written on evolution would leave out a detailed discussion of subjects such as epigenetics, horizontal gene transfer, and environmentally-induced gene expression. The last of which touched on in this book, but only fleatingly. This book is good for one thing: taking neo-darwinism one step closer to the trashcan where it belongs. This is one last attempt to save a dying theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a popular-level book...","review":"The topic and the contents of this book are very interesting, but it is rather heavy reading.

While the book doesn't go into great detail about any of the dogs, it does provide you with the basics of each breed, and so this could be a useful resource if you are starting to look at dogs and want to know a bit about the breed until you pick out your favorites. (Next it would be time to find a book specifically about that breed.) The book also gives some general information on the anatomy and systems of the dog, basic care and info on equipment. This is not a book for the person who has had dogs for years, but rather for a beginner, or someone who needs help picking a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a note","review":"I read another review which said that labradors are not good with other dogs and I disagree.

For example, the American Water Spaniel is listed as a 'scent hound' as is the Doberman Pinscher. The Puli is listed under 'Sporting' or 'Gundog' Breeds. The entry for the Irish Water Spaniel says that an alternate name for the breed is the 'Parti-colored Setter' which makes no sense as it is neither parti-colored nor a setter. I also find listing poodles and dalmations after 'random-bred' is confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rat Terrier Information is extreamly off base","review":"Hello, i have read the description for the Rat Terrier in the newest The Encyclopedia of the Dog.

Because of the mass quanities of information about this book and the Study Group's findings, I found myself saying, \\"I already know that\\" when I was reading it. Because information on the war is constantly being updated and reassessed this type of report in book form seems outdated so in my opinion readers are much better off keeping up with details on diplomacy and troop deployment strategies from bloggers and pundits than buying this book.

However, it's remarkable at drawing your perspective closer towards the center.I think the recommendations in this book are spot on, but practical wisdom tells us that about 25% may come to fruition.

We can either fight the terrorists in Baghdad or we can fight them in New York City.Fortunately we have a President right now who understands that terrorism must be defeated. Our Commander in Chief has said numerous times that the war on terror would not be easy, yet liberals like the author of this book want to surrender and declare victory.

The most unique songs i have heard in a while, something really refreshing. Soft Bomb Salad is by far my favourtie, the lyrics are terribly amazing. In fact, each songs lyrics are much different but quite more optimistic then previous albums. It is however a much more intense and dark, but in every sense 'happy'. Each song is sung with such passion and care, that it makes you want to ehtier just relax or rock out on your own. A very personal endeavour."},{"rating":"2","title":"they've done it again!","review":"The Quicksilver Meat Dream shows IME's ability to modify their sound without relying on reuse of old techniques. This album, while difficult to understand and get into at first, grows on you the same way all IME albums do. This has a much heavier sound than ever before and it provides an opportunity for them to show technical ability, without compromising their skill at giving a good catchy tune once in a while (ie. Like the Sun).If you've not heard this album yet, I urge you to get it and don't tuck it away if you don't like it the first time through, it took me a while to get my mind around it but it was well worth it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Successful Step In Musical Evolution","review":"Like all IME albums, it took me a few listen-throughs to get a grasp on what the new sound was in the latest installment, and I can truthfuly say that this one left the best and most profound impact on me. And I consider myself a big fan, if not one of the biggest of I Mother Earth. Always come to expect a strong poetic presence in their songs, but Quicksilver Meat Dream is a shining example of the amazing mastery of combining such an ancient art with new influences to make pure music.

The mood and atmosphere created on TQMD seems forced and artificial. I was really disappointed upon hearing the album-- there is not a glimmer of that spacey, progressive sound they harbored for three other albums. Instead you get half-baked effort that tries to emulate Tool at every turn, and falls miserably short. However, one of the best IME tracks can be found on this disc-- Soft Bomb Salad-- but it's still not enough to redeem the rest of the album. IME has lost their momentum, as shown by TQMD and their live performances of late."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?!?","review":"what happened to ime? this new stuff sounds like something i could hear on one of the many crap stations on the radio....good melodies, but all simple sounding and no depth whatsoever!!

First of all, this is not a biography: it's a carefully paced, dramatic thriller of the first order. It's not just about Bannister, although the portrait of Bannister is complete and obviously pain-stakingly researched, but about a worldwide effort driven by nationalism, amateur ideals, rising professional interests in sport, and the sheer will of these three determined, incredible men to achieve the \\"mt. everest of sport\\". I literally could not put this book down for 2 days straight. I loved all of them and wanted so desperately for them to WIN! There is heartbreak and joy in this book -- a read of the first order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a Better Movie than Book","review":"What a great idea for a book. Three runners from different backgrounds and countries each competing to be the first man to run a four minute mile. I really wanted to like this book more than I did. After many, many pages detailing training, training, adn more training I began to skim in ernest.By the time the featured race was run, I was all out of steam. I cannot put my finger on just what is wrong with the book other than it is really dry and boring. Maybe if the author had gotten more into the personalities and less into the training regimens. Anyway, somewhere they say it is \\"soon to be a major motion picture\\". Mabye the movie will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you feel like you watched it happen","review":"I'm not a track fan, but this book was recommended to me as being very well written, and I have to agree completely. Following the story of these three men from very different backgrounds as they all strive to be the first to break a previously considered unbreakable human feat, you get a sense that you were there watching it transpire. Even though it's a recounting of historical events, the narrative is so compelling that you find yourself mentally urging on the runners as the races are described. After reading this book, I immediately got myself a copy of \\"Chariots of Fire\\". :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer of My German Soldier was better...","review":"Morning is a Long Time Coming was an ok book, but as the sequel to Summer of My German Soldier, I expected much better. This tells the continuing story of Patty, who helped an escaped POW, Anton, when she was 12, during WW2. Now 18, she leaves her abusive family to go to Europe, in hopes of finding her German soldier's family; she wants a better family relationship then she had at home. However, she gets sidetracked in France over a love affair. She and Roger keep having silly arguements, problems spring up, and it gets old after a while. I think that this book should have focused more on her finding Anton's family, rather than a love affair in Paris. The humor was good though, and I liked the French thrown in. This book was all right if you want to know what became of Patty, but it was rather disappointing. If you want a really good read, read Summer of My German Soldier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever Happened to Anton?","review":"I was so excited to get this book that I picked it up and basically refused to put it down until I was done. When I did put it down, however, I was just left angry.I mean, in \\"Summer of My German Soldior\\", the character Anton was so nice, and friendly, and had psychological depth. But in \\"Morning Is a Long Time Coming\\", the character Roger was just an annoying, shallow French guy with a one-track mind.Also, in the sequel, Patty seems less mature then when she was twelve. She seems to have gone backwards, and now has the maturity of a two-year-old. She has forgotten practically everything Anton has taught her. And what ever happened to the ring he gave her? Did she lose it? Forget about it? What?Anyway, I would only recommend this book to someone who hated the first one. Because it seems to me that everyone who loved the first book, hated the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"stereotype of the sequel","review":"In the sequel to Summer of My German Soldier, Patty Bergen journeys (against her parents' wishes--what else is new?) to Europe with the intention of visiting the family of Anton, whom she sheltered during WWII. In Europe, Patty encounters various people, particularly romantic encounters. She must grow away from her dependence on men like her abusive and controlling father, away from her need and desire for a mother, through her stomach issues, and into her own. Unfortunately, the story is slow and uninteresting. Although thoroughly introspective, Patty really doesn't have anything new to say. Things that were appropriate for a teenager seem winy for an adult. The sequel lacks the complexities, personal and interpersonal, and the dramatic excitement of the first novel. Grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW DISAPPOINTING!","review":"Okay, this was pretty lame compared to SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER. You have to read it to know what I'm talking about. There're are all these stupid conversations and arguments. And I know I shouldn't say this, especially since a lot of peeps haven't read the book, but when Patty gets to Anton's house his mother is dead so she just leaves. CAN'T PATTY TAlK WITH ANTON'S FATHER??? This really doesn't make sense. I mean, even if all she was searching for was a \\"real mother,\\" Patty still could have told Mr. Reiker who she was so that he'd know, not just walk away!!! This was a very disappointing book, but I gotta say, if you've read SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER, you have to read this, just to know what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't say much","review":"This book was such a disappointment. I bought it, mainly because I already had the previous novel, The Summer of My German Soldier.There are small facts and details which are wrong and don't follow on from the first novel. Also it moved way too slow, and she did spend too much time in France (she was meant to be going to Germany to meet Anton's family and there was only about a chapter on that).The first novel was fresh and new about a girl who hide a German soldier from being discovered after he escaped from the the prisonor of war camp. I recommend that you read the first one, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morning Is a Long Time Coming","review":"I orderd this book for my granddaughter.

The main character, Patty, has gone from an engaging and sympathetic lead character to a shallow and, quite frankly, annoying one.The story starts out well enough, with Patty coming of age and deciding to follow through on her search for Anton's family and the reactions of her town and immediate family.

However, I was left disappointed and questioning. I'd rate it 2.5 stars, if that were possible. Patty seemed immature. I will give her kudos for blowing off the people who shunned her, including her parents. I hoped for high adventure when she disobeyed her parents and took a trip to Europe. But she and Roger, her boyfriend, had silly arguements, and she spent too much time in France with him. I know she loved him, but shouldn't she have been anxious to talk to Anton's relatives? Why didn't she try to begin a relationship with them? The ending was semi-inspirational, but not really satisfying. What about her and Roger? Did she ever go back to America?

The paranoia of some essays leap out at the reader from every page; others are more reasoned and convincing. Some of the essays make valid points, but the underlying elitism turned me off.The book's major villain is capitalism, profits being the dirty word that prevents the various authors from imposing their version of truth reality and importance on the idiots who have the temerity to disagree.In the hands of most of the essayists, the constitutional right to a free press has somehow been transformed into a constitutional requirement that all newspapers must publish not what the majority of its readers want to read, but what self styled elitist literati feel should be fed to the public.While an interesting read, the book can't be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Cable works fine (computer detects there is a phone there), but software is useless.

Being that this was her first movie and that Otto Preminger was a very demanding and harsh director to work with, I would have thought that the critics and the public would have been more sympathetic. I decided to view this movie with curiosity and some trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised. I believe Ms. Seberg did a very good job, considering she had no experience in movies.

Inspired, light-hearted support from co-star Crosse earned him an Oscar nod, along with John Williams's jaunty score.

I wasn't sure what I wanted to be when I grew up and at 16, having the imagery and music of the Reivers wash over me convinced me that I wanted to become a filmmaker.The Narration of Burgess Meredith, the superb acting of Will Geer, the side of Steve McQueen that we hadn't seen often enough and the introduction of new young actor Mitch Vogel make this a well rounded movie experience. The supporting cast of Sharon Farrell, Michael Constantine and Oscar nominated Rupert Crosse give the characters and story true life. Add the souring yet folksy score of John Williams, the stunning cinematography of Richard Moore and you have the complete experience that takes you back to Mississippi in the early 1900s and reminds you why you go to the movies in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful original music soundtract","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this is a very well made film.

I first saw it when it came out in the late 60's and a couple times since on TV. I was happy to see that it was available on DVD. I didn't like the wide screen format as everything looked as though the top had been sheared off or squeezed down.

It crosses into the \\"New Age\\" to a point.Soldier's Poem, funny song, great to relax too but doesn't belong on here.Invincible has none of the flaws from above, but it suffers from cheesy lyrics for the first couple of minutes.

This is definately Muse's most diverse album. They completley re-invent themselves with every album and this one is certainly no different. The first time I heard Supermassive Black Hole I absolutley hated it, the second time I listened to it I absolutley loved it. It has a very Prince feel to it, which is a good thing.

I loved Showbiz and it's deep mood and the different sound Origin of Symmetry showed. When I heard the single Knights of Cydonia, I was surprised at the difference between it and my favorites. I HAD to buy the record, and after a few tries, it grew on me. I know it's not as hard as Absolution, or as emotional as Showbiz, or as 'scream-y' as Origin of Symmetry, but if you're okay with change and a pop sound, you may like it. Still not my favorite album, but it is worth the money for the few incredible cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great album...","review":"In short: this is just a cool album if you like modern electronic rock!

It has a lot of Queen influence in the vocal and music department. It also has a very Art Rock approach in the music. The musicianship is amazing and always interesting. This Cd was recommended in a Prog Magazine as an album of rock with prog embellishments. I would have to agree. I'm not sure I hear the Rush influence as others have mentioned. I hear more Queen and U2. I think they should move away from the U2 and stick with the Queen influence. Whatever the case is, the CD is very enjoyable like a real good Adrian Belew CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"It's funny how things occur, you know? I had never heard of Muse before I went to the My Chemical Romance concert where they opened. I was pleasantly shocked. They have this Queen-like vibe that I can't get out of my head.

Music critics who are unable to take an album for what it is in itself love to compare later releases to a band's greatest achievements. I do agree this album is not as good as Muse' previous releases such as Origin Of Symmetry and Absolution, but, taken by itself, it is still an amazing and wonderful piece of music artistry. Admittedly, I love the harder rifs and rhythms of the track 'Assassin' as opposed to lighter tracks like 'Invincible' but it also this flow between hard and soft that adds to experience. I also love the very Xanadu-esque opening. I can't wait to go see and hear these songs played live.

Once I received the album I was consumed with disappointment. This world is suffering from the disease of delusion, religion is the opiate of the masses, and it is more destructive than heroin. The ignorance of musicians spouting their idiotic rhetoric, which perpetuates the myths that god exists and we have souls is sickening. Lyrics are a main component of music and musicians have to write lyrics that people can relate to in order to provide catharsis. Hopefully this band will cease to exist so intelligent artists will thrive in our culture and challenge the ignorance that infects everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds just like...","review":"It is amazing to me how much Knights Of Cydonia sounds just like the old hit Telstar by the Tornados from the '60's...and then Freddie Mercury rises from the dead to sing! Check it out for yourself and tell me I'm wrong...someone remembered his 60's tunes! If you've not heard Muse before, this is so far their finest release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muse is...","review":"Listening to muse gives one a small sense of the Divine. I love Muse, and I love this album. What they are capable of conjuring with their music is utterly astounding. There are a lot of bands and albums that are good and lovable, but Muse belongs to that far more elite group of artists that are capable of truly creating something that is not only good but is alive and scintillating. As far as this album is concerned, I find no disappointment. BH&R is full of excitement, albeit often dark, and is very tight and fluid. It does have a rather political vibe to it, but it does not give the listener a sense of preachiness. This is no let down from Absolution, but is a continuance of Muse's great music making abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good!","review":"Sometimes leans a little too much toward the \\"dancy\\" (synth-rock) stuff, but overall a solid effort.

My favorite is 'Starlight' - I could listen to that all day, and frequently do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"To say that this album is diverse would be a bit of an understatement. From the opening track \\"Take a Bow\\" to \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" at its end (incidentally, this was the song that prompted me to buy the album), Black Holes and Revelations takes you on a nearly-fifty-minute musical roller coaster ride, with each track bringing a different, new sound, and yet being done in such a way that it all fits nicely together. All in all I felt that it was extremely well done, and a very pleasant album to listen to. Not having heard much of their previous work, this album has triggered my interest and I'm now intending on exploring what their past albums have to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY ALBUM","review":"This is album is amazing. I can't say it's my favorite Muse CD-- they're all mind-blowing, it'd be impossible to choose, but I listened to this album at least fifteen times the first two days I had it-- no hyperbole. \\"Starlight\\" is perhaps one of my all time favorite songs, and the whole CD is loaded with different styles of music with a Muse twist. I almost want to say that this album is like a trip back in time, experimenting with different styles of rock-- including Italian Folk??? Sounds weird, but this album must be purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album By TheTrio From Devon","review":"Well what can I say about this amazing masterpiece.Take three musical genius's from Devon and this is what come out.

While previous Muse releases were also excellent- namely, Absolution and Origin of Symmetry- they both suffered from some weak tracks pockmarked in between the great ones.Black Holes and Revelations, however, is almost perfect; it's brash, witty, and gloriously over-the-top. The band flawlessly imbues pop, classical, metal, disco, salsa, electronic, and opera into one grand, sensational album.Musically, this is easily the band's best album, and one that puts most other bands to shame. Thanks to Matt Bellamy's virtuoso musicianship and incredible operatic vocals, Muse's ingenuity outshines many of today's hardest-rocking bands.Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Black Holes\\" from two different solar systems","review":"this album sounds like half 'absolution' b-side leftovers and half new dancemuse songs. that is my honest opinion. my guess is they are striking the iron while it is hot and wanted to get something (anything) out as fast as they could. so they took the leftovers and the new ones and put em together. that said, there are some fine tracks here. but a half great album is not a great album. despite my 2* rating, i do recommend this album for the dancemuse songs. not my favorite direction, but they are great tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"I am a little disappointed in this CD.

Sure The band has a lot of energy, but that can only take you so far. They lack truley original ideas, and enough variation in their songs to make this album last more than a week. Even the lyrics are kinda weak. The songs are far too predictable, maybe I'm just spoiled by Radiohead as i'm sure If I had never heard Radiohead I would think Muse was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, terrible singer","review":"I wish I had listened closer to the samples before buying this record. I thought the song from Guitar Hero III was cool, so I bought the record. The music is so awesome, it's a tragedy that the singer is so annoying. He really needs to listen to something other than Radiohead, and develop his own voice. After a couple songs, the impersonation becomes pastiche. Maybe the band will find a new singer(with better lyrics) and the next album will really be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"they're losing it!","review":"...and it makes me so sad. i'm a huge fan of \\"showbiz\\" and was even more blown away by \\"origin of symmetry.\\" but they started to push it with \\"absolution,\\" and after this one, i'm afraid they're finished. i'm getting very tired of the uninspired and repetitive piano arpeggios, and while the guitars are decent and high energy, they ultimately lack the creativity and distinction that muse achieved in the previous albums. the lyrics are trite, and the vocals are more whiney than ever. it's just a very dull, unimportant album.i expected more from muse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was a huge fan of Muse.

At their best, they capture the excitement of a band like Depeche Mode, delivering rhythmic surprises at every turn while being accessible and addictive.

They are melodic and soothing while rocking.The Killers are coming to town (for which I already have tickets) but Muse is showing up a few days later...think I'm gonna have to try to swing this one, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Muse CD","review":"I don't know if this is my favorite Muse CD because all of the music on it is so good, or if it's because it was the first Muse CD I purchased, but either way, I haven't loved any of their other CDs as much as I love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Can't really add more to what has already been said. But I love this album \\"cover to cover.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply an unbelievable gift to the music world","review":"Like a man and women who look into each other's eyes for the first time and know that they have found true love, Muse hits you straight in the heart and never lets you go. Once you have picked up your dropped jaw after hearing Take a Bow for the first time, you can take a second to realize that you have found the pot of gold on the other side of the rainbow; that you have found the Emerald Castle at the end of the yellow brick road. You realize that you have found something so special that you wonder if you are dreaming because you can't believe that you are only now discovering Muse. You find it so hard to believe that something so amazing could have eluded you for so long.Webster's defines muse as to become absorbed in thought. Well, Muse will certainly make you wonder. They will make you think and realize how fortunate we are to have such an amazing group of musicians that are Muse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muse Backs Off From Perfection of Origin Of Symmetry","review":"Muse's new album was good, but a large disappointment (because their albums are usually great.) The songs are far less epic and some are encroaching on the style of more girly American bands like Death Cab for Cutie (and track 4 sounds like Depeche Mode composed it.) I would guess that this change of style is an attempt to get Muse on the radio more, but I haven't heard that from anyone (purely my opinion.)One of my chief concerns is they are getting too electronic! You can still get the favored Stockholm Syndrome-like sound from Knights of Cydonia and arguably some other tracks, but the rest of the songs aren't as hard I would prefer them. Piano also isn't as prominent compared to their previous albums.It's a good album, but it can't hold a candle to Origin of Symmetry and is beaten by Absolution as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BIG HAIR METAL!!","review":"I love this band.

Then you see how Jodee overcomes her troubles later on in life. Then people have the nerve to write \\"It's the own girls fault that the people didnt like her...blah blah...\\" You're supposed to set examples for kids, even the ones that ARE made fun of. You make ignorant adults and malicious kids parallel. I guess you don't get any better as you get older. And to past reviewers that have this attidude, you must have a terrible life if all you have to do is sit and write reviews making fun of someone whose traumatized from being made-fun of.

I expected a book that would tell of one woman's journey through all the bullying trials. After all, the title and subtitle seems to hint at that, but I was pretty disappointed that it lacked that element.I also expected this book to address bullying in schools as it's a pretty serious matter, but it did not. I also expected Blanco to give some sort of insight or wisdom on how to cope with bullying, but she did not. I don't think many young people who are experiencing bullying will be able to connect with this book. What I wish would have been included was ways to overcome and grow from the experiences.I received this book for free from Booksneeze.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly annoying","review":"I have to agree wholeheartedly with one of the review writers who said while reading this she felt like bullying Jodee Blanco herself. She brought so many of her troubles onto herself through her tattling and incredibly annoying self-righteous, judgmental, superior-acting behavior. I bought this book hoping I could glean some insight into the current state of bullying and hostile behaviors in our schools and communities. I hoped there might be suggestions on how to spot troubled children and young adults that might be victims or perpetrators of bullying and cruelty and how to help. I got nothing of the sort; just a whiny, unbelievable, poorly written tale of one very self-absorbed,narcissistic, shallow girl. It is apparent reading her author's bio. not much has changed-she is still her own greatest fan. An annoying and unbelievable read. I have never reviewed a book online before but this book was so bad I felt compelled to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a choice I would pick again.","review":"The story was a bit disjointed. I like the authors intention to bring about awareness of bullying. She seemed to encounter much physical bullying, which was tough to take, and very extreme. I just couldn't get how this was happening.I thought she focused too much on the class reunion and getting the bullies to see her success. I'm sure she needed that, but I thought that it could have been more helpful to show her overcoming and feeling confident in a more wholesome way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I waited over a year to write this review bc I wanted to ruminate on it a bit. The biggest problem with this book is that she admits that she refused to find a clique other than the \\"popular\\" crowd. She ratted on them and then refused to stop hanging around them and going to their parties.The end of the book is all about how she went to her reunion and they all accepted her and liked her and invited her to socialize after the reunion. Not the kind of message I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop Whining","review":"This was probably the most self-induldgent and self-righteous \\"biography\\" that I have ever read. Yes Jodee, I feel bad for you that you were picked on, but because you stood up for a deaf kid? You were such a good person that people didn't like you? Come on, I grew up in suburban Illionois, and kids do get picked on, but not so relentlessly and pointlessly as this story indicates.Plus, how was anything in this inspiring? The end just shows her still insecure and afraid of what people she hadn't seen in years would think of her. If this book teaches kids anything, its how not to deal with bullying and how not to prioritize whats important to you.And on top of that, the book was boring and poorly written. By the end of the book I knew nothing about any of the characters (except, of course, the do-gooder narrator), and the descriptions of anything else were bland and obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Million Little Pieces, Anyone?","review":"No truth. No answers. Not good writing. Even if you ignore the fact that she often exaggerates (or outright lies), she really does this important topic a disservice by oversimplifying and making unwarranted connections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading","review":"This book is required reading for all. Never before have I said that about a book - until now. The book is straightforward and easy to understand - but at the same time, it will shock and move you. Most importantly, the author has the courage to confront the subject of school harassment - something that has been ignored by others. The fact is, bullies rarely stop - not 5, not 10, not 20 years later - and it is refreshing to see the topic dealt with as honestly as the author tells it. When you pick up this book, you won't want to put it back down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I appreicated the story for what it was, her story.","review":"I'm so glad I read this story, it really showed me how bad bullying can be. Having never been on the end of either being bullied or being the bully, I think I was naive thinking no one every really got it THAT bad. I kept rooting for Jodee, and she had such a good heart throughout. She never turned into a bad girl, she kept being herself. I applaud her for that. Who knows how I would have turned out if I had experienced the things she did. Also, I always thought the thing to do when bullied was to ignore it. However, as Jodee taught in her book, that is probably the worst thing to do. I will teach my daughter to fight her battles instead of acting like they're not happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most bestest review everr!!","review":"Please Stop Laughing At Me by Jodee Blanco is an overwhelming story of a girl who faces a horrible childhood. This easy to read non-fiction book is actually Jodee's own childhood. She is faced with school bullying while attending her school, and to make matters even worse, her own friends do it to. Please Stop Laughing At Me is unfortunate, and makes you wonder why people in this world would do such a thing.It makes you never want to put the book down. If you don't find this book interesting, emotional, and memorable then I'm sure nothing will. I give this book two thumbs up! Jodee Blanco does an extraordinary job on letting kids know how school bullying is very cruel and how it can damage a life forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"I requested to review this book because I came from some what the same background. I was picked on a crazy amount (lost my wording sorry) in elementary school. It made me into the quiet, introverted person I am today. I find it hard to make friends let alone a job because I feel everyone is judging me and I want to make everyone happy. Many new anti-bullying laws have been passed recently. A little to late for me but just in time for the kids of today.Author Jodee Blanco, so eloquently describes her experiences. She talks about the most intimate, painful things that bullies did to her and their long lasting effects. This is a must read for those who have bullied in your life to know you've hurt people beyond repair... But it's also for those who have been picked on.. Because now you know your not alone.I would recommend this book to any one. It really is eye opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Courage to Take a Stand","review":"It is absolutely wonderful that there are fluent writers such as Jodee willing to take a stand for all those who are still enduring painful torture from bullies. Most of the time that I read this book I could identify so very well with the feelings that Jodee had and the daily grind that she found herself going through.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been a victim! I also recommend this book for school faculty, parents, and anyone in social services who deals with children. I can only pray that Jodee's bravery in telling her story will help us to end the violence in our schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I found that this book was about a girl who was spoiled by her pushover parents. The moment someone was mean to her, her parents took her on a trip to GREECE?! REALLY? If I were being called names and such my parents would tell me to suck it up and deal with it, not let me run away from my problems and change schools like Jodee did in the book. I also found it was not a book about a girl overcoming the cruelty of kids, but a story a girl running right into the traps of her tormentor by desperatly trying to be their friend. I think the story was descriptive but not at all inspirational. She is clearly a masochist by consintly trying to be around people who hurt her on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I loved this book because it showed how real things can be. How life can change and people can too. It also reminded me of things that people I know and somethings even I went through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be compared to Dave Pelzer","review":"This is an engaging book--the story of the author's struggles at school are hard to put down. However, I found it quite frustrating as it lacked insight into what to do about bullying (Get reconstructive surgery? An excellent idea in this case, but not always a possibility or solution... Get the word out that you are writing a book about your past so everyone you knew will want to be nice to you before it gets published? May work...) The book does deal with a valid problem, but I found it rather self-serving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate to remember, but can never forget","review":"Freshly graduating from high school and having rough times, this book has done nothing but inspire me to think in ways i never have before.It is happy and sad and moving and exciting all at the same time.It has changed the way i think and feel about my past. it is good for kids adults, everyone. it will stay with me forever"},{"rating":"1","title":"No moral--let's all feel sorry for Jodie","review":"As a school principal was shocked to learn that this book is being recommended by the author as appropriate 5th grade reading. The content is not age appropriate whatsoever. In addition, this book offers no moral. The common denominator in all the problems described is the author. She is a self-centered, narcissistic person who has never grown up. As an educator, I found this book to has nothing to offer anyone experiencing bullying. When kids are bullied they need practical tips and stories with a moral. Circle this book \\"none of the above.\\" When Blanco tells of a cheerleader who had her lip gloss replaced with glue, she says the girl had an \\"imperious\\" attitude and \\"had it coming\\"--there is no moral in that. The book drones on and on from there until her \\"triumphant\\" return as Ms. Fabuloso--this is a story of revenge not bullying."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD ENDING","review":"Ok, the book was good up until the end. I can believe that the same things happened to her at all the schools. I just figure she kept trying to be with the cool kids instead of the regular kids to some degree. She admitted it herself, such as naively taking their invitations over and over again. Why she chose to take gym all of a sudden was weird though. However, I hope no poor kid gets to the end and thinks that gaining the approval of these people at a class reunion is something to aim for. If a kid is being bullied by a large group of people, why indicate to them that some day, even if it takes years and years, you may actually be liked by them? That is an insane message. That's probably why the book didn't do as well as it could have.I feel sorry for the kid who read that book with hope and then got to that ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conform or be cast out?","review":"Boy, someone should write a song with those words in it.I don't doubt that Jodee was tormented throughout her education. I wish she had used that experience to create a book that provided better advice to young readers or an honest and circumspect recollection of the events.Instead, her work comes across as artificial (particularly in the dialogue) and self righteous. Because of the over-arcing prose style, this is a hard book to take very seriously. I certainly wouldn't recommend it.I would, however, recommend an editor who knows the difference between a region in France and the location of a Big 10 University."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Hypocrite In The World","review":"I did not read the book. But sadly I experienced something far worse. Jodee Blanco came to my high school to give her story about her sad life. Half of her little presentation was about how she got picked on her whole life and at one point went as far as putting a butcher's knife in her backpack. Also that she had felt sorry for the masterminds of the Columbine shootings. She is a freakin nutbag. The other half of the presentation was how she is now incredibly thin, hot and has dated all these celebrities due to her awesome job. ANd that now she has become friends with all her bullies. So in essence all she is saying is that she was a geek and not like for who she was, so she radically changed herself to gain their acceptance and become one of them. Yea thanks, great message you freakin tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Read","review":"I requested to review this book because I work with teens and youth in my current profession. Many new anti-bullying laws have been passed recently and I wanted to see into the life of a bullied teen now adult and how the behaviors of youth around her affected her long term.Author Jodee Blanco, so eloquently describes her experiences it left me haunted. She talks about the most intimate, painful things that bullies did to her and their long lasting effects. This book was moving and thought provoking. I found pieces of myself in the author as she describes situations where her ethics did not match up with those of her peers and that is what started the exclusion and violent behaviors of her once close friends. Even adults do this.I would recommend this book to any one working in a school or with a child. It really is eye opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really is happening!","review":"I am not sure if all of her book is based on actual circumstances but, I do know this does happen in schools across the country. As a victim of school bullying I can relate to what she wrote. Bullies are all around us and it is more noticeable now. It has been a long time since I have been in school but I remember how I was treated.I give her credit for coming out and writing this book. It is very detailed on how it actually feels to be bullied. I do not agree with her that bullies should be felt sorry for because this is a decision they made. Our society says it is OK for some one to do that because nothing is done to stop it.I applaud Jolee Blanco for writing this book. Maybe it will help stop this horrible practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book.","review":"I think this book changed my whole perception of how high school can affect a person. It was an amazing read and taught me a lot. The main character took her experiences with her forever and it showed me that some people never forget the troubles they have endured."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!! Cry Me A River !!!","review":"I am not trying to be cruel, but this book was a load of bull. I personally would not EVER read \\"Please Stop Laughing At Me\\" again in my life. Sure, I guess I pity Ms. Blanco for having to go through all of that as a kid, because no one should be forced into that situation. But her claiming to be 'friends with the blind kids and the special ed. kids' was a little hard to swallow. I wouldn't know, I wasn't born yet. The whole book just seemed to me to be a rather loud whine for pity. Or maybe it was written to releave her of her 'anger'. Either way, it was poorly written: maybe Ms. Blanco WAS good at making speeches, but she obviously is not good at making books. I just can't beleive that the publishers would allow such a stupid and pointless book to go through the writing process, let alone encourage her to write another. If I saw another book by Jodee Blanco at a bookstore, I would deffinately not buy it, no matter what the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst read ever!","review":"Like others have said - I really wanted to like this book and take something away from it. It was horrible! The writing is unbelievable and completly unrealistic as to how teenagers would speak. I found myself rolling my eyes at more then one passage. Very poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read","review":"I thought this was a really good book. It really captures bullying very well. I was picked on myself all through school. It's really interesting to see how the people who do the bullying may not even remember what they did, while the person being bullied is often affected for a long time.I really identified with the author of this book. It kind of made me feel lucky because even though I was psychologically bullied, I never had to deal with the physical abuse that she had to.This book inspired me to forgive and forget. I'm on that journey now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"This book was awful! I had to read it for a book club and it couldn't be more exagerated. Blanco claims to be bullied and harrased yet never gives reasons as to why she is treated so poorly. This book is not at all realistic for a true story.The author herself claimed that her book was rejected 30 some times by publishers, you would think that she would realize that perhaps her book sucked, but she didn't get the message. I am writing this to give the message to all the readers considering this book, move on don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is.......","review":"This is Sheila's daughter....Anyways i heard a little bit about this book from school and today my whole school from 6 Th grade-12th grade got to have Jodee Blanco come to our school to talk to us about bullying and I loved the talk thing it was so good and i can't believe I got to meet her she is so cool and nice. I feel sorry for her though what she went through....I still can't believe that i got to meet a famous author/publicist that worked with famous people. I plan on going to the book signing at my school tomorrow with my grandma cuz i want my grandma to get a autograph cuz my mom and my grandma both read her book please stop laughing at me. I think Jodee Blanco is very nice by but i could tell by the talk at my school. Rock On!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wallow, wallow Jodee","review":"please. what a bunch of over-embellished crap. what a martyr. jodee was the only good person ANYWHERE SHE WENT. people just hated her for no reason EVERYWHERE. i bet. and then all her dreams come true in the end and the hot guy admits he didnt hate her he just liked her, and all the popular girls want to be her best friend. Jodee and James Frey should hang out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We need to be more aware","review":"This book was truly an eye opener to the problem of bullying in schools and all around us. We, as adults, need to open our eyes and ears to what is really happening here. I'm so glad that she was able to overcome the terrrible things that happened throughout her life. It makes me wonder how many children I come in contact with are going through the same thing. Let's all stop turning our heads and try to make a difference in the lives of these children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodee is full of S***","review":"I think there is only one element of truth in this whole entire story, and I'm not even sure if it's true for that matter, it's such an obscure part but it was the only part in the whole 276 page memior that actually seemed semi realistic. That part was the part where her mother brought her home from school and made her a grilled cheese sandwich. But like I said that part was probbabally twisted as well, I'll bet it was either a ham sandwich or a tuna sandwich or possibally not a sandwich at all possibally a bowl of soup or a shrimp burrito or something, or else she probabally just ended up taking her right back to school. Because whoes parents would baby them by making them a grilled cheese sandwich just because someone was being mean to them. What a spoiled rotten little turd!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would If I Could","review":"I would \\"stop laughing\\" if I could, but I can't because this is the single most ludicrous piece of tripe I have ever read. The only thing \\"inspirational\\" about this book is the manner in which it demonstrates that a \\"vanity press\\" publishing house will print ANYTHING. From poor grammar and inappropriate syntax to mindbending delusions of persecution and delusions of grandiosity, Jodee screams for editorial and psychological intervention. Although I am certain that she was a troubled child who experienced peer problems, this book is a victim fantasy. Throughout each vignette of her \\"inspirational story\\", Jodee contradicts herself with implausible situations of herself as the noble victim against evil peers and ignorant professionals. This book is an embarassing and pathetic attempt to promote the author's narcissitic vision of herself. Save a tree. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes You Want to Cringe","review":"The title itself is enough to make you want to cringe. But once you start reading it you realize how shallow and vacuous the book is, a glib and badly-executed presentation from a public relations expert.Educators know what an impossible problem bullying is. It's often invisible, its victims' reticence quickly morph into a depression, and often the bullies are themselves victims. Unfortunately, none of this complexity and paradox is presented in \\"Please Stop Laughing at Me: One Woman's Inspirational Story.\\" What we do learn is that you will be hated and bullied in school if you rat your friends out to their overprotective mothers and if you are ugly. But there's hope: if you have rich parents who can pay for plastic surgery in the Mayo Clinic this bullying will come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I can not believe the other reviews that I read - I found the book very good and helpful. I went to Jodee's website afterward and she is doing several things to get the message out about bullying. I know that alot of kids are picked on in school, but the kids of today are just down right mean especially the girls!! I went to Jodee's website afterward and she is doing several things that are helpful to get the message out about bullying. I'm definitely going to read her next book called please stop laughing at us- it picks up where this one leaves off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I got this book in the mail after I requested it from Booksneeze.com. I requested it because in more ways than one I was bullied as a child and still in some ways am as an adult. I figured it may help me overcome some of my past and also raise my boys in ways where they don't bully others. This book was about Jodee's life as a child and how bullying affected her. Her life was not made easy by the individuals she knew until her reunion. By reading this book you will learn how to respect and think about others and understanding their feelings. Don't let others motivate you to hate. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially those who have been bullied and those that are doing the bullying. This book also come with a readers guide to help us better understand the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Story","review":"When I was in grammar school, I was an awkward and clumsy child. I was constantly getting bullied and that lowered my self esteem until my mother confronted the bully and he stopped. I do not remember what she did but I was happy she helped me. I enjoyed the book. I was able to relate with the author and I was able to feel her emotions and fear. I do not understand how she put up with it for so many years and her parents or the school not helping her. Great book for parents and educators.(Reviewed by Eileen- Melissa's Mom)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I really wished I had read some of the reviews before purchasing this horrible book. It is poorly written and very unrelatable to anyone who has been bullied. I would not recommend this for anyone seeking advice on how to deal with bullies. I actually found myself \\"rooting\\" for the bullies by the time I had finished this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"Wow. This book is absolutely terrible, and not at all what I expected based on the glowing reviews from the book jacket. It read as though written by a precocious 8th grader, rife with cliches and ridiculous melodrama. The author gets tormented at school after school, wherever she goes, but can't seem to figure out why. Early on, the astute reader begins to get as clue as they try to decipher this curious mixture self-pity and boastfulness.Please don't misinterpret and think that I condone whatever teasing and cruelty the author endured, or that I think she in any was deserved it. She is/was obviously a very troubled person who has a great deal of trouble interacting with others, and I feel for her. But I think this personal journey of her transformation from \\"ugly duckling to swan\\" (to use her own analogy) is unfortunately not nearly as heart-warming or inspiration as she had hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Pure and utter emotional masturbation on the part of the author. I was so excited to see the topic explored in print to just be that much more disappointed at its shallow translation. No insight whatsoever as to the psychological and sociological causes or effects of bullying.Unfortunately we hear story after story of children killing themselves due to bullying sometimes at the tender age of 6. I hope we eventually see a well written book that explores the topic in depth and provides some ideas for solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe you, Jodee!!","review":"Right off the bat, I'll say that bullies are bad, but for god's sake, who calls their mother during a makeout party? It seems the author tattled on people when not much was going on, and when she was being harassed, she didn't. I didn't believe most of her descriptions of the more outrageous bullying, because I went to public school too and here's the thing-- kids move on. There's always a new person to pick on. Switching schools over and over in the vain hope that someone will eventually not want to crazy glue her locker shut or flush her stuff down the toilet obviously doesn't work and if she was as brilliant as she seemed to think, she might have gotten that after the 2nd school.No one could possibly be as perfect and wonderful and smart as Jodee. Sorry, folks, this book is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this fiction?","review":"My girlfriend and I read this book together while on a trip and it was very difficult to get through - not because of the torment that the author supposedly went through, but because of the blatant over-exaggeration of her bullying. Not having lived with the author, I can't state for sure that this book is fiction, but some of her stories seem just so completely fake that we spent most of the time laughing. We bought this book to gain some insight into bullying and maybe be emotionally moved. Sadly, neither of those goals were achieved. Additionally, this book really just made me pissed at the author for wasting 3 hours of my time. I really want my $11 back from Target. Does this review make me a bully?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullying is wrong but hard to like this author","review":"I wanted to read this book because I recognize that bullying is a big problem these days. I thought getitng Jodees insight would be informative and interesting. Instead, I foun myself really hating her. She portrays herself as a perfect angel who does no wrong. Just reading her opening letter got on my nerves because she toots her own horn as an expert on bullying. Kids do terribel things to each other and do hurt each other. I still remember a particular boy who bullied me in middle school. But, I am not delusional enough to think I never hurt anyone else. Of course it was not right, but Jodee portrays herself as a saint and a complete victim. Frankly, I hated her just from reading her sanctimonius opening letter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to slap her, myself!","review":"What a silly disappointment of a book. The writing is akin to an overly long essay submitted for extra credit by a seventh-grade student. Almost everything I read in this book was worthy of a snort of contempt--or, at the very least, an eye roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop whining already","review":"In August Jodee Blanco came to our school and gave a summary of basiclly the book. I decided I would read it, but as I did. I decided that I was one of those bullies, she would have had it way worse. She goes to like 4 different schools and is popular in the beggining and then manages to screw up repeatedly. Why does she hang with the mentals? Why does she call her mom at the slut's party???? [...] She goes to her reunion and everyones all nice to her. WTF??? When she came to our school. she was like \\"Go up to somebody and let them sit with you\\" We made fun of her for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Start Reading This!","review":"This book is fantastic. I had to pick a non fiction book for a project, and I picked this. I thought I would read so many pages a day, but instead I finished the entire book the night I got it. I absolutely love it. I've never really bullied anyone or been bullied so I couldn't really connect to the author, but it was great and a good book to read. I love Jodee Blanco's style of writing and I'm going to read all of her books now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone who finally understands","review":"I bought this book for my daughter who is being bullied at school. I thought that it would help her to read a book like this and share the experiences of someone else who went through the same thing. What I didn't expect was that I would also learn so much from Ms. Blanco's traumatic adolescence. When she describes how helpless her parents were to help her and all the things they did wrong, I saw myself and my failing attempts with my own daughter. This is a SERIOUS issue, one that desperately needs more attention, especially from the people who run our schools.I only pray that more people will read her book and that Ms. Blanco will continue to speak out against school bullying. Having dealt with this in my own home, I know the courage it must take to come forth publicly. It won't completely solve the problem, but at least we'd all be making a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I felt that this book was not very well written. Jodee makes it seem that no matter what bullies have done that it will all be better if they like you once you are older. I just can't agree with that message. This book should have empowered those who are currently victims of the cruelty of others, to give them the motivation and mindset it takes to make it through and still be successful in life. I was bullied too and although I don't have any ill will towards them I certainly do not care to be friends with them now, nor do I care what their opinion is of me now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strickly a history book","review":"Oddly enough, this is a book that kept me up till 2 am, and I didn't like it. I kept thinking, \\"Surely she'll get to the meat soon\\" and she never did. As one of my fellow reviewers mention there was no introspection here, no thoughts on how to prevent bullying, how to help children deal with it. This book states plainly \\"This happened to me\\". Having had similar things happen in my own life, it made quite sad, and offered no hope or wisdom to soothe the wound. This was half an important book, but the important part is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with the seal","review":"First of all, one of the 3 bottles I ordered was missing part of the mounting kit. Since I only needed one, I wouldn't bother to return it for that alone. Beyond that, though, the gasket on one of the caps is twisted, making this one impossible to seal correctly (i.e., without dripping). I had this kind of bottle before, and I know it takes a while to get the lids to seal properly, but this does seem to be taking a long time, with resulting floods in my birds' cages.

Their harmonies are awesome, and no this is not a case like the Judds where one sings and one is barely audiable, both Teddy and Doyle come through loud and clear and sing their hearts out in these great hits spanning their twenty year career with Decca Records. My favorites are \\"Trouble's Back in Town\\", \\"Somebody's Back in Town\\", \\"It's Another World\\", and their last hit, \\"Arkansas\\". The Wilburns sadly faded from the charts in the early 70's although they were both barely 40, same age range as George Jones, Johnny Cash, and Willie Nelson. One suspects industry politics has something to do with it but at least we had 20 years of country classics from the guys. Both are gone now, but their music is as fine as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure entertainment","review":"I'm not a real fan of the Wilburn Brothers, I happen to like the song \\"Trouble's Back In Town\\", a song I remember from my childhood.

Just remember the good old days when EJB was glorious and almost every company went for it.After the EJB rush, now when we are back to basic, we realized that many Plain Old Design Patterns are real gold. I would suggest you don't rely heavily on J2EE, focus on domain design instead.Many books provide this advice on domain driven development, such as Design Patterns, Refactoring, Domain Driven Design.After you read those books, then read this book again.

I find this book well structured. It has a insightful introduction about the concept of using tiers and patterns. However I find this book requires a well-rounded knowledge of systems architecture and programming in general. It's not recommended for a first year students at the university.One of the things I like about the book, the fact they always fully clarify each pattern they introduce. They discuss the benefit, the rational, bad practices and what other patterns related to it.I could talk all about how useful and handy this book was and still for any J2EE developer who works with patterns and the e-commerce architecture designs.

The CD set \\"Turn On The Heat- Piano Solos\\" takes us back to a quintessentially American form which reinforces the notion of E Pluribus Unum and speaks to the universal feelings present in all men.

This book covers several areas: - the two worlds (this one and the spirit one) - words of power (what to say and who to say it to) - tools to aid you in your words of power (candles etc) - alignments and deities (which deity rules over which alignment) - moon work (specific words of power for each phase of the moon) - covens (a few practices of her very own coven are outlined here and some other experiences she had visiting other covens) - the holidays (when they are and their meanings)The most important part of this book to me (that fed the philosopher in me) was her section on the Laws of Manifestation.

I have used all the different gauges they offer and it only takes about 20 minutes or less of intermediate/hard playing for them to start chipping and breaking. They feel very cheap when you hold and strum/pick with them. Tremolo picking will instantly kill them aswell. It also did not help that they have a slick and slippery surface on them either, not a very good feature!

It's a classic in Peru as far as I read but, as Chinua Achebe's 'Things fall apart', this is one of those folklore books that won't appeal to my Fiction reading hunger. It seems shallow most of the times, the character POV of the kid Julius never works out what's going on around him; no true sequels; Julius' parents are made of one piece of cardboard; the setting is the only thing that might be of interest (very much like Achebe's novel); and Julius barely grows by the end of the novel (at page 350!). For that matter, go check Coetzee's 'Waiting for the barbarians' or Peruvian Vargas Llosa's 'The war of the end of the world', two contemporary masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful and exhilarating description of Peru's high class","review":"Bryce brings in this novel an accurate description of the high class life in Lima in the 50's. I felt absorbed by his simple and elegant description of individuals and situations typical of the times.

What happened to Casper's father, who lived in a completely other part of the country, and the big scary mansion? It doesn't make any sense. This is a disgrace to the friendly phantom.The acting in this movie is at an all time low. They got low paid actors for a low paid movie.

Not all of the stories take place in the USA, however. \\"Runaway\\" is set in rural Canada, and \\"The Tutor\\" describes the inner life of two young people in India living in a sort of self-imposed diaspora, one dreaming about his years at Harvard, the other of a hardly-remembered childhood in San Francisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in good condition","review":"Claimed to be in very good condition, but the book was heavily highlighted with yellow and pink, including some notes in the margins, I would not call that in \\"very good condition\\".

Graphics are pixellated and illegible, sound is terrible, some instructors not miked up so they are shouting, others over balanced so it is distorted. Everyone on it is 40, and older. They have managed to make surfing look really boring, and unattractive. Surfer Joe is the worst animation ever seen... looks like it was done at home by the kid next door on his spectrum computer...

The more I watch the video the more I understand, and not only does it give great instruction, it also holds a lot of good scientific value. Not only did I enjoy it, my parents did too, as well as my two younger nephews.

With both the CD and book, our girls and boy LOVE going on long trips because they all get a chance to read and sing along... not that they don't have the music memorized already; we are on our second CD because the first was scratched up from normal play after 4 years of daily use in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flower Fairies Alphabet","review":"This has all the pictures I remember from 30-40 years ago.

It's simplicity did not seem nearly as shaded as in other of the master's great works. That is, until I heard the commentary that accompanied a short collection of out takes from the film, included in the DVD. Somehow, hearing the story of this film's convuluted production, of Flaherty's angst, and, especially, of Murnau's own disregard for taboo when building his Tahitian reTreat, added gravity that made the viewing experience completely satisfying. (The short on Reri, the 16 year old 'barefoot contessa\\" was equally as fascinating.) Now we all look forward to the imminent release of SUNRISE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly unscientific","review":"Pardon the nearly identical review; however, this book suffers the same faults as every other AAT/H book/pamphlet written by Ms. Morgan. Every piece of literature from Ms. Morgan regarding AAT/H is horribly inaccurate, in conflict with reality and contains information that not only is flat-out wrong, but was known to be wrong decades before her books have been published, and pointed out as factually incorrect to Ms. Morgan many, many times. In addition, her citations and quotations are incomplete, altered and often prove the exact opposite of what she claims them to support. Regarding AAT/H she is either one of the most incompetent or one of the most intellectually dishonest researchers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Convincing","review":"I have read both this book and the \\"Aquatic Ape Hypothesis\\" volume. Both are worth reading but I find the present book more convincing due to the number and quality of the evidence that are marshaled in support of the stated hypothesis; a prolonged aquatic phase in human evolution.I found the book's arguments and evidence in support of the hypothesis convincing but I am not an expert in physical anthropology and related sciences. I agree with the author that the aquatic ape hypothesis provides a more robust framework for the observed data than the savannah theory.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desmond Morris Fans, Take Heed","review":"A former girlfriend and I once agreed to each read \\"The Naked Ape\\" by Desmond Morris and \\"The Descent of Woman\\" by Elaine Morgan, and then analyze, discuss and argue about the merits of each author's theories. [I had previously read the Naked Ape, and was a firm believer in Morris's ideas]. After reading both books (\\"The Naked Ape\\" again), I was appalled and embarrassed at how I had simply accepted Morris' theories without any analytical questioning or deductive reasoning. Elaine Morgan wins this argument hands down, with well-reasoned arguments and logical hypotheses. The last two chapters are the most eloquent statements and arguments of the feminist movement that I have ever read (and I doubt that Ms. Morgan even considers herself a feminist).

After using up every bit of my energy turning that da*(&$#rn crank, the flashlight stayed lit a total of 2 min!!! My arm was so tired from turning that crank. I would have much preferred batteries (I'll go to the gym for arm workouts -thank you). Geesh I wish I hadn't thrown away the box in my excitement, because I just want to get rid of this toy.

The cult metal band was only active for a brief period of time in the mid \`90s, but they left behind an impressive legacy of doom.Mindrot's sound bridged the traditional doom metal of Black Sabbath and Candlemass with elements of death metal (and to some extent thrash). Sabbath-style guitar riffs are paired with crushing rhythms, and the vocals range from clean/almost whispered to a frenzied shouting/not quite death metal growling. Soul is as bleak as it is heavy, conjuring feelings of despair (as on the 10-minute monster \\"Despair\\") as well as Evoken. I also hear similarities to better-known US doom metal bands Morgion and November's Doom.Sadly, Soul ended up being Mindrot's final offering, as the band members moved on to other projects. The album remains a classic example of death-laden doom metal, and one that any serious doom metal fan should hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing....","review":"Okay, first of all ?

This book was originally writen in 1910 decade. The book has the story of Deborah, an American poor. This book was an eugenics' best-seller, when it was published, in 1910 decade. Being so bad, this book has only one value: to read how bigoted and racist was American eugenics movement.Since decades ago, the eugenics preached in this book has any value at all. The eugenics of our times is now greened and is called ecology. The fakes writen by the author of this trash-book, Henry Herbert Goddard (1866 - 1957), were doomed when the Third Reich fell, in 1945.

Another said to check the seal inside the lid, did that. Another said to be sure the lid was tightened securely, did that. I tried and tried to \\"seat\\" the little ball and it looked like it was seated. I lightly tapped, lightly shook, lightly pushed and allowed the ball to drop back down, everything. Still, both these bottles had a VERY STEADY leak. Not just a drop here and there, but a steady dripping. Both bottles leaked at about the same rate. No way will I put these in my cages.

Never dropped, never came in contact with any water. Waste of money. My son really liked it though. He loved honking the horn. This is the first and LAST v-tech toy I will ever buy for my kids.For the parents who are freaking over the lines that the toy says, get over it! I don't think it's anything bad at all. Your kid will hear worse things on the tv playing in the background.

Geez..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this toy for your tot!","review":"I TOTALLY agree with many of the other reviewers, but I thought I would type yet another bad review to make the point very clear! My MIL bought this for our son for xmas and we were shocked at the rude voice and comments (\\"Outta the way!\\" \\"Fill-er up!\\") WHO wants their child to learn to speak that way or worse yet, start speaking that way after playing with a toy you purchased! Sorry, v-tech, we're usually fans of your products, but this toy went right in the TRASH - it didn't even make the bag for donation, I wouldn't want ANYONE'S kids to have it! Save your money and buy another driving toy - we just did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude and demanding language","review":"Having had many great Vtech toys, I bought this for my daughter at about 9 months. The first day, I wished I had never bought it. This toy teaches children poor manners and rudeness. When you push the horn it yells, \\"Outta the way!\\" When you hit the gas button it yells, \\"I'm outta gas! Fill 'er up!\\", in a very demanding tone. I would not recommend this toy to anyone and can't believe that a toy company would even manufacture something so socially unacceptable. It went in the garbage because my conscience wouldn't let me sell it to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude Toy!","review":"How is a toy rude, you ask? When you honk the horn, some bratty kids sounds off yelling, \\"Out of the way!\\" When I heard that, I decided to get rid of it for the simple fact that I don't want my son learning to say that phrase. It sounds like some road raging kid behind the wheel. I think the toy in itself is cute, great concept, music, durability, it's just that I don't want my son to grow up to be a road rager. And I am just being sarcastic with that comment, so don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude Little Fellow!","review":"I usually like V-Tech, but this one missed the mark! My 1 year old liked it--for about 10 minutes. he'd play with it sporadically over the next few weeks, but I found myself hoping he wouldn't. The voice is a demanding little kid, screaming, \\"Outta the Way!\\" and \\"Fill 'er up!\\" I relegated the thing to the car, hoping maybe he'd like to turn the steering wheel when I drive, but the \\"on\\" switch is hyper-sensitive, and every time we'd go over a bump in the road, the !@#$ thing would turn on!

The voice is bratty and gives bratty commands like \\"Fill me up now\\"....no please/thank you etc. Also, on one it says \\"Slow down little fellow\\", and given that I have a girl playing with it, that could get confusing...I would like for toys to think a little more about how we would like our children to act instead of trying to get them to be rude and demanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very loud and obnoxious toy","review":"Ugh, I don't care for this toy at all. I was looking for a driving toy and thought this one would be fun, but my son (9 months) and I both find it annoying. First, it's deafeningly loud, even on the quieter setting. Second, the sounds are far too startling and far too many -- I can see him getting distressed after only 30 seconds or so. Having quieter, shorter noises that are actually caused by some action on the child's part would be much more enjoyable and educational. Third, as several other reviewers noted, the phrases it says make it a great training toy if you want your kid to be a total brat. I don't ever want to hear \\"get outta the way!!\\" escape my son's lips in that awful, demanding tone. I only give it two stars because he seems to enjoy examining it with the sound OFF (which is its now permanent state)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"My 1 year old was given this for his birthday. Some of the phrases are rude. The songs are sung off key. The rollers don't always play the special song when there are 3 of a kind lined up. The car sounds are enough to make me batty. I don't see where it is teaching the child anything since it might say any one of three things for each picture. Is it the number? Is it the shape? Maybe this time it's going to be the animal. The low volume setting is still too loud. The only reason I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 is because my son likes this toy despite the fact that the loses interest after a few minutes.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Li'l Road Rage\\"","review":"I wish I had seen these reviews before buying this obnoxious toy for my 10 month old for Christmas. I agree with what other reviewers are saying; this toy barks rude orders like \\"Outta the way!\\" and demands that you \\"Fill 'er up!!\\" in an extremely snotty voice. It does sing a couple of traditional tunes, such as the alphabet song, but even the singing voice has attitude.So unless you want your little guy or gal to learn poor driving manners, steer clear of this toy (no pun intended)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad!","review":"I haven't written a review before, but I felt like I needed to write one for this toy. I have noticed that the most rated reviews were written in 2005 and 2006. I believe Vtech has changed the tones and sayings on the toy. When honking the horn, it no longer says out of the way. It just creates an engine revving sound. I would give the toy an overall good review. Time will say whether or not my daughter likes the toy (she is 6 months old)."},{"rating":"1","title":"rude toy","review":"My 17 month old son received this toy as a gift.

It was a lot of fun for him to mess with and hear different sounds etc...The sound went crazy within 12 months (if not before) and was not fixable.Also, the voice overs of the kids (phrases) were not a good example of what you want your kids saying.

My husband and I just laugh at the silly expressions. I don't think they're changing the personality of our boy -- he's not becoming bratty because of what the toy says, and he's been playing with it enthusiastically for over a year. I got it for him at 9 months; he's 2 now. At first the blinking lights and moving objects were the appeal. Now he can appreciate the more sophisticated aspects of the toy (numbers, shapes and letters, which rotate like a slot machine and announce themselves when he turns the steering wheel). It's helped us get through 3 multi-day road trips and he loves it. Definitely recommended for extended car time (as is the Vtech laptop)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive in the other direction...","review":"I purchased this toy for my son's first birthday and have regretted it ever since. I agree with the other reviews as far as loudness (very loud) and rudeness of the 'narrator' of the toy. I would never want my children saying \\"get outta the way\\" to anyone and I am in shock that the manufacturer would include this in a toy- especially for children who are beginning to aquire language skills (according to age recommendation for this toy). The most irritating aspect, for me as the parent, is when the ABC song comes on not only is it cut short but the voice singing it is so off-key it makes me cringe. I don't believe the spinning ABC/123s/Animals at the top of the toy are easy to follow for a young child either. I'm giving this toy two stars because my son (and his toddler sister) seem to like it but I'm tempted to throw it away because of all the negatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"obnoxious toy","review":"i dont know what toy is more annoying this one or tickle me elmo. as others have stated, it's rude, too loud and i think has minimal educational value. the age group it is targetted at wants to push buttons just to push them - bells, clicking, tooting is just fine. adding colours or the alphabet does not an educational toy make.im getting rid of this and looking for an older, battery-free, busy box."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like It","review":"This gift was given to my son as a gift. He doesn't yet play with it, but my 19 month old daughter does. It is loud and obnoxious. It says rude things. It is, in my opinion, sexist. It turn on too easily.

It doesn't teach anything but bad manners."},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it!","review":"My daughter received this as a gift when she was six months old. She is now nine and a half months old and absolutely loves the toy. In fact, she actually seems to enjoy it more now than she did when she first got it. The dashboard is great at teaching cause and effect. We can watch her and tell that she is understanding that she is causing her toy to make sounds and light up. It also holds her attention for relatively long periods of time.

I have seen them here in the US and they are all in English and I was ecstatic when she mailed it and I saw it was in German... he was mimicking the German sounds immediately and he loves the toy..... he is now almost 2 and the batteries just finally died so the toy doesn't drain like many others! I def. recommend this toy and try to get them in other languages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this before you buy.","review":"This toy has limited interest for my son. I bought it for him when he was 18 mos (he is now 2). He occasionally plays with it for maybe 5 minutes at a time. If you put it on a smooth surface (table, hardwood floor) it slides around when he tried to turn the wheel or pushes/pulls the gearshift. Also it is very LOUD and I find the tone of voice kind of rude: On the horn: \\"out of the way\\", on the gas button \\"fill er up\\" - but the tone of voice isn't nice it sounds like a rude little kid demanding that he be listened to....NOW. Except for the police button which says \\"slow down little fellow\\" the rest of them sound like spoiled brats! Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THAT bad","review":"I'm sad to see this toy getting such poor reviews. Yes, it does say \\"get out of the way\\" and \\"slow down little fella\\", but my DAUGHTER still loves it. The volume control on the bottom is loud and louder, and that's definitely a negative for me - of course it doesn't bother my toddler. But all in all, this toy has been great. It's been well-loved and still works like new. My toddler loves to drive, and this toy has kept her interest for over a year. Just because it's not specifically designed for education doesn't mean there's nothing to be gained. We make it educational by naming the animals, shapes, numbers, letters and colors on the toy. We also sing the songs on the \\"radio\\" - my child has gotten so good at it, that she can hit the button in rapid succession to get to the song she wants. Fun toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and RUDE","review":"This toy is really rude! It says \\"Outta the way\\" and other very rude phrases.

She has played with it literally every day since she received it. The best part about this toy is that it keeps her attention for a long time. I've never seen her play with any of her other toys for even a fraction of the time she spends with this car.The negatives are: it is loud; when you honk the horn it says \\"beep, beep, out of the way\\" (I would rather it was more polite) and when the police button is pushed it says \\"slow down little fella\\" (I would rather it be a gender neutral statement). But personally, I think these negatives are insignificant compared to the positive of how long it holds my baby's interest. Next to the bouncy seat, this item is a must-have in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll and Learn road rage....","review":"Terrible. If I'd have heard what it said in the annoying tone it always speaks in, I never would have bought it. It is high quality, it won't break. I've tried.

I can't imagine how an 11month old could do this..but he did. I have searched for a recall but have not seen anything so far...Will be calling Vtech today. Just be careful if your child has one of these!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in a day and wasn't worth the return","review":"The educational factor really doesn't exist other than that it speaks and maybe your child will imitate it. The pictures are too small and confusing to make the connection between the word and the picture. So, if you're looking for something educational, skip this one. It lights up and makes noise and entertained my one year old, but he likes anything that sings. For the price, that is fine. Unfortunately, the toy died in less than a day. One second it was making noise the next second it was done. Since this was a gift from out of state grandparents we couldn't return it to the store and so we called VTech for a replacement. Long story short you're required to pay one way shipping to get the toy to the company which means at best you're paying over 2/3 the original retail cost of the toy to get a replacement that may or may not last. We are going to just use that money to buy him something from a different company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality - Broken in a week!","review":"Within just a week of owning this toy it started having problems. The sounds stopped working (the lights would work) and then the problems quickly escalated. I believe that when the on switch is turned to the on position it is not making a complete connection. I called customer service and was disappointed that they couldn't do anything except tell me to replace the batteries (which I had). I lost the registration card so unfortunately this toy is just going in the trash.

We love VTech toys in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for the age it is recommended for.","review":"Some of the reviews are ridiculous. It is meant for a infant not a speaking toddler. Do you really think a 6 month old is going to start yelling \\"out of the way\\" because of a toy. It is entertaining for my son. He started playing with it when he was 4 months old and is now 7 months and still loves it! I will probably not keep it past about a year because he will have many other interests anyhow. What toys do we really buy for a 6 month old that stay around much later than that? Great, fun noises for a baby! Thats who its for right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible toy!!","review":"My son received this for a Christmas gift last year. My husband would not let me throw it away so it got stuck high in the closet. When we moved my 4 yr old daughter found it and as I was afraid the \\"out the way\\" suck with her. I had to explain that is rude and we should not talk like that. She wanted to know why someone would make a toy that talks bad. I had to tell her I had no idea why someone would make a toy that teaches rude things. The songs are sung by different voices in different keys at the same time. It makes me crazy. This thing is going out in the trash asap. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of the year!","review":"I grew up in the city, I was very moved by the explanation and discription of the Appalachian mountains, life styles, and cultures.

It is a good portrait of the people who lived in that area during that time. I grew up in the era and setting of this story, so know from experience the poverty of these people.

Clarke story, earth's first encounter with alien, and its impact economically, sociologically etc. Like his novels, its a subtle thriller, never revealing too much too soon and always leaving more questions than answers.To complain about its animation is as shallow as complaining about 2001:space oddysey's special effects. This is an anime that will stimulate the introvert. Those with a vivid imagination will lose themselves in this fantasy. The imagery is is beautiful to me, the sunny blue-green landscapes, cold deserted cities, long stares into the night sky, and the soothing loneliness (an escape from modern chaos)Although I wish they had made this into a series, and prevented the abrupt ending that inevitably occurred... squeezing the future of mankind in a 90min screening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It stays with you","review":"This is one of those movies that you don't quite realize how good it is until it's over and you can't stop thinking about it. It really stays with you. What if everyone lost their memories? It captures a fragment in time very well. It's not meant go into details about every character or tell you the whole story. A lot is left to the imagination. I thought it ended how it should, I didn't feel cheated. You have to think. During the slow points in the film it can be amusing to think things like, gosh darn it, here we are in 2007 and we STILL don't have building wrecking machines that shoot laser beams! What's up with that?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, Boring movie.","review":"As many of the other reviews point out, that the concept of everybody losing thier memories is a good one. The sad part is that the story kind of drags on. The only people with memories are the ones that had memories implanted, saved somehow due to cybernetic implants, and one mysterious lady in which she is not all that she appears to be. Although the story kind of slow, it does make you think for a while.Basically, an alien race was experimenting with Earth. They see how creative we can be with our buildings and machines. The aliens simply took all the memories of man, as our language and knowledge of tools, just to see how we would behave."},{"rating":"1","title":"R U SERIOUS!","review":"this movie is so bad you cant imagine..i dont know how people actually rated it more than 1..it doesnt have a good story...when you read it at first u think hey this is cool..people who lost their memory..but after you watch it you really hate ur self ...i continued watching it cus i paied for it : (...it doesnt have a nice story..it doesnt have an ending..and most of all the charectors are so ugly u cant imagine..spare ur money and buy somethin else"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is not for Kids","review":"This DVD is not for Kids.

The CD recording, however, does not improve on my old LP, and a couple of cuts sounded muddy, as they do on my LP. Despite that, this is a beautiful collection of songs that should have been rediscovered long before now. Tom's lyrics are achingly personal (and perhaps unfashionable for their time) and his singing got more expressive. (Having attending one of his concerts recently, I can say his singing is better than ever!) Though his previous album, Stardancer, is perhaps his greatest album, Sunforest certainly holds up extremely well.

Coad and Yourdon have been among the pioneers on OO methodologies, and their one is a well respected account.What they provide is a complete methodology that covers all the software engineering phases, from analysis (with this book) to implementation (their OOP book).You'll find that specialized magazines routinely presents articles that compares various methodologies. In each of them you'll always find Coad-Yourdon one. For this reason, despite the book is a bit old-dated, it worths a read and, indeed, it can be easily red. You'll gain a better understanding of the modern OO literature, and some insights that are timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It was the first book that ever really explained OO in an understandable and compelling way! Peter Coad offers an excellent, real world approach to modelling using Object Oriented Analysis. This book optimally fits in with the rest of the series (OOA & OOP) but serves as a stand-alone as well. The book serves as an excellent resource for Software engineers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Purchase","review":"I own a fitness center and bought 6 of these bikes just as a trial along with 15 of our standard V-Bikes. The Momentum Bikes worked for a couple of weeks and then the tension knobs all broke. After months of hassle, the company sent new knobs and those have broke as well. The bikes have a wider then normal stance if you measure the inside of pedal to pedal. Many members complained of severe knee pain every time they rode on the Momentum bikes. Unfortunately, now in every class there are 6 empty bikes. The die hard spinners would rather not spin if they have to ride a Momentum.

First and foremost, shipping was super fast (I could have gotten it in less than a week), the men brought the box right inside, I signed the paper and off they went. Putting the bike together was very easy, less than a half an hour and I was on it testing it out. It's heavy, very sturdy, no shaking whatsoever. It's a very solid bike, better than the ones in the gym. I am very happy with this purchase.Just in case you want to know why...I have osteoarthritis in both hips and am facing hip replacement surgery (eventually on both).

As someone who works with North Korean refugees, I know this for a fact. Cumings is preoccupied with self analyzing North Korea's neighbors rather than dealing with the fact that the truth is within the evil regime of the Kims.Most aid to North Korea is from the nations North Korea despises: South Korea, US, and Japan. I wish someone would write about the Concentration camps and the fact that three million people in North Korea have died \\"mysteriously.\\" Has anyone even seen the videos smuggled out of North Korea. Is Mr. Cumings aware of what aid agencies are calling the worst case in the world to date?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumings is an idiot and NK apologist...","review":"I realize that Cumings has extensive knowledge of NK and that he is a professor at the University of Chicago, however, his left leaning political views tend to cloud his objectivity with regard to NK. This book does provide some interesting insight into NK, however, Cumings needs to wake up to the fact that evil is evil and cannot simply be rationalized away. I have lived here in South Korea for 4 years and work as a professor in a university and have academic credentials and experience in Asia equal to that of Cumings and while I hate to insult a fellow academic, Cumings personal opinions are foolhardy and infantile. A much better read would be The Two Koreas and The Aquariums of Pyongyang, both of which get much closer to the truth than the drivel spouted by Cumings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased, slanted and not at all insightful","review":"This was the third book I've read about North Korea - and by far the worst. Complete waste of my time and money - the author is wildly biased, offers nothing insightful about the country and is a complete apologist for the twisted, dangerous and ruthless state North Korea has become. I'm a liberal, but reading this book made me understand why all the idiots on Fox rail about the American left. The most disappointing aspect of this book is that I failed to gain even a fundamental understanding about Korean culture etc. Thank goodness, I had read other books. In case I haven't been clear, one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professor Cummings, What happened to you?","review":"As a PhD student on Korean studies and as someone who has read all your books, I was taken aback by your most recent edition. How, in God's name, did he come to your conclusions? Unfortunately for the North Koreans, even our own academia is given the green light to the most oppresive regime to date. I recommend that people read other documents such as North Korean human rights watch or Amnesty International."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another polemic from Bruce Cumings","review":"Bruce Cumings is, sadly, one of the foremost scholars of Korea in the US. In some sense, he is the American apologist for the Kim regime. He states in another work that it would be good had the Kim regime gained control of the whole peninsula. Then, perhaps, they would have moderated in the sense that China and Vietnam had moderated.It is an outlandish suggestion, as China and Vietnam are still controlled by Communist parties who are effective at quashing all dissent. It is hardly a moderate stance.He gushes about North Korea's health care, housing, and all the rest. He glosses over the appalling human rights abuses of the Kim regime. One could very easily imagine him playfully holding up cards in the stadium at the latest North Korean mass games. He really should not be taken seriously as a scholar of Korea. He is to Korean scholarship what Ward Churchill is to ethnic studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of rca's","review":"Needed set of RCA cables these looked good, price was right, shipping was fast.

The author took six long paragraphs to describe a man's reaction to being arm-in-arm with a woman. I don't have enough hours in my life for this. Couldn't finish it.

Wrong","review":"This book was a big disappointment, first in that it barely takes place in Panama and has very little to do with the Panama Canal (as its title implies), and second in that it was a very boring read. Other reviewers have done an excellent job of capturing the lack of enjoyment I had in reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent literary thriller.","review":"As you will see from many of the customer reviews, this historical thriller is not a purely plot-driven page-turner, a la Robert Ludlum or Ken Follett. If that is what you are looking for, you will be disappointed. Rather, the author takes the time (and, yes, forces the reader to do so) setting a mood, at the same time capturing the spirit of the age and the tormented inner spirit of the protagonist (Henry Adams). This is first and foremost a book about Adams' emotional recovery, so, no, it is not as fast-paced and action-packed as The Alienist. (I liked both books very much, but they are different--perhaps the marketers are at fault for raising false expectations.) But, so long as you are willing to savor a mood, and to arrive slowly at your destination, this is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a comic book, a true literary novel.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

I would have to say for a local South Carolina band it ROCKS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this. Now.","review":"I'm not impressed by most death metal bands (there ARE exeptions); they tend replace talent with grinding noise, which is unfortunate. Nile, on the other hand, is phenomenal in almost every aspect of their music. The thrash-metal-ish rhythm guitar breaks are an excellent addition. My only complaints come from the guitar solos; a lot of them (esp. the fast ones) are fairly random, which detract from the piece rather than add to it. Other than that, I have no complaints. Nile is easily one of the best death metal bands around. Buy this album or I'll cut your hands off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"I really love this album from beginning to end.

They deserve ranking with all of the Florida based Dmetal bands. In fact their performances on this album outshines most of those bands anyway.

This 1998 break-through release is by far there best work to date. Karl Sanders [vocals/guitar] and Chief Spires [vocals/bass] compose all the music on this album.

I was a little bored by the many insignificant details of his day-to-day activities. I assume this book's intention was to let the reader get to know Og Mandino on a more personal level, but as for myself- I have come to know Og on a more personal basis by reading his other books that have offered me principles with which could help me live a better life and that is what helped me to get to know him at a more intimate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far and away his worst book- don't bother","review":"Very slow, very boring and very, very self-congratulating.

The desert locale was tranquil and beautiful; Bridget Fonda and Eric Stoltz were well cast and interesting to watch; Phoebe Cates was appealing as the sane-but-boring ex-girlfriend; but even halfway into the storyline you never really cared about the characters or their situations.

Anyone who is greatly interested in the literature of this genre, but too young to have actual remembrances of this era, will find this work fascinating. Many of the photos have never been published before, and thus are a refreshing change from the standard photos of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and crew that have been served up so many times elsewhere. McDarrah, who I believe worked for the Village Voice at that time, has done a fine job in selecting the photos in this collection. My favorites are one of Diane DiPrima, perched on a piano reciting her poetry, and Herbert Huncke visiting Allen Ginsberg and attempting to fix the latter's broken TV.

'The Notorious One Man Orgy' is more of the same. True, Playboy Mansion is fun to listen to, Men & Women is alright, but the rest of the album borders on straight up stupidity.

I'd hate to think young women might think this is a healthy thing to do for their unborn child.

It was worth all of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a comedy?!?","review":"Personally, I thought this movie was dark and depressing. It is the story of a 20-year old Irish woman who, after a night of drinking, is \\"taken advantage of\\" by a man so inappropriate, she's ashamed to admit that he's the father of her baby-to-be.Tina Kellegher's performance was very good, but could have been better if they'd given her character a little bit of depth. She comes off as very irresponsible and shallow, and she doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes. I agree with the other reviewer who wrote that Colm Meaney provided an excellent portrayal of a concerned and good-hearted father, but the rest of the cast was practically non-existent - especially the young woman's mother, who shows very little concern or interest in the pregnancy whatsoever (mainly because her character is so underdeveloped in the movie).For a TV movie, this is very watchable. For a DVD, it's a waste of money.

We found \\"The Snapper\\" a major disappointment, and actually threw it away after watching it once. We'd never want to sit through it again, nor would we recommend it to anyone, so we just pitched it. It took us two sittings just to get through the movie at all -- we all fell asleep about halfway through the first time. Yes, it was heartwarming that the family stuck together and celebrated this new little life, but so what? None of the characters made us care about them particularly, as they showed little depth. The girl's father was implausibly supportive, her mother was strange, the baby's father was totally disgusting, and the girl was just plain silly and stupid. From now on, we'll go back to renting before buying. This was a total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly funny","review":"Based on the second book in Roddy Doyle's Dublin trilogy, The Snapper is a wickedly funny glimpse into the lives of a working class Irish family. The eldest daughter of a large family becomes pregnant and refuses to name the father. Not your traditional comic premise, but in this case it works beautifully. The characters are fully developed and presented in such a manner that you care deeply about them, and experience their pain as well as their joy. Veteran actor Colm Meaney (Star Trek DS9), who appears in the other two films that make up the trilogy (The Commitments and The Van), masterfully carries the story as the father of the unruly brood. He comes across as a good man who tries to do the right thing and loves his family, but is painfully human at every turn. The rest of the cast is mostly unknown but very believable and capable. I highly recommend this film (and the books, too). It may be the closest you ever get to Dublin without actually crossing the Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic view into an Irish home.","review":"No other film has ever captured the zeitgeist of Irish life as well as the snapper. Roddy Doyle was teaching in a North Dublin working class school when he wrote this book. Much of the dialoge that you hear in the film is directly out of the mouths of his students.What you see in this film is as close as an outsider is ever likely to come to an understanding of working class Irish life. The unmarried daughter giving birth accounts for 1 in four of all children born today in Ireland. This is as real a situation as you can have. The language, the wit, the sarcasm and the lifestyle are all iminently recognised by Irish people as being true to daily life.The bonus of the Snapper is that you get a bellyaching laugh at the same time. There are few films as funny as this.Absolutely brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare combination of poignant drama and heartwarming comedy","review":"This film is among my Movie Top 10 of all time, and shall not slide from it, ever. The storyline is not much happier than, say, that of The Scarlet Letter... but still, what a wonderful outcome! Colm Meaney is absolutely ingenious as the grumpy but loving father. Tina Kellegher exhibits a brilliant performance as the \\"star-crossed\\" young mother-to-be, and all the other actors draw up wonderfully lively characters. In spite of a little bit abrupt ending, the film offers a hilarious picture of the Dublin family and suburb life. It's so human, so charming... An absolute hit in Hungary as well! You've just got to see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor copy!","review":"I was dissappointed in the poor grainy quality of this DVD. It even froze at one point in the movie.

But you do need to practice the principles taught on other unsloved problems. But for people like me, who find calculus a bit difficult to digest, it is worth the price. I remember myself reading the book one night when I could not sleep, something which could never be expected of an ordinary calculus book.

Overall a very good book for claculus haters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Would Find This Helpful?","review":"I expected some clearly worded explanations of the topics I faced in my gigantic calculus course book. This book has some brief explanations of the major topics but they're not any better than what's in my text book. This doesn't add anything to my understanding of calculus. Perhaps Calculus for Dummies or the Complete Idiot's Guide would have been better choices. I was also dissapointed with Calculus Made Easy. It wasn't any easier than my text book either. My money would have been better spent on a tutor. Michael Kelly's Humongous Book of Calculus problems is very good for showing how to work through some tough problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"How is this possible?","review":"Unless you're a mathematician, it is probably a rare thing when you find a math book that you would enjoy reading in your free time. It is utterly inconceivable that you would find a CALCULUS book that you wouldn't mind for some light night reading.Believe it or not, inconceivable does not imply impossible, and here is the proof in hard copy. I HATE calculus and I found this book both easy to understand and actually amusing! It was an excellent refresher for my 2nd (and surprisingly successful) attempt to pass calculus II. I really wish I'd had this thing earlier, when I was slaving away through first-quarter calculus. For anyone who is taking calculus or wants to review, I give this book my highest recommendation. Now, if only these folks would write a full-length textbook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what its cracked up to be","review":"I got this book thinking it would be perfect for my college calculus classes, what a mistake that was. I used Stewart's text, which is a pretty common text, and this book didn't cover even half the material we went over. The material it did cover it didn't go nearly in depth enough to actually learn anything. If you want to read a book to become familiar with calculus before you get a real book this might be ok, but it really covered so much less material than Stewart and didn't really do any better of a job for the most part at explaining it that I don't see any reason to buy this book. Perhaps for high school calculus this may be better but for college calculus it truly is completely useless I feel. For each concept there are only a few worked out problems and those are so basic they aren't even worth being mentioned for the most part. Do yourself a favor and if you are using a halfway decent textbook don't worry about buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"OverRated","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews. I wish I hadn't. It was a waste of money. This book is EXTREMELY simplistic.

In fact, it is the quality of the material that sets this collection apart from the rest in Iain's illustrious career. He manages to combine the topical with the personal, the familiar without being plagiaristic. All of these songs resonate and ring true, and even the topical ones avoid a preachy tone.Just check out Living in Reverse, or Back of the Bus. This disc is worth picking up for those two alone, but it also has a wonderful Miles Davis tribute song God's Empty Chair. And The Ties We break is one you'll be playing over and over again.You should definitely buy this disc if you've never heard of Iain Matthews before.

Unfortunately, this film has nothing -- and I mean nothing -- to say in its 85 excruciatingly tedious minutes. Conceiving Ada touches on a wide range of subjects -- time travel, sexuality, computers, and memory -- but fails to generate a single insight about any of them. This film desperately wants to say something, but doesn't. It wants to be beautiful and original. It wants to be the sort of film you argue about over coffee afterward, but it comes up empty-handed. You will look at your watch. A lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best.......","review":"Yeh i rate this as one of JT's best albums in my opinin.

A great black and white about a knight's return from the Crusades where he is faced with the crisis of the existence of god as he enters plague ridden Sweden. Throughout the film, the knight plays intermittent games of chess with death for his soul as well as knowledge about god. Filled with a great cast of characters that make the film funny, sad, beautiful, disturbing - ahh, I do love Bergman!

It's not even the best Bergman film released in 1957."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Accessable","review":"Please don't avoid this film because you have a preconceived notion of it being arty or pretentious.

Truly one of Bergman's best (if not THE BEST). For those who are not used to and/or impatient with black and white films and subtitles, this one just might save you yet. It may take some getting used to and God forbid, you might have to use your brain (!) to see the poetic, tragi-comic moments experienced by all. I think everyone and anyone can relate to at least one of the film's characters- whether it be the performers/ artists who seem to have no valued place in the world or the errant knight who has come home.

His movies have that extra something which puts them out in front of the others. Everything from Wild Strawberries to this film display his incredible ability to turn what seems normal everyday occurrences into moving mental delights. I wish he had not given up filmmaking but his greatest love is the same as mine, theater. That is where he practices his craft now. This movie takes us into death but with a twist. Every one wishes to put off death. Our hero, and he is heroic, manages to cheat death out of an early demise. The game of chess is very appropriate for this film. In what other film can we see the plethora of incredible images we se here? What other has the genius to make the simple into the great? Bergman has done everything very well.

Though it was fun to play and had things to find like in the 2nd potter game it just was not as fun as the 2nd.

I borrowed this one and was very disappointed. The game is boring and hard. Sure, the graphics are good but I hated the game. It was hard to beat the tasks. Like the first one, the game got harder as you got further into the game. I liked the second one most because it was hard but it didn't get super hard. I wish it was at least a bit more like the second one. Definitely play the Game Boy Advance version or borrow this one first."},{"rating":"2","title":"POA on PS2 - not bad","review":"Having played the other 3 releases, this one was a little nicer in being able to play all three characters and having each character having his or her own stregnths. The layout of the castle and grounds is a little different from the previous 2 releases from EA, but overall, I felt it was a pretty nice game. Some of the tasks are not that easy and it takes time and patience. It's good also that as you collect your \\"cards\\" each of your characters gains enduracne. My kids enjoyed watching me play and even my husband thought it looked pretty darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage might fail you. Friends won't. Neither will EA...","review":"...since they've only gone and done it again! Taken a smash book, a smash movie and made them both into a smash game. In The Prisoner Of Azkaban, you get to play as Harry, Ron, Hermione and Hedwig in your quest to escape the Dementors of Azkaban and find out the truth about convicted murderer Sirius Black. Along the way you get taught about some different subjects - but unfortunately they've still kept the stupid find-the-spellbook-to-get-the-spell idea. Also, the characters no longer shout out the spell they are currently casting. But the graphics are good, the gameplay is good and the character swapping is excellent - immensely satisfying whenever you use it to solve puzzles. So for a truly great Harry Potter experience, (a) Read the book, (b) See the movie and (c) Play the game. Go on, you know it makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Dissapointment","review":"OK. I am a HUGE Harry POtter freak. I am totally obsessed. I have all the books and have read them each at least 10 times. Even the fifth one. When I got this game, I thought it would be way cool, alas, I was mistaken. I don't really like this game very much, it's NOTHING compared to other games I've played. This game is long, tedious, and, well... boring. You spend most of your time at the stupid \\"loading\\" screen, and when you aren't there, you are doing some meaningless task that someone tells you to do. BORING. The battle system really stinks, I can never manage to hit anything with Harry's stupid wand. I say, forget the wand. FIND A SWORD.

And you dojn't even get to fly buckbeak. it is just a cut-scene. The only new thing about the game is three new spells.

At the first in the train ,though, theyr faces look kinda weird, but they get better as the game goes on.I Got the impression that they were Rushed on the plot, because at the first cut scene starts with ron,harry, and hermone on the train. Ron is all \\" Blmy,10 years ago, sirrius black killed (something) number of people\\". I mean talk about an abrupt start.it just seemed like they diddnt care much about the plot.Also it was pretty easy.

The game could take less than 2 days to beat even if you've never seen a PS2 before. The game isn't near as exciting as the book and misses a lot of key parts. There is absouletly no quidditch in this game. I really enjoyed the other games because playing quidditch was so much fun. In this game you mainly watch cut-scences and spend half of your time finding spellbooks. Another great part of the book was the excitement of going to Hogsmeade for the first time. In this game you go to Hogsmeade once and it's not even scheduled. I give this game 2 stars because I think it could have been much better and more exciting. I would recommend renting this game instead of buying it unless if you want to play it over and over and seeing how many times you cant beat it in a year (probably 365)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok game","review":"Nice graphics.

But in the last year, Oxo has changed the composition of the sponge, probably to save manufacturing cost, and in doing so they have made it useless. These new replacement sponges do not absorb water nor pick up dirt as well as the previous versions. I live on the desert and wet mop tile floors after vacuuming. It doesn't matter how good the vacuum cleaner is, there was always plenty of grit to mop up. This new replacement sponge does not pick it up. Just moves it around I guess. My only alternative now is to buy another brand mop and hope it performs as well as the Oxo used to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO roll mop refill blue version is worthless","review":"I bought the rollermop, with it's original blue sponge- and one replacement sponge at the same time from bed bath beyond- the sponges LOOKED identical. The first sponge served well enough. Upon use of the replacement, I found it did not fit the mop - the rollers extended past the sponge on one side when squeezing dry, so it was continually slipping off the handle. Also, within about 30 uses on a fairly clean floor (no big challenges), using murphy's oil soap- no chemical challenges- the sponge simply tore off the metal bracket. I'm going to try to return the roller mop itself, as it has no value without replacement sponges.

I picked this book up at a book store in Paris and read the entire thing in one sitting (standing, walking... etc.). Basically, I couldn't put it down. It gives the reader a detailed account of a new religion being created and converting the world by storm.The interesting part is how realistic it all seems, and the ties to the way Christianity crushed its opponents and absorbed many of their holidays and even some of their traditions in order to make itself stronger.This book will leave you wanting more and truly questioning religion. It addresses things we don't often think about. And shows a messiah with speech writers, much like a politician. John Cave (initials J.C.) is a modern-day you-know-who that preaches a doctrine of death that people are only too eager to swallow.I don't want to say more and give anything away, but if you're at all interested in what I've said so far, check this book out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"if you have no sense of humor and like to over complicate everything to make yourself look smarter, you probably won't enjoy this book.

I wish we had returned it immediately.Pros:-Lightweight-Handle for squeezing water is good-sized and easy to useCons:-Sponge does not stay in the mop, sometimes falling completely out but usually just sliding from side to side, meaning you can't put much force into mopping-Sponge doesn't wring out completely before you start mopping, leaving tons of water everywhere-Confusingly, given the previous point, the sponge won't absorb that extra water back up so we are left with huge puddles that have to air dry.-The sponge is held onto the mop with a little metal strip at the top that provides little support, so the big sponge just flops around loosely, making it impossible to scrub difficult dirt spots.This is far and away the worst mop I have ever used.

It has never scrubbed the floor very well--I have to bend down and scrub up most spots by hand. As I've used it more, the rollers that hold the head in place have gotten loose, allowing the sponge to slide back and forth on the head. And it does not squeeze enough water out of the sponges--I can squeeze till no more water comes out, but I still get a puddle of water on the floor.If I just wanted to do a light surface cleaning of my kitchen floor, this would be fine.

From that standpoint, this is a book that will hold your interest although there is too much \\"me\\" in the book. However, from my limited knowledge, I spotted several inaccuracies that diminish the author's credibility as a careful researcher. She describes the Tamiami Trail as starting in Ft. Myers (which she spells incorrectly as Ft. Meyers). The reason it's called the Tamiami Trail is that it spans the route from Tampa to Miami. My horticultural knowledge is mostly confined to what I see in the Home Depot garden center but I know how to spell liriope, a common border plant here (she spells it loriope). It makes me wonder about how far to trust her other horticultural pronouncements."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE CHARACTER?","review":"Why didn't I just read the encyclopedia for information on orchids and the Seminoles? What was so special about Laroche as a character? Was he really that boring or does Orlean really write that horribly?

Orlean's prose is, for the most part, bland, although there are a few moments of clever, vivid description. I came away feeling that this was a non-story. Comparisons to John McPhee are absurd. There is no such brilliance here. Instead there's a great deal of light, surface observation.

Most of this information is gained through her conversations with the unusual people that make up the orchid world in Florida, the most interesting of which are the orchid hunters which poach wild orchids. The setting of the book is probbaly its biggest. Florida is an unusual state with rich history and incredible wilderness.The history of the orchids and the scientific details about them seemed a bit too superficial. Although experiencing it from Orlean's \\"exploring reporter\\" point of view does make many of the stories easier to relate to, I think I would have preferred the voice of a real orchid expert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers can cause such a ruckus!","review":"Susan Orlean travels to Florida and follows John LaRoche, an independent soul who is enamored of orchids but has been arrested for stealing them while managing a nursery for the Seminole Indian tribe. In the author's desire to understand orchid growing, she visits nurseries of well-known orchid retailers and a prestigious orchid show. The Fakahatchee swamp becomes her focus as she joins LaRoche in pursuit of seeing a rare ghost orchid.A history of orchids, the mysterious places they grow, and the people to whom they mean so much leave the reader with a deep appreciation of how plants can affect people. It's a hobby; it's a career; it's an obsession. The writing conveys so much of the excitement of keeping orchids that I, myself, ran out to buy a Phalaenopsis orchid from my local Trader Joe's (who I learned imports them from Thailand) in order to view it closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable.","review":"Essentially a portrait of John Larouche, orchid hunter and thief extraordinaire, as well as (surprisingly) supporting the conservation movement, this laconically humorous tale takes us into the depths of the Everglades, the forests of the Far East and the hot-houses of the rich, famous and crooked.There are some strange asides, that illustrate the type of enigmatic person who goes in for the underworld orchid trade; tales of frog poachers, happy in their slimy occupation; capsicum and bromeliad growers who dump the whole crop in a fit of pique; collectors who also spray-paint pigeons' tails.In all, this reads more like a novel than an investigation into the illegal orchid trade, but loses no credibility for that, rather, it lends a more accessible quality to the book than it would otherwise have.A very funny, worthwhile read. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched, tabloid journalism at its best","review":"The author has done no proper research, neither she has examined all the facts. She is totally dependent on what the toabloids have published, or orchid zelots, often without proper academic qualification have fed her. Example Phillip Cribb from Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew has his PHd not in orchids, but in \\"Cultivated potatoes of South America\\".Equally, the author has never been to any of the sites where wild claims about them being endangered is made repeatedly, feeding public with fairy-tales, none of which upon close examination hold any water.Another book, to keep the door of my warehouse open!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Given the opportunity, I wouldn't read it again.","review":"It's unfortunate... I really wanted to like this book, but after finding nearly identical passages about Robert Fuchs and Martin Motes repeated in different parts of the book (talk about filler) I simply can't fathom giving this book a good review. Did I really need to hear that Mr. Motes drove a BMW two times?As an orchid grower, I found the author's use of the elusive ghost orchid flower as a device to tie the book together trite, as, it's really not the flowers that make ghost orchids so interesting, but the fact that they have no leaves. It all seems a bit naive to me, or perhaps a bit concocted. Parts of the story are interesting, and yes I did learn something from the book, but the whole reason for being of the book is a bit lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulda been call \\"Time Thief\\" cause that's what it does...","review":"Waste your time... If you would like a humorous and interesting account of the Orchid industry, wait for another book. This one lacked story, humor, plot and drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I read this book with a book club. Of the 10 members only 3 were able/willing to finish the book. Of those who did, the universal opinion was that the historical factoids about Florida make the book. The only problem is that Susan Orleans seemed the make the history of Florida into a her own fictionalized version of it. Even the web site which she states refers to the tracking of Florida Panthers is incorrect. This was extremely disappointing since we live 50 miles from the very sites she describes. For those who enjoyed the book, be aware that she chose entertainment over historical accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received item","review":"I never received this item so naturally, i'm pissed.

Real and exotic and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"no story, no plot, no drama...just long-winded verbiage","review":"i read this book expecting some kind of genuine narrative or story -- but instead i kept confronting long passages of exposition that seemed designed to draw attention only to the writer and her stylish prose. this read like an overblown magazine piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"flowery language isn't enough to keep this from wilting","review":"i found this book to be dull and pointless. orlean's writing style isn't enough to save this book from its essentially superficial quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS!","review":"What a bore! If you really want a magical reading experience there are thousands of books more worthy. This is like a 260 page magazine aritcle - and not even an interesting one. The book goes nowhere and ends in the same place. A complete waste of time and money. I skimmed through parts looking for anything to gain my interest. Before you categorize my review - I am a huge fan of the area in Florida and an orchid lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Start, Slow Finish","review":"I came to The Orchid Thief with high expectations, the book recommended to me by several friends. I left disappointed. While the first hundred pages or so were absorbing and the extreme fascination that orchid collectors have for their plants interesting, The Orchid Thief ultimately lacked the narrative momentum and stylistic writing of, say, A Civil Action (a much, much better, and much more readable, book than this). The strain of stretching a magazine article to book length shows as the author delves into tangential and even pointless digressions about Florida history that often have nothing to do with orchids or plants or much of anything. It's just padding, and lacking a compelling central character (the author occasionally, and intriguingly, comments on her own reactions to it all, but appears to hold back just as I as a reader want to know more), the book plods on and, for the reader, proves as slow-going as a trek through a swamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hothouse flower","review":"I'm a plant dork. I have a Cymbidium orchid in my bathroom right now that won't flower for me, despite pampering. I recently met an orchid nut from Florida and was inspired to read this book. Yet, about halfway through \\"The Orchid Thief\\", I started to lose interest. It is a similar sensation to seeing too many famous important paintings or too many fabulous flowers in a sitting. As the tales of intrigue, plunder and eccentricity started to pile up, they began to lose meaning and became, unfortunately, boring. Probably the New Yorker piece was the right length."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gifted writer on the bizarre subject of orchid thieves.","review":"Susan Orleans came to my attention several years ago in the pages of the New Yorker, where her matter of fact, man on the street stories stand heads above the rest. The book is a page turning, and a laugh a minute. She's a keen observer of humans and their bizarro ways, and knows how to share the weirdness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment and incomplete thought","review":"I have just read The Orchid Theif, one of the most boring disapointments of a read. I was expecting a lively narrative of John Laroche, the \\"Theif\\" of the title. Instead what I got was a slow lecture about the history of Florida and orchids. When the author tried to descibe a flower, she was never able to put the picture of what she saw into my head. The author had a tendency to go off on many tangents, many of which seemed interesting, and just as I gained interest in her tangent, she would abruptly stop, and change the subject never to return to what she had made me interested in. The book was boring in that it could not capture my attention due to it's choppy writing style and inability to complete a thought. I would've preferred a clearer glimpse into the seemingly interesting, Laroche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The Orchid Thief is not a tale of any kind -- horticulture, lust, or lunacy. There is no story, no plot, no nothing. The horticultural content is riddled with inaccurate generalities and hearsay making it an annoying read at best. While well-written natural history tales are exciting, interesting, and educational, Ms. Orleans merely relays a stream of gossip meant to shock us. If you are really interested in the natural history of Florida or the Orchid family, you will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is all over the map","review":"I'm a writer by trade (news) and know how fickle the public can be, but I am still amazed at how successful this book has become.It's a pure and simple bore, with a choppy story that wanders all over world and at times seems to have lost any contact with the original focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mired down in the swamp of bad writing","review":"A slice of life sketch of various people who collect orchids, this book gives accounts of those afflicted with the orchid obsession. While at times engrossing, the writer jumps around constantly, offers opinions as unsubstantiated facts, and leaves the reader wondering why some people are mentioned in the book at all. I was disappointed in this book and definitely did not catch the fever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A colorless story that does no justice to Floridas orchids","review":"Quite a disappointment - The Orchid Thief is one of the most boring books I have read in years: it is utterly colorless, in spite of the fact that it is based on a true story of beauty and obsession. Susan Orleans impressive professional experience as a journalist unfortunately does not show in these 282 pages of nothingness. John Laroches character simply does not captivate the readers heart (or the authors, I dare say), and the book is simply plotless. The Orchid Thief does no justice to Floridas captivating orchids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Audio","review":"I cannot get through this book. The reader's voice is annoying and it turns out to be not a story of a person but a travalogue mainly of Florida.I learned a lot more about orchids than I care to know. To me it was like a textbook and the so-called orchid thief barely appeared. I had expected a novel and instead was back in the BOTANY department where I used to work.Maybe if I had read it with my eyes I would have liked it but the audio WAS not pleasant and I don't think I'll get past the 4th disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very long journal article","review":"This novel contained too much excessive detail and facts pertaining not only to orchids, the obssession with orchids, but also pertaining to the swamp and characters within. When Susan Orlean left her journalistic viewpoint and just wrote about Laroche and others and their obsession with orchids the story became interesting and at times quite funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book written?","review":"Sorry I have to leave such a bad review, but please, where's the story? All I can say is that the message could have been a beautiful short story (2-3 pages), but a book, no way. Don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Orchid Historians Only","review":"One of the members of my book club chose this book mainly because she loves true stories. We were all sorely disappointed in this book. We found it to be slow and boring and was a chore to get through. The only people who could enjoy this book would be orchid historians or the orchid \\"philes\\" described in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much undeserving praise","review":"This book is simply awful. Orlean simply saw one odd piece of news, exploited it to every angle imaginable, and completely bored me along the way. A good author could get the point of the book across in about thirty pages, but Orlean uses 200. This isn't a book, it's just a collection of newspaper clippings. Please do not support this terrible literature; if you're going to buy it just get it from a library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, funny, sad, and wondrous.","review":"A brilliant and funny excursion through a wondrous jumble of oddballs and seekers. Breathtaking writing about Florida's landscape, especially the dank, fetid Fakahatchee swamp. Like Joseph Mitchell and McPhee, Orlean's writing about lives built around obsessions is often funny, though never cruel or demeaning, and always deepened with the mournful recognition of human frailty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"I don't know what took me so long to read this book.....maybe I do.I did not start reading non-fiction until recently, and what I knew about this book, or thought I knew, was related to the movie. So, I had no interest. Something made me pick up this book when I was in the book store, and I'm so glad I did.I used to live in Florida and my mom would tease me that every once in a while, something would pick up the states and shake and all the weirdos would drop into Florida. I had to agree. This book just proves it all over again. The only reason I gave it four instead of five, is the author told some stories twice and I think once, even a third time. I was surprised at that, but all in all, a great book.Those obsessed orchid collectors? Who knew?This book is a very, very , interesting and fun read. Well worth the couple of days it took me to race through it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the extremely curious","review":"Can't figure out why this got such rave reviews. Based on those raves, I expected a book highlighting the motivations behind, and the experience of, obsession. Instead the book reads as a litany of botanical trivia and unintersting personal details about the author. I put the book down with only fifty pages to go...something I've almost never done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at a world I never knew existed.","review":"I don't know an orchid from a dandelion, but something about this book's description intrigued me. The pursuit of beauty takes many forms, and orchids appear to be a particularly virulent strain of this passion, which for some, apparently, borders on madness.The author draws readers into the intertwined worlds of orchid business and orchid obsession in South Florida, where history and heat inject their own craziness into the mix. It is a fascinating glimpse into the human condition; I will never pass another flower store advertising orchids without pausing to think about this book.In fact, I enjoyed it so much, I immediately went out and bought Eric Hansen's \\"Orchid Fever\\" -- perhaps the beginning of my own orchid obsession!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous","review":"Saw adaptation. wanted to see the inspiration behind the movie and bought this book. It received positive editorial reviews comparing it even to a \\"midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\". Boy, was I dissappointed.This book was four parts repetitive description of orchids, history and repeated passages of why people seek them out. Next time, I'll pick up the encyclopedia instead. The best is that there is an addendum to the book. (Orlean interviewing Orlean) which was unneccessary, not useful and not good. This book is not good writing. We should remember why the screenwriter picked this book for a movie about writer's block....because this book says nothing, goes nowhere and is a waste of paper. Story could have been told in 50 pages....or a New Yorker article.I wanted to love the book. Was thoroughly dissappointed in the book and Orlean's writing.

I come from Poland and I think only people from Poland will buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and disappointing","review":"Unfortunately Miss Edyta let herself be lured by the world of cheesy tunes, wrote either for her or peformed by some other artists. I don't think she has much chance of conquering the Western markets with this unoriginal repertoire. For some reason her voice is not as excellent as it was the case on the earlier Polish record, 'Dotyk'. It seems to be dampened down, and lacks that unique 'colour' and variety we have heard before. The songs' monotonous tone definitely does not help her perfom to the best of her ability. Edyta, you can definitely do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Copycat","review":"Edyta was once a very good singer but this was so long ago that she has forgotten it herself. The songs on her international album are unoriginal and so is her interpretation, so much alike other singers in the West.

The basic premise is that a man who has discovered that he has terminal cancer while his wife is pregnant decides to make a series of tapes to leave behind for his child to get to know him.

I would definitely recommend this movie, but be prepared to shed a few tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life","review":"Bob and Gail Jones are expecting their first child, but Bob has been diagnosed with kidney cancer which will possibly take his life before his child is born. Heartbroken at the prospect of not ever getting to know his child, he decides to make a video about himself and his life so that his child will know him. This movie is one which really makes us sit back and evaluate our lives and our relationships with those we love. Michael Keaton does a superb performance in this movie. This is a movie should be watched every now and again just to remind us that life is too short for arguments and should be cherished. A must see movie, a very hard hitting tear jerker."},{"rating":"2","title":"tear jerker","review":"I've been looking for this DVD in the stores and couldn't find it. I like this story very much.

I agree wholeheartedly that our attitude is everything and we can find happiness even in the face of death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, thought provoking movie!","review":"This is not a typical feel good movie considering the subject matter. However, in my opinion, it can be a feel good movie because it really makes you think and re-evaluate what and who is important in your life. At least for me, everytime I watch it, I am reminded that the most important thing in my life is not my career, or money or material possessions, but the wonderful family that I have and the time that I get to spend with them. Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman are exceptional in this movie. It's a movie that everyone should see at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I bought this movie on the recommendation of a friend.

They could have done so much more and it just left me feeling completely unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, Enjoyable, and Enlightening","review":"This is an up-close and personal look at the life of a man battling cancer. This isn't your typical cancer story, however.

It is a 1/2 hour video of a guy talking about a few of Jesus' Miracles in brief. The Christian viewer with adequate scriptural scholarship already knows these stuff. For the non-Christian, not having read the accounts of miracles in the Gospels, the presentation makes no sense. The bottom line of this video is that the miracle behind the miracles is that Jesus didn't make a big deal of himself but glorified the Father.If the video was free I would have kept it, but for almost $10.00 I am sending it back.

The first section was sufficient enough with general content on webdesign, layout principles, and image formats. But then, when you arrived at the section regarding Photoshop's tools and how to use them, the real nuts and bolts of the textbook, the author just kind of blows everything at you all at once - like out of a cannon. The pages are filled with many bold-text terms and not much explanation on these terms. Secondly, the section on the layers palette- probably one of the most important tools of Photoshop- just a few pages of general terms with hardly no explanation of how to use the program. By the time I finished the palette section, I was totally muddled. So no, don't buy this book unless you are very experienced with Photoshop's tools and operations."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Don't waste your time or money.

As for the person stating that they ordered a generic set, there's simply no such thing. Every region has their own card designs. The fact that one set was received and not another does not, in any way, make playing a game, such as scopa, any different or more difficult, as its the same game no matter which cards you use.So if you discount those two statements and look at what the cards actually are, a deck of 40 cards, you'll be happy with what you get as Modiano makes a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, just what we wanted","review":"The cards were just what we were looking for, and seem to be of good quality.

A great watch, and should be required for business ethics classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie.","review":"Helps you understand how big corporate business use Americans and the greed that rules their lives no matter who they destroy.

So I was not able to use it for the purpose I desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time","review":"This really isn't a documentary; it's a propaganda film. Rather than interview a variety of people who know anything about what happend at Enron, the film spends the vast majority of time interviewing the two people who wrote the film. We get a lot of opinions and very little real information. This is the sort of propaganda film that the Nazis and Communists used to make. The film attempts to connect George W to Enron. Yes, there were connections to the Bush family but virtually all the mis-deeds committed by Enron were done while Clinton was President. If there was any failures by the regulators it was the Clinton administration that was responsible. The film makes no mention of the regulatory failures of the Clinton administration.If you want to find out the truth about what heppened at Enron, you won't find it in this film. But, if you want to see an anti-Bush, anti-free market film and don't care about the truth than this film is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty of a Film, Complete waste of time","review":"I brought this movie after reading all the positive reviews. But as usual it turned out be the usual hype. This movie tries to appeal to the female segments by using positively dressed female narrators who somehow are remotely related to the Enron story. This movie does not cover by any means what was Enron actually doing? What was Anderson doing? How did they inflate earnings? It tries to demonify skilling and Lay, by identifying their greed. Well what Harvard MBA is not in for the money? what corporation is not trying to whatever it takes to stay afloat? To sum up, this movie completely fails to explain what enron was doing and why was it bad? Any college educated person will find this movie a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Repetitive and Biased","review":"The content of this documentary (?) could easily fit in a 30-minute piece. There is an attempt to sensationalize things. For instance, they make a big fuss about the trips made by top execs to Baja, making a tenuous connection to the risk-taking culture at Enron. There is practically nothing of substance. For instance, one would like to know more details about the actual shady dealings that Enron went through, rather than a depiction of trading room banter. Very shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Could have been a seminal work on some of the most egregious robber-barons of the 1990's, but succumbed to a ridiculous partisanship characterized by heavy-handed Bush-bashing -- how tiresome (this even tho Kenny-Boy was head of Ann Richards's finance committee when Bush challenged her). Meanwhile, one of the documentary's great moralizers was investigations-target Bill Lerach, and one of the chief complainers was the since-recalled Gray Davis, who was so incompetent he couldn't sell beer on a troopship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assassination by Association","review":"I stopped watching this film. I expected to see an evenhanded documentary because of my interest in this situation. The film imputes that because the Bush family was friends with Ken Lay that they Bushes are criminals. This is pathetic character assassination by association. Tell me facts figures and scenarios that prove this. The ENRON employees would have had better insight into what was going on in their company. There certainly wasn't any whistle blowing. Why would the Bush family be responsible for the actions of ENRON? It was ridiculous. If you are going to make allegations that the Bush family are criminals, then provide details. This is just a smear campaign. This is not a documentary. This 'documentary' is liberal bias at its worst. I will pick up a copy of the book. I've heard the book is more balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infuriating!","review":"I'll admit, I'm not good at business and finance. The first half I was a little bored but it was interesting enough for me to keep watching.

And then I really started listening and became really disgusted. This is the dark side of Capitalism. Bush can say all he wants. He's involved in this mess. How involved I have no idea. I'm sure he has it covered up well.

Every profession has its fatal flaw, and greed is the primary one for business people. Since today's students tune into visual material, they would view some of this dvd with interest. I especially liked the thoughtful comments of the former employee who acknowledged that he had never asked \\"why?\\" Better to prepare young people just entering the workplace to ask some questions than to end up feeling bad later. Ethics don't have to be dry or even \\"good vs. evil\\". They can be as tangible as \\"how will I feel about myself at the end of...the day...my career...my life?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the fall of Enron--from a former employee","review":"If you were an Enron employee, as I was, you will cry watching this movie. It is sick with greed, manipulations and facts about no one minding the store. But, it is a good movie to watch to understand big business and corporations, and yes, their political agendas and their political friends. The fall of Enron encompassed many other big companies and their complicity is shown well in this movie. The reporters did a great job putting this very complicated situation into an understandable story. I recommend this movie no matter who you work for--it will help you protect yourself if in no other way but to always question what these companies are up to.

After a short stint of living off the grid in Maui I found this is currently not a practical option to divert a worst case scenario... this film has dramatically fueled my distrust of any altruistic motive of those in power and THANK GOD my Merrill broker did not allow me to invest, how did that happen given their high buy marks I will never know, she is retired and living in good conscience, after the films end I had no assurance this would be prevented through reverse legislation, so who knows what deals are going on this moment to further rape US citizens. sigh"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"The whole ENRON thing is messed up beyond all comprehension.

Ones who are out to attack the \\"Mormons\\" and those who are on a crusade to promote. With all of this biased authorship, it was refreshing to see Mr. Newell's book, LATTER DAYS. At first I was put off to the fact that he himself is a Latter Day Saint, but after 2 pages of reading, it was obvious that his intent was simply to inform the reader of the LDS faith, and its history. I was impressed and charmed by his unique and entertaining style. In all of my research and reading on the subject, I have never seen such a well done book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I found this book to accurately describe contemporary mormon beliefs (unlike other books that site early mormon sources from the 1850s and then claim that these sources represent what average mormons believe today). I was curious about what mormons thought about such controversial topics as polygamy, for example, and this book addresses the topic. I asked a mormon friend about several points in the book and was pleased that the book seemed to accurately describe my friend's beliefs.The title of the book is accurate--it is an \\"insider's\\" guide in the sense that it is written by a mormon convert. What you get is a concise, clear and accurate representation of mormon beliefs from a sincere mormon believer. It's a good read--I had a hard time putting the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Depiction of Reality","review":"I picked this book up at a baby-sitting job expecting it to be a fluffy sixth-grade chapter book. Yet it was much more. DeClements did a great job depicting Helen's challenges with a learning disability as she navigates sixth grade and finally finds some answers in the end. This book is great for teachers like myself because it allows us to see the impact the \\"little things\\" we choose to do or not to do can have on a student.

This book promptly was donated to the local thrift store."},{"rating":"2","title":"'My Dinner with Andre' meets Thomas Pynchon ?","review":"A light book on the surface - but when you're finished, it begs to be read again to make sure you picked up all the subtle nuances. The unorthodox 'plot' works well and the narrative is always crisp ( my only problem with the storytelling is that annoying habit 'serious' authors feel they must invoke these days of an overly conversant tone - phrases like 'you see' and 'shall I say' etc). Tom is kind of an everyman trying to figure out the daily game of life on immediate and philosophical levels. He is given the advantage of a bird's eye view (literally) of his world and doesn't waste the unique opportunity.I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something slightly different, but still accesible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking the novel to a new place","review":"Somehow I think the definitive novel is one that is free to say anything about anything as Antrim does here and in his other novels. The trick is( or the art is) if its enjoyable and interesting.

It seems perfect while being unlike any book one has ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batter up - this book is flat as a pancake!","review":"This is a novel of internal monologue and external dialogue experienced by a clinical psychologist as he meets his professional colleagues for brunch at a pancake house. An abridged version appeared in the New Yorker as a piece of short fiction - and that in itself ought to tell you something about the audience for which the novel is intended.Antrim is a darling of the NYT Review of Books, and this novel fits the formula to a T: a book about upscale, well-educated white people nattering on, in an unusual and diverting way, about the particular neuroses and life events and issues typical of that group.Nothing much gets said or done, and in the end you're left to contemplate how this sort of fiction is actually remarkably well symbolized by pancakes: light, sweet, fluffy, homogenous, mild in flavor, and probably bad for you, yet there's always a new way to prepare it.

It looked so cute, you push the lion head down and it plays \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" while everyone takes turns rolling the colored and number dice to determine how many spaces you move your character around the board. Then at any given moment the lion wakes up, pops his head up, and roars(which means you have to go back to a certain spot on the board)...which scares the daylights out of my daughter. She ran out the room and cries even when we ask her to play it with us. I also recently had my 3 year old nephew over a few days ago and he had the same reaction. So this game will be for sale at our next garage sale, because by the time my child grows out of the stage where this game will not scare her she'll be too old to enjoy the color and number matching movement around the board.

It is NOT ok - bloody coffin, vampire in the bathtub, eery ghosts flying around, mummy in the bed winking at visitors, skeleton jumping out at you from the closet, funeral music playing - gray, sinister looking pictures - going quite overboard for 6 year-olds.

It was just plain dumb. It has bland terrible dialog, they overdo the fake blood splatter, and the actors have no emotion in their voice. A man named Bill Loomis (who plays himself) is called Mr. Halloween because he runs a cheesy haunted house in this garage. He kidnaps teenagers and uses their body parts as props. Jill, played by Shannon Eastman, is probably the only worthy character, and that's not saying a lot. It is very stupid, but somewhat entertaining. Unless you're desperate for a bad movie, I wouldn't recommend MR. HALLOWEEN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Halloween","review":"There is a chill in the air and soon Halloween will be here again. Maybe that's why i've been digging out horror movies i've yet to watch. Mr. Halloween is probably the only independent horror film i've watched that is nearly two hours long. The story is pretty good and had lots of promise. Then again as i've said before no movie has a good synposis followed by overall, you'll be disappointed with this movie. Mr. Halloween suffers from poor acting and it moves at a very slow pace; it could have been cut down to the standard hour thirty, forty minutes. There is a few good kills and inside the haunted house was good. The ending confused me and I guess I must have missed a cruical part of the film because I was lost.

Most performances were great in my opinion - Ian and Desmond are clueless.

The legendary Robert Johnson, perhaps the greatest blues musician in the history of this country, is unseen and effectively unheard in this collage of generally mediocre performances by admirers and wannabes. In fact, the two weakest performances in the film are the opening and closing sequences. The only insight which comes through clearly here is the vast gulf in talent between Robert Johnson and his imitators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure drek","review":"This film missed the boat in so many ways. I will grant you that the sets are good, BUT the acting (a few exceptions), the directing, the scripting and the editing are uniformly baaaaaaaaad. Tom Skerrit and Mindy Cohn did the most with the little they were given, Jacqueline Bisset (Christine/Mrs. DeLuca), unfortunately, did not. The young leads lack the skills to do anything with their material. The whole film was much like watching 8 year olds putting on a play and thinking up their dialog as they went along.

When I received the bible the pages were stuck together by the gold page edging and they had to be separated which was a bit time consuming. One of the thumb index tabs was misplaced and I had to gently remove it so I could place it on the correct page. Other than that it's a fairly standard large print NIV red-letter bible with references. Fairly compact and light considering that it's a large print bible.

It's nice to see all these great songs come out on CD. You can never go wrong with this artist if you have any love at all for the earlier ska and rocksteady music of Jamaica. A better songwriter and singer would be hard to find, he is a unique voice and spirit. Like Bob Marley, Justin Hinds started recording as a teenager around 1963 back in the days of ska, and has maintained his artistic integrity right up through the present time. Unlike Marley, who had more commercial aspirations, I don't think Justin Hinds ever made a bad record. Certainly everything on this set is worthwhile, as is the other CD on Trojan, \\"Ska Uprising\\". His his later work in the 70s for reggae producer Jack Ruby is also crucial listening. Justin is still around and occasionally tours, if you ever get the chance to see him in person I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gun","review":"I purchased this airbrush after much research.

I have finally purchased it again, and it makes me smile when I spritz!Great fragrance, gets nothing but compliments."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love, I love love scent","review":"I really do love this perfume! I received so many compliments when I wear this perfume. I like to spray it directly on my skin. It is very citrusy but it has this real tame woodsy scent in the background. So hard to describe but it's now my signature scent. :) I wear it wherever I go, not just the summer time like most people. You have to try it for yourself. And I heard a lot of people describe closest as Dolce's Light Blue. I can agree with them on that but I think I love love lasts longer and had a lighter scent."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I really like this fragrance. It smells very clean and fresh. Everybody asks me what I am wearing and often confuse it with Light Blue of Dolce & Gabbana. Really happy with my purchase. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Love","review":"Can not beat the price for the quantity. I think it smells great, citrusy and light not to overbearing. Only con is it fades quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't smell like the first one I got.","review":"It doesn't smell like the first one i got.It smell different, the first one I got in chula vista store smell better, I don't know why, the package is the same....but smell different, I have the first bottle and I can compare...Please Amazon ask your supplyer...Was a valentine's gift for my wife, and she open it a month after that day, so I can't sent it back. Is a shame, I love this fragance.I will buy it again in the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Gift","review":"Wonderful gift to put on top of anything else you have purchased for your lovely lady. No matter who has been gifted with this item, the reviews are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfume you will enjoy wearing","review":"I bought this perfume few months ago and I enjoy wearing it since then. The price is great and I dont have to wait long for delivery. I got a lot of attention from my co worker and asking me where I got it.I surely recommend this to everybody who loves flowery and citrusy scent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love love.... not really","review":"It is an ok perfume. I smelt it and bought it but it is not my favorite. I got tired of it really fast, specially since it doesn't seem to be very unique. Smells too much like light blue, which I hate. Try Live in Love by Oscar de la Renta, it is a far better buy and smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced Album","review":"Whoever priced this product had their pockets lined with dollar signs. Kaur is my newest favorite singer. Based on her past work, I decided to pay what I thought was a rather high price for the Prem album. The sound is commercial and redundent. Not the ethereal quality I have come to expect from Snatam Kaur."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily relatable","review":"I loved every word of this book!!! Being a new mother myself, I found myself relating to so much and laughing and crying with the characters. Each character brought something to light for me; I think I may be a combination of all 4 women. Having a support system of friends during this emotional, wonderful, and scary time in your life is crucial and Jennifer Weiner did an excellent job representing those relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under estimated author","review":"Once again Jennifer Weiner, the author of Good In Bed and In Her Shoes has proven that she deserves to be placed among todays top women fiction authors with her newest release.Little Earthquakes is a entertaining trip through a year in the life of being a new mom with the help of four women from different backgrounds and lifestyles. With tears and laughter you will surely be able to see yourself in this book if you are a mother or a mother to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I Expected It To Be!","review":"I was counting down the days until this book was released. I went to my local bookstore Tuesday and after I couldn't find it on the floor, I lined up at the guest relations desk to see where it was located. As I approached the desk I spotted 2 boxes on the floor that read \\"Jennifer Weiner - Little Earthquakes\\". I begged the salesperson to let me buy one before they put them out and he did. As I walked away the 2 women that were behind me in the line were also lined up waiting for it!Jennifer Weiner is the best author in the world, in my humble opinion. I love each of her books and can't recommend them highly enough. I hope she writes many, many more and when she does I'll be standing in line on the day they're released, begging the salesperson to sale me one from the box.Go buy her books, everyone. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Clever","review":"This is the first Jennifer Weiner book that I've read - I thought it was really cute and clever with some really funny parts. The character \\"Becky\\" was especially hysterical. Since I don't have kids, I probably didn't appreciate the story as much as someone who's actually been a \\"new mom\\" --- But I still thought it was a really fun book. And based on this novel, I'm looking forward to reading another J. Weiner book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moms-to-be and new mommas must read!!!","review":"I just had a baby 4 months ago and the experience was not at all what i expected. This book goes through 4 different women's experiences as first time moms and somehow manages to cover almost every emotion both wonderful and aweful that a parent can have. I love this book. I feel that every woman no matter what her circumstances will be able to find herself in this book. I came to love every character (both male and female) and found myself relating to them and crying for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good motherhood book","review":"easy read. mothers can relate to any one of the different characters in the book. some parts made me cry only cuz u never want to imagine bad things happening to your children. very basic about human condition involving children n relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps of interest mainly to those in the Mommy Club","review":"This book disappointed me because I'm a big Jennifer Weiner fan. I guess it's because I'm not part of the Mommy set that this book didn't appeal to me.The writing and story are interesting enough, although at points the transitions between characters (some which are cliches, like the interfering mother-in-law) seemed a little awkward. I liked Weiner's other books much better because they were more original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weiner Does It Again!","review":"On 9/14, I was at my local Target before it even opened, axiously awaiting Jennifer Weiner's latest novel. I called out of work, got comfy on my couch, and read \\"Little Earthquakes\\" from cover to cover. I do not have children yet, but the fact that the story revolves around pregnant women did not deter me. As with \\"Good In Bed\\" & \\"In Her Shoes\\", Weiner has created a character in Becky that we fall in love with. You want to embrace her, become her friend. Kudos to Ms. Weiner for another winner!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are past childbearing years, it is a must not read","review":"I have read Good in Bed, and loved it, read In Her Shoes, and loved it, and totally thought that Little Earthquakes had to be written after Jennifer was in an earthquake and had brain damage. If I sound rude, I am not, I am just annoyed at the time spent waiting for her book to become less trite, less uninteresting, and less predictable. This is the first book that I actually threw away after I was done with it. I did not want to pass it on to anyone.The subject matter might be good for the generation having babies right now, but I am 44 and it bored me. I hope that Jennifer is not getting stale so soon. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entertainment!","review":"Like the title says, this book is pure and simple entertainment. Even if you're not pregnant/mom yet, it's a fun read. And, if you're way past that stage, you can still read it and reminisce the way things used to be. Either way, you get sucked into reading about the lives of 4 very different women, with atleast one thing in common. The story has been written in such an engaging and interesting way that it makes you want to go on reading and hope it never ends! Jennifer Weiner has a winner and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I read this a while ago and enjoyed it immensely. It's a story about women who are adjusting to having or not having kids. One of the characters is referred to as \\"Yoga Barbie\\" because of her blonde hair and perfect body, but she is struggling with her unemployed husband. Another woman is trying to get over the loss of her own baby, who died.The most memorable character is Becky, who is probably modeled on Weiner herself - a spunky, overweight woman who meets life head-on and has an answer for everything. Becky's accounts of meeting her husband, the early days of their relationship, and their sexual problems in the beginning, are tragicomic. Her skirmishes with her mother-in-law are also entertaining and the outcome is enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only marginally more interesting...","review":"Than an afternoon spent with any of my new-mom friends. What worked so well with her previous novels - the depth and complexity of relationships, the interesting and orignal elements of the plots, are completely missing here. It was a huge disappointment and I hope that Ms. Weiner's future books return to her roots - which were so promising.If I want to spend hours being a sounding board to a new mother with mixed feelings about her new role as nuturer/provider, there are any # of friends of mine I can call. But frankly, I'd rather put on some cute slingbacks and get my flirt on in a bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Weiner has written another fabulous story with interesting, relatable characters. She has another winner on her hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Earthquakes","review":"Very good, quick read. She always seems to capture something that any woman can relate to and make you feel \\"OK\\" about it. I wish I had read this when my kids were really little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"I got through the book, continually hoping for it to acknowledge the joy of motherhood. The joy was there occasionally, but it was too deeply buried in the hard parts of being a Mom. Plus, out of 5 husbands, 4 had issues. Where is the balance? This is not how I'd recount my children's early days, or the message I'd want to share with young women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderment!","review":"I loved this book!!!! it reminded me of sex in the city but with babies.... i am a mother of 3 with no life so i found myself envying these women who became and remained friends with their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gem!","review":"I loved this story. I enjoyed sharing these characters' first experiences with a newborn, from the joys and wonder of those first months to the difficulties of sleep deprivation and the strains it puts on a marriage. My daughter is 14 and this story brought me back to her early days - both the good memories and the bad. But most of all, because the tale is so honestly told, it helped me relive the miracle of my daughter's birth all over again. What a great story teller Jennifer Weiner is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a letdown","review":"I really enjoyed Jennifer Weiner's other two books, so I was looking forward to reading this one. What a letdown. I found all of the characters to be very one dimensional and whiny. Kelly was materialistic and her inability to talk to her husband was frustrating. Ayinde also seemed to lack the ability to talk to her husband and didn't seem to act like the strong woman her character was supposed to be. I felt for Lia's pain about losing her baby, but found her stalking a bit creepy. Becky, the most likable charchter of the book turned into a wimp when dealing with her mother in law and also made too many rules about her daughter. No boys and no tv for a baby? Get a grip! I had to stop reading many times just because the characters had become too annoying to continue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending was lacking","review":"Little Earthquakes was a very compelling read even for someone who doesn't have children. It was great to see the different relationship dynamics and the mysteries surrounding some of the characters. That being said, the ending was less than desirable and literally left me asking, Seriously that's how this ends. It was quite disappointing how it ended, there were just so much left unanswered that it almost undid the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Wanted to Read While Expecting","review":"I read this book two weeks before my due date. While perhaps the events are a sad part of life the last thing I needed to be reading about was how having a baby negatively effects your life and your relationship with your spouse. There was little emphasis on the positive.The fact that the main character's own child dies a tragic death at 10 weeks was sad to me. Having her stalk a pregnant woman and leave her mysterious gifts is creepy. The way that they became friends is completely unrealistic.Personally, I thought this book was entertaining in a mindless-fluff kind of way, but the characters and their relationships were too predictable, yet unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not uplifting","review":"I usually enjoy Jennifer Weiner books and even after reading some of the more negative reviews I decided to purchase this book as a nice read to unwind with after a long semester of law school. I was severely disappointed. The characters continuously complained about raising children- it was one big b!tch fest with an ending that left something to be desired. I would not recommend this book unless you are looking to feel better about how disappointed you are with the experience of having a child. If you want something fun and uplifting read Emily Giffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another sappy chick book","review":"I am a yet to be mother, and yet found something to relate to in each one of these characters. I enjoyed the writing style, where each character tells a piece of her story and ends up moving the novel along, month by month. Expertly done. This is the first book I've read by this author, but I will definitely look to read her past novels as a result. The story, centering around four women and their babies, is one every woman will be able to relate to and find a part of themselves in. This isn't a sappy chick book but relates on a deeper level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read","review":"Okay, maybe this isn't the greatest work of literary merit, but it is a dang enjoyable read which is more important in my book. As a father of two small boys lots of things hit home with me and I'm ashamed to say I saw more of myself that I would care to admit in the men of this story. The author does a marvelous job of getting the feel of parenthood on paper. Read this if you have kids or plan to anytime soon. And don't let yourself be fooled. This will happen to you. You're experience will not be a golden fairy tale jsut because you consider yourself special. This book, like parenthood, will show you you reality has nothing to do with sixteen people dumped in an island."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but still darn good.","review":"I read this third book of hers because I adored her other two books. And I'm not exactly the age for your average chick lit reader at almost 54, but that is just how appealing & entertaining Jennifer Weiner's books are. Overall, I would say Little Earthquakes is definitely worth the read but I enjoyed her other two: Good in Bed and In her Shoes, even moreso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This book is engaging from the first page. Great for new mothers, or older mothers who can look back and laugh. Good beach read. I look forward to reading more of Jennifer Weiner's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Earthquakes","review":"Jennifer Weiner gets better and better. This book is very funny and at the same time so sensitive to the characters. Once I started reading it, I could not put down. Any mother, any age, who reads this will relate and laugh to her various characters which she will identify with herself or someone else she knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this even get published?","review":"I have enjoyed Weiners first two books and did listen to an unabridged CD (on 12 cds). Well not quiet all 12, by the 11th I could take no more. This, as story telling goes ranks right up with Danielle Steele. All four women are frustrating idiots whom you would like to strangle or put over your knee. I found myself shouting at the CD! They were pitiful stereotypes, some even borrowing modern day scandal. Most events were catastrophized and never really brought to successful conclusions. Only Becky was mildly enjoyable and believable, yet even she continued to let her husband put his mother before her and their marriage at every turn. Kelly has a mental illness as well as being the most shallow woman in history and Lea is most self centered and immature. Stay away from this one. I'll think about trying her next book but doubt it.Tonya Liodos"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"I find this book extremely irritating. It seems contrived - like the author is striving to make the characters 'normal' and in reality who has a group of friends that includes a stunning newsreader with a famous husband and a hollywood actress. I don't get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got to be Kidding!","review":"I finished reading this book only because I paid my hard-earned money for it. As the mother of three children I thought it was totally unrealistic. what! they didn't have any other friends until they all met up with each other. All they did was whine! I didn't understand why they couldn't talk about their feelings with their HUSBANDS.....I thought they were all total air heads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, even with the VERY heartbreaking","review":"I loved this book! I must say that now I have to read everything by Jennifer Weiner. Great story, and true to what early motherhood is like. Could relate to all characters.The parts about Caleb are so hard to read. I have 2 friends that got to that part of the book and couldn't finish. I felt like I was physically in pain reading about the loss of a baby. Jennifer Weiner described it so real.Great read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"This book had great potential and at first I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, the characters never developed and by the end I was sick and tired of their whining. The characters were very stereotypical and while much was made of the trials of motherhood, the author never really showed us the joys that make it all worthwhile. I'm a working mom who's also experienced the pain of losing a baby and I was extremely disappointed in the storyline for Lia. There was a better story there than the one that was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"no tremor","review":"I couldn't even finish this novel, which was poorly written and devoid of charm and interest. Jennifer Weiner is capable of much better, as her other novels prove. I think that she wrote this when she was sleep-deprived, in the months following the birth of her first baby, and her editor was on auto-pilot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun book.","review":"This was such a fun book to read. I finished it over a rainy weekend. The characters were well-drawn, sympathetic and human. Weiner's descriptions of new motherhood made me long for the days when my children were babies. The story revolves around a circle of new mothers, all quite different in situation and background, who meet in a prenatal yoga class. There's a wealthy professional woman of color, a Jewish restauranteur who has problems with a nosy mother-in-law, the blonde overachiever, and a forlorn actress with major heartache. If you want to read a tale that will keep you engrossed, well written, and fun, this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Unless you are an avid reader, and you are like me and your reading time is limited, I'd say don't bother this one. I was looking for a good chick lit type summer read, and a new mom myself thought this one looked good. I'm surprised at all the good reviews, etc. In my opinion this one just isn't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but a bit contrived","review":"I enjoyed this book, as I do with all of Jennifer Weiner's work. It made for very pleasant reading. It is not the book for you if you are looking for a deep read or anything thought provoking. But if you enjoy reading about a circle of friends and their trials and tribulations you will enjoy this book. I particularly liked the ending and thought it was the sweetest, and best written, part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for mommies and future mommies","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Amazingly, each character was likable and the story kept you on your toes. I have recommended the book to mothers and aspiring mothers and will continue to. It was my first of Jennier Weiners books but I have been prompted to read many more after enjoying this one so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Depressing","review":"Maybe it has to do with the fact that I am not a mother but a 25 year old trying to get on her feet, but I did not find this book to have many redeeming qualities. The characters were stereotypical, predictable, and tiring. The only half-way memorable one is Becky. There is no plot besides \\"let's see how miserable we can make motherhood out to be.\\" After reading this book, I am put off by the idea of becoming a mother. Like I said, maybe you have to be a mother to enjoy - that's the only reason I can come up with for other numerous rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Others","review":"If you have just had a child or are about to, then this it he chick-lit for you.The whole of this story revolves strongly around child baring and birthing. So, much so that the characters are over shadowed by it to the point that if you aren't actually experiencing this in your own life, you will probably not like the book. Just because you are going through something in your personal life doesn't mean that the general population wants to read about it.Little Earthquakes is as the title suggests. Nothing special and wont shake your world or even move you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I really did not enjoy this book at all. I think it was poorly written, contrived and unrealistic, very difficult to finish it. This was the first time I read a book by this author and probably the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading an article in People magazine","review":"I really have enjoyed Ms. Weiner's books, and I volunteer at a library, so I thought I'd try this. The author is usually charming, witty and perceptive. I felt the author was similar to her characters-in need of a nap. Wow- I felt that if this was her first book, I never would have returned-we have all read those books! Who would publish such a lackluster book?Repetition- did she think her readers were too drowsy to remember what she'd told us two chapters earlier.I know this book was written quite a while ago, but has left such a bad taste in my mouth , that I am hesitant to pick up Ms. Weiner's future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor and realism... all in one book!","review":"This is the first time I read any of Jennifer Weiner's books and it was a good enough experience that I'll probably read more. I loved the way she covered the real story of first-time motherhood... the sleepness nights, fear of failing to do everything right and the worries over returning to work. Incorporating humor (like the part when one of the mothers tells her mother-in-law what she really thinks), just makes it a good read.I also like how the story kind of resolves itself at the end and doesn't leave the reader guessing about the ending. LITTLE EARTHQUAKES might not be \\"classical literature\\" but it has a good story and I was compelled to read it quickly. I'd definately recommend it to my friends who have children. I'm not sure if someone without children would really understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to finish this book and get it over with","review":"One-dimensional, stereotypical characters. Too many pop culture references used for description--if you don't know the reference, the description means nothing. I didn't think the dialogue was realistic either. And many of the women in the book were just whiners.I agree with another reviewer in that seems to view new parenthood as something that makes the Earth shift--causes little earthquakes--as a bad thing. Maybe the author had this experience and other Moms feel overwhelmed but I thought it was a bit overstated. The women's relationship seemed forced too. Put this in the same category as a bad Movie of the Week on TV.I couldn't wait to get to the last CD of this audiobook. . .and move on to a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged me back to some awful times","review":"Although I have loved some other titles by this author, I did not enjoy this book. I agree, its fairly well-written. However, the details of the agonizing days of dealing with a newborn are something I would like to forget. This book forces you to relive those awful moments (why won't my baby nurse? How can I avoid having post-baby sex? Will I ever get a full nights' sleep again? etc.) This might be a good book for someone who is closer to those days, but my kids are 10 and 14. I've moved on, happily."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed...","review":"I read Good In Bed and In Her Shoes, and loved them both. The thing that stood out to me the most was how relatable Jennifer Weiner's characters were. She managed to grab your interest while increasing your sympathy for everyone. I was looking forward to Little Earthquakes, but found the book falling short. No character really stood out to me, the story ended up being a snooze fest and I almost ended up in sugar shock with all the unecessary sappiness. After forcing myself to finish it, I was left with an overwhelming sense of \\"who cares?\\" Not her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even for the single too!","review":"\\"Little Earthquakes\\" may seem like a book that only new mothers could enjoy. But even the single gal will be able to connect with the beauty of frienship in this book. One of the few chick lit books that have depth and warmth to it while still being an entertaining read. So you must pick this book up even if you have never had a child but who has a friend or friends that seems like a sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait","review":"This book got lost in the mail twice while enroute from Amazon. I could hardly wait! When I finally got it, I tore through it and realized that it was well worth the wait.As usual, Ms. Weiner's characterization is superb and the characters feel like people who you have known personally for a brief stint.\\"Good in Bed\\" was my first exposure to this wonderful author and I soon read \\"In Her Shoes\\" after that. I always thought they would make great movies because of how vivid the characters and stories were. I recently found out that HBO is making \\"Good in Bed\\" into a show and when I was at the movies a week ago, I saw a preview for \\"In Her Shoes\\"!!! It's starring Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette. I'm very excited for both the film and show (although I think HBO will do a better job w/ the show) and I cannot wait for Ms. Weiner's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting read!","review":"I picked this book up after reading a few books that were anything but page turners. This one definitely exceeded my expectations! The stories about the 4 woman are all relatable in different ways: funny, sad, embarassing, heart breaking, triumphant! I loved how they were all intertwined in interesting ways. The characters are unlikely women to form such a bond, but they do, and it is great. I enjoyed the way the story was told, from all 4 points of view, it made for fresh starts and refreshing narrative. I think anyone who likes chick lit would enjoy this one! Much better than the run of the mill single girl surviving in the city type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio CD Review","review":"I listened to the Audio CD of this book and was pleasantly surprised. I thought it might be just another mindless \\"chick lit\\" book (which I enjoy sometimes also), but it delivered more. The characters were well-developed, and the plot moved along nicely.I found that I didn't want my commute to end some days when I was listening to the CDs, and that's always a good sign! I often wanted to find out what would happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, Heartwarming Read","review":"Weiner does it again with Little Earthquakes. This book follows four women from very different walks of life and their journey through motherhood. One great aspect of this book is that it doesn't just take you through their growing pains as new mothers, but you see how they find themselves and learn to grow and compromise through the events and through each other. The characters and plot are so well developedthat you find yourself becoming angry, sad, and happy right along with them. Although it's hard to agree with the way Weiner had her character's deal with some of the situations, that just develops the characters even more. It also forces you to look at it from a different perspective than you may have if you were in their position, which is another aspect of a good book. Witty, heartwarming, and sad all at once, this is a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two translations are better than one.","review":"Pushkin Threefold is so named because each of the poems featured is presented three times: in metric translation, literal translation, and in Russian. It's a wonderful work because, barring actual fluency in Russian, comparing multiple translations is the closest English-speakers can get to the meaning of the original poems. It loses a star only because some of the poems have been better translated elsewhere. However, it maintains four stars because I've never found any single book which contained _all_ the best translations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Druidry???????","review":"Druidry and Taort are not the same thing. No where on the cover of this book does it say anything about Tarot. Are you sure you have the right book in the right place? Druidry suggests that it deals with an ancient religion and contemporary practice with Cletic roots. Tarot is the art of divination, through the use of cards, historically spread across the European continent, and contemporarily world-wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madagascar","review":"The photography on this dvd is fabulous.

A great documentary. I have watched this over and over and every time I see something I hadn't noticed before. And when you see that it's narrated by David Attenborough, you know you can't go wrong. He's literally the best narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASN'T as pictured - *all* red, picture is fixed now.","review":"This item is not as pictured, and amazon rep's are clueless as to how I can actually get the item that's pictured.

But I chose it for the wrong reason. This bassinet has a rocking feature but you must rock it your self, which can become extremely tiring. The music feature is hilarious...I never play it for my son. It is also extremely inconvenient at night to pick up the baby from the bed...I should have purchased a co-sleeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I must say the bassinet looks just as good (if not better) in \\"real life\\" as it does in the picture. I have it all set up waiting for baby to arrive. I love the classy look of this bassinet (not too frilly and works for either sex) and it looks great in our bedroom. The onlt complaint I have so far is putting it together. For the most part, the directions are very helpful and things go together easily. However, when you get to the wheels, be prepared. The don't just \\"snap in\\" like they are suppossed to. We had to wrap a wash cloth around them and actually hammer the things in. But once you get it together, it's cutness makes you forget about those pain in the butt wheels! Hopefully baby will like it as much as mom does! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy with Functionality","review":"This bassinet looks great, but is totally unsafe. I wake up every night with my son having moved to the side of the bassinet with his face burried or almost burried in the side. We have the rocker locks on and they do not prevent the cradle from rocking at all, so when he is in there it tilts to either side with barely any force. I am very displeased that this expensive bassinet would have such a dangerous and faulty feature! My son is only 3 weeks old and almost manages to turn over on his own when he is in the bassinet. If you want the security of knowing your baby is safe while you sleep ... DON'T BUY THIS BASSINET!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSAFE - Locking device DOES NOT work","review":"We bought this bassinet because we really liked the way it looked and it had excellent reviews. We did not realize that the cradle portion still rocked a good two inches to each side (when in the locked position) until we brought our daughter home from the hospital. She likes to roll onto her side and the first night that we put her in it, the fact that she moved to her side put it off balance and she rolled face first into the side of the bassinet. We returned the bassinet to the store and they accepted it back once we explained what had happened. This bassinet may be cute but it is not safe...especially if your newborn is very active."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only ones sleeping in here are the cats!","review":"I loved this design because it matched our furniture, was sweet looking, but not girly, and was made well. The day we brought our son home, he would sleep anywhere but the bassinet. He'd sleep on the changing table of the pack-n-play with no trouble, but the bassinet would send him into hysterics. I think the fact that it never fully locked, and would continue to shift made him uneasy. As others have mentioned, cleaning this is a real pain. I have not even been able to figure out how to remove the fabric on the canopy to clean. My baby spent his 1st 3 months sleeping in his Papasan instead of the bassinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I bought this bassinet because I liked the way it looked. Like the other reviewers have said the music is HORRIBLE and yes, it rocks, as long as you are rocking it. Also, the matteress pad is VERY thin and standard bassinet pads do not fit in this bassinet.It is also very small. If you have a large baby, I don't think they will fit in it for 4 months.I had no problem ordering extra sheets from the company but really, it would be nice if they would include extra sheets with the bassinet from the beginning.With all that is wrong with this bassinet, I still like it well enough and kept it around for baby number 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service and difficult to obtain sheets!","review":"My mother bought this bassinet for us 4 months prior to my due date. When I assembled it, I noticed a piece of hardware missing. So I called customer service to get the missing part. They said they would have to send a whole new hardware pack and they were out of stock and would take 2-4 weeks. That was 6 weeks ago, and my baby is due in 1 week. I also ordered replacement sheets and they also were on backorder; I still have not received them after a month or more, and so I only have one sheet that I can use for the bassinet when my baby comes home from the hospital. It does NOT take standard bassinet sheets or crib sheets. I would not buy this product again because of these inconveniences!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SLEEP TIGHT DONT LET THE BED BUGS BITE","review":"PARENTS BEWARE.

It is cute to look at but thats about it. It does not rock automatically, so twisting in bed trying to rock it back and forth was torture (esp. if you had a c-sec). We had our baby swaddled alot in the beginning and she would roll to one side with her face smooshed against the padding. She would also freak when she was on her back and it would rock slightly-even though it was locked (I think she felt like she was falling-very common w/newborns)also, the music is super distorted and scratchy.Save your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bassinet!","review":"This is a very nice bassinet. Larger than many out there so you get more use out of it. It goes well in a house as a nice piece of furniture. I liked that I could roll it from room to room. I parked it next t my bed and rocked baby back to sleep without getting up many times at night. The mattress it comes with is too thin so I got an organic one at BBRUS that fit perfectly. Not sure why, but all bassinets seem to come with flimsy thin mattresses. Safety perhaps? Or just being cheap 5 don;t know. I loved it so much I got it again when we got pregnant the second time. Was sorry when they outgrew it. I think they are very sturdy and can stay in there well past 15 pounds, but that they say that so they are not responsible. All bassinets (even they pack n plays) say 15 pounds as the limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Our grandparents purchased this item for our second child since we borrowed a bassinet for our first. We love this bassinet. It wasnt the easiest thing to put together, lol. Only prob we had putting it together was the wheels had to be hammered in. Better tight than loose though. Reviews were right about the music. The music could be A LOT better but I wont use it anyways. Not sure why people said it wasnt sturdy. Its a real sturdy bassinet. They must not have tightened the screws or something for it to have been the way they described it. All in all Im really pleased with this item. Would recommend it to others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Night Sleep Tight Don't Let the Bed Bugs Bite","review":"My sister was the recipient of the this bassinet. One day she saw a bug on the bedding. When she killed the bug alot of blood came out. When she lifted up the mattress she found a nest of bugs hiddden in the crevices of the bassinet. We had no idea that sleeping in the bassinet with my niece were bedbugs.We called BabiesRus and they were not suprised. They said that the bedbugs probally got into the shipping from the manufactuer. She asked for a refund and was told to call Eddie Bauer. Eddie Bauer said they would replace the bedding. Why would anyone in their right mind want a replacement?I just wanted the parents to be aware. Bedbugs do in fact bite. They feed off of blood. So be careful. Be very very careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not worth it","review":"I picked this bassinet for all the wrong reasons. It was pretty and looked sturdy. My daughter hated sleeping in it. I could never find sheets that fit it and the music stopped playing after a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing part","review":"We purchased the bassinet a 3 weeks prior to our baby's arrival. When we put the bassinet together we realized that it was missing a lock to keep the bassinet from rocking. Babies R us told us to contact the manufacturer for the part. The manufacturer said that there would be a 5 week delay in getting the part to us. 3 and 1/2 months later, we still have not recieved the lock. We called 4 times and the representatives said they could not do anything about it because it was on back order. Their manual says do not use the bassinet if any parts are missing. They seemed to not care about this statement because no matter how many times I have called they have made no attempt to get me the part like they keep saying they would. I cannot place my baby in the bassinet without her rolling to one side which can cause possible suffication and that is because she is only 7 lbs. Good luck if you have to deal with Babies R us or Customer Relations department for Eddie Bauer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking Device","review":"My husband and I are expecting our 4th child in December. I was looking forward to adding this bassinet to our registry, but after reading the reviews, I am very concerned about this locking device which is supposed to keep it from swaying. Some of your customers were not happy with the device at all. It was mentioned as being \\"unsafe\\" by a nurse which resulted in the parents' returning it to the store. I'm wondering why hasn't it been recalled if it is indeed \\"unsafe\\"??? Also, what is the deal with all of the missing parts? I certainly don't want to go through that. Overall, it seems like the majority loved it, however, I'm still too nervous about getting it under those conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hates it","review":"We agree with the prior reviewers that this bassinet does not lock. If you have a wiggly baby, like ours, your baby will end up crammed against the side and screaming. We borrowed this bassinet from friends and their baby also refused to sleep in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for....","review":"This is a really great bassinet...for a boy or girl! It seemed like all the other bassinets were either too frilly for my baby boy, or too cheaply made. This one took care of both problems...it's very neutral in color(which matches just about anything) and it's a very simple, practical design. It's very sturdy and well made. It's also fairly easy to assemble...it took me an hour and a half to assemble it myself(at 7 months pregnant)and I didn't have any problems. The only thing I wish it had was a vibrating feature. I'd also recommend ironing it first because it does get very wrinkled."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, horrible customer service","review":"I gave this bassinet a 1 star rating since the customer service at the company who manufactures this bassnet is simply horrible. I ordered sheets to fit the mattress 4 MONTHS AGO. they originally told me it would take 2-4 weeks. It is just outrageous. They keep telling me they will be here is about 1 week. Of course, this was many months ago. I keep calling and they have no explanation. Don't buy this product because the customer service is terrible. the number is 1-800-544-1198. Call and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Bassinet if you got the screws","review":"I chose this item and selected to be on my register. I received this bassinet for my newborn son three weeks after he was born. It was not mentioned in the description that shipping will take such a long time. In addition, when I set all the parts for bassinet to be built all the screws were missing. I called the manufacturer right away. They promised me that the screws will be here in 7-10 business days. My son is eight weeks now and I still have not recieved any screws. After speaking to manufacturer sales department I was told that the screws were backordered and that I will take another 10-14 days to received them. Hmmmm...At that time my son will be three months old and I will not be able to put him into bassinet for safety reasons..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS - Please do not sell/buy","review":"The bassinet has a faulty design and the top 2 screws supporting the bassinet often come loose with movement and fall into the basinett, which can result in serious injuries to the baby. We are not quite sure if the whole thing can just collapse (with the baby in it) when the screws become loose, but we are not about to find out.After finding the screws in the bassinet a couple of times, we went out and bought another by a more responsible manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one would sleep in it.","review":"Neither my neice, nephew, or daughter would sleep in this bassinet. They would all sleep anywhere, anytime, EXCEPT in the Eddie Bauer bassinet. Other cons: there is no way to keep the bassinet from rocking and the music box is terrible quality. Also, I couldn't find sheets to fit this matress anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will keep for my next one","review":"Really love this bassinet. We have the one in all white, but it's the exact same thing. Used it exclusively for our daughter to sleep in until she was about 6 weeks and then changed to the crib. I know it seems silly to use something like this for 6 weeks only but I thought it was indispensible. You can roll it room to room wherever you are so that baby isn't far from you, and store all her clothing and diapers in the shelf underneath it so that all baby things are in one place until you are more comfortable using the nursery, changing table, etc. The crib just seemed too huge for such a tiny baby. We love this bassinet. Very well made and easy to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you value your baby, do not buy","review":"I bought this bassinet and had to return it because my daughter weighed over 9lbs at birth and her weight caused it to rock. This resulted in her face being up against the slats. We feared she would suffocate and had to be constantly moving her from against the sides. She got black and blue bruises on her cheeks from pressing her face against the sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 2 cents!!!!!","review":"This bassinet....doesn't rock, the screws fall out..it is unsafe...especially with little toddlers around, when they try to peek in at the baby the whole bassinets swings...NOT WORTH 2 CENTS (let alone $130.00)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I received the Eddie Bauer Bassinet as a shower gift. It was easy to put together (I did it myself at 8 months). Since the mattress was thin we also received an additional mattress for the bassinet. The storage space at the bottom is great and the classic look of the bassinet is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but Poor Design -- Hurt Baby!","review":"This was the first time I heard my baby's \\"Ouch! I really hurt myself\\" cry: in the Eddie Bauer bassinett. It's pretty, but what's the use of having something pretty if it doesn't serve it's purpose -- to rock baby to sleep. And especially if it hurts baby? As soon as my baby turned her head to the side, the crib shifted causing the side of her head to slam into the metal slats. Ouch! That's when I realized, there's NO PADDING! I know there is a locking mechanism. But let's face it, babies need to be rocked. That's the reason I bought a bassinett that rocks. Why would they make something that rocks, with no padding? ... As a makeshift solution, I made my own \\"bumpers\\" out of 4 small mattress pads folded to act as cushions in front of the metal slats. But I think the company could have just put bumpers in the crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"A peice of Junk","review":"All I have to say is don't waste your money our babykept rolling in it and the music was annoying. Noow we use it to store his clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is unsafe!","review":"My sister purchased the bassinet for my son when he was newborn. I found him, more than once, in the middle of the night, having rolled into the corner of the bassinet with the cradle on a tilt and his face buried between the \\"mattress\\" which is not much of a mattress, and the side of the bassinet.Then I found that the screws that keep the bassinet attached to the frame unscrew after rocking for a while. More than once I have found the screws in the bassinet, which is a choking hazard, but the bassinet was also completely detached from the frame creating a fall hazard.This is a beautiful piece of baby furniture, but not worth the safety risks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S SOOOO CUTE......... BUT DANGEROUS!!!","review":"OK.... Little babies have fits anywhere they lay.. especially when they are hungry and with my baby she pushes her self around in a cirlcle when she has a fit. Although, she sleeps right next to our bed one night she had a fit and her head got stuck on the little itty bitty bar on the side of her bassinet and she screamed so loud it was a mothers worse nightmare. I picked her up and felt the top of her head and it was dented in and I freaked out, it ended up a bump and thank god it went away... but if you still must buy this product after reading this I suggest you put thick cardboard in between the bar and the fabric.Ohh ya and to other reviews my baby was only 2 (two) months old when it happened and 21 that's (twenty-one inches) when it happened. My baby it just a very active baby. (smile)Keep your rude comments about other's babies to yourself. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good, Works Terrible","review":"My husband bought this because it matched our room but other than looking good, it is not worth the money. It does not rock by itself. The one and only sheet it comes with is more like vinal than cloth and the music is horrible. When I tried to contact their customer service with questions I couldn't get ahold of anyone. My suggestion is that you find a different bedding option."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I thought that this would have been a rocker that rocks itself, and it is not. This is too small, so you would not get too much use out of it. You are better off getting the pack and play. I used this for around 4 wks if that long, and had to put the baby in the bed until i got the pack and play. Totally waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks...............","review":"I loved the look of this bassinet at first sight. Having my first baby I wanted something that looked good and would last through another pregnancy. The under storage basket is great!!! That's about the only thing. The \\"Rocking\\" bassinet doesn't rock unless you stand there and rock it yourself. The music is not the best. Worst of all is the durability of the bassinet. Pushing the bassinet from room to room really wore on the wood. We had to tighten the bolts several times within the first month. I was so disappointed with this item that we only used it for the first month. Get the Travel Lite Crib by Graco - it's much better and you will get much more use out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Bassinet","review":"We bought this bassinet for our baby boy. It is very easy to move from room to room, and I love the storage underneath. I did find the mattress pad too thin, but purchased a thicker one along with sheets to fit nicely.

Mobsters, sex slave trade, and most of all good ole' country cuisine make Prime Cut a real winner. The photography is beatiful, the direction very cunning, and the performances terrific. A real oddity in some ways, but a great twisted ride for those willing to take the chance on on older film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Sunlit Noir","review":"I saw this film when it came out in theaters way back when. I didn't remember much of it except the character Weinie's attempted stabbing of Nick (Lee Marvin) with...well, you gotta see it. Seeing it again makes me appreciate what a wacky, goofball take this is on film noir (only in bright sunlight). All along the way there are quirky touches that make this film more memorable than it should have been for me the first time I saw it. Just one thing as a for instance: the hitmen drive from Chicago to Kansas City and we see them just sitting in the back of the car for pretty much the whole drive while the music (by Lalo Schrifrin) is pulsing and insistant. The juxtaposition struck me funny after I thought about it. This is a 70's film definitely worth seeing. Also, as an aside, Sissy Spacek looks great naked. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldy but Goody","review":"This a classic with great acting and some light nudity that was well before its time. Worth a watch or two just so you can brag about having seen it.

Lee Marvin, Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson were three of the toughest MFers ever on screen. While Prime Cut's not on the same level as Point Blank, it's still a tremendous amount of fun. Lee Marvin delivers his lines with the coolness of McQueen and toughness of Bronson. There's plenty of violence, a slaughterhouse where girls are sold like cattle, and Gene Hackman plays a character named Mary Ann. Now if Rolling Thunder could just get a decent DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Favorite","review":"As a teenager of the 70's, my family used to attend movies together and we would often go to the latest John Wayne movie. Well, one double feature later we were watching Prime Cut. We were captured by the grittiness and good ol' boy syndrome of this film. The first part caused my family to give up hot dogs for about 10 years!!!! The action was so fascinating, for that time period, that you found yourself running across that wheat field with Marvin & Sissy. And Violet's nickels, the part they always cut out of TV showings. I know they tried to put out a series after the film, with Lawrence Luckinbill (Mr. Lucy Arnez)as the lead character, but it never really caught on. But we loved it then and we love it now. Hope you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prime Dumb!!!","review":"I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like \\"Prime Cut\\". You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters.

Anyway, in spite of the big time actors you can forget the plot which involves white slavery and some other stuff, who cares.We got two scenes here worth a snip. The first is a county fair style hog contest, only with mobsters replacing the 4-H'rs and drugged out nubile starlets replacing the pork. Oh, did I mention they're nekkid? Straw pens and everything. I'm not going to speculate what the straw is for.The main draw is an extended scene with Sissy Spacek showing her Janet Jackson's, mainly beneath a see-through dress that Lee (unaccountably) takes her out to dinner in. OK, Ms. Spacek has showed them before, or rather after, but they never looked better than this, a real pervy lolly type feel.That's it, one and half stars for the nudity, and a 1/2 star bonus for the FBF (famous bosom factor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !","review":"Mr. Dickerson is extremely talented in all areas of the gospel music industry,as far as writing,recording,publishing,and directing.He is most definitely under rated in his field !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in the microwave","review":"At first, I was very pleased with the appearance of the bowls.

So far, at least half the bowls have one or two chips along the edges, creating a convenient way to slice open your fingers.We're not rough, careless people, and no one is thrashing these around... they're just either cheap or poorly designed.

Domingo's voice is pumped up electronically as if that were even faintly necessary, and the orchestrations are loud and annoying.Looking at the stills from the film (TV show?) which I have never seen, in the booklet, I can't help but wonder what any of this loud modern pop music has to do with the elegant costuming and reconstruction of 19th century life.This is bad !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alborada - Placido's or Soap Opera Soundtrack?","review":"Totally disapointed, the novela has stunning and beautiful melodies that are not included in this CD (I'm so mad), what is doing the others Placido's songs in this CD anyways?

When putting this stand together do NOT tighten the screws until all the outside pieces are on because if you do the last piece (front one) will not fit. It took forever to try and figure out the issue. While you are screwing in the screws someone else will have to hold the rest of the stand so it doesn't keep falling apart (because the screws weren't tight).

I looked in the box over and over again and also got up a few times to look around Me. Nothing. So I decided to look for the contact number. I read over the return policy it as for only 60 days.

I would recommend ever winsome wood item I have bought, except this table. I bought two of these thinking they would be perfect for accent tables with a bit of storage in my dining area. They do look good.The material is cheaper than other winsome wood product I have bought. One piece was chipped slight where the screw hole was. No big deal I thought. When I screwed in the piece the chip enlarge into a giant split. I used some epoxy to hold the piece together, but that only happened because the material was cheap. The sides were cheap composite wood only a little sturdier than cardboard. The front and back seemed to be wood, but with the splitting I am not so sure.The second one had no major fault like the chipped item, but it just seemed cheaper and easier to break than all they rest of their products. I own 12 winsome wood items overall, and these two are the only ones I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well for light use","review":"Bought this for our guest room. I wasn't expecting much for the price, and I certainly got what I paid for. It looks nice enough, the finish is a bit off on the front, there's a cloudy white haze over most of the door which won't polish off, but not a big deal. It is verrrry flimsy, I assembled it in our living room and was concerned it might fall to pieces when I carried it to the guest room (it didn't). Some of the holes are too shallow, and quite frankly I was afraid to take a drill to it. It looks nice in the room and while it isn't wobbly, you wouldn't want to put your weight on it or anything. It's holding an ihome, lamp, and a book or two without a problem and will work well for light use in our guest room. I would definitely look for something a little more solid if you need an end table for daily use.

Took about 15 minutes to put together. The only (and I mean only) complaint I have about it is that one or two of the little rubber covers/plugs that are supposed to fill the holes where the screws are didn't quite fit.

I wasn't expecting such poor quality from Amazon retail. The wood had split on the top of the back piece, however I was still able to build the nightstand. It was a two person job to build, someone to hold the pieces together while the other screwed pieces together. It feels a bit flimsy, but I put it against the wall, so hopefully it wont break on me anytime soon. It serves it purpose though of sitting next to my bed with my lamp on it.

When I opened the packaging, several of the pieces has nicks and dings in them that looked like they'd been covered up already by some cheap filler and the front-facing piece even had a very large stain of some sort on the door that couldn't be wiped away.

The only problem is that one of the two end tables came without hardware so I had to call the manufacturer. They sent it without a problem. My bigger challenge was Amazon customer service (such a shame given they're usually fabulous!) They said I'd have to return the whole end table and couldn't coordinate sending me the hardware.

However, I needed 2 black end tables w/a classic look for not a lot of money, so I took a chance. It may be possible that the negative reviewers received a bad batch, because mine had no odor. They were exactly what I needed. I'm a 32 year old woman w/average assembly skills, and the table took 15 minutes to put together. It's one of the easiest I've ever dealt with, and I've assembled a lot of furniture over the years. Instructions were easy to understand, all parts were included (you'll need a screwdriver) and nothing was damaged. They seem very sturdy to me, though, I'll only be putting small lamps on top and some books on the bottom shelf.

They ARE a bit hard to put together by yourself and one of the two I purchased had either been damaged in shipping or came off the assembly line a bit rough because there were scratches here and there that exposed the natural wood coloring but luckily I bought them in Black so I just ran a permanent marker over those spots so now you can't see them!

It came nicely wrapped in a box but when I took the pieces out,one of the slates was broken so I used wood glue.

Then I put the front on and the front doesn't match up on one side (you can see when the crossbar should go into the up and down leg but they don't meet together all the way. I wanted to use wood glue but I didn't have a clamp to hold it together long enough! This was a nightmare.

Bottom line...not worth your $39"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly flimsy","review":"This looked a >lot< nicer in the pictures. What we received was a thin, floppy piece of furniture that barely holds together. The thickness of the sides, door, and bottom are less than 1/4\\". The overall size is smaller than the listed dimensions, as well, which was important to me. Most of the pieces slide a little even when screwed in tightly. The caps to cover the screw holes pop out immediately, so we will probably have to glue them in. It even wobbles when placed on a linoleum floor! I'm afraid to press on any part of it for fear it will snap. The only reason I don't return it is that we purchased it to convert into a hidden cat litter box. I comfort myself with the thought that my cat will likely have no reason to put pressure on it.I would NOT recommend this to anyone. $50 is too steep for how cheap this end table is.

She was able to reach her tough students and make connections with them that \\"the system\\" had written off. Much as people would like to deny it, there is racism in our schools. If given a chance, I think that all kids can succeed. It's the stereotypes and told that you're stupid that brings a lot of these kids down. Poverty and their domestic situations don't help in the least either. Erin saw through everything and at such a young age! I believe it's people like her that truly change the world for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda boring","review":"This book is okay. I wish Erin didn't portray herself so perfectly all the time. She always does the right thing to an annoying extent.

Can't really keep track of every one of their collections, compilation, live recordings, etc. Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed what I'm hearing on 'Recurring'. Couple of the songs I thought stood out the most include the \\"Why Couldn't I See\\", \\"Set Me Free / I Got The Key\\", the catchy \\"When Tomorrow Hits\\" and the happening \\"Feeling Just Fine (Head Full Of Sh**)\\". A couple of other worthy Spacemen 3 releases, I think most fans would get a lot out of are 'Dreamweapon' and 'Taking Drugs To Make Music To Take Drugs To'(you just gotta love that title). Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro","review":"Look at this as the Spacemen's \\"white album\\" --Sonic Boom and Jason Pierce each wrote and produced one side of this record; the band was essentially finished. The first side, from Sonic Boom, is clearly reminiscent of his work in Spectrum. The second side, all written and recorded by J. Spaceman, sounds much like Spiritualized. It's more straightforward and accessible than some of their earlier releases, but it's nowhere near as good as Playing With Fire or The Perfect Prescription."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it spin you to sleep for prophetic dreams:ecstatic...","review":"This is my favorite album for:bringing a friend back home that has gone out a little too far for comfort...thinking hard and gazing at geometric shapes...introsensualselfrelations/astralorgasms...pre-dreams of interest recalled the following day...prescribed daily"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why this won a pulitzer","review":"The story is sub-par at best, and written in a tedious and trite style. The plot development is slow, lacking any real action. Though I appriciate La Farge's sentiment, I think it is poorly expressed. The only thing I liked about the book was the character development, but that alone cannot salvage this book. Save your money and time and read Steinbeck instead. God I love Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing Boy","review":"A sheltered Navajo boy (Laughing Boy) marries a Navajo girl (Slim Girl), who has had experience living in the white man's world; in fact, she continues to meet with her white lover only for what he gives her in material things (she actually despises him). She hopes Laughing Boy can help her return to the authentic Navajo ways, but she is killed by the jealous Red Man before this can happen. Highly praised for its authenticity, much of LaFarge's writing struck me as stylized. The novel won a Pulitzer Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK!","review":"This book is not for me.

Laughing Boy was raised in traditional Navajo culture, and risks greatly by marrying this semi-alien woman in defiance of family and tradition. Theirs is an intense and fragile love story, and the unexpected ending is wonderfully appropriate, albeit tragic. The author has done an excellent job of demonstrating some of the Navajo values and ways of thinking and behaving, very different from mainstream American culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Readable Classic","review":"The feeling of living the life of an early 20th century Navajo is felt directly from the begining. La Farge is masterful in relating the sounds,sights, and feelings of his central character Laughing Boy. The risky gamble of racing a tired horse, and the instant attraction of two opposites: Laughing Boy and Slim Girl show that here is man who trusts his heart more than his head at times. It is hard not to like the guy. I wanted to get up and cheer at least twice. The true strength of Laughing Boy is revealed, and passed on to the attentive reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSIGHTS, INSIGHTS, INSIGHTS","review":"Serendipity pointed me to this book and boy am I glad. It's no surprise to me it was a Pulitzer Prize winner! If you are interested in looking from the inside at a Navajo world, this is THE book for you.I am an avid, avid reader - science fiction, adventure, you name it - into the thousands of books in my lifetime. In all those years, this is the ONLY time I've read a book that so stunned me, so brought me into intimate knowledge of another's thinking. It is as if the book were written by an alien being. From page one, you are inside Laughing Boys mind, a phenomenon few writers have ever been able to achieve. Don't miss it!DA"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book to past on to todays young people","review":"Once you read Laughin Boy you'll remember it forever. I've read it in high school many years ago, my teenage daughter read it, now I planned on reading it to my 4 year old. The landscape that La Farge describes in the book is genuine. Every time we pass through Tee Nos Pos,AZ I can image where Laughing Boy may have ran. My teenagers today know little of their own people, through this book their eyes have open, they've learned a little about them and the old traditions. Even though Laughing Boy is fictitious some parts are authentic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When Cultures Collide","review":"This 1930 Pulitzer Prize novel is a heart-rendering look at young lovers brought together at a time when their world is astir with changes of which neither of them can control nor understand. The emerging culture of Slim Girl who has been given a Christian education clashes with the traditional Navajo norms of Laughing Boy. LaFarge has given powerful glimpes into the lives of these people as it was being played out in the early years of the Twentieth Century. Within this context is a compelling love story that is near poetry as the author gives us an unvarnished look at their struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book about a beautiful man.","review":"This heart-rending story of a Navaho man and his non-traditional wife was truly an education. Like every other great book, each word seems inspired, each paragraph flows perfectly from the last to the next, and you just won't be able to put this book down. When you finish it at last, you'll want to read it again. I loved The Education Of Littletree. I like Laughing Boy even more. Don't miss it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A poetic and inspiring love story.","review":"This story not only depicts what life was like for Navajos before their resettlement on reservations, it also reveals a beautiful love story.

It is summer, it is calm and all go about their own chores. As usual we meet the Reverend, the pub owner, the milkman and the local Dad's Army. The visiting troops turn out to be something quite other than expected and display manners very unEnglish and sometimes rather brutal... reminding us of the threat that lay present those last free days of a Free Europe.. This is certainly a film for those of us who where too young to have been there, to remind to not always take freedom for granted, nor the freedom of speech, still regardless of age this is a film for all of us.

I was a little disappointed when it came. It had obviously been sitting discarded on a back shelf, it was battered and dirty. The sticker was barely staying on any more and it was marked with a 2009 expiration date. The bath jelly barely comes out and is obviously old. I give it two stars because it was shipped and arrived in a timely manner and honestly my daughter is just happy to have the piggy packaging, the bath gel was an after thought. That being said, for almost $10 (and just over 3oz) I would have hoped for better attention to detail on this product and I personally would avoid this retailer in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are the Vice Presidents talking about?","review":"If you want to know what the managers, directors and vice presidents are talking about, or even better -- inform them, you need this book. Straight info, and straight talk -- with no concessions to the Redmond monopoly. Find out what's really happening in the computer industry, Not Just Java tells it like it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should cost $9.99, not worth paying the price","review":"The book is interesting because it provides a lot of information about what's going on and what are the trends in the industry as of the end of the 20th century. The problem is that this book speaks only from Sun Microsystems' point of view, so it's not very objective. I also think the author goes a little too far trying to thrash Microsoft and make Java seem like it's a solution to all problems of the world. One thing which is obviously wrong with his point of view is that he is trying to convince readers to use Java for its good things, even though Java's performance sucks. I personally work for a company where efficiency is the most crucial thing, so whatever benefits Java offers, they are not very helpful to us. Bottom line is, it's pretty interesting to read, but don't believe everything there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultural bias served with a side order of Java","review":"I had hoped that this book would give me a broad overview of what Java provides and when/how to use Java as an architecture. Unfortunately the message was all but lost in a sea of Microsoft bashing. I can understand making some comparisons but it is obvious that Mr Van Linden has a major axe to grind.If you wade through the incessant bashing there are some interesting points on Java but it isn't plainly stated or well organized enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unjust Java.","review":"First of all, I really enjoyed Van Der Linden's prior book, \\"Just Java\\". That said, this book's one great omnipresent flaw prevented me from developing a similar respect for \\"Not Just Java\\".In brief, this is perhaps the least objective book on computing I've ever read. To say that Linden has a prejudice toward Java, Sun, or against Microsoft is a wondrous piece of understatement. I can only conclude that Linden possesses a major block of Sun stock options and has sold Microsoft short. IMHO, definitely NOT a productive or instructive attitude, even from someone who disrespects M$ as much as I.The book badly needs a grounding in fair play. Its lopsided view of the world so distorts its view that the reader cannot escape its reality distortion field. Unfortunate and frustrating, from an author who has proven that he's capable of much better.I truly hope Mr. Van Der Linden's future writings don't continue down his present path, or his next book may be entitled \\"Irrelevant Java\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey into the History of Soul Food","review":"Soul and Spice is a well presented compilation of recipes from the African, African American (Southern Region) and Caribbean cultures.

Aparently, Miss Price was known for leaning on a piano at parties and singing this kind of thing. It's a shame she didn't do more of it. Everything on the album is interesting, and sung with feeling (and, in a few cases, just the right amount of archness or irony), some are very operatic in approach, some quite jazzy, all accompanied perfectly by Previn and the varying accompanying forces. I don't think the two Previn songs have ever been recorded elsewhere, and both are very good songs, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many voices at work here","review":"This album is a prime example of why most opera singers should keep away from the great American songbook. (And I say vice versa to the likes of Michael Bolton, Barbra Streisand and Aretha Franklin.) Although Price was hard to beat in \\"Trovatore,\\" \\"La Forza del Destino,\\" and even some Richard Strauss, this kind of music calls for a style that was foreign to her. The many voices she uses - some unsupported - would have given my voice teacher a heart attack. Often the choice of keys exposes the break in her registers mercilessly. I suppose the varied English pronunciation she uses from song to song was an intentional choice; it doesn't work for me. Album space is wasted on two mediocre, long-forgotten songs by André Previn and his then-wife Dory. This album was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel Baby By: The Origaniles)","review":"I love this CD so much because it's from the 50's times I love the 50's times.

It looked as if the box had been opened before (no shrink wrap). I've contacted Amazon about this twice, once on the web (to ask if anything could be done) and once by phone. I received no response to my web inquiry at all, and the rep I reached on the phone told me he'd send a return ticket (apparently my only option) but that they had no more in stock and I'd just have to wait. I never did get the return ticket. Printing one is an option, I guess, but I've hit a point where I really resent being put to all this trouble because of Amazon's mistakes.Amazon's never treated me this badly before, over anything. I can only guess that they sent me the last one on the shelf, and that it had been re-stocked without a proper inspection. Consider getting your KVM switch elsewhere.

It wasn't until I called Belkins tech support (very hard to get through to by the way) that I was informed that it does not work with laptops nor is there a fix.

About 7 out of 11 of the tracks are extreamly heavy and just about every toned down track has a heavy chorus. His screams are awsome and not raspy at all unlike some melodic death metal bands.

I gave it 4 stars because its standard metalcore(Singing, breakdowns ect...) which is not a bad thing, but its all been done before. On the positive side, Tim Williams gives it all he has both live and on the cd and before buying the cd i suggest you looking them play at the starland ballroom on youtube. Type in Bloodsimple and it should be the third video. Seriously if you have a taste for hardcore i suggest trying them out but if your looking for a more metal sound go somewhere else.

The production is a little too over-the-top; the lyrics of \\"Burn Forever\\" are drowned out by keyboards, and \\"In Chains\\" would have been awesome at three and a half minutes, instead of borderline torturous at six and a half. Still, \\"Wonderland\\" and \\"Ray of Sunshine\\" are nothing short of masterpieces, and the rest of the album is solid and gets better with each listening.

He and Ekatarin are on their way home from a delightful galactic honeymoon, and they're eager to get home for the babies' uncorking from their uterine replicators. Needless to say, he is delayed. A Komarran trade fleet is being held at Graf Station after an altercation between Barrayaran MPs and station security.Old friends, aquaintances, and enemies turn up in due course and complicate matters. Will Miles solve the mystery? Will he and Ekatarin make it home in time? Or will Aral and Cordelia have to raise their grandchildren?Bujold did a fine job as usual thinking up bad things for Miles. She didn't use Ekatarin as much as I hoped, but those times she acted independantly were intelligently played. I liked this one about as much as Komarr or Brothers in Arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it a lot","review":"I've read most of the series, and despite disagreeing with some of Ms. Bujold's political and social views I find her books universally compelling and entertaining.I read one reader review that says the book doesn't have the depth of character development that previous books had. I have to agree somewhat, so those new to the series might want to start with a book earlier on, or better yet--read the series from the beginning. But as someone completely familiar with the characters, I enjoyed getting right down to the nitty-gritty--a fast paced and highly enjoyable story.As I believe one of the back cover blurbs says, the woman can flat out write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles never disappoints","review":"You have to love Miles Vorkosigan. He is the most one of the most interesting characters in contemporarty SF. It has been fun to watch him grow up over the years and come into his own. Ms. Bujold has once again written a witty and fun story with Miles as the star. This book is basically a who done it on a space opera set, like the rest of the book in the series it keeps you amused and turning the pages. Although Miles in now a respectable married government offical in his mid thirties, he still has a few of the bouncing off the walls loose cannon moments that got him into trouble when he was a teenager running coverst ops so secret even he didn't know who was really in charge. If you have not read any of the Miles Vorkosigan books, you might want to start with on earlier book in the series and not jump in with this book. If you have followed Miles' earlier adventures...Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Lonely At The Top","review":"As other reviewers have noted, earlier works in this series dealt with Miles' difficulties fitting into the conservative Barrayaran society. But now Miles has triumphed -- he is an Imperial Auditor, with the Emperer's full support and considerable power. How will he adjust to that? This is what the author is dealing with in this book. Miles couldn't stay forever at the bottom of the pyramid -- he's just too competent for that. So now he has to deal with being at the top -- and Bujold has done a great job of showing us how he succeeds -- just barely -- at it. If you've read the other books and enjoyed them, you'll really enjoy this one -- angst gets boring after a while, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diplomatic Immunity","review":"A real page-turner. The plot's twists and turns are seamless and the characters come alive under Ms. Bujold's mastery of her genre. I can't wait for the next episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best effort, but still a good read","review":"I seldom give Ms. Bujold, who is my favorite author, less than five stars, but this book, though filled with her usual cleverness, just didn't have the *significance* that all of the previous Vorkosigan books had. Nothing really new occurs in Miles' life, or in the lives of any of the other major supporting cast. It's an interesting story, well told, and Miles is at his manic almost-best. He never gives less than his all, though, and you've gotta love him for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster & with a bonehead error","review":"While I love Miles books, this one had a bonehead error: Miles is looking for someone who can produce synthetic blood. He's walking down the hall with someone who admits to having a bunch of uterine replicators he has to attend to. But he doesn't put 2 and 2 together. Ever. Argh!This, unfortunately, is only one example of why this book doesn't sparkle as much as some of the others in the series, especially following on the heels of _A Civil Campaign_. It simply wasn't thought through as deeply and it shows.This is not to say that it doesn't have good moments, but it doesn't have great moments like the dinner scene in Campaign.I'll keep the hardcover as a set-completer, but I hope the next Miles book is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was nice, but..","review":"I was hoping for Admiral Naismith hyperactivity, and I didn't get it. This is the first Bujold book which brings Quaddies, Cetaganda and Miles together, so perhaps I shouldn't complain. But if Miles is slowing down, what fun is left?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed plot, nothing new, disappointing","review":"While I've really enjoyed the first dozen books in this series, unfortunately the author is apparently starting to write new books just for the money. In this case, the plot is predictable and not different from all the other stories. It will be disappointing for anyone looking for the quality of the other Miles novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst of the Vorkosigan series","review":"I'm a great fan of Bujold, and in particular of the Vorkosigan series. But this one is a lemon. Clearly, and very unusually for her, Bujold had nothing to say and no idea what to write about. The only reason to read this book is if you've read every other Vorkosigan book (and the superb Curse of Chalion), in which case you probably loved them so much you wouldn't trust this review anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Stand Alone Novel","review":"This is the first book of Miss Bujold's that I have read. Frankly, I found it to be an uninteresting read for the most part. Her characters are flat, with obvious nudges towards previous novels, and no explanations for these nudges whatsoever. The plot is thin in many places, the characters are somewhat predictable in their mannerisms. Her writing style is somewhat short, and her plot mechanisms are thread-bare. But I will note, that this is one book in a series. My impressions may have been different if I had started with the first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Lois, you can do MUCH better","review":"I eagerly awaited the next novel from Lois set in the Barrayar world with Admiral Naismith and company only to be saddled with this load of guff. It is worse than her last one. I read page after page with nothing happening except to hear from Miles telling his wife how lovely she looked and how lucky he was, blah blah blah, yata yata yata. End the series Lois, because it is going nowhere fast because it ain't moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off of faithful readers","review":"LMB run out of ideas already in the previous book \\"Civil Campaign\\"; that book was running on the momentum of the previous ones.\\"Diplomatic Immunity\\" is much worse. It's plot, if it could be called a plot-line, is 1950's science fiction horror based, boring from beginning to end. The pages run on \\"idle\\", the reader is continuously expecting magnificence to emerge, the way the previous stories used to be ... and continuously disappointed.The entire tome is an attempt to cash in on the glories of the past, which was truly outstanding ... BR>I have every Miles book, in hard cover, on my bookshelf. I will not buy a used paperback of \\"Diplomatic Immunity\\" and I suggest you do the same.Shame on LMB for playing false with our trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasten Your Seatbelts","review":"Miles is back and, if not as bubbly as before, he still has what it takes. I received Diplomatic Immunity yesterday afternoon and finished it this morning. As usual the story rushes you through to the finish and leaves you wanting the next book. The only problem I had was that I guessed the why before Miles did! That isn't usual and I have to wonder if Ms. Bujold started to have Miles realize earlier and then put off sharing it with the readers. He seemed to know what had happened. (Miles says I've got to contact Gregor about this, I can't handle this one on my own.) Miles then drops the whole line until the later part of the book when it comes out like I thought he thought earlier. Overall it was very enjoyable and leave several options for future books -- His children ought to be extraordinary, both the ones just decanted and the Cetagandan... I can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing steam","review":"The plot of Diplomatic immunity is pretty much vintage Bujold peppered with stupid asides. Perhaps this is a holdover from her recent foray into fantasy, an excursion I found unsuited to her writing style. She is much more at home here, in the easier world building of the future, but something is missing. The characterization that made Miles so endearing is growing thin.That being said, it's not a really awful book. For Bujold fans, however, it is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely dissapointing and lacklustre","review":"Let me begin by saying I am (& remain) a huge Miles fan. I have enjoyed (& occasionally re-read) every one of the previous books.However, IMHO this book falls far short of any previous offering, failing to \\"spark\\" pretty well from the start. It feels \\"rehashed\\" with the plot devices feeling all too familar and often being telegraphed (eg the handkercief).I initially thought this slowness and familiarity was a ploy to lull me into a false sense of security before a whiplash plot twist or revelation a la \\"Memory\\". However, there are no twists or interwoven layers here and the characterisation (especially Bel's) is way short of what we have come to expect from Lois.That being said I'm hanging out for the next installment and hoping for a return to Miles' usual blinding form!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical Bujold novel","review":"I've been a major fan of Lois McMaster Bujold for quite some time, and I was mildly horrified by Diplomatic Immunity - characters that typically would have been rich, complex, and interesting came through as extremely two dimensional. In fact, the main reason I checked this amazon page is that I figured that it may have, somehow, been written by someone else.When I first read the Warrior's Apprentince I was captivated by many things, among them were the complexity of the cultures the author creates, the occasionally fallible nature of the hero, and the 3 dimensional, very lifelike antagonists; all of these qualities were somehow missing in this book.I still hold out hope that I, somehow, received a counterfit copy. Overall it was OK, but it was not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book as well as some reviews...","review":"I was really disappointed - after brilliant \\"Civil Campain\\" I expected for something bigger and stronger. And all we got was mixture of \\"Cetaganda\\" motives and \\"Komarr\\"'s plot (Auditor investigating...), unfortunately minus Miles-Ekaterin romance...!Probably Lois used her yearly supply of talent on \\"Curse of Chalion\\"? Kidding! Lois is talented enough for making this book readable and funny! (Terry Goodkind, please LEARN something from her!!!)P.S. By the way, I disagreee with the people saying \\"Cetaganda\\" was a cheap knock-off"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, but not great.","review":"I have the impression this is another 'set the stage' book, similar to \\"Komarr\\" in advancing the series and Miles' life. While a tad disappointed, I DO realize not every single book can be as outstanding as Memory, Mirror Dance, and Barrayar, etc. etc. Unfortunately, I read it in one evening and now must restrain myself for the next year or so. Thank you so much Lois, but please hurry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and entertaining","review":"This was a great adventure in the Vorkosigan series. Miles has to solve a complicated mystery and resolve a sticky diplomatic situation. We also get to see more of the different peoples and cultures in this future world.

When holding it, it isn't terrible, but unless I place it on a plain surface (paper, a folder, or a blank mouse pad) it flies around the screen. Not only that, but if you take a second to read something and keep the mouse in your hand, it takes very little pressure to click in both buttons, so on numerous occasions I've switched windows, started programs, or completely exited out of the internet just because I didn't know exactly where my cursor was on the screen.Bottom line, this mouse sucks and I'd strongly recommend you stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"triumph of form over function","review":"Might be good if someone was never going to use another mouse, ever again.

Originally released the same year as Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, McWilliams' book relates the history of not only migrant farm labor in California, but the corporate farm as well. Having included extensive background on California's 19th Century land grab, McWilliams presents a comprehensive look at corporate agriculture, including its effect on various labor groups and the economy of the State of California. Written with a definite bias toward the underdog (the migrant worker), Factories in the Field nevertheless provides the reader with an understanding of the beginnings of corporate economy in California and its true beginnings in agriculture, including an explanation of the power of the ag growers--a political hot potato that continues in the state today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellbender Review","review":"Yes, this game is a dinosaur in the reckoning of technology years, but I love it because it brings back memories from my childhood of playing similar games with my older brother.

Over the years, it disappeared, so when I saw it available on amazon.com, I decided I needed it for my collection, especially for the Earl Scruggs/Johnny Cash version of \\"I Still Miss Someone.\\" I should have read previous posting...as it the Flatt & Scruggs version of the classic, rather than the Johnny Cash edition of the song, and the audio quality as a whole is questionable.

I have eight additional ablums that they did, and I can't wait until they are also released on CD.This ablum sounds like \\"Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\\" with an edge. Covers of \\"Some of Shelly's Blues\\" and Dylans's \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" are excellent. The band later moves off, adding more Rock and Jazz elements in later ablums.

What the hell people!!! When I buy something I just expect it to work.The man at the place I took it too said they no longer carry Bulldog cause of all the problems they were having with them.

I elected to solder connections to make them more secure, though. The trouble is that it quits working from time to time (and it's not working now!), and so far it's been a grounding problem. I followed the directions for grounding explicitly, but this time I think I'll go for the fuse block or a soldered connection to an existing ground wire. I'll revise this review if it turns out to be something besides a grounding problem.Those troubles aside, the system has worked flawlessy.

However, the parking light confirmation of the lock/unlock function does not work. It is supposed to provide -12VDC current to a relay you have to use with a vehicle that has a +12VDC parking light circuit. The main module is not functioning properly in that it does not provide the -12VDC cycle to trip the relay. I believe I have a defective unit. The frustrating this is that I have left 3 e-mails to Bulldog Security and they have never responded.

It simply locks and unlocks your doors. No horn chirp to signal it is locked and no flash of your lights. All of those features can be added but you must buy additional products to do so.... something I missed when ordering this product.The remote has a somewhat cheap feel about it.... but again.... for the price it is fine. Working distance seems pretty good.Installation takes some time. Probably helpful to know what your doing. Google definitely comes in handy.Also, this keyless entry will immobilize your vehicle if you do not use it to unlock it when you used it to lock the doors.

However, the fitted sheet did not fit. Of course I had just thrown away the packaging and receipt the day before, so returning it is not an option (my fault completely). The tag on the fitted sheet says queen, and it's supposed to fit deep pocket queen mattresses. My mattress is a regular queen one, and it didn't even come close. It could be an isolated flaw, but just be sure to try it on your bed before throwing away the packaging!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy These","review":"I bought these for my QUEEN size bed and the fitted sheet is way too small.

They came out horribly after only two washings. Pilling, pilling, and pilling, did I say pilling.... Oh Yes! Also, they are very thin or loosely woven (not sure how to explain that) but you can see right through them after the first wash. Very, very poor quality.I do own another set of sheets(500 thread count) from this same manufacturer and am very happy with those though. Just remember the old saying: you get what you pay for and I promise you these sheets are a classic example of that. They are cheap for a reason. I got them for 19.99 but even still, I may as well have just thrown that money in the trashcan since I didn't get much use out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"This set of sheets was a bargain...

What makes me a big fan of Pretty Maids that they can write heavy songs with great harmonies and melodies. On anything worth doing.... the song \\"when the angels cry\\", which i think is one of their better songs every written, mixes heavy guitar with great melodies and harmonies. This whole cd is awesome not one bad song on it. If i had to compare them to another band, maybe heavier version of Europe.

It is the tool of choice for belaying the leader. There are lots of other designs out there, but few of them work better. The only reason I took off a star was because the top is thin and they wear out a little faster than some designs.

I thought the back cover was completely misleading. The book is about cat death - tons and tons of cats die in horrible ways. The descriptions are graphic. There is not a normal relationship between a woman and her cat wherein the woman loves and grieves the cat - it is written with complete emotional distance. If the author wasn't famous for other work I can't imagine any publisher publishing this book. Awful doesn't do it justice. If you want to read about cats dying, written in a completely dispassionate, matter-of-fact, \\"oh-well\\" way go for it. Otherwise, SKIP THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't even worthy of one star!","review":"This is not a pleasent book to read for people who really love cats. It is very depressing and not uplifting at all. I ordered this book, thinking I was going to get a cute cat book with fun stories about cats. Boy, was I ever wrong. The stories are so dismal and depressing, they are all about cats & kittens getting killed or dying from one reason or another. The author even tells us a story about how she \\"had\\" to kill some new born kittens, because she thought the mother cat was to weak to nurse them. Well, she could have gone to the vet and got some formula and a dropper and feed them herself. She shouldn't even be a cat owner, she doesn't even know how to take Good care of cats. Also the author refers to her cats just as black cat and gray cat. My cats are members of my family, they are my children, and I gave them names. I don't refer to them as: orange cat, or black and white cat, or tabby cat, etc. This book is just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Cat Lady","review":"While reading this book I became so involved having raised so many cats over the years.

I personally did not care for it at all. had I known the class I chose was using this book I never would have taken it.

There are very brief warm-up and cool-down that (do but) barely use yoga moves. And then three short 3-4 move \\"routines\\" that definately get you jumping around and work out your back legs well from the jumping but as far as taking them into performance or the dance floor- you probably wouldn't. The workout felt good- my muscles felt really warm and my legs surely received some toning but as I am more interested in dance as an artform as opposed to a mere excercise... this dvd disappointed me. I would recommend instead, The Bollywood Workout. That one again really works the legs and challenges you to let loose and laugh with your whole body- a great workout but feels much more like you just had a dance party. It is more fun and more useful for broadening your dance move vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs a PUNCH!","review":"This workout video is GREAT if you're looking for variety and don't like repetitive movements.

Good Job Ladies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uli steals the show!!!!","review":"I owned the vinyl before there even were cds and I felt then, and now, that the performance is much better than the recording. Uli John roth absolutely steals the show with his blistering lead guitar riffs. He was so much better than Mathias Jabs. At this time, they were a blues based hard rock band. To me, this was their peak artistically. Tracks like Speedy's Coming, We Burn the Sky, Fly to the Rainbow, and Robot Man are blistering. And, get the import double disc with ALL tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last and the best of the \\"old\\" Scorpions","review":"This is the last album to feature the fantastic Uli Jon Roth on lead guitar. All their classics are here except for Catch Your Train, Sails of Charon and Polar Nights which was transferred to the CD-version of In Trance.Roth, serious as always about his music and lyrics, left the band after this album because the other members intended to change directions and become a more straight-forward-no-message-included rock act. So if you're the \\"Roth\\" kind of person when it comes down to hard rock this is probably the best Scorpions CD on the market. Good sound quality and enthusiastic playing. A pity they didn't leave out the rock 'n' roll medley so Polar Nights could 've been included.

If you ever get the chance to see them perform live haul ass to the venue, get there early, drink a Lone Star, eat a Moon Pie while your honey slams back an RC (lable out), and get strapped in for the ride of your life.

You don't really learn anything about him (he's got a wife and kids)and all the good footage are clips of his fights. Ironically, scenes with his enemy Chael Sonnen were the most entertaining. I'm a fan of both mma and documentaries, but this could have been cut down to an hour and shown on (insert channel here).

After seeing the video for \\"Evolution Revolution Love\\", I was interested enough to pick up a copy of the album. What starts off good, with the trippy \\"Excess\\", and then \\"Evolution Revolution Love\\", and the Morcheeba-sounding \\"Over Me\\", soon winds down to track after track of uninteresting songs.

Its okay, I guess..","review":"I was really looking forward to this album, sadly it just didnt stand up to the repeated listening test that all his other albums have passed with flying colors. You can't say this album is bad, I love tricky, but it just wasn't satisfying, too easy to listen to, which isn't always a good thing. The great thing about tricky is that each album is a new experience, and usually takes some work to get in to, which inevitably is worth it, not with blowback. Okay, you have to get it if you've got all the others, but by no stretch of the imagination is this his best work. I wouldnt say steer clear, but don't have great expectations. Song for Yukiko and Five Days are the highlights, maybe even You don't Wanna, but Im sorry I just didnt get Hawkman. Hopefully the next album will be more inventive, less radio friendly, but nevertheless tricky remains one of my favourite artists, and is no doubt a genius, he's just had a bad day!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"genuinely interesting","review":"I mostly listen to classical and 50s-60s jazz music, and this CD is my intro to Tricky. I find most pop music boring, predictable, and repetitive, but I really enjoy this... very atmospheric and interesting.I had a very different reaction than another reviewer to the song \\"Your Name\\": I think it's really touching--it gets stuck in my head and I like having it there. it reminds me of Mo singing with Velvet Underground, kind of.oddly enough, the lyrics to one of the songs (\\"I believe in buildings tall... I believe disease is coming, I believe that's why I'm running\\") gave me such a strong and vivid premonition that 9.11 was like deja vu.the evolution revolution song is great.I have no problem with Tricky wanting radio play. does any musician record songs s/he honestly hopes not many people will listen to?really good record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Foolishness and a SELL OUT!","review":"Tricky was an innovator of Trip Hop Music. Not only did he make it, he pioneered the Blue print for others to come along. To hear some foolishness like this is a complete contradiction, and shows he didn't care about his loyal fans. Tricky isn't a singer nor can he do something that just isn't him. This album is a sign of desperation and shows that the creativity he once had may not exist anylonger. If you want a real Tricky album get Nearly God,Maxinqueye,Pre Millenium Tension and Ruff Guide. Everything after PMT has been a sign of an artist that apparently has lost it. I believe that after his departure with Martina, It was the beginning of the end for him. This may be O.K for people who never heard his other material,and if you like Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"better & better","review":"i first became familiar with tricky in 1996 with his \\"nearly god\\" albumn and lemme tell ya, that albumns till blows me away whenever i listen to it. after the diappointing \\"pre-millenium tension\\" albumn, i had almost given up on him...until now! \\"blowback\\", although not as beautiful as \\"nearly god\\", is a really, really good downbeat albumn. while still being downbeat, it's actually more upbeat than his previous stuff (i know i'm not making sense, but you'll get it when you hear it). it makes you want to dance. there's reggae, retro 80's dance, and typical, wonderful tricky trip-hop.so if you're just getting into tricky: get this, \\"maxinquaye\\", nearly go, and forget \\"pre-millenium tension\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm trying to give it away.","review":"With the release of Maxiquaye, I thought Tricky was one of the most moving and powerful artists working in any medium. I felt as if I was waiting for that album for my entire life. That album cracked my skull clean open.And Tricky continued to progress, creating the terribly-underrated \\"Nearly God\\", the eclectic and minimal \\"Grassroots\\", and proceeded further with the masterpiece \\"Pre-Millenium Tension\\".And after that it was all downhill. Each new album seemed to get worse and worse. Thinner and thinner. Stupider and stupider. It was as if Tricky bought into his own myth and took himself all too seriously.There is hype of \\"Blowback\\" being the most radio friendly album. Very possible, in the world of Limp Bizkits, Brittney Spears's, and Back Street Boys. But is that really such a good thing?My friend Saul asked me recently if \\"Blowback\\" was worth picking up. I told him he could have mine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricky gone bad...","review":"This ain't Tricky. In fact it's not challenging at all. In the liner notes he says he wants this album played on radio stations, and that he's basically sorry for producing the albums prior to this one, which he says were more to insult his audience rather than give us what we want.Wrong. This is not what I want. I liked the insulting Tricky better, then. At least then he was truthful about himself. This album is pop mash. Probably get some radio play, but who cares about that other than 16 year old girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comment on dit \\"panderer?\\"","review":"Imagine that you're an average low-end hooker, but with one super-hero quality: when a john approaches you, fold of cash in his sweaty hand, you able to transform into an average hooker of any age, race, body type, etc. Wow - you can do anything to get a few bucks out of a guys hand, as long as it's derivative and average!That's Tricky on this decidely mundane genre tour. I'd say stay clear, but if you go, use protection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"If you expect this album to be as beautiful and truly genius as Maxinquaye, then you should really think again. Some songs on this album really are progressive and moving (Excess and Evolution Revolution Love) but most of the rest are just so Not-Tricky. He has moved further away from hip hop and is now including singers such as Anthony Kiedis, and is not teaming up with the lovely Martina as in Maxinquaye. One of the most awful songs I've ever heard is on this album, which is a cover of Nirvana's Something in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in","review":"After Maxinquaye, I couldn't wait to hear this. Unfortunately I was seriously disappointed.The first problem is that the album differs so radically from Tricky's previous work that it can no longer even be classified as downtempo/Trip Hop. My feeling is that so many big names were brought in on this one (Morissette, Flea, Cyndi Lauper, etc.) that the sound was ruined; too many cooks in the kitchen.The cover of Kurt Cobain's \\"Something in the Way\\" is so bad it's embarassing.Maybe the next trick will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok COMPILATION OF FOOTAGE","review":"This DVD Is just a compilation of thoughts by U2 biographers, not bad if you are a crazy U2 fan, but NOT recommended to de casual fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Corporate America must read.,","review":"I found this book to be very educational and presented where even the common foe could read.

The glass is very thick, but not quality. Half the bowls came with the rims chipped and still flaking off slivers of glass. The glass of the bowls have a slight green tint. Basically you get what you pay for. For $19.99 for 12 bowls- the price is good, but I was looking for more quality. Since half were chipped, I sent them back to Amazon. They said 'Libbey' brand on them- but they were really made in Mexico. The quality was poor (nothing against Mexico.)

They arrived half broken. Amazon promptly sent me another order. I now had about 18 bowls. They are attractive and great for salads and eating cereal. I like that they are deep so stuff like soup and cereal milk don't slosh out as I balance the bowl on my chest in bed.I am now looking for more bowls as I only have about 6 left. These are not tough bowls and easily break and chip. My mother gave me four glass bowls 20 years ago and I have all four still. Changing environments to be sure, but those four remain unchipped, albeit a bit scratched up, but fully functional. They shared the cupboard with these bowls.These are an everyday kind of bowl and are not sustainable in that fashion.

The play has never been published, either in its original or revised version. But there's the film -- and this novelization.

But when I went shopping for a new address book disc for Win 7, no one had them. I got the same answer from everybody-- use \\"Contacts\\" in Windows Live. Well, I do use Contacts for my e-mail, but I wanted a stand-alone address book.StatTrak Address Manager was just about the only one I found for Win 7. And- if I had made a list of the features I wanted, I would have come up with exacty what the features are on this program. It's easy, fast, simple, no unnecessary (for me) bells and whistles.

It is very good for managing names and addresses for things like Christmas card label/envelope printing. It has a facility for grouping entries in multiple ways and selecting reports based on the grouping criteria. It's easy to use, has some canned reports that are helpful. You can also create custom reports. However, and this is the significant problem, you cannot save the specifications created for custom reports. Therefore, if you use custom reports you have to reenter all the criteria each time to create the report. I have contacted the developers twice in the past 3 years asking that they add this as an enhancement. They responded quickly and politely saying that they have received this suggestion from other users and may consider it for a future release. I would give this product 5 stars it had the facility to save custom report specs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It","review":"I got this to replace Parsons Address Book - which was perfect.

The narration by Joanne Woodward is beautiful as well. I highly recommend this movie. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"The Age of Innocence is an incredible film. It's gorgeously made and has a wonderful score. Daniel Day-Lewis is, as always, great, and the rest of the cast does quite well, too. But I think what I like most about the film (maybe because the other reviews got me thinking about it) is the narrator. When I saw it a second time, 5 years after its release, I found it more deeply stirring than I remembered, mainly because the narrator gives the audience such a profound insight into Newland's psychology, which many books-turned-movies can lose. If you don't feel like you're being led by the hand, the narration will make the film a very personal and moving experience for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Period Classic","review":"The Age of Innocence will go down in the books as a true early American Classic full of fortitude and intergity! This movie simply \\"Class A\\" cinemology at it's finest! A good story line, capturing the period of the early New York Society with great acting exhibited by Jeremy Irons, Michele Pfeiffer, and Wynona Ryder. Showing the struggle between desire and temptation, right and worng and the consequences of doing the honorable thing when honorable is right.

Daniel Day-Lewis is usually outstanding but even he can't bring life to this role. Of course, you can't blame him for not loving the always annoying Wynonna Ryder...but how could he choose the histrionic and insipid Michelle Pfeiffer, who doesn't begin to do justice to Countess Olenska? Her red eyes and her heaving bosom have gotten tiresome (here as in Dangerous Liasons)...Not to mention the narration...thanks Joanne...you're the best...but why not just do the audio instead of this annoying voice over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Martin Scorsese has made a masterpiece here. His long shots coupled with the exquisite costumes and glorious scenes are breathtaking. Ryder gives a shockingly incredible performance. Pfieffer follows suit, as I had this inner plea for her to win all that she sought.The supporting cast (including bit players) were also perfectly placed and helped create this piece into \\"Master\\".This film is truly a feast for the eyes, creating a visual world that perfectly reveals the society in which it is set. More importantly, the screenplay draws us into a world where emotion and its expression are defined by the rules of class. Subtlety and depth are keywords for the story in this film, and the actors compliment the presentation by giving well rounded, natural, and believable performances. Oscar Nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Apated Screenplay. Oscar Winner for Best Costumes. Fans of Martin Scorsese might love this and others think this is Scorsese\`s Oddest Film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece, yes, that is the word","review":"Like many other reviewers, the first time I saw this film, I thought it was boring beyond words. I think that I was expecting a \\"chick flick\\" and that's not what I got.Upon second viewing, I realized that I had missed the boat and that the film was absolutely brilliant in every detail. It simply does not take one false step in any way. Performances, script, cinematography, score, sets, just everything.Personally, I believe that Ryder gives the performance of her career as May. Her performance is so subtle, so under the surface, that many may dismiss it as one-noted. Not so, not so at all.I can only hope that Scorsese puts a special edition on DVD so that I can enjoy it in all of its sumptuousness over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Film.","review":"I have watched this film many times and have recommended it quite often.

I couldn't get into into. The story line is dragging throughout the whole movie. I saved it on my dvr because I thought it was worth while looking. I wouldn't recommend anyone on buying this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director ruins good film","review":"I actually agree with many of the comments of the previous reviewers. The camera work is excellent, the story is good and the acting as well. The visual storytelling is beautifully done, so why does Scorsese have to ruin it all by letting a voice-over explain everything which the images had already conveyed? Doesn't he believe that the audience is capable of thinking? Apparently not because near the end he had to make a flash back to that pivotal beach scene where Pfeiffers character did not turn around. Only this time she does turn around, thereby indicating with the subtlety of a highway billboard that if only she would turn up in the window (which we all know she won't) things may end happily. Please Mr. Scorsese, do have more respect for your audience in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"I bought this movie after reading some of the positive reviews. After seeing it, I am baffled at how anyone could possibly like this movie. I love Edith Wharton and The Age of Innocence is one of my favorite books, but this movie is awful. It is a hokey, boring attempt at bringing Wharton's beautifully written, Pulitzer Prize winning novel to film. From the laughable love scenes between the Countess and Newland Archer to the annonymous narrator that cuts in with background information to the strange lighting effects that make you think there is something wrong with your TV, this movie butchers a classic and puts good actors to shame. Don't waste your time and money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Age of Boredom","review":"Martin Scorsese, usually a brilliant film-maker, has broken the cardinal rule of film-making: Thou Shall Not Bore the Audience.This film is excruciatingly boring. There's no other way to state it. The pacing is slow, the dialogue without emotion, the story is thin and lifeless. Although beautifully filmed at times (check out the ornate dinner parties), and the actors appear competent, if not comfortable in their roles, there is no disguising that in this film, nothing happens. Nothing.I have no problem with deliberately paced films with similar story lines, such as The Remains of the Day. However, with The Age of Innocence, the sum of the parts is significantly less than zero. A complete waste of two hours of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast characters","review":"Even though this was directed by Martin Scorsese, the film missed the book because the casting was all wrong.If you loved the book you couldn't see Winona Rider as May. May was tall and blonde and athletic looking with pale blueeyes. The Ellen character in the book is described as a small \\"dark lady, pale and dark\\" &\\" with \\"brown hair in close curls\\" andhere's Michelle Pfeiffer in all her blonde abundance playing Ellen! It bothered me a lot. Daniel Day-Lewis was good asArcher; and the last important scene was played very well but over all it was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Torture!!","review":"At first, I thought that this was a horror movie.

Thanks for reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Age of Innocence","review":"I thought this movie was good. Reminded me of Martin new movie Gangs of NEw York with Leo. But that was in my opinion since he used the same backdrop which is almost for all his movies. I wonder how he would for something else not in NEw York. THe respention of social pressure or society was right on. The society was reflect though visuals that were stunning.

Ahhh!I own the movie to watch that scene.Then, the end, when their love, which had been so perfect,so unmarred, he dared not go up the three flights of stairsto her, even though he was free, because the memory of theirlove might have been lessened.I own the movie to watch that scene, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Age of innocence","review":"I never saw it because it wouldn't download.

Normal people are instead productive and take pride in that.This movie is one longwinded pile of dialogues about trivia, without passion or any other emotion, certainly lacking the original humorous style (which was the sole redeeming aspect of Wharton's work).Action you won;t find much here.The characters are all unpleasant One would not want them as one's friends. They are either weaklings or moochers. No heroes here.Due to the rather 'emotionless dialogue only' atmosphere, I fell asleep for boredom and that rarely happens with other movies.Pity, because Scorsese has made many good movies.This ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Casting","review":"Terribly disappointed in this film. I love period dramas, Daniel Day-Lewis and Martin Scorcese. However, the film was ruined for me by the atrocious performances of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder.

I had thrown in the whole bomb into the tub and let it fizz before stepping in. Not sure what the exact proper directions are since they don't come with any whatsoever! The smell didn't last too long on my skin. Oh on a funny note, I didn't realize the middle was rice paper and had let it fizz along with the rest of the bomb. When I came out of the tub the rice paper had turned to goo and stuck to my hair! Didn't look too good, but whoops on my part! I liked this BOMB alot more than my previous LUSH bubble bar (milk?) and look forward to experimenting with more LUSH bombs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I was excites about this one...smelled great in the store, but when i put it in the tub, there was almost no scent.

Ylang Ylang oil from Young Living, for example. It's wonderful!! Just add some drops to the bath water. These are oils proven to have very high vibrational frequency to them...and you can definitely feel the difference!!

I had read all the wonderful reviews and was looking forward to using them (I ordered a few different ones). I can not even tell you my disappointment when I took my first bath.

I have used several of them and every time I keep hoping that it'll just be an amazing experience but really, after the fizz dies down, you're left with colored water and some random stuff floating around. The scent is a little overpowering in the tub, but it doesn't stay on my skin very well. If I'm going to take a $5.00 bath, I would much rather use one of Lush's bath melts...they leave your skin feeling much softer than the bombs and tend to smell better too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stained the tub","review":"I like Lush products, but the dye in this one was way too potent.

I dropped it into the bathtub which turned neon pink - ok, fun. Then the strong scent of a cheap perfume permeated the bathroom, and I was less happy because it was really pungent.

Each one has disappointed me. While the scents range from 'ok' to 'really good', the bombs fizz out in under 5 minutes and leave massive amounts of *navy blue* grit in the bottom of the tub (no matter the type of bomb). This is not fun to clean at the end of a relaxing bath. I've also been turned off by the heavy staining characteristics of the bath bombs. If they lasted longer and left my skin feeling more moisturized instead of dessicated, I'd be more forgiving of it. Bath bombs are mostly scent-infused baking soda. Big deal.If you're looking for something that gives lots of bubbles, more pampering for your skin and amazing scents, go for the bubble bars and bath melts by Lush. You'll have some grit in the bottom of your tub afterward, but the trade-off is a longer-lasting, better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex Bomb Bath Bomb by LUSH","review":"Sex Bomb Bath Bomb by LUSHSmells great haven't had a chance to use it yet but can't wait"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Necessity for Any Business Owner to Read and Own!","review":"Darby Checketts hits a home run with this book, it's worth way more than the asking price.

I cleaned the print head and deep cleaned umpteen times no luck.The other problem is it really uses up the ink. It has 3 color tanks that are said to last longer, but once one goes the other two are right behind them. My recomendation is the canon Ip 1500 it prints pictures as good as the ip3000. The nice thing one black and one color cartridge that you can get on the web for less then ten bucks for both. Also they are very easy to refill. I can not see the difference between print quality with the ip3000 and the ip15000. Canon does make great products and hasexcellent customer service.

After using it I i quickly realized why the store couldn't wait to get rid of them. This unit is no good for the regular, digital picture enthusiast. Why? It utilizes CMYK. This means that all of your photos have to be converted and even then they won't hardly resemble the colors on your monitor. Only design nerds and professionals use CMYK and that's for printing jobs. As well, the lines per inch (lpi) is severely out of whack with my unit. I have to finagle everything I do in Photoshop to a great degree in order to avoid having vertical streaks on my prints.Even if my unit has some strange quirks that others don't, I highly advise the regular user to stay away due to the CMYK cartridges (which are also more expensive than say HP's). 2 stars out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, good quality prints!","review":"I have this connected to my iMac G5 and the thing works wonders.

The water stays clean, it's easy to find replacement bottles - just buy another drink in a glass bottle - juice, tea, etc., wash the bottle and you have it! No waiting for a shipment to arrive or running from store to store looking for the exact bottle you need. When you refill the bottle, use room temperature water, fill to the top, place the stopper in, put your finger over the tip, closing the water flow out of the tube, turn the bottle upside down, allow the bubbles to rise to the top (actually the bottom of the bottle), place the tube into the holder on the cage, and place the spring around the bottle. There should be very little to no dripping. This is the very best water bottle system I've found!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Advanced Version of the Original, But NOT a Clone","review":"Dreamlights is such a magical parade, probably because of the nostalgia from the original, and that nostalgia is very much presented in the music. However, if you are expecting the same musical lineup you are going to be let down. There is a lot of stuff from the original mixed in there but most of it is completely new. It's still really great to listen to and you really feel like you are there because they include all of the dialog from the parade on the track. A word of warning though, this is a JAPANESE CD, which means that there are several parts of dialog that are completely in Japanese. That doesn't hurt it though because it's still a great listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great flip flops","review":"These flip flops are very comfortable.

Thank God the corporate drones at fox decided to release this after Criterion lost the rights! Hands down, this is one of the most astounding action films ever, and one of my faves of all time. If there was ever a movie that defined the word kinetic, this is it. The shootouts are so stylized and frenetic, one must see it to believe it. Woo also uses religious iconography to underpin the the deeper subtext of the film. If you see one Woo film, this must be it!Like it says on the box, \\"Outrageous, Supercharged, Go for Broke Cinema! \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado . . .","review":". . . About Very Little. John Woo heaps so much care and (seeming) intelligence on such trash. He has studied all the masters so carefully, and added his own touches to create such overblown kitschy rubbish that it almost makes one sick. Add to it the outrageous claims of Woo's fans (no other word for them) and you have what could have been an enjoyably amusing shoot-em-up transformed into a painfully pretentious shoot-em-up. And Chow Yun Fat is easily the worst excuse for a movie star since Whoopi Goldberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"guys, come on","review":"this movie is cheese city. the worst acting and nonsense foreign production values ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly a change, compared to Hollywood-action !","review":"The Killer is one of John Woo's best movies, considering him teaming up with Chow Yun Fat, Hong Kong's greatest star.It is a delight to admire Woo's gunfights, that are filmed with such precision and express thorough knowledge of the genre. We have experienced repetitative tries from directors like Quentin Tarantino, to create similar moods to Woo's work. But this doesn't simply work through saying the F word, it needs a talent, which John Woo seems to be the only one to posess. The Killer has an intelligent plot, underlined with style and character, which isn't simply based on the action, but also on the consciences of a villain, accompanied by code of honour. Great movie !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The idol for action movies","review":"This was my first John Woo/Chow Yun Fat movie and it opened my eyes about action movies. Compared to this Hollywood's turn outs are slow, predicatble, awkward and tame. There actually is a story, the acting is good, and the action balletic. This is my top action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"For John Woo Fans","review":"The killer has more action in the first minute than most action films have in the first hour. Don't miss this gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true mature film.","review":"John Woo does nothing to prepare us for the blood and carnage that is \\"The Killer\\". He wastes no time in blowing men into bloody sausages in the first 5 minutes of the film. And the intensity of the gunfights simply grow until you're met with the climax of the film which won't be like anything you'll ever seen. And underneath all this chaos is a very poetic and human story of a hitman's wish to go straight and a policeman's unshaken dedication in catching him. It is as perfect as a film gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a movie","review":"More hong kong action from the greats. You really should see this movie if you're into hong kong action. The shoot outs are great, and the action is incredible. I also really love the story. Also, you can really see alot of John Woo's tradmarks appear in this movie, like the use of dove's and religion. A great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film but....","review":"Before you purchase this DVD be warned: The sound is in MONO format. Yep... that's right. MONO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"!John Woo's Masterpiece!","review":"This is the movie which cemented John Woo as probably the worlds best action director. After the runaway success of A Better Tommorrow in 1986, Woo proved he wasnt a one time hit by making this masterpiece. The Killer is probably one of the most voilent movies made, with Chow Yun Fat playing the swauve hitman Jeffrey. Woo manages to blend hi octane action and violence with the themes of honour and betrayal which concoct to create one of the most memorable endings ever recorded onto film. The choreography by Chui Sui Tung is excellent creating some amazing action sequences and the script (written by Woo himself) is also excellent. Woo named this film his baby and rightly so as it established him as a player and later paved the way to Hollywood for him. Watching The Killer just once is not enough and it'll simply blow you away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has everything","review":"You laugh, you say, \\"Whoa cool!,\\" you cry, but mostly you say, \\"whoa Cool!\\" Anyways...Jeffrey (Chow) is a hired killer and is pretty cool. Until one killer evening, he accidently blinds a nightclub singer, and does one last job to pay for her eye operation. Howvever, things don't go as planned, when both sides of the law are after him.Logic does not play a big part of this movie, action does. So don't go expecting a realistic movie, instead expect a supurbly done action-drama. The last scene in the church is one for the record books. The best part of the movie (in my humble opinion of course) is when the Mary statue is blown up and this very sad music plays, very good. Another great masterpiece from the collaberation of John Woo/Chow Yun-Fat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killer","review":"\\"The Killer\\" ranks as one of my personal favorites. Through all of John Woo's masterful direction of realistic action and shoot-outs, a simple but emotional story remains, one between Jeffrey (Chow Yun-Fat) and Jenny (Sally Yeh) the nightclub singer he accidentally blinded. Another is the interaction between Danny Lee and Chow Yun-Fat. It sounds campy and formulaic, but turns out to be emotional and very touching, in which a true friendship forms between the killer and cop. Chow Yun-Fat is one of my favorite actors, and undeniably, one of the coolest around, and definately is one of the elements that elevates the film to greatness. The action scenes are superbly done, with a biting sense of realism attached to them. The film is well-writtten, without one senseless moment, and Lowell Lowe's music is quite memorable. This is John Woo's best film to date and one of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"RE-ISSUE!!!!!","review":"I don't know much about the secondary \\"market\\" for DVD's, but when I look to buy a copy of \\"The Killer\\" on amazon, I am filled with disgust. $300.00 for a copy of a !@&%$*@ DVD?

Then there is the trick of showing people in one room through the doorway from another room. Effi ALWAYS talks gently and sweetly, regardless of the occasion.

The author explores the events leading up to the Cultural Revolution, how and why it happened, and the aftermath of a tragic decade in Chinese history. Because this book is based on interviews conducted with people who lived through the Cultural Revolution, it gives a lot of insight into what was going on in the minds of the Chinese populace.

Not only is the movie a downer, it also is unable to truly find a genre or its own niche. It's the kind of movie that has unidentifiable characters and an air of absurdity about it, although it's only really an exaggeration of what undoubtedly does take place. At the end of the day, The Omen succeeds much better in the psychological thriller that describes evil children.

The second half of the movie goes in all sorts of different directions. The ending leaves more questions than you started with.

The characters sometimes smoke and sometimes they yell. There is some running. The characters get rearranged and their roles change throughout the movie. They all win something, lose something. They all change. At the end, Joshua plays the piano. There is a lot of piano music in this movie.

A lot of people don't know this but there were only supposed to be two seasons of Prison Break and that was it, but the ratings were so high that's why there shooting season 3.

The action and twists were SO relentless that sometimes they got tedious, but it kept you coming back for more.Every episode has a cliffhanger... and it is being continued in Season 3. THAT is the PROBLEM.Season 3 added one disgusting TWIST too many... After investing so much time and money in this show they pushed the \\"edgy\\" factor too far and killed one too many MAIN characters.

But once it begins to pick up pace, it just become hard to stop watching. This season, there are several other sub-plots to support the Michael-Lincoln main storyline. We also get to peep further into the conspiracy, which hopefully becomes clearer in Season 3.However die-hard fans of Michael may find that he had to share the limelight with other people this season, unlike the case where he being the sole backbone in last sesaon. This is because this time, the rest of the original characters were given a more in-depth analysis.

Tough sometimes, charming sometimes.Beautiful Loretta Young holds her own as Cagney's \\"girl\\".A little \\"fun fact\\": Cagney speaks fluent Yiddish in his opening scene. I lived for many years in Switzerland where \\"Swiss German\\" is spoken. Well I was shocked to hear Cagney speaking what I thought was Swiss German! Who knew? But found out it was Yiddish which is very close to Swiss German.Cagney also displays his dancing talents with a mean Foxtrot, and a short tap dance.Enjoyed the story and acting.

But, sadly, they don't back it up with anything to put some meat on the film's bones. The script just wanders, the acting is terribly amateurish, and the camerawork just clunks. Worst of all, the film's treatment of women is unintentionally hysterical and borderline offensive. The funniest moment on the DVD? Watch the interview with the lead actor... he thinks he's Tom Cruise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Hour","review":"May be one of the most listless films ever made.

On a recommendation I rented this (unfortunately my list of movies to watch doesn't tell me who told me to see them, or I'd never speak to them again). It was AWFUL. The acting was very amateur (that's an insult to amateurs actually, I've seen some home movies that are better than this); The directing is almost nonexistent: two characters are often scrunched together (on a couch or standing) so closely so they fit in the frame-- looks very unnatural. The story... hah! I think most of it was adlibbed... and quite poorly. Most of the dialogue is so forced and fake that it's sickening... and to top it off, most of the dialogue doesn't relate to the story AT ALL.

Actually, my original vinyl LP was the english language variant with lyrics by Peter Hammill (is that version available anywhere?). And while I was a huge Hammill and VDGG fan I found the lyrics very clumsy and a detriment to the music. Hearing the original version now (even though I don't speak Italian)I realize what a good prog album this was.

Understated acting - like having a window into what an English seaside town was really like during the \\"War to End all Wars.\\" It's not a series about the war, but more an original take on the impact WWII had on a small town as the residents just go about their daily lives. The attention to accurate historical detail is meticulous.

How ridiculous! Such a question would never occur on current AP exams.Pre-calculus questions used to appear regularly on the AP exam back in the 1980's and 90's. But you won't be asked to regurgitate things like the sine double-angle formula on the 2007 AP exam.

This band is like nothing else I've ever heard, and this album is my favorite.

Just as beautiful as a thunderstorm rolling across the land on the horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoots high, falls flat","review":"Conveying a mystique that is not musically there, this Cocteau-Dead Can Dance lift only mimics a few hallowed principals, usually at the expense of much artistic integrity. The increasingly-grating, female-baby-like vocal deliveries only compliment these attempts at haunting melodic minimalism when the songwriting somehow stands up- which it usually does not. With some refinement, and perhaps a more informed musical vocabulary this could have been something special, as brief signs of darkened life shimmer beneath the plodding craftsmanship enough to appease fans of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got a question.....","review":"In as much as this book is out of print and I don't actually have it...

Its best writers possess the skills of both writing styles. Chekhov was such a writer. His short stories provide a revealing glimpse of pre-Bolshevik-Revolution Russia, which in many ways doesn't seem to have changed much: stark, gray, cold, dysfunctional. He was able to sculpt three-dimensional characters, scene-scapes, and storylines that cause emotional reaction in readers. To read Chekhov is to feel.While I found myself distracted by the Russian character names, the aging writing style, and my ambivalence toward short fiction, it's impossible to read these stories without great appreciation for the man's talent and his contribution to America's understanding of Russian culture and the world of literature in general.

I'm fortunate my local grocery stores have a reasonable array of organic foods; the tiny local Asian market had most of the rest, and I made a trek to Whole Foods for the two items I couldn't find locally.

I have made many of these recipes for my family and friends and also for people undergoing cancer treatments. Each recipe has been a complete joy to try, because the food is just so incredibly good!

Good beam. The problem that I have with this one is that is feels like they put the wrong shroud on it. It's the same size case as they put on the Pelican SabreLIte 2000 Flashlight. When I turn the light off all it takes is another half of a turn and the shroud pops off. You can even see the O-ring. As it sits I wouldn't see this being submersible at all.I did e-mail Pelican about this issue. They said, \\"you shouldn't have to turn the shroud that far to turn the light off.\\" I'm going to send it back and see how well the replacement works.

I use it on my desktop and laptop computers.The problem that some are experiencing with it just one day not working has to do with the receiver piece. MS made these with 2 different receivers - one an \\"J\\" shape, and one a straight stick.The \\"J\\" shape receivers have a problem where if you happen to turn the piece all the way around a couple of times (very easy to do if you're not paying attention when you put it away), it snaps the wiring inside the receiver.If you get the straight receiver, you should never have this problem.All in all, I LOVE this mouse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"Neat mouse, works instantly when receiver plugged into USB slot.

Worked great, easy to connect, battery lasted about two months.Then yesterday it died. The scroll wheel stopped scrolling. It feels like it's stripped.

I think I may have only changed the battery 4 times, and it does everything a mouse should do. The grooves for your fingers are surprisingly comfortable, though the scroll wheel does have an annoying click to it.For those with a Mac, the right click does work which is very handy, and because the scroll wheel also acts as a 3rd button, you can program it right in the system preferences to activate Expose or any such program, again, extremely handy.For the money, it's a great mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"It died on me, but I really like it...","review":"I bought this same mouse 6 months ago - I used the heck out of it and it died a few weeks ago. It just quit working for no apparent reason. Now, I really liked this mouse - especially for use with a laptop because it is ultra-portable with a nifty little place to store the USB. Despite doing extensive comparison shopping for my next mouse, I decided on this one again (not sure if that says more about me or the mouse...). When it comes down to it, this mouse really suits my needs, I know what to expect from it, and it is inexpensive. I may have to lay out $22 every 6 months, but at least the intervening months are not spent grumbling over a mouse that I am not satisfied with."},{"rating":"2","title":"New USB receiver fixes problems","review":"The most important feature to mention is that Microsoft has replaced the repair-prone adjustable USB receiver with a small receiver (no moveable parts) that looks like a flash drive. It DOES NOT have the rotating section shown in the product pictures. This should solve all of the repair issues mentioned in so many other reviews below.Fits my hand very well - incredibly comfortable. I have had no reception issues, and the precision control is quite good. I highly recommend this mouse for laptop users, which is, after all, the target market. Desktop users may find it somewhat less user friendly since you have to remove the USB receiver from the computer and plug it into the bottom of the mouse to prevent battery drain. If your desktop USB ports are not easily accessible, this could be an issue. Laptop users will love this mouse, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke","review":"lasted 6 months and stopped working.

But I am on my 2nd mouse of this particular design. Great idea! HORRIBLE design! And I think they designed it this way knowing what would happen so as to increase sales.So what happened?? The USB dongle broke both times....it's all in the design. The dongle is essentially 2 peices, and the outer peice pivots (maybe for better communication with the mouse?...nah!!). The problem with the pivoting part is that it goes so far, and then breaks. The wires BREAK internally if you go beyond that point. Did Miscrosoft implement some kind of safety stop on the housing? Of course not!!BOYCOT!!They do make another one that is one peice...I will probably exchange my broken one for this (if I can - it's been a few months)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wasted purchase","review":"purchased this mouse as a replacement for my laptop mouse which stopped working. unlike that mouse, this one only seems to want to work on a pad or similarly textured surface.

But soon you will see that it makes the cursor on any word processing program jump around, especially email (Outlook Express).

From the start it has been reluctant to switch on. This won't bother you if a desktop user, but having a laptop, it has finally become intolerable for me. The on/off switch is located under the mouse; when transporting the laptop, you remove the USB dongle and slot it under the mouse for storage; this switches the mouse off. Unfortunately, when you remove the USB dongle from the mouse (placing the dongle into your laptop port) the mouse remains off. I have tried remedies such as replacing battery, warming the battery with body heat, warming the mouse, flicking the on/off switch. All work with varying degrees of success. This weekend has been the last straw as it has taken me 3 days of jiggling, till finally it came back to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for laptop mouse","review":"My wife likes it and it was cheap to boot.It has held up well with use and is small and easy to use for travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"In looking at previous reviews, I was fairly confident this was going to be a great mouse.

It features smooth operation, and is a handy alternative to the built-in finger pad on the computer.

Great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Wireless Notebook Mouse!","review":"This is by far the best mouse I have ever used with a notebook. The size is perfect.

But its demand for mouse pad and wire gets in the way.2. wired mini optical mouse are good. But again, wire limits me.3. wireless mini optical mouse is the best fit. But unlike its desktop cousins, a good one is hard to find. There is matter of design, egonomic, battery, power conservation, and connectivity. I tried many brands, most are okey, but none impressed me until I got this.It is small, yet egonomically well designed so that it feels good in my hands. Very comfortable. It only requires one battery, and conserves power well. Its receiver can be mated to the mouse to shut it down and for ease of carry. It simply works just by plugging in, no fuss.Overall, I am very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after short time","review":"This mouse only lasted about two months - i changed the batteries etc but the receiver itself is not giving out a signal, so i guess i am just sol. i do not recommend it at!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POS Mouse","review":"Typical Microsoft product, worked for about a month and then started acting up.

While it functioned excellent at the beginning, over the last couple of months I've noticed that it started to react slowly as I used it, like the battery power was low (even with a fresh battery). After just under 6 months, the right-click has completely stopped functioning. You'd think the left click would wear out faster than the right click since I use that constantly, but the right-click has completely failed to even 'click', let alone function. Not sure the cost of returning it to Microsoft would warrant repair or replacement, I'll just buy a new one - only this time I'll follow the lead of others and go with Logitech since they do seem to be built 'sturdier'.

I really don't know how it got the good ratings. I am very disappointed in it. First of all, the USB transmitter is about twice the size of the Logitech mouse that I had. I'm always hitting it with my arm while I work. The worst part is that it keeps falling out of sync with the mouse and stops working, even though the mouse is about 6 inches from the transmitter.It's very possible that I just got a bad one, but I would suggest paying a little more for something that will work well right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad purchase","review":"Poor product.

When I received it, I plugged it in and started using it - no hassles of installation. I think it is wonderful! It only requires one \\"AA\\" battery that is 'disabled' when the USB adapter is placed in the crevice on the bottom of the mouse. It conveniently travels in the laptop case as one piece - it is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse, great price","review":"I received this mouse a few days ago and I already love it. I had a little trouble getting it to sync at first, but after looking online I saw the suggestion of having the mouse about a foot away when you're trying to sync and that worked. Other than that it's been easy to use and travel with. I love the color and the shape. I had been wanting this mouse for awhile, but it was more expensive at all the stores I'd seen it at. I had been trying to use an older mouse that wasn't wireless, but finally got fed up with it, especially for traveling. I was just using the touch pad on my laptop, but I missed having the scroll wheel. This was definitely worth the investment.As for the review that said they couldn't switch the buttons for a left-handed person, that's something that you have to switch in your computers control panel options for you mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"works ok....for a short while","review":"I have owned two of these now. Each works fine for about a month and then something happens with the usb receiver that causes it not to work properly. Its like something happens that makes it unable to connect after youve taken it in and out of a usb slot for a month. Then what happens is you have to constantly jiggle the receiver to get it to connect properly. After a while its not worth the trouble. So if you dont mind investing $30 every 2 months for this mouse, then go ahead and purchase.. I dont know if other mice are the same way, but I will consider a return to mice with wires if they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Rodent","review":"I bought this mouse to replace my previous destroyed wireless mouse.

In fact, you get over the mouse itself within seconds of use-- you just use it. Move your hand to a spot on your surface, and the pointer moves there. No fancy features to deal with, no extra buttons to accidentally push. Your interaction with the pointer is thoughtless, as it should be.The resolution of this mouse is top notch. Response rivals corded mice. And as always, Microsoft delivers with the solid feel, fantastic wheel, and nice clicks that I've come to expect.Being an input aficionado, I bought the Logitech Cordless MX Laser mouse to replace this one. I thought it felt nice at the store, and I could always use a few more buttons!Not 3 hours later and I was back to the Microsoft.

I replaced the battery and it still doesn't help. So I think it's either the loose contact on the stupid designed L-shape receiver or the USB interface that has broken..so disappointing.My other optical mouse, the cheap Logitech wired mouse (300 Baht=US$10) one still works fine after hard uses for several years !!

Microsoft acts like there is nothing wrong with it and there are no helpful suggestions anywhere on the web that actually work. I tried to use it on a new HP laptop with Windows Vista 64 bit. The buttons work sort of, but you can't see a pointer anywhere so the mouse is useless. Before running it over with my van I tested in on my older Dell laptop with Windows XP Pro, and that didn't work either, except intermittently for a nanosecond at a time. I've replaced the batteries with several kinds of brand new alkalines, I've pressed the ridiculously tiny little white buttons over and over again, and I've downloaded and installed and uninstalled and reinstalled until my head ached, and that was before the hangover it drove me to.

The left and right buttons sound cheap. The battery compartment opens in a cheap way. I'm a big \\"wheel user\\" for scrolling, and it's NOT a smooth scroll - it's like there's a ratchet/cog in there. What you're scrolling \\"jumps\\" - I even downloaded Intellipoint 7.0 (the latest version) - that doesn't fix it - even with the slowest scroll.

The mouse functions great. I was unaware of the other similar mice that had much smaller USB plug ins, or I would not have bought this one to replace the broken Microsoft one. I would highly recommend you look at others instead of this one with the smaller plug ins that are less likely to break or bend. The plug in with this one is an accident waiting to happen.

This is much less noticable in regular windows apps and shouldn't bug anyone, but if you play FPS games, you're not going to like it.The delay is not caused by the laptop or the game as the laptop is a highly upgraded HP Pavilion zd8000 and the games work great with a corded USB mouse.

I did not understand the reason. my older logitech mouse is still working although i bought it 2 years ago. it made poorly and it just stop working this week. it is not dependable and no long term investment. It was my first microsoft mouse experience and i will never buy again unless they make dependable mouses not for just two months. I wish they made it dependable otherwise it is a great comfort having it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Mouse","review":"I like the sise of this mouse, and the usb connector is smaller than some.The only bad thing I have to say is the battery does not last as long as they say it will.

I like the responce and the mouse buttons, it fits my hand well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft junk","review":"This mouse is the worst I have ever used. This goes beyond the trackball that was full of cat hair type bad mouse. I plugged it in and I can't use it more than a foot away from the device I'm trying to control. As in, I'm a foot and a half away from the receiver and it won't work. I have no interest in fighting with this device when a logitech will just work with no problems.DO NOT BUY or BUYER BEWARE.No description on the box or any information that would lead me to believe it should act this poorly.Again, DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"This mouse worked great at first..... but within the first week i started having issues. The mouse refused to turn on after I removed the usb plug from the base but after some wiggling of the sensor-switch, i got it to work. Now, sometimes i have to flick my mouse really hard to get it to turn on. even if it turns on, the computer will frequently not register its connection. Based on the reviews, i have an out of the ordinary mouse.... but be wary. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"As it gets older","review":"I bought my optical mouse about a year ago. I was very happy with my puchase back then, but as I began to use the mouse I started to notice one glaring problem. The clip used to secure the wireless conector to the back of the mouse (thus shutting off the battery) just doesn't hold tight enough anymore. Therefor it leaves the battery on and the batteries lasts about a week before your replacing them again. Perhaps Microsoft needs to work out a few kinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portable mouse","review":"Excellent mouse for occasional mousing on your laptop. Mac and PC compatible. Is a little small, so after a few hours you wrist may begin to hurt. The only problem I have is that the \\"dongle\\" reciever doesn't always fit into the bottom securly, and may not switch off the mouse. Also, no mouse cover like the logitech.Overall I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"For no reason whatsoever, this product broke after I had used it for less than 4 months... I did not get my money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"Can't believe how comfortable a fit this is to use. I guess that's why they call it ergonomics. Outstanding Wireless Notebook Mouse. The best thing is when you're done, take your USB Plug-In and it snaps on the underside of the Mouse for storage and ALSO shuts off the battery of the mouse to save battery life!Excellent. Thanks Microsoft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure beats touchpads ...","review":"This mouse and the laptop mouse from Logitech are absolutely terrific innovations. The wireless USB will be the next hot thing but it's here now with this mouse and it works flawlessly. Plug in the USB adapter to a USB port, put batteries in the mouse and it works. No settings required. Just use it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, this is my third one and it stops working after a few months","review":"I either have horrible luck with Microsoft mice (not just laptop mice) or the product quality stinks as I've been through three different types of mice (the presenter mouse, and two of these mice) and they've started to be very inconsistent in performance after a few months. At first they work fine, but then after a while the mouse skips on the screen when you move it and then becomes nearly unusable. Microsoft keyboards seem to work fine, but stay clear of their mice.

It worked fine for the first several weeks, then it started working intermittently. Now it is not working all together. I am so dissappointed in the quality of this product. The receiver that snaps to the bottom of the mouse has become loose. And the scroll wheel is so deepy embedded in the mouse that it does not give you enough surface area to even move it. A friend of mine also bought this mouse and had similar problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working after 2 Weeks","review":"The mouse worked fine, except a little jumpy for my taste, for about two weeks and then stopped working entirely. I changed the battery and still couldn't get it to work. I called Microsoft and asked to return it, rather than replace it, because I had originally purchased it mistakenly thinking it was a Bluetooth mouse. They were polite and understanding over the phone and assured me I would get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"New model not as good","review":"Unlike the product title, the reviews here are meant for the Wireless Optical Mouse, which looks identical, but not the newer 3000 as indicated by the name. While identical looking, they are vastly different. The 3000 has an improved 6-month battery life (which is the only plus). The new model removed rotatable antenna on the USB dongle, which is really bad. Even short distance, these mice still experience interference every now and then. With the older model, you can rotate the antenna and get a better reception instantly, but with the new model the only option is to try to move it to another USB port. The 3000 model also has \\"improved\\" tracking precision, which means very erratic unprovoked spantaneous movements of the pointer in real life. Lastly, the wheel is not \\"clicky\\" as the older model and much tighter. Overall, most of good things which made the older model very popular are no longer in the newer 3000 model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok at first but not as hardy as Logitech","review":"Had 2 MS mice fail this model and the MSK-1058.

It's small, light way, and requires only one AAA battery, which lasts forever.

It worked great until last week when it just stopped working. I replaced the battery three times with newly recharged, and then brand-new batteries, to no avail.

But I find it annoying that it's suddenly landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Iffy","review":"After all the hype of the wireless mouse, I decided to figure I'd go for the best known brand. Microsoft. Come to find out, their product, which I paid about thirty dollars for, is cheap. The USB receiver broke and I found myself trying to fiddle with it to get it to work. It's really a waste of time and definitely not a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Pretty nice mouse.

The rubber coating where my thumb resides has started to deteriorate and peel off after just a few months of usage. The mouse wheel is smooth in the backwards motion but clunks when changing direction to a forward motion. It's a fair mouse that is fine for periodic usage but not for daily use. There are better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic","review":"Problems : The range on this mouse is very limited, the battery life is short (The mouse seems to always be on. The only time the light goes off is when the dongle is plugged into the base), and best for last... all you have to do is look at the dongle the wrong way and it disconnects from the mouse.Pro : It doesn't cost much."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I bought a pink one, it is fast, smaller than expected but I am not having any problems with that. Before buying I did not noticed that this was a laptop mouse, but because my monitor has a USB connector, I am not having any problems using it.

I believe all products should come with frustration-free packing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second one I've bought","review":"On a trip this last spring, I took my mouse out of the laptop bag and it wouldn't work. Since I would be staying at my mom's for a couple of weeks, I decided to order a new one from Amazon. I ordered this Microsoft Optical mouse because from the description it sounded like it would be perfect for a travel mouse for my laptop. It came in a few days and worked flawlessly and smooth. It's coming on Christmas time, so I decided to get one for my wife for her notebook. She likes using mine alot so I thought it would be perfect for her. It's a great little mouse and feels good in your hand. The USB receiver snaps right into it for easy stowing.

I wouldn't recommend it to people with large hands as the mouse is pretty small. Also, it loses connection frequently so I would have to replug the USB stick, which occurs often when I accidentally hit the USB receiver. As long as the connection is there, it seems pretty great. The USB receiver is quite large and this may hinder the other USB slots. I know this is the case for me, since my laptop only has 3 USB slots.After a year of using this, I would stronlgy recommend a mouse with a micro-USB receiver. That's what I did, and I've stopped using the Microsoft mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse, but alittle problem","review":"I'd say this is a great mouse, but the only cons about this product is that if you happen to accidentally shake/wiggle the usb.

But, less than a month after I purchased it from TigerDirect, it stopped working! My computer just doesn't recognize it, and the little light on the end of it doesn't light up anymore. Three days ago, it was working intermittenly... and two days ago, it worked the same way... and today it's out of business. What a waste of money.

The design may be OK, but the build and materials are terrible. The first one stopped working after dropping a few feet to the floor. But, since it worked fine until the fall, I bought a second; what a huge mistake! First, the urethane grip reacted under use. Disgustingly, a big blister of liquid formed in the urethane and started oozing from the mouse. Good god--what is this freakish stuff?! Taking a scalpel, I lanced the mouse boil and kept using it, hoping the ooze wasn't harmful. Unfortunately, the problems didn't end there. Now, the USB contacts on the wireless adapter are failing.

I tried a new battery, although the battery that was in it was also supposed to be new, to no avail. I tried using different usb ports, but it never changed. I got about 5 minutes of uninterrupted use out of it when I took my wife's plain, black $5 mouse pad to use. Five minutes later the problems returned.Microsoft makes some good and bad products.

I hesitated on spending the money, but figured the Microsoft name meant quality, so I went for it. Unfortunately their mouse is buggy just like many of their applications. When it worked it was comfortable, easy to use, and I especially liked how the receiver snapped into the bottom of the mouse when not in use. Unfortunately getting it to work was a headache. It ate batteries and I usually had to hit the 'connect' button to make it recognize that it was connected. Today it apparently gave up the ghost and is working no longer...no new battery or fiddling seems to be bringing it back. Sad.

This one did all of that for its limited lifespan. It conformed to my hand, and the reciever tucked neatly in the slot built into the mouse. It worked flawlessly, and linked quickly to other computers I linked it to as well. However, after about four months of use, it decided to work sporatically, then not even connect to the reciever. I think this had to do with the reciever, not the mouse itself. Otherwise, not much to say about it. Buy it if you just want it for a short term thing, otherwise there are better options.PS: Battery life was great-I never had to replace the battery once during the 4 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOYCOT this product!!!","review":"Kinda harsh heading, I know. But I am on my 2nd mouse of this particular design. Great idea! HORRIBLE design! And I think they designed it this way knowing what would happen so as to increase sales.So what happened?? The USB dongle broke both times....it's all in the design. The dongle is essentially 2 peices, and the outer peice pivots (maybe for better communication with the mouse?...nah!!). The problem with the pivoting part is that it goes so far, and then breaks. The wires BREAK internally if you go beyond that point. Did Miscrosoft implement some kind of safety stop on the housing? Of course not!!BOYCOT!!They do make another one that is one peice...I will probably exchange my broken one for this (if I can - it's been a few months)."},{"rating":"1","title":"this mouse is not good","review":"it is not sensitive, very slow and time consuming to move the cursor on the screeen.I have to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 STARS!!!","review":"This is a great little mouse that is design specifically for travelers and laptop owners!!!

I've had the Microsoft mouse for about 3 weeks and just bought another Logitech to replace it. In fairness to Microsoft, I'm using this on a laptop running Linux, not Windows.I plugged it in, Linux picked it up and all seemed fine. But the range is VERY poor, it frequently loses connectivity (even at a short distance from the receiver) and I needed to reset it on a regular basis. Frequently the cursor will track the mouse but the buttons don't respond. Frequently the motion sensor seems confused by my desktop (which is faux wood) and cursor tracking is a random event.Overall, I've found this mouse to be worth disposing of -- not much more. My experience with Logitech has been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mouse - Great Battery Life","review":"I use this every day and have replaced the battery once in the last four months.

While it tracks faily well, its ability to register clicking is arbitrary and frustrating. It will click along fine for a while, and then for no obvious reason, it won't register a click no matter how I try. To get it working again, I have to remove the battery, unplug the usb, reinsert everything and then hope for the best.There are also two design components I dislike about this mouse. First, the usb connector is quite large compared to the connector on the Logitech optical mouse. This one is long, like a large thumb drive, and it's easy for it to get bumped or jostled as it sticks way out of the laptop. Second, this mouse has no on/off switch. The only way to power it down intentionally is to take out the battery. The Logitech optical mouse has such a switch.Owning both the Microsoft and the Logitech optical mouses (mice?), I strongly recommend the Logitech over the Microsoft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great USB Mouse","review":"This is a great USB mouse for a laptop.

As a result the Logitech 4 times longer.Secondly, the mouse is very unresponsive at times. I don't know if it has a sleep mode or goes into power save mode, but it doesn't track well at times and is sluggish then \\"wakes up\\".

It has two buttons and a scroll wheel. Plug the snap-in receiver and start using the mouse straight away. Battery life is also good; with daily use a single AA cell lasts between 6-10 months.However... a measure of the quality of the device has to be also based on longevity. Two years after purchasing this mouse, one fine morning its left-click button stopped working. I tried turning off and back on the mouse, changed the battery, gave it a rest and tried again, dusting the mouse to remove any dust or particles that may have found its way in. To no avail. The button has simply stopped working. Two years is pitifully less. I have mice from the 1990s that still work.

It has a three-year warranty, so I called Microsoft and they are refunding my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Good Long Term","review":"I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The \\"L\\" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive.I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"mouse Range","review":"As I saw someone ask about its range.this notebook mouse'range about 3feet or less(from the manual)but in desktop wireless mouse would range just 6feet or less(from manual) but I used desktop wireless mouse and it seems to range more than 10feet to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mouse...when it works","review":"I bought this mouse a few months ago and was mostly satisfied with it. It plugs in and the computer recognizes it in a matter of seconds, which is nice. Sometimes the left click was a little unresponsive, but it never really bothered me. The range is not that great, as the usb had to be plugged into the front of the pc rather than the back to work. Just a few days ago, the mouse completely stopped working. The laser appears to be stuck on and it won't connect with the computer. Microsoft's suggested \\"fixes\\" sometimes make it start working again, but after only a few minutes it goes back to doing the same thing. I would not recommend this product if it will only work for a few months before breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaws","review":"After a few months of use, the left click became intermittent, probably some dust problem, because after cleaning with cleaning fluid it worked again ... for a while. Also the battery mounting is a poor design. The contact spring is at the wrong end (Pos. side), toy designers know better. Occasionally I have to bang the mouse because of intermittent contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"MICROSOFT WIRELESS NOTEBOOK MOUSE","review":"Decent price, although I am sure a percentage is INCLUDED for MR BILL GATES and the REDMOND conglomerate.

It did not install on my mac OS1.6 very well; I got a message to call support. Like I'm going to spend hours on the phone for a mouse. It must be used with a mice pad otherwise it does not slide easily. The scrolling and was too fast. IHMO, bluetooth is superior USB for mice. I knew that. Other vendors have a superior bluetooth solution. Why did I waste my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Love this mouse, does exactly what it's supposed to do. Just plug it into your USB and you're good to go! Simple, compact, take it anywhere. I highly recommend this product. My boyfriend has the same one, he says the battery life isn't that great, but I've had the same battery for over 3 months and no complaints. I would purchase this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... when it works...","review":"I imagine this would be a decent mouse for someone on a flight or when their mouse will be no more than 2 feet (3 feet is a gross over estimate) from the USB dongle. Over 2 feet things get quirky. Unless you are on a full battery your mouse may not respond to clicks and may lag. It doesn't help that it takes about a week from installing a new battery to get to this point. The sides of the mouse also wear down easily and the cheap rubber starts to peel away after about a month of use. Not a pretty sight. The dongle is also one of the larger ones on the market and will cause your mouse to act up if anything brushes up against it.If you want a cheap wireless mouse for a trip or as a temporary solution, then I'd say go for it. But if you want a long term, reliable mouse for office use, then I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already been through two","review":"I originally bought one and liked it. It was relatively inexpensive and did its job. After that one broke for no reason I decided i would but the same one again. BIG MISTAKE. The second one broke too and I dont intend to buy another microsoft mouse ever again.Negatives:If you even touch the usb connector it starts blinking signaling you disrupted the connection and you now need to take it out and put it back it which is annoying.The mouse stays on all the time. I see the red glow from the bottom when im laying in bed.It makes a small beep noise every time you use it. The beep is very low but if you have no music on or anything and are sitting in silence you can definitely hear it a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"these work great","review":"This is my third (and fourth) purchase of this product. One of the really nice features of this mouse is the ability to store the flash drive in the bottom of the mouse when not in use. The range is good, too. I have not had to replace any batteries yet and I have been using one of these for over a year. I use one with my desktop and one on my laptop. The two I bought this time were gifts. Both recipients are very pleased with the performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it's great; however . . .","review":"The mouse worked fine for a couple of months, then it started to go bad. Sometimes it works, other times it'll balk. It always balk when I'm doing something important. I'd have to pull out and reinsert the USB receiver several times to get it to work again. I've changed the battery several times so that's not the problem. Since I was getting frustrated with it, I went back to using a wired mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"My roommate's broke, then mine broke!","review":"My roommate's mouse broke (she had the older L shaped receiver)... and I thought it was because she's bad with technology. But I'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment... and even mine broke (a few months later, I had a straight receiver). It just gave up on me. Not a battery issue. More like a connection issue.Now I read all these reviews about it breaking on people. Well, I'll write back when my other roommate's break, and when my cousin's break.Don't get me wrong... but it was great while it lasted. Less than half a year. Gonna go back to my Logitech.

I'm sooo frustrated.I 'd not recommend buying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reciever designed by people who don't know design","review":"I just have a problem with the design of the reciever. I bought this at Best Buys and I returned it instantly. I think people who think that functionality must be incorporated into design and that functionality must be obvious will like it. I rather not have it fold and be so obvious that in order for it to be a proper antennae, it must fold. I think tech geeks will probably think it's cool. I think the folding antennae does add to the reception distance (maybe by inches), but I don't plan on using my mouse 10 feet away from my laptop.Also, I would have liked a rubber scrollwheel instead of cheap plastic.I ended up getting the Logitech V200. The reciever of the Logitech simply is a stub. And it works fine. Looks like a memory stick. No folding, no green light, no moving parts, no odd shapes for it to be bumped in to and break easier, just a simple little stick that protrudes a bit. 1 year battery life on the V200, not sure about the MS mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used product sale indicating that they are new","review":"I bought 7 supposedly mouse new, but i when verifies the product, i see that 2 of them were not of equal model that i which it buys, that was used and they did not work.I'm report to this situation at seller, but say to me that i must send product.

Took it out of the box, popped the USB receiver in my laptop and it was ready to go- worked flawlessly. The receiver snaps onto the back of the mouse so it's very easy to travel without worrying about losing it. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not have a power button and I am worried it's going to drain the battery when I am not using it. Of course, I could take the receiver out of the computer but then that does not seem very practical and defies the whole purpose of a wireless mouse. I would have liked it to have some kind of a button to shut the mouse off when not in use. Other than that, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not order from this vendor","review":"When I ordered this product it was in stock but took nine days to arrive. I should have gone to the store and purchased it rather then paying $4.99 for shipping. The vendor apologized and told me that if I removed my negative feedback, they would refund my shipping costs.

The appearance and the color of the mouse are nice, but it does not work very well. The click sound is kind of noisy. What's worse is the scroll wheel. It makes a loud noise when it scrolls up. It is not as bad when I [scroll down].The mouse is very precise when it comes to moving around the page. You have to refocus your spot several times before it can locate the exact spot you are getting at. Comparing with the other Logitech notebook mouse I have, the Microsoft mouse is more poorly made. The USB transmitter is too long and does not fit on to the mouse nicely. The worst part of all is that it does not work even on a flat desk surface. I had to use a notebook as a mouse pad for it to function.My recommendation is to spend a little more money and get a better mouse. You will regret if you get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"microsoft mouse 3000","review":"the product compared to my swiss gear, is excellent. dont use my old one anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"This mouse sucks.","review":"at first this mouse worked great. The problems started to appear on the next start up after I installed the mouse. The new hardware installation wizard started to appear and continue doing so every time I restart the computer. All it takes is just cancel that wizard, but it's annoying.But that's not even a problem. The problem is that the roller wheel broke and did not respond and wasn't making those clicking sounds anymore on the 4th day after I purchased it. I had to take it back to the store and exchange it. So far the second mouse works, but that installation wizard still keep appearing no matter what I tried to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first - Then not so good.","review":"I bought this mouse about 6 - 8 months ago.

I plugged in the receiver to my USB port and that was that. It has a good feel to it and the wireless operation worked perfect. I am not a big fan of the touch pad mouse on laptops, and this makes life much easier when I use it. There are newer models that have a nano receiver (that I also own), but if that is not an issue or need, this mouse stands up to Microsoft's reputation for quality and ease of operation. Plus, the color is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3000","review":"I have used a Logitech mouse with my laptop previously. They have been great.

I had several Taruses that my mom gave to me and they ate batteries and had connectivity problems. This mouse is great i bought it on feb 28 and received it two days later and now at the middle of march i have not replaced the batteries yet which is an improvement to the others. Also i literally put the batteries in plugged in the receiver and that was it in seconds it was ready to go. It shuts itself off and the receiver at 2 in long is a bit big but it does have a spot on the mouse for storage when needed. My son uses it easily and if you are left handed and need to change the buttons just go to the mouse setting in devices and printers and click the button that says switch buttons for left hand use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best wireless mouse ever built","review":"When I saw this product posted for sell I had to get it.

Microsoft is supposed to make good stuff, right? It has worked erratically all this time and now won't work at all. I have changed the battery several times during the past few months and again today. I went to tech support for Microsoft. Guess what? It costs $35 to get email help. More than this mouse cost!!!! I had already used their trouble-shooting guide and it didn't fix the problem. While I was looking at trouble-shooting issues, I found out that the mouse was the reason I hadn't been able to get my screen saver to work. I may never buy Microsoft hardware again.

Private Room by Avant is full from top to bottom with it. Avant is the voice of ghetto love, hands down. This cd can calm me down from track one to 16 no matter my mood. He has features Olivia, and production from mostly Stizzle, who was the major producer on his last cd too. The hottest track on this cd is the single, Read Your Mind, which is good enough to make you get it. It helps that there is and abundance of this on the cd. Go cop this, for real for real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck at the Line","review":"This CD is better than Ecstasy which, as you know gave us ALL side affects. But compared to My Thoughts (Which in my opinion, was still very much on the R. Kelly tip) it's sad. The voice is incredible, the production is GREAT, but lyrics help make a song cross the line of greatness. This whole CD aside from numbers 2,3,5,8,& 10 (15 is the remix to \\"Read Your Mind\\") is stuck at the line. So should you buy it, YES.

While I enjoyed some of the songs, the album seemed to be up and down. The second album was roughly the same. Avant had a nice voice that would work great on quality up tempo r&b; songs (much like TQ) but lyrically... most of the stuff he sings is trash (much like TQ post Never Saw Me Coming). However, there were enough good songs on Avant's albums that I decided I would take the risk and give his third album a try. BIG MISTAKE.After several playthroughs of the album, I found I could hardly remember any of the songs. Not because I have alzheimers, but because most of the songs are bland. The entire album seems to be filler track after filler track. The only track of any exception here is Wanna Be Close which I LOVE. If you can, just get that song because the album is definitely not worth its admission price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth R&B","review":"Avant has come through on this one.

Kelly songs, that's his only disadvantage, and has a couple on his new album. He has a Marvin Gaye twist to this album, and it works. But Avant hit hard with his single, Read Your Mind. Also future hits, Heaven, Hooked, Seems To Be with Olivia and Most of all, my favorite, Phone Sex (That's What's Up). I believe that I can say that this song tops, Don't Say No, Just Say Yes, the best Avant song ever. Avant blind sides everyone on this new album, I never seen it coming. Don't sleep, it's to buy, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"i really wanted to get into this cd and i find.. just ughhh.

The lead single quickly plays the back but both versions of \\"Read Your Mind\\" are sexier with the total package. A resemblance of R. Kelly with \\"Phone Sex (That's What's Up)\\" is a great addition for his voice and style. What keeps this from being classic material is the lyrics and or a signature style as the mediocre \\"Have Some Fun\\". Yet, songs like \\"Hooked\\" and the old school style fetish \\"Feast\\" are pleasers as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABC and 123 LYRICS!!!!!","review":"The album is almost great. I like 12 out of the 16 on the album 75%. Avant has a great voice the production is excellent, but he has no song writing talent period. Avant lyrics are VERY elementary.

Unfortunately, the last page of the book amplifies the overstatement of Mr clancy's role: a picture of Gen.Horner standing next to Mr Clancy, who, judging by his attire, likes to leave the impression that he was \\"there\\" himself, either aloft or as the personal advisor of Gen.

A lot of the criticism of fellow reviewers is true. To notice: - Acronymes, a lot of them you can not re-read. I missed an index.- Too few maps. Which town for example lies where? What was happening.- Perhaps Chuck Horner isn't a top writer, I did enjoy especially these parts of the book.- Perhaps Tom better had shut his mouth, I don't think he is that good a writer. The way he writes looks like he likes himself very, very much- It is somewhat an amalgamous bit of history and desert storm.

Then he gave me a come hither look when he signed the book \\"Sum of All Fears\\" and just as arrogantly didn't say anything when I complimented him on his works. This is NOT the ONLY TIME he has done this to people but has done this many times to his fans.

It reads like a vanity press effort for Gen. Horner and I don't understand why Clancy got involved. I'm sure Horner was a great and brave general (just ask him). He is certainly not an author. This book reads like a military manual. The reader must wade through mind-numbing arcania such as chain-of-command descriptions and an endless batch of acronyms. The constant ego trips of Horner (he was bright, practically everyone else was misinformed) are irritating. The theme and content were very interesting, its just too bad it was buried in such a ego-gratifying style of writing. This is my last Clancy book written in collaberation with someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Warrior's Unique Story","review":"The best part of Every Man a Tiger is the compelling voice of General Horner revealing the inside story of a revolutionary air campaign as it unfolded. General Horner, the man, the tiger, allows the reader to climb inside his head as he choreographs the human aspect of critical air operations while managing a multi-national coalition, freely admitting that the burden of failure rested with him. Indeed, destiny put the right man at the right place at the right time. All his prior training, assignments, and experiences in Vietnam and the Middle East coalesced during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In future conflicts, we will need tough, compassionate, selfless, military leaders like Chuck Horner if we are to overcome the daunting challenges that lay ahead. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy should stay away from biographies & the NFL","review":"It was bad enough when Jack Ryan was replaced by John Kelly, certainly is was worse when the NF and Tom Clancy did not team up, however, the worst was this biography. General Horner may have been brillant as a fighter pilot and a commander, but his biography is pretty boring. I say this an old \\"brown shoe\\" navy man who flew in the same era as when Horner was a young lieutenant. I can not comprehend how any one with little or no military training could even pick this tome up. Too long, too technical and a little too self agrondizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts the rubber onto the road (into the air).","review":"If you are looking for a Jack Ryan techno-adventure, this ain't for you, bucko. Other reviewers seem to have failed to look at what they bought. Like Clancy's book with Fred Franks about the US Army, this one looks at the 20 years during which the US Air Force stumbled out of Viet Nam and re-created itself into a winning military force. Yeah, Iraq wasn't the Soviet Union, but they used their weapons and, most importantly, their tactics. This behind the scenes look shows that what George Marshall said 60 years ago is still true, \\"The plan is nothing - planning is everything.\\" This book peers into the plans, means, and methods of modern air war. Read it with that in mind, not Jack Ryan, and you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have purchased, read and enjoyed every book written by Tom Clancy.

Blood Music is much more consistant, the tracks are stronger and well produced, and it has also aged much better than Whirlpool.Whirlpool to my ears always sounded like the work of a band who didn't really know what they wanted to achieve, and consequently they made a bit of a dog's dinner of their first album. Admittedly there are some great moments; the obvious examples being Breather and Pearl. But there are some very weak links too, where they really do sound like just another derivative shoegazing band trying unsuccessfully to rip off a few My Bloody Valentine riffs (and the lesser moments of MBV at that!)If all you've heard is Pearl amd you liked it, then I think you'd be happier purchasing Blood Music first.

Unlike other collars like this which glue accessories on the end of the ribbons, the jingle bells are actually tired in place. I'm not sure if this makes them more or less secure as I'm not giving me dog the opportunity to see how well they are attached. My only complaint is that these are not true to size. I measured my dog's neck as slightly less than 10 inches. The collar is elastic and relaxed is much smaller than 10 in., but it does easily stretch to that size.

Since it is comfortably around the neck, there is little reason for a dog to mess with it.The four stars are due to the fact that some of the sequins came off as she romped around, or just walked inside with company around. There are still plenty of sequins on the collar, but there were perhaps 2-3 dozen that came off. You can't tell they are missing, except that we picked them off the floor.It looks good.

Make me want to learn more about my family history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference book!","review":"This book is a great book to have in the bookshelf as a reference before you call the pediatrician. While this book does not describe how your child should develop month by month, it does describe symptoms and basic treatment for common childhood ailments (that new parents may not know about). I have found this book to be a great resource that compliments my calls to the pediatrician's office.In his first year, my son has had cradle cap, eczema, some colds, fever, roseola, and diarrhea - and the treatments suggested in this book have been right on with what the doctors' office has prescribed.I would highly reccomend this book for the new parent. It is simple to read and a great reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a useful book from such a stodgy source! :)","review":"This book is just full of useful information and it's presented in a clear and helpful way. First, a month by month guide to infant development and psychology. Then some helpful sections on child proofing your home and finally a large and valuable section on health issues and emergency care. I didn't expect the AAP to write such a handy and easy to read volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for both new & experienced parents","review":"This book has been of great help! I am a new mother and had no clue what to expect with a baby. This book will help you through just about everything from teething, eating, sleeping and behavioral developments. There is a informative section in the back of the book for common illnesses, cpr, etc..I buy this book for every baby shower I attend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I am a physician and bought this book for a family member. Luckily I didn't have it sent directly to her because I am now sending it back for a refund! I found it to be full of advice that anyone with common sense could figure out on their own. It also devotes a fair amount of space to disorders most kids will never get. My advice is: buy this for a gift if you have enough time to send it back and get something else instead if you decide you don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought this book as well as the what to expect series and i found that the What to Expect Series is much much more informative on the \\"little\\" things mom's and dad's need to know in a pinch. It goes in to much greater detail. I feel i wasted money on this book. I bought it when my first daughter was born 3 years ago and have used it twice. What To Expect whether it be first year, toddler years, etc. is much more informative.Now i have this book collecting dust.The what to expect books were cheaper too.That's my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another book","review":"I do not like this book for the one fact that it does not break it down into age groups (1 mo, 2 mo, etc.) It groups a general age together and that's it. The index in the back is not that easy to read, it has to many different sub sections and other areas to check. I would recomend the book \\"What to expect when you are expecting - the first year.\\" I got this as a gift, so I felt kind of inclined to use it, but only as a second opinion if I cannot find what I need in my other book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough \\"normal\\" information","review":"I bought this book hoping it would tell me month by month what to expect developmentally. It does do that, but the majority of the book is focused on diarrhea, sniffles, sneezes and other very specific ailments and disabilities. If I want to know about my child's ailments, I will call her pediatrician - not consult a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading.","review":"This book is really vague and just gives you brief information on different topics, stages, etc. Don't waste your time buying or reading through this book. Instead, get 'What to Expect the First Year' by Eisenberg, Murkoff, and Hathaway....this book addresses individual concerns/topics and is very informative. As a new mother, 'What to Expect the First Year' has really helped me get through some tough nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and parent-friendly","review":"I have used this book and the other two books in this series, both in my work as a parenting book author and in my \\"real life\\" as a mom of four. The books have received top marks on both fronts. Not only are the books comprehensive: they are also extremely well-organized and easy to read. I have purchased a number of copies of these books over the years for family members and friends and they have all been similarly impressed by the books. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference!","review":"This book is a great reference tool. I'm definitely glad I purchased it. However it addresses a number of months at a time (ie, one chapter is dedicated to children ages 4-7 months). We all know how different a 4 month old is from a 7 month old, so if you are looking for a month by month guide, get \\"What to Expect the First Year.\\" I own both books and consult them each for different things."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought an extra for the part-time care giver!","review":"This book was given to us by our pediatrician and thank goodness. I have found the month to month guide very helpful in anticipating phases in our child's development. I am purchasing an additional book for my mother-in-law who also cares for my son on occasion. There is so much new information on child's health since our parents were starting their families and this book is concise and clear enough for any reader to quickly find what their looking for. From general health to feeding schedules to developmental milestones this book covers it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book with only one fault","review":"This book is a MUST for every parent! It is a great source for sound information. My only complaint is that since I rely on it so much I believed it was safe to give my 13 month son a bit of bread and peanut butter. The books says it is fine at 12 months. This is not correct, it should be introduced at 3 years or earlier with Dr's advice. I should have waited, my son had a severe reaction to the peanuts. (He didn't even eat it, he spit it out!) No where in the book does it reference severe food allergies or the sometimes fatal result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"I bought this book after it was recommended by a friend. I originally just had the \\"What to expect the first year\\" book that is written in a question/answer format. This book is more of a text type of reading but is very easy to understand and very informative. I use both books because they both offer similar information. This book separates the chapters into several months at a time, while \\"what to expect\\" takes it one month at a time. I enjoy both formats so I can read ahead to see what's coming up with my baby as well as concentrate on a specific month's development."},{"rating":"2","title":"wealth of knowledge","review":"Publix gives this book as a part of its baby program. It is well worthy of all 5 stars, and it makes a perfect baby gift. It is a must-have for new parents! The book is sectioned by age group and then by issue within that age group, so it is very easy to navigate. At first it is a wealth of knowledge for the new parent and then it becomes an excellent reference item as you encounter those inevitable things with toddlers that will challenge and miff you. I've found that the solutions referenced are easily adaptable to any parenting ideology, and at the very least it offers a perspective when you have none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best parents reference around!","review":"We have 2 children, and out of all the baby books we own (many!) this is the book we turn to over and over again. Great developmental sections, and excellent medical references, as well as much more. I highly recommend this book to any parents of children under 5!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get off your ass! Not nonsense, common sense...","review":"In a market littered with fad exercise equipment and get-thin-quick snake oils, Marty Tuley's book Get Off Your Ass! is a refreshing kick in the pants.Tuley refuses to coddle his audience by telling them that the road to fitness is an easy one that can be traveled without breaking a sweat. Instead, he straightfowardly asserts the trite but true aphorism 'no pain, no gain.'At the same time, Tuley understands that the average man will reject, and in fact does not require, an overly demanding fitness regimen. He eases the reader into an exercise program that is designed to build a better life and body, not stacks of muscle.He also helps the reader learn that true fitness requires a change in lifestyle, not just sporatic trips to the gym.That said, it is important to note that Tuley's book is not for everyone. An already active person looking to enhance his training needs to look elsewhere.This book is for beginners only, but can work wonders for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good read","review":"The book is well written and a good booster to get going on a post-holiday diet and exercise regimen."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most insulting book ever!","review":"This is the most disgusting, insulting book I have ever read.

I understand that they are no longer available. I have been searching for a replacement for a large triple tube feeder and I came across this item.It is not squirrel proof!I ordered it on 8 JUN 12 and installed it upon delivery, so it has been in place less than three weeks. Squirrels have already eaten off most of the bottom tray. Thankfully the feeding stations themselves are metal or they would be gone too.I do not mind providing some feeding for squirrels, but I do mind them eating the feeder. If you have squirrels I definitely do not recommend this feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bird feeder","review":"I have own two of these bird feeders over the years, and am about to purchase my third. It is a large capacity feeder, and allows for multiple birds to feed at once from the three tubes. The feed holes have metal forms, so that when the squirrels feed, they don't chew the actual feeder. The only times I've have problems with these feeders is due to user error, not the product. My problem has been when I dropped it during cold weather, and the top \\"hood\\" will crack in the brittle weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well.","review":"This is the third 2 in 1 feeder that I have purchased. The only thing I've had an issue with is the plastic lid. It strips out the threads easily and will crack, making it useless. My birds love it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third one I've bought","review":"Over many years I have purchased this particular feeder three times. Due to nature and avoidable accidents these feeders eventually break, as they are plastic after all. But, they last long enough, perform as good as any other feeder we have owned, can handle more birds than most feeders, and are easy to re-fill and easy to use. You will get your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdfeeder","review":"This is the second of these feeders I have owned. It's a fairly good product that holds a lot of bird seed. Be cautious when removing the clear plastic top shield for filling, as a small piece of plastic is all that prevents the center rod (which holds the whole thing together) from unscrewing and coming apart. Best way to avoid the problem is to not overtighten the shield when replacing it after filling, especially in freezing weather. Our previous unit lasted about 5 years. That's probably a practical limit as UV radiation affects the clear plastic tubes resulting in cracking (either that, of the birds get carried away and \\"peck\\" holes in the tubes). The design is effective in keeping rainwater out of the birdseed in the tubes, and is large enough for reasonable intervals between fillings. A determined raccoon will defeat this feeder. I speak from experience. YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I would not recommend this bird feeder. After three months of use the top threads (where the lid screws on) cracked.

It was eerie how they spoke of things that we would not think such an ancient civilization would know about.

Within the first month of purchasing the TV, the TV began to have yellow vertical lines running the entire length of the TV. I contacted Magnavox, via telephone, and after argueing with customer service they agreed to ship me another TV. I hated the TV because:1. no matter what channel you are watching, the picture was too dark2. I had to constantly adjust the contract and tint settings depending on the channel you had it onI had this TV for only 4 months and sold it in my local newspaper for only half of what I paid for it.

I totally agree with that reviewer who emphasized this band has the enormous merit of releasing such an album during the middle of the post-punk to techo transition, just in the late 70s. This fact, in my opinion, is a high merit for the musicians who did not worry about the path rock music was taking at that moment, but kept the inspiration and spirit they had in earlier compositions, except for they put an acoustic aura on them. Lyrics in italian give this acoustic record an almost perfect atmosphere.

While More isn't my favorite song, I was excited by the b-side, You Could Be the One. Boy, was I disappointed.YCBtO is, well, cheesy. The music is good enough, standard Sisters fare, but the lyrics? Groan inducing. We all know how pompous Andrew Eldritch can be, but this was surprising, even for him. Lines like \\"You could be the one to get your flower pressed, you could be the one so get undressed\\", are just so uninspired and trite.However, seeing as how TSoM don't have many official releases, I'm giving this 4 stars just for the addition of this unknown song (although it might have been best left unreleased).Bottom line: buy it only if you're a diehard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable stories","review":"This very Canadian book by a revered Canadian icon is a collection of little stories about unusual events that happened in Canada years ago. They come from fireside chats the author originally told on TV, and then wrote down as stories. When they became popular, he published them as this book.They are all interesting stories about events I had never heard about before I read the book. An example is the race across Canada early in the last century, when five people decided to race on foot from east to west, just to see who would win. I very much enjoyed the stories and the pleasant way they are written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay, magnets!","review":"Several years ago I bought a package of 4 magnetic bag clips at a dollar store. They lasted a long time before the plastic started breaking up, so I was very happy with them and wanted to buy a new pack. However, I couldn't find them again. These are a great replacement, and although they cost a lot more than the last ones, I'm just happy to find them at all. We store them on the fridge when they aren't needed. This makes them easy to find, keeps down the clutter in kitchen drawers, and keeps them from being damaged in a drawer. I wouldn't hesitate to buy more or give them as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"Why is there no solution manual available for this book? Each section of Kreysig's text contains dozens of difficult exercises that bear little resemblance to the straight-forward sample problems. For self-study, no mass-marketed math textbook could possibly be worse. In class, using this book can often be as bad. Professors and TAs (at the University of Pennsylvania, at least) serve only to further obfuscate an already incomprehensible text. I'm not bitter because I failed the course- actually I did fairly well- but the inordinate amount of effort it takes to master this material should simply not be necessary. What is the point of having a textbook that tries to address 20 different areas of mathematics if each topic is treated so haphazardly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible excuse for an Engineering Analysis book","review":"Material is poorly presented, examples are as vague as possible and the practice problems aren't even close to relevant to the material discussed.

Sadly, the line has been broken here. In this book, the rich materials, since the book tries to encompass everything, were presented in a terribly dry and desperate way. The world is already full of miseries, so my friend, be nice to yourself and don't use this book as a textbook. Perhaps it better serves as a reference book, as some previous reviewer already pointed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever seen on engineering mathematics.

For example, partial differential equations chapter 11 does not even introduce the student to the Sturm-Lioville problem. As a physics student I do not recommend this so-called engineering text to supplement your understanding of PDEs. Its not even good as a reference. I highly recommend \\"Boundry Value Problems\\" by David L. Powers. His book treats the subject of PDEs rather wellIts fine for engineering students, i.e. cook-book approach, but not a very good text for science students"},{"rating":"1","title":"Advanced Engineering Mathematics","review":"This book is useless as a learning tool. It should never be used as the primary textbook in an engineering mathematics course. The explanations are incomplete and extremely poor. The author often forgoes a general explanation of new concepts. Instead the author tends to focus on a single example, forcing the reader to generalize the concept on his or her own.Even as a reference its utility is dubious. In the 15 years that I've had this book, I have only succesfully extracted useful information from its pages a handfull of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author fails to explain clearly","review":"This is a fantastic book for those of you who have done engineering math before. If you ever forgot certain concepts, this would be a great book to refer. It is not recommended for first year college students.The examples are too few and some of them skipped quite a few steps. If your math is not strong, you will be frustrated in no time trying to work the missing steps. The concepts explained are not very clear.After using this book for my coursework for a year, I came to the conclusion that to really grasp the concepts, I have to solve many problems. Why? Because the author is not good at explaining the concepts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in print,still a great reference book","review":"I'm looking at my poor, mistreated old 4th Edition as I type.

The examples in it are very clear and it covers almost every math topic you should need for any engineering at least enough to get you started in a big way. I could see this being a hard text if it were your first exposure to any of the topics, but in my experience it was used for engineering math courses which expect that you have seen the material before and are ready to apply it. If this book is being used to teach math for the first time I would fault the prof. for teaching with this advanced text, as opposed to the text, which is AWESOME! Again, I have books on all of the individual subjects covered, but I find the examples very clear and easy to follow to bring you back up to speed more quickly than the other texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advanced Engineering Mathematics 8th Edition","review":"I am using this book in my undergraduate studies and in my opinion this textbook is not very good in explaining or demonstrating throught its example problems the concepts needed to successfully complete the exercises at the end of each section.

It has something about everything, but when it comes to details, you need to go to some other text.\\"GRADED EXERCISES\\". Well, they sure are, but most of the problems are far too simple, and almost all of the same kind.

It is hard to beleive that Mathematics book so thick has examples that miss complex steps, simply because these steps are deemed 'elementry' by Kreyszig's mathematic standards.

BUT, and here's what matters, if you want to UNDERSTAND what engineering math is about, you absolutely have to get text books for each of the subjects Kreyszig deals with: Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, DiPrima/Boyce for ODE and so on...this book won't get you there.

Both books and particularly Kreyszig's, require a strong background in high school Mathematics (a background which, I suspect from reading the American reader comments, is not provided by the American High School system). If a student is not adequately prepared, then of course they will struggle with this text. However, to blame Kreyszig's book is not the problem, but rather the system that left its students ill prepared to study it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality that Doesn't Work","review":"The cable was well built...

Luckily I bought the SIIG Firewire 800 9-6 Adapter. It worked perfectly. Fit into the MACbook Pro perfectly and instantly worked when I plugged my 1394a cable into it. I am very disappointed with the Cables to Go version. Sent it back for a refund within an hour.Buy the SIIG Firewire 800 9-6 Adapter and don't waste your time with Cables To Go 50704 3M IEEE-1394B Firewire 800 9-pin/6-pin Cable!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic MGM Double Feature!","review":"Panic In Year Zero!Excellent sharp print and even the original trailer.The Last Man on Earth (1963)Without doubt the BEST print I have ever seen of this Vincent Price classic.
