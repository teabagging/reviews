Little do they know (hah hah) they are heading straight for a den of godzilla-sized anacondas.

This movie isnt gonna be any better, in fact it will probably be worse, I watched the trailer for it the other day and everybody was like ooooo ahhhh im just like ohhhh god kill me now this is gonna be stupid. August looks like it has some great kick ass movies commin out such as Alien Vs Predator then they come out with this horrendous sherade and it just kills it.

Maybe in your lokal zoo but not on Borneo.I'm looking forward to see the sequel (there has to be one) with mutant penguins feeding on polar bears and elephants while our american heroes searches for money to be able to send themselves and the director to college.At least it wasn't the worst flick I've ever seen.. well it probably is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably a better film than the first one","review":"I enjoyed this creature feature.

However, warranted or not, Screen Gems has given us this glorious sequel to an utterly unforgettable giant snake movie.It is what it is, guys. A giant snake movie. There's some sort of plot line about a pharmaceutical company wanting a super rare orchid, but it's still just a giant snake movie. If you liked Boa vs. Python, this one should have you writhing around on the floor in glee.The CG effects are slightly better in this one than in the original, and the best part of this movie involves an anaconda slithering between the legs of our protagonists, just below the surface of the water. The effects were probably the best part of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"please stop, this is painful","review":"Let's see...remember back to about 1997 when J-Lo and Ice Cube were in a movie called \\"Anacondas\\"? A group of young people hook up with a shady jungle guide and encounter oversized anacondas while fighting amongst themselves. Sound familiar? Well, for some reason, this movie has been re-made, and it is even more painful than the original. Horrible acting, completely unrealistic, insulting dialogue, etc etc. I found myself hoping that an anaconda would come along and swallow everyone involved. I didn't recogize a single one of the \\"actors\\" in this film, except for the little black guy who I think was in 8 mile.

Embarassing!!! There is nothing new in this film and even worse, nothing fun. The characters are as B movie stupid and annoying as they come and the whatever story line adds no big twists and turns to the film. The giant snakes are not scary and even the attempted Jaws rip-off scenes don't work. What a waste. Big snakes in the jungle could be fun, but not like this. Please STOP making more of these films if you have no ideas for them. For those of us who are suckers for giant creature movies, go and rent Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, Lake Placid or even King Kong again and indulge.

If you buy this book and are planning to go to the Baltics, I hope you only want to see the capital cities. There is no mention of the beautiful seaside resort towns, eco-tourism spots which are very popular there, or even the major cities other than Riga, Vilnius, and Tallinn. Similarly, with Russia, don't plan on learning any useful info beyond what's written on Moscow & St. Petes. Even the info which *is* presented is so minimalistic that you it would not aide anyone. Advice such as \\"ask a native speaker to help you get a taxi\\" isnt exactly helpful, is it? No, and neither are the handdrawn maps. One saving grace with this book: it has good bus information (but the most recent info given is for 1997!). Want a good guide on the Baltics?

It is only about 3/16\\" wide and shorter than that. The USB end for the computer is the big end to the right in the picture(about 3/8\\" wide and shorter than that).MANY USB PRINTERS HAVE BOTH USB AND PARALLEL PORT CONNECTIONS Many USB printers have both a parallel port cable connection as well.

It lacks any meaty, substantial analysis you'd expect to find in a \\"bible\\" of portfolio design:-nothing on the theories behind print design.-no explanation on the \\"whys\\" and \\"hows\\" of presenting your work.-little analysis on proper organization of a portfolio.-insufficient info on photography, cropping, margins, etc.If you've never put a portfolio together, you might get some use out of it in the initial stages of your portfolio.

Very, very diasappointed and in fact gave the book away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"The book was really helpful in terms of layout and organization of a portfolio as a whole. It was more specific than anything I have read before, which I found helpful because I feel like so much writing about making a portfolio says that you should make it look nice, but that it just depends on each individual person without much concrete information. It was a good resource and I felt more confident putting together a portfolio because of it. There is, however, a good amount of information that is now outdated. Most of the book assumes that you are making a print portfolio and only new chapters added for later editions acknowledge the use of the computer. I think that some of the material in the early chapters could benefit from having this information present throughout the whole thing. At the very least, the book does provide a lot of examples of good portfolios and seeing other people's work made me realize more clearly what I wanted my own portfolio to be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're an architecture student you have to buy this!!","review":"This book will get you accepted in the best schools!!I have read more than one book on portfolio design for architects, listened to many words of advice on the subject but Howard Linton's book was really the best resource I've ever had.Other books are just vague and annoyingly general, they don't tell you how to organize yourself and your work and they don't discuss the many details you have to bear in mind and go through, or worse still have no lists of the dos and don'ts!

Classical Mechanics has a storied past, dating back to Lagrange and Newton. Mathematically, the book gives you the important historical papers. But, just as importantly, the editors have furnished recent papers that give you an idea of the cutting edge, circa 1987, when this book was assembled.There are discussions about chaotic behaviour in various dynamical ensembles, and about the onset to chaos. Very much a new thing in the 1980s. And, indeed, with still much to be explored.The papers also hail from a variety of fields. Particle accelerators, plasma, solid state, chemistry and fluid mechanics.

Whilst it is a very specialised publication, for those looking to work overseas in foreign countries it is well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Real Life Adventures with Humor","review":"With Wings as Eagles is a well written, humorous accounting of war-time adventures and the daily life of young men in battle. With photographs taken during actual bombing runs, flown through shrapnel choked skies, the author makes these adventures during a tragic time come alive with the humor necessary to live these dangerous, exciting moments in time.Gray is obviously an intelligent writer, who served as both a pilot and navigator, recounting the more than 50 missions his crew flew and the outlandish circumstances that often colored their activities. The captions Gray has inserted with his photographs are hysterical. Enjoy this piece of history, which poignantly manages to capture the intense tensions of combat, while exposing the close relationships these men had with each other and the ridiculous humor needed to survive such extreme situations. An excellent read.RJ FlemingGeneva CH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked just fine!

I use it for everything from taking notes at meetings to jotting down lists to doodling sketches for design projects. It's not a drafting-quality pen - the gel ink dries just slowly enough to smear if you're in a frenzied hurry, but it does dry much faster than most gel pens (oh Gelly Roll, our affair was cut short by your messy habits). Smooth, even ink flow -- none of that fading-in-and-out nonsense. This pen allows a strong, sassy style.

A Great Read","review":"Silent Battlefields is a moving and fascinating tale in which the author unpacks the intergenerational attempts at personal and family healing from the atrocities of the holocaust. Through two families living out their post-war lives, we see that the war is transformed from a political event to a personal and internalized experience. The battle becomes, as the author so aptly put it, silent. The story illuminates how this silence deadens the soul until once again the struggle is spoken aloud and true healing can take place. Throughout the story, the author calls upon the reader to wonder how the choices we make at one time in our lives may revisit us in the future. A great read - I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different twist to a familiar theme","review":"Initially I thought Silent Battlefields would be just one more, of many, holocaust books.

Albert and Humphrey are the first to wake up and go looking for a price to break the spell by kissing the princess. Instead of a price they find a scientist named Daniel Bernoulli. He used his invention of the flying machine to get back to the palace and break the spell.The scientist in the book was based on a real person named Daniel Bernoulli.

It shouldn't be named after Mike Austin, for the takeaway is in complete contradiction to Austin's method. Shauger actually 'borrows' his takeaway from Joe Dante of \\"The 4 Moves to Winning Golf\\". Shauger is only 40 years behind Dante in that department.But the biggest beef with this book is the ridiculous pictures and drawings. They don't in any way shape or form correspond to a golf swing. That's why you see no actual swings of his models analyzed. You do see lots of posed pictures and confusing descriptions.The diagrams are - to be most charitable - unhelpful.If you buy this book, buy it from me, I'll let it go very, very cheap. It is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now obsolete swing theory or proved not efficient","review":"Dan's student Jaacob Bowden's swing now doesn't look like what he demonstrated in this book or Dan's DVD.

And if you're already in the biz and looking to brush up for the exam, it will make you nuts. The review questions are matching or fill-in-the-blank, whereas the MS questions are generally multiple choice. The so-called labs and demos on the CD-ROM are comically useless. If you're a newbie, try Sybex. If you already pretty much know the real stuff and just want to get ready for the exam, get O'Reilly's MCSE: The Core Exams in a Nutshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"...you can't please all of the people all of the time","review":"I used this kit and passed the exam easily. I agree that it could be updated with better end of chapter questions. It is an essentials book, so I didn't expect it to be The Authority on networking; just the basics to help me pass an exam.

And no book is a substitute for practice/experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"An adequate book, in the tradition of other Microsoft Press offerings, but clearly insufficient as a sole resource for exam preparation. Also not nearly enough information to be practical in a real-life situation! Better test prep materials can be had from the Exam Cram series. Another hint for prosepective MCSE test-takers: take the Networking Essentials exam last, after the other core subjects and after the electives.

First, the book is not all that well written, with typos and careless errors, and more importantly, content is only so-so. Many available study guides from major publishers that I have perused are a better choice; certainly no worse. However, I bought the title for the alternative learning expience of the \\"multimedia\\" CD, and of course one can't scan the book before purchase anyway because it is shrink wrapped. Be warned, the CD is a major disappointment. First, the CD does not install to the HD properly. Next, there are numerous discrepancies between the Labs and the text book. The Demos themselves are absolutely LAME! Also, they ARE NOT Multimedia - There are NO SOUNDS of any kind on the CD.

I am still glad I bought the book because I think it will be helpful in the future, but my primary goal was to get study materials that would help me pass the exam - and the book fails miserably on that point.

I should have checked these reviews before purchase. The questions at the end of each section of this book are WAY easier than the real questions and the book doesn't cover several topics on the test.

Furthermore, that the educational materials provided by same corporation be in depth, concise, and thoroughly proofed for typo and grammatical errors is IMHO a must in order to validate the topic on which it is based.It is deeply disturbing to have not only missed the mark on all accounts, but to present some information in a self-contradictory manner within it's own pages. It does not bode well for the future of MS Press products at our school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't depend on this book at all","review":"This is book is good if you are new into the world of networking.

I think the best way to categorize lesions is by internal structure. This is the most prominent feature of any lesion. Any lesion can be one of three possibilities; radiolucent,radiopaque or mixed. There is no fourth possibility. After that lesions can be further grouped according to patient age, relation to teeth, site and other characteristic features. Oral radiology, principles and interpretation by white and pharaoh provides a perfect system of describing lesions in an easy and very organized manner. Wood and Goaz book was printed in 1997. It contains names of lesions that no longer exist. For example you will find odontogenic keratocyst which is renamed by WHO to keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its aggressive behavior.

I should also mention that that protein smell is quite overwhelming. As soon as I made my first shake I knew something was off, and after I barely got down my first sip I decided to throw out the rest of these containers and switch back to the regular version.

I liked it better than the Broadway recording, but then again, this is the one I learned first. Also, although this may not have every note of the score, since it presents a fairly comprehensive representation of the live show, I find it preferable to just highlights. When I listen to this version, it, more than the highlights, takes me back to when I saw the play.I agree with the reviewers that the Valjean and Eponine voices take a bit of getting used to, but I think they emote the parts well, and there are parts where they shine (God On High for Valjean and A Little Drop Of Rain for Eponine). The Javert, Gavroch, Enroljas and the Thenardiers are SUPERB."},{"rating":"2","title":"The musical that swept the world","review":"After seeing the show in St.Paul MN. it is nice to sit down and listen to the whole show from start to finish and picture the show in my head. With the other Les Mis Cd's they don't give you the whole show. Don't get me wrong I think the other's are great, but not the same. The complete symhonic recording is the best by far. 5 stars, and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"The only choice if you want the entire score, which is a little unfair. I was a bit apprehensive because it doesn't have Colm Wilkinson, who IS Valjean, but Gary Morris does a lovely job. And if you squint your eyes and shake your head really fast they sound the same! Eponine sounds like Britney Spears sometimes, but in the dialogue parts you hardly notice. I have no complaints with Cosette, she's different from the other CDs, but different is not bad. Basically, if you're not in love with Lea Salogna as Eponine, or if this is the first you've heard, then it's great! And it has EVERYTHING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Les Mis Experience","review":"Like so many others, I have never been so deeply effected by any other staged musical. It is somewhat like going to mass. I know the story. I have seen the turntable production multible times in multiple countries. And still, whenever I find myself at a location near a live performance, I feel compelled to go again. I know that I will always be so moved as to feel marvel that such a feast of story, sights, and sounds can be put together in a single theatrical production. Somehow it seems to renew something inside of me that is good.This play has so few spoken words that it is rather like an opera. It has inspired me to buy virtually every recording associated with it (even the French concept album)... searching for that heart felt experience. This album, better than any other, allows you to re-experience the entire play. It is a treasure.William R. Beaty, M.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow..","review":"This CD is totally amazing. I am a huger Les Miserables fan, and this CD just makes me fall in love with this musical all over again. One voice that sticks out to me has to be Kaho Shimada(Eponine). I've heard that she didn't know how to speak english when she recorded this, which was even more impressive. Her voice is just very emotional, and the different way she says things... She truly is amazing. She reminds me of my favorite Eponine-Diana Kaarina, whom was the Eponine for the final broadway cast. Although she(in my opinion) is not as good as Diana, Kaho definitely has an amazing voice. I also think Philip Quast is an amazing Javert. None-the-less I think the whol cast was great. I would recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"As close to experiencing the full musical as you can get!","review":"I like this recording because it features many sequences that can't be found on any other recordings, such as Eponine's Errand and the dialogue part of In My Life. I only have complaints about the voices of Cosette, Mme. Thenardier (so irritating to listen to), and Eponine. Cosette's voice is nice, but annoying, it doesn't seem to have enough depth. I guess it sounds all \\"head voice\\", I think that's the term. Judy Kuhn's Cosette is much more pleasant sounding. Eponine, her voice is alright, but it's too bad her English pronunciation wasn't better. I mean, it's great at some parts, but worse at others and makes her a less convincing Eponine. Gary Morris is a great Valjean; I was surprised to read that he is actually a country singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The recording is exceptional but.....","review":"honestly I just don't love Les Miserables the way millions claim to. The On My Own/Fantine's death theme is truly amazing and ALWAYS gets to me. Same with One Day More/Who am I? But...on the whole the musical does not leave me with the same feeling as such masterpieces as Rent, Sunset Boulevard, and Ragtime....those being my personal favs. Don't get me wrong, the complete symphonic recording is DEFINITELY the one to get-the libretto is wonderful and every voice is heavenly but....well, I suppose I'd be more enthusiastic if I just like Les Mis more....oh well, if you do pick this up IMMEDIATELY"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MUSICAL EVER CREATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(but not album","review":"I am a huge les mis fan. this musical is a mix between pop and opera. whatever you do , do not call this a play , it is a MUSICAL. Now, the seious part- songs- great songs (as I said before) singers : Valjean- Gary Morris is the worst Valjean , but that does not mean that this album sucks! Javert- Philip Quast is the best Javert ,but he does do a better performance in the 10th anniversary concert. Fantine- Debbie Byrne is Ok ,but I think Patti LuPopone and Ruthie Henshall is better. Thenadier- Barry James is the worst ever. MME. Thenadier- Sounds like a wicth and does not really sing !!!! Cossete -Ok ,but not the best. Enjloras- A. Warlow is the Best!! He is also awsome at Jekyll and Hyde! Eponine -don't even think about it!Marius- Micheal Ball is the best! Conclusion-London and 10th anniversary cast is the best. this is the best if you want the whole musical(3cd's), but some of the singers are not so great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Score, Even better voices","review":"I absolutely adore this recording! Tis probobly the best choice in my opinion, as you get to hear the entire score. Unlike others, I had no problem with Gary as ValJean. However, I had to put up with Michael Ball, *AGAIN* and the Eponine (who's name slips my memory) lacks the talent of my personal favourite, Frances Ruefelle. The chorus and Quality however is AMAZING! A great gift for you or others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This is a short review, because I basically agree with what the others have said (even if they said contradictory things, but that's me!). My only disagreement is the criticism of Cosette. I actually thought that Tracey Shayne's voice was unique and fantastic. Most other women playing Cosette have been great too, but their voices sounded too mature. Tracy Shayne is the only Cosette I've come across who can plausibly sound 17-18 years old (which is about the age Cosette should be).Anyway, a fantastic CD, although if you were to buy only one Les Mis CD, I would recommend the 10th anniversary version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I can give you a single reason for why you should buy this CD: the way Michael Ball sings, \\"I like the way you always tease!\\" And the way he sings, \\"Oh my friends, my FRIIEEEEENDS....don't ASK me (da da, da da DUM) what your sacrifice was FO-OOR (da da DUM) Empty chairs at empty tables...\\" Well, you know the rest. I love Michael Ball! He is awesome on here! Philip Quast is fantastic, too. IMHO he is the definitive Javert. Actually, aside from these two, every other performer on this CD is excelled by somebody on one of the other versions (especially Enjolras...I'm sorry, Anthony Warlow is okay, I guess, but Michael Maguire is just stupendous, and he's the best Enjolras ever). Still, if you're a fan, I would definitely recommend this. It's wonderful to be able to listen to the WHOLE thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"Les Miserables Complete Symphonic RecordingAlthough the quality of the recording is excelent, the title is misleading for those like me, who were looking for purchasing only a Symphonic Orchestra Instrumental recording without the singing part. There are many other recording of the Musical with a singing cast and they don't say \\"Symphonic\\" on their title. This is the part that I found misleading when I came to purchase this item, and there was no information published about it, on Amazon, that would have helped me not to purchase this item, as it did not correspond to what I was looking for. It is only after opening it and starting to listen to the recording, that it became evident that this was not what I wanted to purchase, as it duplicated other recording of the same Musical, which I had purchased before. So be aware of this fact before you order this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, great, great fan of Les Miserables from Sweden!","review":"I think the CD is very good.

(Soon Capewell) I really, really love her!!!!!!!!!!! And she's a really nice person, too. I met her two times, and once she showed me backstage in Palace Theatre in London. She great! And of course, she sings terrific, too. My favourite Gavroche is Ian Tucker, and I also like the one I saw one of the times I saw it. It was either Dominic Childs or Jordan Lee Calvert. I loved him, anyway. My favourite Enjolras is Mark O'Malley. My favourite Marius is (I think) Tom Lucas. I love James Doherty as Grantaire.

You simply have to hear it! The other recordings contain only about an hour and a half of music, which is not very much, considering that the entire three hour score is completely sung-through. This is especially important if you don't know the story. You can understand it completely with this recording, whereas the other one skips important parts in the story. The show is magnificant, and this recording is certainly the next best thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Les Miz","review":"I was prepared to love this recording because it was complete - and I do like it fine, but I can't seem to fall in love. I first just listened and couldn't quite figure out what was missing. Then I read the liner notes and learned how it had been put together - orchestra recorded here, singers later, etc. and it came clear that it was missing the spark you can get when the musicians work together in a live setting. Too bad, it was a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Les Miz by far","review":"This is a great CD because it picks ot the best artists from around the world to sing their respective parts. Such as Michael Ball (Marius) and Phillip Quast (Javert). The Thenardier in this recording is great (I'm not sure of his name). He really gives you a feeling for the character. I might say that Gary Morris isn't the best Valjean, but he does an exemplary job at the part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patton Oswalt Sings Colm Wilkinson","review":"Sorry if that offends but it was the image that immediately sprang to mind when I heard Gary Morris. What one looks for in a new recording for a show is the new artists interpretation of the work. What Gary Morris provides is a bad carbon copy of Colm Wilkinson's performance, right down to vocal inflection and pronunciation. I really have no issue with the rest of the cast's vocal performance because they are at times so very different from the approach of the Broadway and London recordings. I really don't know why I subconciously chose Patton Oswalt as the face for the voice I was hearing, but it's the one that stuck. Perhaps because I find it so ridiculously amusing that someone with a Broadway caliber voice would go to that much trouble to sound like someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beef with Quast","review":"I think that, on the whole, this recording is excelent. As has been previously mentioned, it is the only recording to house every note within the show, and as such is an invaluable resource to those who are : A. diehard fans or B. Performers.That said, Philip Quast cannot read a time signature, or at least struggles mightly with it on this recording. I know that others enjoy his performance, but when you are reading the score and he is a full 10 bars behind and ignoring and adding rests left right and sideways it becomes grating after a while.Anyway... great cd on the whole, but if you dig Javert, Allum is better than Mann, who beats the pants off of Quast.

Wallis Budge's books is that it's often impossible to tell when he's using conjecture and when he's actually stating a fact. Far too often he'll make a statement that today we know to be false -- for example, that the name of \\"Bast\\" and \\"Sekhmet\\" derive from words for \\"fire\\", which they don't as they mean (respectively) \\"Devouring/Ointment Lady\\" and \\"Powerful Lady\\" (nothing at all to do with fire) -- and then make a statement that actually has some basis in fact. For BEGINNERS, I would say: STAY AWAY from this book until you have a very firm grasp of Egyptian society and culture. If you need an indexed book about Egyptian deities, try George Hart's \\"Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses\\". For ADVANCED USERS, I would say: Yes, you should probably read this, but be sure that when Budge makes a statement that there's some way to verify what he's saying, or your research could be seriously skewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For General Info, Great. For serious study-Steer Away","review":"Budge's works are generally considered a bit of an Egyptological embarrassment; his intentions were noble but he seemed to favor quantity over quality when it came to research and there are lingering questions about the extent of his \\"exploitation\\" of the antiquities trade. No one will know for certain whether his legacy to Egyptology was helpful or ultimately harmful but his works have served to generate a fantastic sort of curiosity about Egypt, which may benefit the preservation of archaeological goodies in the long run. This book, like all of his others, is rife with errors, contradictions, mistranslations of the ancient texts and sadly void of references for Budge's countless \\"scientific\\" assertions. Generally, however, he gets the basic qualities and legends of the deities correct.

Because of that, after 2 or 3 uses the print on the pick starts smudging. I'll say though that the sound they generate is very crisp and bright. They are also very durable. But they're just no fun to use. Celluloid picks are still my favorite. But I have purchased a tortex pick from a band at a concert. It's unbranded, smaller, has print on both sides and yet exhibits none of the problems that this Dunlop pick has. So the issue isn't the tortex material itself.

George Knight, an Adventist himself, writes very clearly, and in an entertaining style. The work draws heavily on primary sources, and often reads like a screenplay! I especially appreciated the extensive footnoting, which allowed me to check and retrace Knight's historical work. Knight does an excellent job of portraying the Millerites not as heretics or lunatics, but as Christians passionately devoted to the \\"Blessed Hope,\\" their belief in the immanent return of Jesus Christ. Knight's one weakness lies in his treatment of the recent history and current state of the Advent Christian denomination.

And 5.2 pixels is ridiculous overkill for any pictures that you don't plan to blow up to poster size.

It begins cutely if rather like a sitcom; it contains a slapstick chase scene which suggests screwball comedy; but after a while, it switches gears and becomes a rather boring, talky drama. Bardot is the whole show here, and strangely, she's not in the film all that much! Most of the time, we're off on a flashback involving the male character, a singularly unappealing pig. That he gets his just desserts courtesy of Bardot doesn't really satisfy the viewer. Its also a relic of its time period -- 1969 -- with grainy half-in-focus images and too much zoom lens usage. Another troubling aspect is the lousy soundtrack -- its really badly dubbed. Yikes -- I'd rather have it in French with subtitles!

I can't dub in high speed or even LP mode on my Panasonic DVD Recorder, because most error out on me. When a DVD does finalize, often they won't play or the picture freezes or skips. I've had both my recorders checked out, and one has a new DVD drive. So it's the discs. I've had problems using these with my computer as well, and almost all end up as coasters.I've estimated that out of 100 DVDs, 50 end up in the trash. That's the low end.

Out of all the brands I have used, they seem the best. I only use 3 brands now: Sony, HP or Verbatim. I would buy Sony again anytime. Note that every brand I have tried fails if I go above the minimum burn speed. Could be my old slow hardware that causes the problem with not being able to burn at higher speeds.

It makes one wonder if all the extra weight damages the discs or even the possibility that people are more willing to buy the cheaper 50-pack, leaving the 100-pack sitting on the shelf for who knows how long and it degrades. So, Sony may be a good brand, but I recommend opting to buy the smaller pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Having lots of problems recording reliably with this brand.

But, while Miranda's character is well-developed and likable, Li's borders on stereotypical, and at times the threats to their relationship seem artificial. The ending also seems somewhat weak and wishy-washy for such a promising storyline. Not to give away the ending, but after 10 days of knowing each other, Miranda and Li struggle with the implausible -- one page has her staying in China (what about her kids in the US?) and the next page has him leaving China and moving to the US.

When Meg was a teenager, she and her mother walked in on what they thought was Meg's father having a extramarital affair. Though the husband swore it was not as it appears, the wife left him and moved back to England for 10 years. After witnessing this, Meg, rightfully so, has trust issues with men. But it is written in the extreme in her relationship with the hero-whom she browbeats almost the entire book-when time and again the hero is nothing but nice to her. She finally \\"sees the light\\"-but so late in the book that it hampers the storyline.Add to that an extremely unlikable and prejudiced Grandmother, and you get a bit above average romance instead of the exceptional book it could have been.

Manson's videos are very artistic and unique. There are over a dozen videos on this DVD. However, this greatest hits disc is sadly missing a few vital songs.. any Manson fan knows whats songs these are. I'm not going to be the umpteen person to say what I believe to be \\"their best of\\". I guess most of the songs are there if you count the ones that are not on the CD, but appear on the DVD.

And now, all his mainstream hits are available on a long-awaited greatest hits album along with an awesome new bonus single!

(I am actually over 13 y/o but too lazy to make a username and all) But when I picked up this album I expected there to be some songs on here that weren't, which deeply dissapionted me. I had definitely expected to see Coma White and (s)AINT. And I thought that maybe tracks like Man That You Fear, Spade, Dope Hat, Vodevil, The Golden Age of Grotesque, Antichrist Superstar, or Angel With The Scabbed Wings. I was absolutely shocked to not see Coma White or (s)AINT and was even more shocked to see The Reflecting God and Lunchbox taking up room on the CD. I realize others may like those songs, but I never thought them to be all that great. But there are some very good songs on this album. I'd still reccomend just buying all of his other CD's so you won't miss out.

I don't care for that song, as I predicted to myself how it would sound if he sung it. In case you don't like this kind of music, don't buy it. I bet a few people even think it is anti-semetic.

If you want sAint then buy it from the Manson store. If sAint was on it I would have given this a much higher star rating but now a 1 because it is still missing several videos from the Manson collection. What makes it even worse is that you have to buy this one anyway because the one you get from the Manson store only comes with the DVD for sAint.

Most old Manson fans would be quite disappointed with this disc, as it contains about 65% material recorded after Antichrist Superstar, which most fans would tell you was the last true Manson album. It's the same thing over and over. They throw in most of the singles, a few covers here and there, and you've got your \\"best of\\" album.Don't bother with this one, even if you're new to Manson.

It was an okay clock...too bad it wasn't very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronics failed within one month","review":"This alarm clock seemed perfect - large display, easy to understand and use buttons - automatic dimmer. Unfortunately, the switch to set the first alarm failed within a few weeks (it started setting the time instead of the alarm). A week or so later, the snooze period started flaking out - sometimes it was the standard 9 or 10 minutes, sometimes it was just one. The other annoying thing is the radio tuning would creep (from AM 1490, to AM 1491, to AM 1492, etc.), and every time it changed, the display would change from alarm to radio.

The internal electronics are way out of whack. Right out of the box, it wouldn't keep the time showing, but would only show the radio station unless it was manipulated by putting the AUX on. When the alarm goes off, it won't show the time, just the radio station. The radio station frequency constantly oscillates, and is no where near the station it is playing. Then it started waking me up randomly in the middle of the night where I certainly didn't set the alarm for. This was right out of the box, and yes, I fully read the instructions.

The features are great, the alarms are easy to set, the display is easy to read. I've had some problems with it though that has me looking for a replacement:--The biggest problem is the sound of static coming from it all night. The radio is off, and I can't quite figure out if the sound is coming from the speakers or the circuit board. Maybe this is the sound it makes before the LED fails?--The display is too bright even at the dimmest setting. I think they tested in the lab by turning the lights off, but never left time for their eyes to adjust to the dark.--Sometimes I wake up thinking it's 9:05 in the morning only to realize the unit is displaying a radio station of 90.5, though the radio is off.The nap feature is nice, and the button placement is great.

It turns out to have a major (in my opinion)flaw: it blinks between time and alarm set radio station number. I don't need to see what radio station the alarm is set to after I set it. For me, nothing more annoying that looking at the clock to see time and see a radio station number instead. I called RCA/Thomson about this and was told there is NOTHING that can be done as it is part of the hard-wired function. Do NOT get this clock if you expect to see the time when you want to, despite the attractive blue numbers. I will not buy RCA again.

While this alarm clock has all of the features I'm looking for, they are so poorly built that I'd avoid buying one. The first clock I bought from Target lasted only about 2 months before it just completely died one morning. No lights, no nothing. I'm guessing the components they're using are very cheap and burn out easily. But I thought maybe it was just a fluke unit, so I bought another one. This time the buttons are breaking. One of the alarm buttons started working intermittently, until it finally broke completely. Again, another sign of poor components.I love the variable snooze time, the nap function, and the gradual wake up alarm, plus the auxiliary jack is nice. ]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many PROS, few CONS","review":"I recently purchased the RP5430 alarm clock. The auto-set feature is not as good as it's cracked up to be, it simply has the time already set from the factory, but in my case the backup batteries were dead and the time was not set. My original impression was that it picked up the time from the atomic clock, but that does not seem to be the case. Other than that, it was very easy to setup out of the box, the display is great, the quality of the speaker is excellent, and the manual tuner with digital display is great to fine-tune the channels. The auto-dim feature is nice too, works well so far. The only other thing that this clock does that I don't like is that it will randomly \\"buzz\\" quietly, with or without the radio turned on. Actually it's more of a scratching sound, coming from inside the unit, and I've read that others had that same problem. Not sure about that one, but other than that, it's a great clock, the dual alarms are great too. I recommend it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not purchase","review":"This dual alarm clock could a wonderful product if it worked longer than 2 months. The first alarm clock I purchased lasted 4 weeks, then the nap button no longer worked. 2 months after receiving a replacement, the alarm set buttons stopped working.

I am now shopping for a new dual alarm clock.I would not recommend purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big issues with this alarm","review":"This clock has two huge issues for me that way outweigh the positives.DISLIKES:Numbers are WAY too bright. The only way I can sleep comfortably with this near the bed is to face the clock away from me (which is extremely inconvenient).The NAP function is a huge flaw for me. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to turn off the alarm and hit NAP instead. And once it's on, good luck trying to figure out how to turn it off. So more often than I would like (which would be zero), when my GF gets up before me, 20 minutes later, the stupid alarm goes back on. Even when I am coherent enough to realize I accidentally hit NAP, by the time you figure out where the stupid button is and remember which button you have to hold down for how long to turn it off, you are pretty much wide-awake.LIKES:Easy alarm setNice two alarm featureCool blue numbersNice auto set feature"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Do not buy this product. I had this thing just long enough to be a few days over the return policy time limit before I realized that the subtle crackling I was hearing over the past month wasn't in my head, it was in this thing. It isn't consistent-- it might go an hour just fine. But then when it does \\"act up\\", every few minutes or so, it spits out what sounds like just a couple of \\"crick crick\\"s, and NOTHING short of unplugging the thing will make it stop.

In this case, I had to and my wife even insisted I do the review. This clock cannot keep the time and maintain it.

Basically, this is a clock that does not do its primary function correctly. Finally, after few years and pain, deciding to junk it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features, poor manufacturing","review":"The nap function is nice. The automatic time set is great, too, but...within two months, the digital readout for the hour partially burned out. You couldn't tell if the clock read 5 of 6 and 8 or 9. Another light burnout made it so you couldn't tell if the alarm was set and on or not. That's pretty shoddy manufacturing, especially considering our previous clock radio (Panasonic) lasted for 15 years before the time set buttons fell off. We are buying a new clock to replace the RCA."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bright it Keeps You Awa e & Then the Buttons Will Break","review":"This alarm clock had everything we needed: Dual alarms, big numbers, auto clock set, and digital am/fm tuner.But it also has two major flaws:1. The light the numbers cast is very bright, even on \\"low\\" setting. The high setting is so bright it lit up our room enough to read by. The low setting made us feel like someone was shining a light in our window. We thought we would get use to it but never did. My wife has gone to putting a card over it to block the light.2. The buttons that turn the alarms on or off are both not working now.

First, it has trouble keeping time. The clock can be set to adjust automatically for daylight saving time, but this feature has adjusted the clock at the wrong time of the year, leaving the time off by an hour and making me late to classes. Though more minor, it will also occasionally switch the display to the current radio station for a few seconds to a few minutes when the radio is not on.Other problems I've had:Several times, the alarm has failed to go off.I can no longer cancel the nap feature if I accidentally turn it on.The auto dimmer still leaves the display too bright for a dark room.The snooze button became stuck once, leaving the display showing only 0:03 for a while.Overall, a terrible product. An alarm clock should be reliable and simple to use, and this product is neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work long, poor build, marginal design","review":"This clock has always felt 'flimsy.' Now, after only 1 year of service, some of the LED segments indicating the time have completely burnt out. It has been gradual, too: first some segments, then a few more, etc. I can't even tell if the alarm is on anymore.Also, I hear a faint sparking sound when the radio and alarms are totally off, which turned out to be the transformer when the clock was disassembled. Who knows? Maybe voltage/current transients associated with this problem caused the LED segments to burn out.In any case, there is no excuse for the clock breaking down after 1 year of mild service. I won't be replacing it with an RCA.PS The price suggested here for the clock is outrageous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I liked the big display, easy to set-features and the tuning accuracy afforded by a digital tuner. Two problems: if you turn the volume all the way up, you may have total silence from the radio (I missed my flight). Second, after three months the buttons that operate the alarm broke, and broke in a way my tinkering could not fix (the plastic buttons correspond to a mechanism fairly deep below the casing, and they somehow disengaged with normal use). So now its just a radio I keep in my bathroom. Between the cost of the radio and the missed flight to Japan with a nonrefundable ticket, owning this radio cost me $2000.

First time I miss a meeting due to alarm clock failure, I'm likely to vent my frustrations on this clock.Goods:Very easy to read numbers.Nap feature can be set between 10 and 120 minutes.Easily adjustable snooze.Respectable radio tuner.Graudual volume increase on the buzzer alarm.Bads:Even with dimmer, display is quite bright.Aux. audio in quality (for connecting an MP3 player) is lacking.Overall, I like the features of this clock, but two dead clocks in under a year is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the features!","review":"I purchased this because it had all the features I wanted. The clock has done weird things since I received it like the display changing to a radio station that is not playing, alarm not shutting off, etc. I could deal with these, but then the noise began...It makes a soft, shuffling noise, completely random, from the speaker. This can only be stopped by unplugging it AND removing the batteries (or crushing it with a sledge hammer, I suppose). It is soft, but loud enough to keep me from sleeping, which makes it worthless.I have been unable to even contact RCA customer service regarding the problem, because their website contains no section under which alarm clocks are serviced and their general contact form is broken.Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheapo Alarm Clock!","review":"This alarm clock had all of the features that I needed: large LCD, auto-set, dual alarms. However, the build quality and instruction manual are terrible.First, to turn off the alarm, there is a small \\"Off\\" button the far right of the top. However, half of the time, the alarm treats this as a snooze, so 10 minutes later, the alarm goes off again. This is really annoying if you actually get up when the alarm goes off and aren't just hitting the snooze button.Second, the alarm has a nap function that will make the alarm go off in 15, 30, or etc. minutes. In order to turn off the nap function after you have set it (say you set it for 30 minutes, but you woke up after 20), the manual says to hold down the off or hold down the nap button.

I wish I had kept the proof of purchase to return it to the Target I bought it at. Although the warranty is a good for a year, you also need a proof of purchase for that.

It is easy to set one OR two alarms to music or an alarm. All I have to do is hit a button to switch from DST to CST.

The alarm is very pleasant, but gets loud enough to wake even deep sleepers. The blue light glows a little too bright, but the color is nice.Main complaint is that after 6 months of normal use it developed an intermittent buzzing sound. The sound comes and goes. It's irritating. Also, although we never use the radio feature, the channel selected would sometimes flash instead of the time. We were able to resolve this by selecting a stronger channel. This happened although the radio was off. So it appears there's some wiring problems.We sent the clock in for warranty two months ago and still haven't received anything back. It's frustrating to be so inconvenienced due to faulty construction. Would have got 5 stars if it had lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful alarm!","review":"I just recently purchased this and I really love it. The alarm is great. It's not like your typical alarm that makes you jump about 5 feet in the air when it goes off.....it starts off softer than a typical alarm...but not so soft that it doesn't wake you up. It's more like your laying there waking up thinking...oh...there's the alarm and you can start to wake up..then it starts to get louder so that you get your lazy self out of bed.As for the display..I think it may be a little brighter because the display is so large....but it hasn't hindered my sleeping any.I would recommend this clock to anyone.

I can't say if Amazon or RCA wrote the ad copy for this, but whoever did is a bare-faced liar and cheat!Other than the CD player not playing MP3s, the ergonimics on this device is about as bad as one can get.

She needed a cd player that would read cd-r's. She was happy with out selection and so were we. The only concern I had was in packing. It arrived UPS and the box was dented in several areas. When I opened the box I saw the cd clock radio was in another box inside and that box had visible depressions as well. There was one piece of paper between the boxes but offered very little protection. I removed the cd player and it was in good working order.

It wasn't until I heard Low Millions open for Butch Walker live in concert that I was introduced to their edgy sound. I got the cd as soon as possible and I must say I am thrilled that every single song is beautiful and has its own sound. The lyrics are cunning and relatable, and Adam Cohen's voice is simply irresistable. Overall, this album is brilliant, and I have no problem putting it on repeat in the background. Low Millions debut cd is mellow, original, and most of all sexy. It's the kind of music that you can turn the lights down to for sure. My favorite tracks are Statue, Nikki Don't Stop, and Low Millions (but I still love them all!) Buy this album, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a discovery","review":"I hadn't heard Leonard Cohen in awhile, but apparently his son is in this band, and has inherited a good bit of talent from his old man, particularly with the lyrics, even though they're probably a bit different from that. Another thing I've noticed is that people sometimes compare them the the Wallflowers, a band I never got so into. It seems to me maybe they're just saying that because another singer/songwriter's son has a band now, but you should listen for yourself and decide. It's worth your time, and I can't say that for every random thing I bump into, where music is concerned these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"I heard one song off this album, Elenor, which is a great song so I bought the album.

Plus, at times I felt this was music for a teen female audience. Just not my cup of tea. I do love the song Elenor, but the rest of the album doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh New Band!","review":"I loved the songs Eleanor and Statue and knew the sound was fresh and original, but when I saw Low Millions in Alexandria, VA live and bought the CD and started listening I became hooked. This band is very unique with provocative lyrics and heart and soul in every word. The beats are a combo of rock and dance, but every song has its own pull to it. I think if the band can keep up this sort of unusual style and keep creating great lyrics and sound then they'll be around for a long time. No fly by night group here. I do hope they create another album before too long that is just as catchy and different. Excellent band and an album worth every penny.

This forced me to work the pump a lot to get up to a reasonable pressure. After about five or six uses, the attachment of the tube to the base cracked and wouldn't hold any air. I was so mad at the thing for $40 bucks, that I broke it in two and threw it in the garbage. I guess I can't expect a refund.

I screwed everything back into place and attempted to pump my tires again, but this time the pressure pushed the handles beyond it's normal range and it nearly smacked my face. Pretty dangerous if you ask me. The pressure gauge also stopped working.

Thus, my friend's reasoning for this gift.Mr. Leonard does a fine job of presenting some concepts which may awaken a desire to learn more about the philosophy and spirit of Aikido.

So they said they'd put on their web site what part of their book matches the Oracle Forms exam objective, but unfortunately they have not done this.

The first thing to go was the underneath basket which dragged on the floor until it ripped open. That was only with light weight items -not even a diaper bag. The second part to break was the snack trays that easily flip open and do not stay in lock position - this part broke twice and has been replaced on both services. Thirdly, the cup holder is a complete waste as it does not hold even a can of soda without tipping.

We never used the drink trays because as it's been said in many other reviews, they were worthless. As my kids got heavier though (they only weigh 20 lbs now so I'm not talking very heavy), the stroller became very difficult to turn. All side by side strollers will have issues with tight spaces however not being able to turn this easily resulted in me leaving many stores because I couldn't either get in through their tight doors or get around their shop.This stroller is absolutely not worth the money and I regret having spent any money on it.

Oh but one thing about the snack trays - they don't unlatch on one side and swing over like on the single Peg Peregos. So you can't place a child straight in, you always have to lift them up and over and stick their legs thru like your putting them on a child swing - and when you pull them out their shoes are stuck and their legs are stuck.

Which of course, makes them unique. Not many bands attempt to blend horns, strings, keyboards, guitars, percussion and vocals and fewer still succeed in doing so. PDP has been a Chicago favorite for years. Disc 2 especially has as much energy as you'll ever get on a little piece of plastic; if you're not moving to that; you're beyond help. Check out the monologue on \\"Shu Zulu Za\\", Frank Orral's snarling vocals throughout, and especially the last two tracks on Disc 2, \\"Platetectonic\\" and \\"Complicated\\"; the latter their best-known number. You'll wish you were at the concert!

The last two orders I placed with Nueske's have been a huge dissapointment. Much of the smokey flavor was missing and the amount grease left over after frying was astounding; leaving me with hardly any meat.

It's a greatly entertaining adaptation of the time period it represents. If you're looking for complete historic accuracy, look elsewhere! This is what it was meant to be, entertainment based on a time in history, nothing more, nothing less. That being said, my only complaint is the last season just seemed too rushed. They spent so much time on Anne Boleyn in the first season and halfway into the second, and so much less time on each wife over the next 2 seasons. There was so much more to each of the wives that would have made just as excellent screen time as the Anne Boleyn story, yet it was neglected."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Season","review":"Having watched all of the Tudors previous seasons, I was very excited to finally get a chance to view the final season.

To choose a top model as Henry VIII is pathetic - the king was a baloon with an ulcerated leg (which smelled as roten meat!). More, Henry is portrayed as the most powerful king in Europe. That is not true. Charles I of Spain (Emperor Charles V of the Holy Empire), the king of France, the king of Portugal, the Italian princes, even the kings of central Europe were more important. England transforms itself in a European and world power with Elizabeth I his daughter from Ann Boleyn."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible journey","review":"I had discovered 'The Tudors' during some flights I'd taken on Virgin America.

The writing, the drama, the cinematography, the production, the acting, the characters...all of it was excellent. Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn was especially impressive during season 2.I can't say enough about how terrific this show was. I'm not going to deny that at times Jonathan Rhys Meyers (who plays Henry VIII) felt a bit off in terms of his casting, but overall, I feel he did a solid job and certainly doesn't take away from the wonderful journey that this show was.The last episode was especially well done. Anyhow, this show is very much worth the viewing investment. And I would strongly suggest watching it from the very beginning, and not just starting on any season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history","review":"This is a rating for only one episode,but I have seen them all.

But normal version, with some steamy scenes deleted, usually goes for $35-40, and the pictures are far superior to DVD-format.I compared the normal and UNCUT version and found in Season 2 a difference of 42 minutes, substantial to understand the true human natures in most of the characters involved.

Wrong! In Season 1, it was not usual to see only 1 episode per disk, sometimes 2, or perhap 3. By Season 2 there were 2 or 3 episodes per disk. Now in its last season we are seeing 4 episodes per disk, 4! The result of which is low quality resolution, so that even on a 32\\" screen the images are noticably pixelated. It's barely tolerable on a 32\\" screen. If you have a small TV, or don't have 1080p quality, or are on a shoe-strong budget, then by all means buy the DVD version.

I particularly like the \\"shock\\" value at times because it keeps the storyline suspenseful. The costumes and scenery are absolutely incredible and very authentic looking. The 4th Season of The Tudors was not the \\"best\\" of the 4 seasons because Henry VIII's later years were not his best years, but I'm glad I got interested in the series and now I can watch it whenever I'm in the mood for a \\"period\\" film.

Even my husband had difficulty getting it on my arm, because of the slippery nylon material. I'm sure it was accurate, since it was a manual cuff, but I never could get it tight enough on my arm to be satisfied with the unit. While the quality of the LifeSource UA-100 Home Aneroid Blood Pressure Monitor is not as good as this Omron, I still ended up buying 3 LifeSource UA-100's. One for each us, as we all monitor.

The last play, \\"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\\", was not one that I cared for with the same passion as with other Wilson plays, but that is partly because I am not that wholly savvy with the early 1900's religious culture of African Americans. other than this, i actually liked it, and if I were to be able to find out more about the cultural and religious signifigance of it, I would be able to better appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plays","review":"This book contained three of my favorite August Wilson plays.

Taiyo Yuden is number 2, would rate it some 10-15% below Sony. Verbatim would rate number 3. The later 2 are good, but to my ears Sony sound coding was far superior.

Second off, unless you use the flash, and even then sometimes, the picture is blurred unless the subject stays absolutely still and you have this camera on a tripod.

I HATE it for 2 reasons- it has an electronic viewfinder and not just a lens viewfinder and I HATE it for taking pictures of anything requiring any kind of quick response- the shutter takes around a second to respond and you will miss MANY shots. This is just not acceptable for me while trying to take pictures of my kids. For the first time in my life I am looking to buy another electronic item without the first one breaking, being stolen, or being outdated! If you only want to take still shots, this is a great camera. But if you want to take any pictures that include movement- find something with a quicker shutter response time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but has some problems","review":"Camera takes great pictures and it is really simple to use MOST of the time. However it has a big delay on it so when you are taking pictures of something that is moving it proves to be a difficult thing. Another problem consists with the zoom. It for some reason does not take clear pictures (all the time) on the furthest zoom. It is also kind of big which makes it annoying to carry around different places.Although, I must say, that I like this camera. I had it for years now and it still works as good when I first purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Camera, Short Life Span","review":"Purchased 2 Fujifilm Finepix cameras. Both took excellent pictures; however, both died within 2 years and would not function at all. The cost of repair just not worth it. Now I sit without a camera which I cannot afford to fix or purchase another. As a senior citizen, this was one of my favorite hobbies. These were not 'refurbished' and I don't blame Amazon. I've read many reviews (after mine died) and the consensus was that this has happened with many Fujifilm cameras. Love the camera, but very disappointed in its life span!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing portrayal of opression","review":"Oranges is a powerful film, showing the opression of Jess, a young girl uncertain of her own identity.

Lets the writer leave a clear and distinct mark upon the paper that is easily readable, ever so sharp. An excellent choice for artists who need to have a sketch instrument handy without carrying a full array of pens and pencils. Also--and here's my main reason for buying this product--the writer does not have to press so hard upon the page as with other products: thoughts flow, and with this pen, so do the words. Use it more gently than other pens and it will last much longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you try it, there's no turning back.","review":"I am very picky about my writing utensils. I tend to write small, and it becomes very sloppy if my pen's tip is too large or the ink runs easily. Not so with this pen. The extra-fine tip is the perfect size for my writing style, and the ink dries very quickly and requires little pressure, although still very clear when more pressure is used. However, there is one exception I have found; I work at a movie theater, and the surface of the ticket stock is too glossy for the pen to dry very well (thus signing for a credit card purchase must be done with a regular ball-point). Other than this one instance, I have had no issues with them. I have gone through several packs of these wonderful tools, and I will continue to use them for as long as I am able."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic pen","review":"This pen is the best.

I purchased this review with the hopes that it would provide me with clinical ENT pearls that would better prepare me for the in-service training exam. I must say that I was severely disappointed. The book does have many one-liner questions followed by the correct and yes, as others have stated, sometimes the INCORRECT answer, but much of the information is out-dated and not really relevant to the field today. It certainly doesn't come close to representing the in-service exam, which I have taken three times now. Over-all I would consider it \\"low-yield\\", and as any otolaryngology resident can attest, it is not worth our while to spend time studying low-yield material. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENT Boards? Don't Bother.","review":"Lots of questions with just the answer and no explanation.

The essence of the story concerns three respectable members of the community who are ex-Vietnam veterns. Each year they leave their normal lives to go into the northern woods on a hunt like thousands of their fellow Americans. They have built a cabin in a remote area which is equipped with all the comforts of home. Where they differ from everyone else is that they like to kidnap people and then release them near the cabin and hunt them down like any other game. Unfortunately for them, this season they are being hunted by a realtive of someone they harmed when much younger and this person is just as skilled and ruthless as they are. The book can be taken as an indictment of war and how it dehumanises people and allows psychopaths to thrive, or, it can simply be enjoyed as a tale of some bad guys getting their comeuppance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Season","review":"I read a book called Open Season in the late 70's and I'm wondering if this is the one.

First of all the vast majority of the songs are good; often an album will only have a few songs you would include in a playlist. Secondly, the songs are well produced, original, and distinguished by a bassy, rhythmic, soulful, passionate style - real swingy, body moving R&B that demands proper bass reproduction from hi-fi systems. This is my favourite type of black music which combines the following elements: slow tempo, funky, rhymic, catchy beats and bass, well produced musical arrangements, souful harmonies, predominantly found in music from 1993 - 1997.

It sounds like they are shuffling through piles of papers when talking to me, they've lost communications that were attached the camera when submitted for repair and are disinterested in all conversations. I will NEVER buy another product from FUJI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy The Fuji E550 Camera!!!","review":"I have owned Fuji Cameras in the past, and I was very pleased with them. So, based on my experiance with Fuji, and the Consumer Reports recommendation, I bought the Fuji E550. What a mistake! Fuji should recal this camera, and Consumer Reports should help the customers on this one! I am looking for a new camera right now, and the E550 will soon go in the trash. I would not sell it in a garage sale! This camers acts like it has a basic chip flaw, and should be recalled. Under normal conditions, I can usually recover only about 10% to 15% of the pictures taken. What a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioned after 3 days","review":"I had this camera for three days when the built-in zoom lens broke, rendering the camera unusable. Zoom error appeared in the LCD and I could not take any pictures. I tried replacing the batteries as the troubleshooting section sugests, but that did not work. I contacted the place I bought it from, and they said that the camera was defective and needs to be returned. I ended up buying a Sony DSC-W7, and I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor auto focus unless in very bright light.","review":"I would look elsewhere for a camera unless you don't mind using the flash all of the time. The auto focus (when not using a flash ) on this camera is very poor in anything but very bright sunlight. I've taken several shots in very well lit conditions and the images come out blurry. You pretty much have to use the flash all of the time. I believe Fuji addressed this problem in another camera (I don't recall the model)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Camera","review":"Pros: The Fuji E550 takes good pictures in a variety of lighting conditions. This camera is very quick to start up and lag time between shots is very short. It's easy to navigate through the menus and the buttons and controls are laid out logically. The compact size is not a hindrance to using it. The included software (FinePixViewer and ImageMixer VCD2) are easy to install and pretty straight forward to use. You will probably want a more sophisticated photo editing program for composing / cleaning up your shots.Cons: It does have a couple of drawbacks. The memory card that ships with it is way too small. Removing the memory card is not practical so connecting to your computer via USB is necessary. There is a mechanical switch you must use to change between taking photos and viewing or deleting what's on the camera. I question how long this switch will last.Overall Impressions: I like this camera and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out For This Camera","review":"This camera has a problem with overexposing and shuttering effects on uploaded photos. Fujifilm denies this as a chronic, recallable problem, but the Internet camera forums are filled with people (like me) who bought this defectively designed camera.Buy a Canon or a Nikon. Fujifilm doesn't deserve your business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Policy","review":"Fantastic camera for the value, features are abundant, comfortable and easy to use on auto settings, more than enough manual options to accomodate improved skill.

This is the place to buy products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product and Fuji","review":"This was my 3 Fujifilm camera that I bought. I wish I never did.The camera is heavy when loaded with the batteries. It is also big and awkward in shape.In my experience it is unreliable as well. I bought mine brand new. To my chagrin, the zoom unit failed only 5 days and some 30 pictures after I started using it on my long-awaited European vacation.I sent the unit for repairs on October 3, 2005, and I was just told that I can expect to get it back in two weeks (45 days later). To make the story complete, the customer service guy hang up the phone on me.My loyalty to Fuji is gone. Moreover, I will never touch their products again.I realize that my case is probably extreme and unfortunate, but I will strongly encourage you to stay away from this product. There are better companies and products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"This camera has served me well over the last few years. There are a few things that you need to be aware of however. The first thing is that the flash has a delay. You have to wait for it to recharge in between each picture if you are using the flash and that can take at least 6-8 seconds. Taking pictures of children can be challenging if you are using the flash! With that said, the camera has been great. It is very simple to learn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fujifilm Finepix E550 6.3MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom","review":"As a golfer and a picture-taking fan, this camera is soo good...and you can take movies with sound....and the camera is small- However it uses expensive type memory (xd) so take that into account when buying.Stay happy,Happy golfer"},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy this thing","review":"I bought this camera 2 years ago.

Just my opinions.This is a fantastic camera! I have have wonderful luck with Fuji in the past, and they did not let down this time!The recharge rate is very fast. I read one person say it's 5-9 seconds. I don't know what kind of watch he uses, but it does not take that long at all! Even with the flash on! (Yes, the pop-up flash is flimsy, by the way!)The color is great! My last camera tended to run in the yellows. I rarely have to adjust the color with this camera at all. Same holds true with exposure. Indoors and outdoors, I rarely have to adjust the exposure when editing pictures.I am still getting to know my camera. The multi-shot feature takes practice to avoid major blurring. But, I know I'll get that down.The grip is fantastic. I can have a firm hold on the camera while chasing my 3 year old son around! That makes taking pictures of him much easier! He is, after all, the reason I have this wonderful little camera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You know I had this camera before.. so I don't know what went wrong with this one.","review":"It has a battery life of about 3 shots and then shuts itself off. I'm to say the least quite surprised since I owned this model before and my old one died a natural death. This is now officially a bad purchase and I'm out the 50 bucks I spent. I hope the seller didn't know this and sell me a clunker but I've changed the nice shiny new batteries multiple times and it does the same.. click turn on and immediately shut off.Too bad for my wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"common lens defect - read this before buying","review":"I am one of the many purchasers who likes this camera but suffered the dreaded zoom error (see the reviews of others who had the same problem). According to a Fujifilm technical service representative (who was very familiar with the problem), it occurs because the lens is designed to come out so rapidly. Fujifilm is replacing the current lens assembly, but it is not clear when that change is taking place.If this problem happens to you, the repair to replace the lens assembly will cost about $150 unless the camera is within its one year warranty. Fuji estimates repair time will be about 4 weeks.So think hard before you buy this camera and ask lots of questions. I really like the ability to take rapid shots in succession, intuitive menus (unlike my Canon), and excellent picture quality. However, I probably would not have bought it if I had known of this design defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINEPIX E550","review":"I bought this camera after it was rated a 'bestbuy' at Consumer Reports. The flash is extremely flimsy and I have never seen a point and shoot camera with such a rinky flash setup which needs to be extended before use. After 4 days in the Grand Canyon the camera began vignetting and overexposing and no amount of tinkering with the exposure settings have improved this fault. All in all it has become useless. This has definitely soured me on Fuji cameras and I will look elsewhere to Nikon or Canon for my next camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Gift!","review":"OK, the ring was a HUGE hit! The intended recipient of the wonderful piece of jewelery, my girlfriend, has already named it and its name is \\"Magnifico\\". It was a nickname of Lord Medici, the archduke of Milan and I have to tell you that it doesn't take a huge stretch of imagination to picture it on his hand. A wonderful ring with so many layers of visual beauty, a perfect gift for a person that has your life in her gentle hands, and a great way to usher someone into a realm of fantasy. TOP MARKS!I only have one small complaint, not with the ring itself, but with the marketing part. The photos of the ring (and every other piece of jewelery by Silver Insanity btw.) do not do them justice. I think you should strongly reconsider creating some new, more detailed, pictures of them under various lighting and preferably while someone is wearing them.I'm looking forward to ordering more of your fabulous products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting contemporaneous coverage of Mount St. Helens eruption","review":"This is a really interesting documentary about the eruption of Mount St. Helens. It's done with actual still shots and video shot just before, during and after the eruption itself. This is not a Hollywood mock-up, or a staged disaster film. It is a real-life depiction of what really happened on the mountain. The videotape was mastered using the graphics and video that were available at the time. The music is what was actually written about the eruption and performed at that time. I lived for several years just a few tens of kilometers from Mount St. Helens. I can say that this video is a realistic version of what it was like in the Pacific Northwest around 1980. My only regret is that a DVD version is not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random and dated","review":"This collection of random shots of the mountain's eruption, coupled with comically melodramatic voiceover and a dated soundtrack, make this hard to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"::jaw drops::","review":"I heard A--->B life a year ago and thought it was ok, then 6 months later I grew to love it,and then this album came out.....And it is one of the best cd's of all time in my book,I can't seem to take it out my cd player,and after listening to it about 25 times in a week (not alot compared to most music lovers I know) it still hasn't got old.If you enjoy music with provocative lyrics you need this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed","review":"I first saw Mewithoutyou on MTV2's subterranean.

Worse, the analysis is tinged with a very outdated Marxist perspective, common to the region itself at the time it was written. Much of the ill befallen Central America is attributed to the landed elite and gringo involvement with a blameless proletariate suffering endless petty power struggles. The role of the church is basically ignored, as are Panama and British Honduras/Belize. Fascinating anecdotes like the American who tried to set himself up as king are glossed over. By the end, the analysis supplants the history and becomes dull and repetitive. This book is a worthy example of the kind of thinking that has perpetuated itself for years to hold Central America back. There may be a meaty read of Central American history out there, one that is equally critical of American involvement, but this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so naked","review":"Im a Navy vet but always had a fascination with the Legion.

If I had a dime for every book I have ordered, read or borrowed and then thrown out, I'd be rich!Most of them are either too boring or too philisophical or too academic and they all seem to be written for the training professional in the same unrealistic way.This book cuts right to the chase and just gives me the practical tangible stuff I need right now. There's no lecturing or tons of background theory. My people appreciate it too. After reading a few chapters I passed it along to the busiest guy who never has time for training and always makes a reason not to go--or grumbles terribly when he finally is forced to attend.His response: \\"If a trainer actually made something to fit what they tell him to do I would love it! I'd even promise to go willingly!\\"I passed it along to our training manager and can't wait to see the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent reference","review":"The first thing I loved about this book was the non-linear table of contents.

I've been designing eLearning courses for 10 years now but just bought this book as a reference for my office."},{"rating":"1","title":"In other words.....","review":"Peter Berger's \\"The Sacred Canopy\\", while containing some insightful ideas, are too muddled down with Berger's personal terminology to be considered an interesting read. Does Berger point out some interesting and intriguing thoughts? Yes. But that's not the argument here. I consider myself an intelligent, university-educated individual, but Berger makes up his own words, comes up with entirely new meanings for existing terms, and throws in as many Latin terms as he can in one sentence, that simply trying to comprehend one sentence becomes a chore. Moreover, each chapter feels redundant with ideas expressed in previous areas throughout the book. Berger's inflated language gives the reader a feeling of his pompousness and self-importance. If you'd like the condensed version of the book, here it is: Religion was/is created by man as a \\"sacred canopy\\" to give us meaning as human beings, but we forget that religion is man-made and thus give power to religion to control us. The End."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's not REQUIRED do NOT buy it!","review":"I have never written a bad review...ever, but this book was SOOOO useless. It was a required read for a higher level religion class I was taking and this book almost forced me to change my major (and I'm NOT even a religion major!). The language was COMPLETELY over my head, over the head of the TA, over the head of every person I asked to help me decipher the language. I understand that this doesn't make a \\"bad book\\" but it is the perfect example of useless academia; the author wrote this book for the sake of sounding intelligent to his contemporaries. We get it...you're smart and you want to alienate those who aren't as smart as you! Lesson learned. I was almost in tears every time I had to pick it up. I started to develop anxiety as a direct result of HAVING to read this book. If you are still having/ wanting to buy this book, pop on over and buy yourself a dictionary, a thesaurus, and a BIBLE. Trust me-you will need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable?","review":"Berger is anything but readable. To start with, any given sentence in the book contains anywhere from one to five neologisms the author himself has spawned (most likely in a laughable attempt at clarity). Sentences like \\"the nominizing act intends a comprehensive order of all items that may be linguistically objectivated, that is, intends a totalizing nomos\\", is among one of thousands of obscure artifacts of Berger's logic-gears that serve to make this book, in three simple words, *anything* but readable. I award it five stars for containing excellent ideas, and subtract four for managing to render them virtually indecipherable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original publication was 1967","review":"Those reviewers giving a low rating to this book do not on the whole seems to be aware that despite the 1990 date of this edition, it was originally published in the US in 1967--incidentally the same year that Berger (co-authoring with Thomas Luckmann) also published \\"The Social Construction of Reality\\", one of the most important sociological contributions of its time. So references to non-standard vocabulary, and views of pluralism, don't take account of how much both the world and the discipline have changed in 45 years.(In the UK it was published as \\"The Social Reality of Religion\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of This Book is NOT About MSP Airport!!","review":"It seems that only about 36 out of the 208 pages of this book are really about MSP. The rest?!? Mainly profiles/PR fluff pieces about local companies that are probably located near the airport. Also, a section telling you about all the great things the Twin Cities have to offer. Looks more like something that should've be given-out to companies that were considering relocating their operations to Minneapolis-St. Paul.

If I ever cared about the words, as if to follow some kind of story, I couldn't hear enough distinct words within the singer's bark to tell what he was talking about.I heard a few hints of South of Heaven era Slayer, maybe a dash of Anthrax and even Suicidal Tendencies, but not enough to say they are imitating any of them.This is just too extreme for my tastes, and I like extreme music.

My friends who make jewelry hated it.It is possible to do all of these fiber techniques with metal instead of fiber, (ie: Arlene Fisch, Mary Lee Hu, Barbara Berk, etc.) and that is what I thought the book would be about.

This show is absolutely hilarious and so awesome, I would watch it if it remained on for 10 seasons or more. The jokes are great, and the way the cast interacts with each other, the chemistry is great! I can't wait until they bring the 3rd season to DVD, because I will be standing in line at the check-out with my copy. Absolutely brilliant. I cannot say enough good things about it.

Like showtime's Dead Like Me, the narrated shows delivered us something that we have enough of in our lives but can always stand to watch more of. Chaos. If that isn't enough the cast acted out their shallow characters as well as possible, only offending people half of the time. Despite that it put a face on corporations and showed that everyone even crooks are human. I own every season and pride my self on recently reviewing each delightfully hilarious episode and finding each episode better than the next.

Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is \\"howthe hell did they ever get this on network TV?

It wrote smoothly, without skipping, and put down a nice, solid dark line. When the ink got closer to the bottom I decided to purchase some ink refills.The difference is night and day. With the new ink refill the pen writes scratchily and seems to tire my hand out more while writing. Plus, the ink quality is not the same. In a side-by-side comparison with the old ink, the new one is not quite as dark and there's a subtle smear line through each ink stroke. Rather than a completely smooth line.It seems like the quality for a lot of pens and pencils have been decreasing over recent years. I'm sad to say that it appears Pilot G2 pens have followed in this same trend.On another note, I have found that Pentel Energel pens write similarly to the way the old G2's did.

I could put up with the grisliness of style, for the sake of the information, while the author was detailing Peggy Lee's rise to fame, but as he attempted to address her complicated middle years and sad decline, I found his gaudy shallowness downright insulting, and had to put the book down.Until the day a writer who can write decides to set down an appropriate biography of this great and underappreciated singer, I'll just have to make do with her recordings, which tell us, ultimately, everything we need to know about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Sizzles!","review":"Miss Peggy Lee has never been in better hands.

Nevertheless, this is a very detailed bio, with lots of interesting musical / historical information.One small gripe: Not enough info about all the great musicians who backed her, especially drummers (Stan Levy, Jack Sperling). On a lot of the recording sessions, all the musicians are named except the drummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodramatic view of her life","review":"I couldn't get into this book.

The animation is subtle, but effective, with amazing attention to detail. The music is fantastic, following every character and mood. Plus it's all based on one of the best graphic novels of all time.Ok, so why is this review biased? Well, I may have helped create this masterpiece. In fact, I was one of the animators who brought the comic to life. Despite my partiality, I think my comments are valid due to the overwhelmingly similar responses I have read from people not associated with the production.And, if you saw the movie and weren't impressed, please check this out.

But then I actually watched the first episode, and became instantly hooked. This is a labor of love, and I really enjoyed revisiting the comic in a different form.One actor performs all the voices, and it can be a bit strange for the female characters. However, I got over it pretty quickly. What matters more is that this meant the acting is consistent, and consistently good.I would rather have one voice actor who can act than a bunch of actors who can't. In fact, I prefer the narrator's interpretations of Laurie and Dr. Manhattan here over their lackluster counterparts in the movie.I watched a chapter a day, and it gave me something to look forward to each afternoon.

I'm confused as to Fuji's direction with this camera, though, because when I bought it the vendor said it was being phased out, and for that reason was substantially cheaper.

The small size is great, except that I couldn't find a case that fit it well. Because of this, in my purse it seems that it accidentally turned on (which happens quite easily, unfortunately), which caused the lens to push out against my rigid purse which broke the zoom. I attempted to take it to a Fuji place to get it fixed (I bought it recently enough that it should have still been covered under warranty), but they said that it would cost me over $175 to fix the camera (what was wrong apparently is not covered by the warranty)!

How hard can it be in Los Angeles to come up with a competent proof reader? I concede that there are instances in which the author obviously intends the Spanish to be colloquial, but they are far outnumbered by the glaring, blatant mistakes. Using foreign words and phrases just for the heck of it and not providing a treanslation is pretentious enough, but to get it all wrong is impardonable.

Saying that, this book was disappointing. The sentence structure was jumbled most of the time, and hard to understand. The characters were very underdeveloped to the point of being two-dementional. The real point of the story seemed to be the mother-daughter relationship, and the mother's character was too painfully exaggerated to be realistic. It was very hard to be swept away by this book.

She doesn't seem to understand that just making chick lit \\"go ethnic\\" doesn't automatically make it any less vapid and pointless. The Mexican family is a cheap cliche, the book is about nothing, the dull plotline is interrupted for a few soft-core porn scenes, and the writing is unequivocally bad from the opening scene discussing Tamara's menstrual period through a character being described as walking \\"into her office like something had flown up his butt\\". I've seen better prose from 6th graders. Castillo reveals the kind of underachiving readership she seeks when she starts citing Nora Roberts novels.

And I love the fact that they came in different colors. This is the first time that I tried the Extra Fine Point. Prior to that, I've only owned the regular (Bold) versions. Now that I've tried the 0.5 pen for the first time, my initial finding was that the 0.5 pen was not as smooth and just a bit scratchier. The difference is very noticeable however. But on the big upside, the Extra Fine Point dries a lot faster. But since I'm right-handed, I rarely smudge my hand with ink even when using the Bold version.Even though it was not as smooth and a bit scratchier, I do love the Extra Fine Point.

I am able to take 3 months worth of notes per pen as a full time student, which is pretty good value.My biggest issue with this particular purchase was that I had so many pen failures. Out of a pack of 12, I have had 4 or 5 pen tips break on me within the first few weeks of use. Why that is, I cannot be sure of. It certainly isn't the way I use them because I am only taking notes, not jotting or scribbling with great force.

The book follows the same format as most of the others in the series, providing a cast list, credits, plot outline and photos of each movie in Bogart's catalogue. Where this book falls down significantly is a lack of any critical evaluation or discussion found in most of the other Citadel books. Only a few films, such as \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"The African Queen\\", have an additional brief paragraph of background information. Bogart was more fortunate in his career than many of his contemporaries in appearing in movies enjoying a generally high standard and critical success, particularly from 1940. Unfortunately those not very familiar with Bogart's work will not get any impression of that from this book.

I've been a TJ and Dave fan for a long time, so my primary concern was that the film would faithfully capture the magic of this remarkable team. It does.Without prior consultation, the guys (both Second City alumni) start a dialogue as soon as the lights go up. As they play, they discover who they are and what the story is. For those who know improvisation, this is work on a high level. The swiftness and subtlety of their agreement is breathtaking, and the observations of human behavior are unclouded by improv cliche. While nothing can replace the thrill of seeing these guys live, being able to go back and watch how they build this particular performance step-by-step offers lessons in craftsmanship that students of acting and writing will profit from. Combine this with Scott Silberstein's SECOND TO NONE, and you have the best representation of improvisation on video that I know of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I have seen their improv show live in Chicago and it's awesome.

This short but sweet tribute features the Church Street Station performances from the now defunct Cheyenne Saloon in Orlando, FL. This footage dates from the mid-'80's, and features some of her best known hits. Makes a great addition to any Dottie West fan collection! Now how about giving us the \\"Full Circle\\" and \\"Special Delivery\\" concerts that aired on Showtime? THAT would be a real treat! Still, I think most people will like this collection. This is a great tribute to one of country music's most glamorous and charming ladies."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR VALUE.","review":"I'm amazed this DVD has been rated so highly by all reviewers & feel the balance needs to be redressed.Firstly, let me make it clear I am a big Dottie West fan, regarding her as one of the all-time Country greats. However, do the previous reviewers seriously believe this brief (18 minutes) lacklustre appearance at the age of 54 to sing half a dozen not-so-great (apart, perhaps, from Here comes my baby) songs represents the 'best' of the lady? I think not. And, just to emphasise the point, I recently purchased 'Strangers', a DVD featuring British group Keane - at the peak of their powers, nearly three & a half hours in length - and all for under 10 dollars! Now, that's value for money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Grip Gel","review":"I wish there were more pens like this. They are easy to write with and I use them as frequently as I can.

I like that Dr. Grip has also been releasing some unusual barrel colors, and if you're like me the distinctive colors help me grab a certain pen for a certain mission. (I like writing in little Moleskine or Zequenz journals, and I like varying colors and thicknesses for effect or emphasis).

If you can handcut a dovetail with this saw, you probably already have your own woodworking show (that's not a typo, I mean you are probably paid to make a show about woodworking). Independently, the blade and the rest of the saw both are terrible. Your force is always at an angle to the blade edge because of the \\"flush cut\\" feature. The \\"reversible\\" feature makes the blade come out when you get caught on something. The teeth on my new saw were so dull, I literally checked with a magnifying glass to see if they had rusted in the store or something. Take the word \\"dovetail\\" off of the title of this product, put a decent grind on the teeth, and make the locking mechanism more secure.

The minor problem is that the actual paste comes packed in a vacuum-sealed bag that itself is stuffed in the tub. This doesn't make much sense to me; why not just seal the tub itself? The paste can be easily popped out of the bag, however.This is a cost-efficient way to produce curry at home.

I was so excited when I ordered my first guitar, but the myriad of accessories out there was overwhelming. I opted to get myself some rubber grip medium picks. I was happy with those.. until I bought these.After following a lesson system online I heard the instructor say that for strumming you should be using .38mm picks - super thin, nearly paper-like. I almost didn't buy them because I thought he was nuts since it seemed to me like you should have something more sturdy(naivete at it's finest).Once I got these, I gave a nice strum on my guitar and was shocked at the difference in sound it produced compared to my medium picks.It's beautiful and clear sounding. I just love it and it gave me new inspiration for learning this amazing instrument.I can't provide any \\"technical\\" details on them - I just know that I love them. They don't slip from my fingers.. they don't break.. they sound beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"A very thin pick that is flexible, durable, and easy on inexperienced fingers (like mine).

A friend gave one of these picks to me and I loved playing with them. When I lost the pick i looked to Amazon to buy the same ones. WARNING: packaging is TERRIBLE.The cardboard box that it arrived in was WAY too big. Padding was not needed for something that is barely 2 inches by 4 inches. The plastic bag supposedly containing the picks was cut open on the side. When I opened the box, the plastic bag was underneath the cardboard flap...There was one pick inside the plastic pack and one pick in the box. The other 10 picks were missing, probably fallen out of the box during shipping. Packaging was terrible. Even if the plastic pack was open, if it was placed in a sealed padded envelope instead of underneath of the flap of a cardboard box, i would not have lost over half of my picks. I paid for 12 picks and got 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality!","review":"These are excellent picks, quality wise. The only problem is that they were too thin for my electric acoustic guitar. I would suggest that unless you are already familiar with these picks that you order the .46 mm also from Dunlop Instead. They are a little bit sturdier; that's what I end up doing anyway.

Not only did the straps immediately loosen, but the bike flopped around on the rack with the pedals crashing into the trunk. The plastic strap piece that is supposed to secure the top tube of the bike to the rack easily comes loose. The overall design of the rack is very poor. I realize this is a very economically priced bike rack, but it is not worth the risk of having your bike fly off on the highway. I'd suggest going to a good bike shop and buying their entry level Yakima or Thule rack.

I am so dissapointed in this rack the scratches on my bike's forks are a reminder of this horrible bike rack. Fortunately it was my hardtail mountain bikes so the scratches just blend in with the other scratches. It's just sad to me that the damage came from a bike rack instead of the trail.

That being said you might have to work with it. Create extra padding for the trunk clips, for instance. As others have said add your own sturdy ties to keep the bikes from swinging. I used my long cable lock. AND you must add rubber or other material to each frame tube to keep the seats holding your bikes from moving. I don't like that it has plastic parts but if you aren't rough onthem they should last a long time. I just drove for five hours with mine on federal highways. No problems but you must do as instructions say and check straps for tightness on your first trip or after bumpy terrain.Oh, and as others said, expect that the strap version carriers are NOT secure.

I drive to a parking lot, pull my bike off the rack, and ride the bus closer to work every day.This rack is fine for using occasionally, every week or so, but daily use wears it down quickly, and the comprises made for lower cost are no longer worth it.Many people complain about the rubber bike holders sliding down the rail, letting the bike hit the car. This gets worse and worse with time. At this point, the holders slide freely up and down the rail, making it difficult to get the bike on them quickly.The velcro straps make taking the bike off and on the rack slow. Having to stick the velcro through the hole and pull it back around may not seem like much, but doing it often really makes you envious of the rubber strapped bike racks.It;s not a terrible product.

You are suppose to push in the red buttons and move it into place but once you do there is this really weak locking system that is suppose to keep it in place. It did not look very safe to me so before i even though of putting my bike on it i applied a little downward pressure on the arms and it just popped out of place.

If you're never planning on driving on the highway with it, then this bike rack could work fine for you.

Even when I have the straps pulled really tight, my bike still bounces around quite a bit, but it hasn't come too loose while driving yet. The plastic coating the hooks came off on one of them after the FIRST use(I only drove 75 miles!), and ended up scratching my trunk up A LOT.I'm definately returning this and getting a better quality bike rack.

Although this CD contains songs from the mid 90's an improvement from Vol. 3 which was produced in I think 2001 and featured music from that year it still does not capture the music most people thimk of when hearing the word classics in a CD title.

I was hoping for a manual chopper that I could use to feed my daughter out and about, and this was nearly perfect. It tucks into a tiny little package and separates at the top of the clear portion as well as at the bottom, so you can actually chop in the little cup and then serve right out of it! The only thing I wish I could have changed was that when using it this way, the bottom of the cup is only attached like a rubber stopper and it occasionally let go especially after adding enough water to make the right consistency food.

If someone finds something that chops well using this device I'd be interested to know what it is. Everything in mine either a) jams the device up or b) \\"bruises\\" whatever I'm chopping so bad the result is completely unappetizing.I thought this might work well for, say, cilantro or basil and the like, but the result isn't pretty...you basically get dark-green mushy stuff when you're finished.Did I mention it's *impossible* to clean? Things get trapped *behind* the blades and go up into the handle. Good luck really flushing this thing out.OK--well, I have to admit this chopper is decent for peanuts--those don't get caught in the mechanism. For a small amount of nuts to be chopped to go on ice cream or something this makes a decent tool. So perhaps that's one use.Not a big expense here, and maybe the bigger chopper jams less--I don't know.

This product is essential useless unless you notice the keyword \\"garlic\\" in the product write-up. What that means is: If the thing you want to dice is as small as a clove of garlic, you should be able to do that. Anything else you have to cut into bite-sized pieces and then put them in, chunk by chunk, and maybe the chopper will slice through them. I've tried onions and eggplants -- both relatively soft vegetables. From the first push down the chopper sticks and I literally have to yank it back so that the blades come out (not always successfully) of the chunk of vegetable. It doesn't matter what I put in.

When it arrived, I was happy to see it is a genuine Oster product, not a knockoff, and it works great. As an aside, even though this is an \\"ice blade\\", the trick to making great smoothies is to use no ice at all. Just frozen fruit and juice. The frozen fruit takes the place of the ice, but doesn't separate into water and pulp like when you use ice plush fresh fruit.

McLellan had access to much more material about Marx's life than did Berlin and he brings it all together in a satisifying package.Berlin's book, however, provides a superb discussion of the philosophical background to Marx's work. Because of that Berlin's book is extremely valuable.Readers of Berlin's book must be aware that his interpretation of Marx's social theory is colored by Berlin's anti-communist beliefs. Although many today reject that a close tie existed between Marx's social theory and the USSR, Berlin assumed that such a link existed when he looked at things in the late 1930s. As a result, a tone of worry and concern suffuses Berlin's discussion of many of Marx's ideas and Berlin tends to paint Marx as more of a potential authoritarian than did later biographers.Despite that, Berlin's book is well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk Too Much","review":"I had the vinyl and it had a song about talk too much; another song seems to have replaced this one but I liked the previous song 'cause it was one of the best on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I wondered when I saw this title whether it would be a simple \\"wax me up and make me feel good\\" book.

If the person's shoe was the closest to the lens, they looked like they had clown shoes on. A jeep hood where the camara was obviously mounted on the right front of the jeep made the hood look so odd and long that there could have been a V12 motor in there.

There were barely any dinosaurs in this dinosaur movie. It was a documentary about a bunch of paleontologists digging up some fossils. How lame. Part of the DVD was a big blank screen in the back with a small inset of a 2D video of paleontologists digging from 1920 in black and white. Why would I want to see this? If you're expecting animated dinosaurs, there's about 4 minutes of that in this 48min DVD. Skip it altogether. I realized after I purchased that you can rent it from amazon for $3.99. I wouldn't have even been happy with a rental let alone purchasing, but would have saved $16 at least. Will not take a chance and buy any more Imax 3D DVD's.

I thought the show might be more tolerable watching it in 3D - we recently purchased a Samsung UN46D6400. I was wrong.

We made sure the cover over the battery pack/motors was as tight as it could be. We ran the boat for less than 20 minutes before it just died. I recharged the battery, tried the odd instructioon to create a circuit beteen the two drive shafts with my hand,and looked for loose wires etc; nothing works. Very expensive 20 minutes. While there was a little water in the boat after we used it and it died, it was only a couple tablespoons, that must have come in through the driveshaft holes in the hull. I think this design is horrible, and you should not expect this to last past the first use. It's junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Fun, enjoyable for kids","review":"My son (age 7) received it for a gift. He wants to play it all the time.

Had some awesome speed, lightning acceleration, great turning radius. The only problem was that it failed to work after the it's maiden voyage (perhaps i should have christened it?).Didn't show any signs of water damage, even took apart the radio receiver box which was heavily sealed and bone dry.

When it does start up again, it will only run in 30 second bursts. We're not sure if it's the radio or the electric motors overheating.

I understand that sometimes products just don't work the way they should and it is by no means the fault of the seller. What I DO consider to be the fault of the seller, NST GIFTS, is that they would not replace the boat since it had been over 30 days.

At the first use, which lasted about 5 minutes, he noticed that the remote control had completely consumed all of the new batteries he put into it. We got new batteries. The next time out, the remote lost control of the boat (not due to distance, but malfunction either in the boat or the remote) and the boat sped off out in the middle of a large lake.I can say that my nephew thought the boat was fast and made impressive turns ... while it lasted. But this thing is so cheaply made that I would not recommend buying it. It likely will not last more than 10 minutes. There is something very wrong with the design of the remote that it would use up all of the charge in new batteries in 5 or 10 minutes. I assume there is a reason this boat is on sale for such a low price - it is cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.","review":"I'm satisfied for what I paid for this little RC boat.

After checking other Colony 5 songs, I decided to order it through an independent record label. While I was waiting for the cd, I downloaded Colonisation which I loved. I recently got Fixed in the mail after a rather lengthy wait. It automatically solidified me as a huge fan of the duo. I am hopelessly addicted to the melodies and crisp dance beats.

Great characters,rich in depth and detail,a hard driving plot,incredible intrigue,and a willingness to show the harsh brutality that was medieval life. The only other books that have come close lately would be the 'Sword of Truth' epics put out by Terry Goodkind,the main difference being that Martin has made little use of magic thus far.He makes up for it however with a tale of conspiracy and subterfuge reminiscent of Clancy or Forsyth. If tales with complex plotlines confuse you then stay away from this book to everyone else I say ENJOY,ENJOY,ENJOY !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind Author!","review":"Martin is so abusive to his main characters that we just gotta love him. There has been so many times that I've said to myself, \\"No way, someone's going to save (spoiler blocked!) any minute now. there's no way the author will let him......Oh god, the author DID\\". Expect a lot of switching roles. Characters you think are allies are enemies and ones you think are enemies are actually the worst kind of enemies. Your eyes will be glued to the page, watching all the action unfold. \\"Game of Thrones\\" is a bit morbid and might make you feel miserable when you finish it but the book has a certain charm that will insure you'll be coming back for more soon enough.Good: fast-paced, change of POV keeps things fresh, witty dialogue, realistic and believable characters who grow throughout the course of the bookBad: some characters are annoying (Sanya *coughcough*), large cast of characters to the point where you might need to keep a character list to keep track of them all"},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises if you've seen the TV series","review":"I read this after having seen the first season of the series. I loved the TV program so I thought it was worth a go. Basically the TV series is very faithful to the book imo - so much so there wasn't really any surprises or additional information/background to the story.Having said that - I still loved the book. I thought it was very well written, the characters are gripping whether you like them or not and the plot is gripping. There are some unexpected events that if it been written by many others (or for TV) wouldn't have happened.My only complaint is the maps in the Kindle version - they are nowhere near good enough (can't zoom or move around) and there is no quick access to the index of houses in the back either.

Reading the book after was very much the same experience only better. I cannot think of another series or movie that followed the inspirational book so closely. I'm sure that's part of the success of the series is that they knew the book was so well done that even most of the dialogue seems to be verbatim. And I can't see any reason they would have changed it. Everything in the book was very well done. The plots, the way the characters intertwine, and mostly the twists and turns that you'd never see coming. All really well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to an epic series","review":"This was a great book. Martin did a really good job making me love and/or hate the characters. The story is fantastic and I can't wait to continue this series.I only had 2 issues that kept me from giving this 5 stars. First, there are a ton of characters. Keeping track of who's who in the earlier parts of the story was very confusing. This wasn't helped by occasionally calling someone by their first name and other times by their last name. Second, I don't think the storyline concerning the Night Watch really fit in. I was so engrossed with the other stories that I grumbled every time I was pulled back up to the Wall. I'm sure this will play a larger role in the books to come, so I can live with it for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor editing, but great story","review":"This is usually not the type of genre I would pick to read; however, after seeing that the majority of the two thousand reviews were positive, I decided to pick this book up. I am glad I purchased this book; it is full of adventure, action, and deception. The only negatives about the book are the times when the novel/writing is rather wordy, and the poor editing. Since it is over 800 pages, I recommend picking up the kindle edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verbose (but you could tell that by the size of the book!)","review":"I'm not a big fan of books that have so many characters that you need a cross referenced geneology appendix in the back - but Martin managed to pull it off in this book. He created interesting, well-developed personalities that you really got to know and care about. Of course, with all of the character background and development there was little time to actually develop the plot - but I suppose that's why this is a series. If you like to really get into the characters of a book, and are willing to read 800 pages of what is basically an introduction, Martin has really started to create a wonderful tapestry of personalities and events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate and Imaginative","review":"George Martin has created an incredibly intricate fantasy world in which intrigue and treachery unfold with every page.

I can understand why some people like the grittiness aspect, but I'm not personally interested in reading about an actual medieval world. By actual I mean that almost everyone is miserable, kind of like a Hobbessian worldview of life being nasty, brutish, and short. I prefer fantasy worlds that are different and a bit more enlightened, or at the very least ones where some of the characters are likeable. I found very few of the POV characters in this book endearing at all, and the ones that are get killed. Bleh.The world is also really low magic which I don't care for. If you are really into medieval politics and a very \\"gray\\" story, however, this is probably more your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This is anoter one of those books where the author tries to butter up a story with nonsense, to much description.

I am probably the exception, but I found this book very appalling. It is bursting with explicit sexual material and I tired of it quickly. I say this as an adult, I wouldn't recommend this book, especially to more sensitive readers-but others can make up their mind.

His use of words to create pictures and feelings is adroit and rare. Unfortunately his talent made me feel nauseated. I have no need to fill my mind with the images that his words create. I did not finish his first book and will never read another. One never knows what disgusting little tidbit waits on the next page. I for one do not care to find out. If I want to be sickened by what I read I will pick up the evening newspaper and read about child abuse and murder. I read for pleasure and Mr. Martin does not know how to write that.

The reader is excellent, giving wonderful word pictures to the story, no matter what the setting. You feel like you're in the moment whether in a castle, camp, brothel, inn, crypt, battle, etc.It's having a bed time story to wait for expectantly so I save it for the evening when I forget TV or work & just enjoy a time one can only experience in imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivery on time and product in good condition","review":"I live in Argentina and the product arrived on time without any flaws.

This book in particular is so predictable, from the get-go, that it's almost to the point of ridicule. The language is florid, yet purely ornamental. The plot is like walking through a road you've walked on many times before - unremarkably boring. The dialog and characters are cookie-cutter fantasy that pervades the genera these days. If you want to see what I mean by what I say above, read your C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, Jack Vance, Poul Anderson, heck, even Terry Goodkind for something more modern and contemporary. I just don't see what all the fanfare is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, Kindle edition is a disaster","review":"The Kindle edition of this book reads like it's been run through OCR software. It's full of ridiculous typos. Get the dead tree edition instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting typos and mistakes","review":"Regardless of the writing itself, which seems to be ok, this version of the book has so many typos and mistakes throughout the book that it was constantly distracting and irritating. I'd find another version or buy the book in hardcopy rather than tolerate this poorly transcribed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame really","review":"I am going to start off this review with saying that the author, almost, did everything right with this book. The characters are awesome and you feel like you know them, the plot is equally as spectacular, and the writing overall is simply addictive.But with all that said, there is one fatal flaw with this book that made me stop reading it. This novel has an extreme amount of sex. The sexual references are bad enough with multiple instances on every page, not to mention the graphic, highly detailed accounts of sex and rape. The author's description is ridiculously noted and disgusting. I could not in good conscious finish this book, which is a crying shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, one warning","review":"I agree with everything people have stated here, and couldn't put it much better myself. It's great. Read the rest for specifics.However, I give one warning to readers: This is a GRAPHIC novel. The sceans are rich and pull you into the world, but the battle and sex sceans are also very...descriptive. Almost to the pointless point.I think that Martin could have done without them, but it's a great book, so I can overlook it myself. But don't start into this book expecting to see violence and sex of the Robert Jordan variety, i.e. as people die, the story just says 'they die by the hundreds' and the sex sceans consisting of 'they kiss and start tearing at eachothers shirts' and then leaving the chapter. George RR Martin is descriptive and immersing, and his sceans are not for the easily offended reader. However, the brilliance of his writing overshadows any such problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read!","review":"I couldn't put this book down, it was so powerful and gripping. It's one of the best books I've read in years -- I, like everyone else, am waiting VERY impatiently for the 2nd book in the series! aGofT has a few weak points -- from the author of \\"Sandkings\\", I had expected some parts to be a bit spookier -- but those weak points are better than the best writing of the majority of Fantasy writers out there. Read this book, but be prepared to be reading continuously for a few days, losing sleep and work time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but depressing heroic who-killed-who intrigue.","review":"'Sokay I guess (sniff) (heheh). No really, although I would not go into the sort of raptures that other reviewers have indulged in I certainly found plenty of \\"meat\\" and little \\"fat\\" in this book. Like many people I am wondering if George R R Martin can keep up the standard in subsequent books, and I hope that he does. I gave up reading heroic fantasy years ago but I bought the paperback version of GOT purely because I liked Martin's SF writing. I have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dispointing read.","review":"I had expected so much from this book, what with its award and all the rave reviews I'd heard. However the book was slow going in several places, lots of interesting ideas just fizzled out and left me wondering what the point was. Some of the characters were likeable, and even some of the events were exciting, but mainly it was hard to find anything interesting to sustain the book. The ending just sort of lost its steam half way through and it seemed like the author just gave up and left it that way. There was a great deal of unrealized potential here and I shutter to think that this is just the start of another unending epic. If you want better written epic fantasies try, Fesit, Williams, or even Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul Sucking Drivel","review":"Terrible, worst book I've ever read. No likeable characters, it makes you not care who wins or loses, who lives or dies. The battle scenes are terribly written. A ten thousand man battle and one of the main events was summed up in a few lines by a woman who \\"closed her eyes and listened to the sounds\\" so you have a few phrases like \\"a man's boot sloshing through shallow water\\" summing up the battle. The plot and characters are sickening.I want my money back, but worse, I want my time and the part of my soul that got leeched away by this drivel back.So glad I didn't throw money away on the 4 book set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game of Thrones is carelessly violent and somewhat shallow","review":"When I first started this novel, I was impressed with the grandeur and twisting plotline. But as I got further into the book I began to see the flatness of the characture development, and the callous uses of violence. The story itself is slow and predictable and the charactures shallow. I realize that to sustain a story through the viewpoints of many different people is difficult, and while I admire the auther for trying a challanging form of narration, I think that it hurts the development of both the charactures and the complexity of the story. My comments about the violence does not only refer to this particuler book. Fantasy in genaral, except for a few authers, seems to put grotesque violence where it is not needed to make a point. If the auther wantes a character to be villified then incorporate other ways to show it. A Game of Thrones was no exseption.Needless to say I did not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite by far...","review":"I found this book to be dry, boring, and VERY slow paced. It revolves around several characters and they each have there own storyline, which for me is totally awesome. However, I would like it if more than one of those storylines had an interesting plot to it. There were some interesting spots, but for the most part, it was pretty boring, I'm sorry to say... I simply could not finish it! And I tried really hard to get past the 2/3rds point, but then I gave up and just read the one plot line that interested me. The storyline was pretty cool and it was a good idea, but I think it was poorly exicuted. I mean, really, murdering a little boy? Was that neccesary? And all of the rape and other murders as well? Simply put, I did not like this book and dont understand the 5 star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar language and descriptive sex scenes - not my thing","review":"I was super-excited about reading this book considering it is my favorite genre, however, I was not prepared for the vulgar profanity and sex littered throughout the book. That might be your thing, I prefer a more tasteful approach. I did not finish the book and promptly returned it on my Kindle. Kudos to Amazon for allowing customers to return digital books within 7 days!If vulgar / profane content doesn't bother you, by all means ignore my review :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst money I ever spent!","review":"I found this book bleak and depressing. I could not begin to identify with any of the characters. The only reason I gave it one star is because that's as low as the scale would let me go."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just plain BAD.","review":"Whatever do people see in this tripe? It has everything that should make people make it throw against the nearest wall:Unlikeable characters? Check!Confusing narration and utter lack of plot? Check!Extremely pedestrian and unimaginative writing? Check!Gratuitous violence which serves no other purpose than to shock the reader? Check, check and double check!But of course, the biggest sin Martin succumbs to is presenting a fantasy world with barely any fantasy in it and which, as a result, is toe-curlingly boring. If you want to read gothic snuff porn there are actually better choices than this tedious mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attracting readers with rape scenes","review":"I can not for the life of me understand why so many people love this book. While the prose is ok, the rest is third rate. There is very little in this book that i can feel is realistic (yes, i know that this is fantasy). The author seems to feel that the more voilence, the better. There is hardly a page without a sex scen, and a multitude of rapes, discribed in considreble detale. And that some rapeists are discribed as heroes, i find revolting. If you enjoy reading about this kind of thing, then by all means, buy this book, but it is certenly not my cup of tee. If you simply want a great fantasy book, the buy a book from Robert Jordans Wheel of Time series instead. He is, without a doubt, THE master of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Review","review":"First of all, I love these books. The characters are rich and well thought out, and the world they live in has not been matched by anyone, save Robert Jordan. With that said, this e-book is atrocious.If I have to stop every other page and try to figure out what word goes in place of the disjointed letters on the page, it completely pulls me out of the story. In one instance you just see \\"200\\" in the middle of a sentence that is important to the plot, leaving you to have to figure out what was meant.Especially in a book so complex as this, every spoken word, turn of phrase, or setting description may be important, it seems foolish to so poorly proofread it.TLDR: Great book, crappy e-book translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there are no minus stars","review":"George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones series is a colossal waste of time. I am ashamed to admit I read all five books, constantly hoping they would get better. It's a sad comment on my dogged persistence in the face of overwhelming evidence. I enjoyed J. R. Tolkien's Hobbit/Lord of the Rings and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and their ilk immensely and was sad to see each end. Mr. Martin's greatest talent lies in convincing the reading public to purchase his stories. Martin takes an interesting theme and that should have been well handled in 400-500 pages and balloons it through five books. He constantly introduces new characters and locations throughout the meager plot thread that are never seen or heard from again thus expanding his page count to no purpose. To say this is bad literature is too kind; it's horrible. I bought the series from Amazon for my Kindle. I wish there was some way to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was wondering why I dislike the Game of Thrones, and it was not totally because of 1000 characters that are impossible to remember and keep track. Within these four books you won't be able to find any shred of love, affection, or loyalty. These books are full, and I mean FULL, of cruelty, betrayal, and violence against women and children. Brothers kill brothers and sisters, sons kill fathers and mothers. Everyone can be bought or be fooled for power. I really don't understand what HBO saw in these books to make a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on description, short on plot","review":"This book reminded me in a way of Tolken's Lord of the Ring saga with the rich background materials. GMMR has spent a lot of time and effort creating a deep world for the reader to explore. However, Tolken had exciting action and interwoven plot lines, but GRRM's novel has a slow moving plot with little action (at best one could say there is a lot of suspense).I would characterize the novel as a fantasy suspense novel or fictional political drama. Definitely not an action/adventure story. Entire chapters seem devoted to describing a historical incident.I like an exciting story with many plot twists, so I cannot recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent classical fantasy","review":"One of the best all time fantasies read. Don't read as much now (age 34) as I did when I was younger - it takes an exceptional book to capture my attention with all the demands of family, business & life - and this one did. Can't wait to read the next (and this is now rare).Excellent characterization with a breadth of personalities, complex multi-level imaginative plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SERIES!!!","review":"This series is amazing- first two books are nearly exact as HBO Show fyi but every book is worth the read and keeps you coming back... I love that the author is similar to a soap opera- no character is safe and you never really know if someone is truly dead.. makes things forever juicy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good...","review":"Half way through this book, and the story is getting more and more captivating. I am enjoying it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I started reading George Martin books after searching the Amazon recommendation list. Boy was I got mesmerize by his work of art. I had a great pleasure reading Raymond Feist and Robert Jordan works but comparing to George twisted, intrigue and fascinating stories plot, it's remarkable the story is only in it's 4th Edition. I believe the challenge in writting a good book is not telling the story over voluminous amount of series and chapters but tying all the plots necessary to keep the reader at the edge of it's seat. From what i know, volume does not sell anymore. George has shown what it takes to make the reader hungers for more with micro story plotting and significant smooth storyline to interest the reader. I could never stop wanting for more after ending a chapter... it's just so highly addictive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great story, but...","review":"This review is for the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones. Were I reviewing the print version of the book, I would give it 4-5 stars. However, the Kindle edition (for iPad) is full of wretched errors in grammar and formatting that destroy the narrative flow. There are floating parenthesis, random-seeing italic text or misplaced commas every dozen pages or less. Considering how engrossing the book is, encountering one of these instances is like hitting tire spikes during a high speed chase. I hope the Kindle edition is re-editted and updated very soon. I hope the later books in the series aren't formatted so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story but full of typos in the Kindle edition","review":"The story is great. I read it in paperback awhile back. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is so full of typos and other errors that it distracts from the story. For example, instead of 'hand of the king', it says 'hand of the ring'; 'longs words' instead of 'long swords'; 'torn' instead of 'tom'; 'righting someone else' instead of 'fighting someone else'; just to name a few. There are many more, and I'm not even one third through the book. Also punctuation errors.I contacted Amazon about this problem, and got a reply stating that they were working on getting it fixed. I hope they do, as a book as good as this deserves a better translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series - if he ever finishes it!","review":"All the positives written about this series are true - the character development, plot devices, shakespearean killings, and non formulaic writing are really very attractive, and will keep you reading right until the end. And there's the problem. GRRM has not finished the series. The next book was promised years ago, and the estimated date for publication keeps getting pushed out. If GRRM keeps to this pace, the last book will be finished sometime in 2030! It is the opinion of many that he has lost interest, and is now focusing on more important things like the miniseries, and flying around the world to various fan events.Be warned - you could invest a lot of time and money in this series and leave it feeling very unfulfilled.My recommendation would be to leave it on the shelf, and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction with a dash of fantasy","review":"After reading several rave reviews I didn't know what I would find between the covers of George RR Martin's book. This book is more like a fictional world that has dashes of fantasy thrown in. It is fast paced, well writtn, full of well-fleshed out characters and a gripping story. This book was definitely worth the read. Between the covers you will find intrigue, politics, humor, heart break, love, sacrifice, honor, magic and dragons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but slow","review":"I really enjoyed Game of Thrones, but at times it seemed to progress rather slowly. It does a good job of keeping your attention and filling you with suspense. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editing concerns have been fixed!","review":"First off, since almost every review sings the praises of the content of this book, I will start with the more pressing concern of the grammatical errors that seem to have come with previous versions of this kindle book. Most reviews I read said the book was riddled with editing mistakes almost to the point that it was unreadable, which almost deterred me from downloading it. I was, however pleasently surprised to find it almost error-free after finishing it. It would seem that the good people of Amazon read the reviews and act upon them. So if you are like me and are hesitant to buy this because you are scared of too many typos, fear not and enjoy this excellent novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the show - but how's the book","review":"Got into the series on HBO from the get go and heard the book was even better. Turns out their equally as good. Surprisingly, the series follows the book quite closely, with very little deviation and only a few details left out. Looking forward to starting book 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One","review":"Too difficult to follow the story, too many characters, changes in scenery, i couldn't finish the book, especially since it's just a first book in the series, i gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fantasy titles ever","review":"The cast of characters is intriguing and the various plots and situations are engaging. This is definitely a must own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"True literature, comical, violent, real","review":"True literature for those who appreciated it. Comical, Tyron is my favorite character. Violent as a real man's novel should be. Real world dynamics in terms of character development. This series is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult Eyes Only","review":"I love this series, but the sexual content is disturbing to me. It's minimal in the first book then gets more explicit with each following book. By the time you are hooked the only way to finish the entire story is to read about explicit sexual encounters, men pleasing themselves and women pleasing women. I wouldn't have started the series if I'd known this.If this doesn't bother you then you will love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxious to read what happens next","review":"Riveting and exciting.

It is genuinely one of the most engaging fantasy books every written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for HBO!","review":"Just watch the show. Don't bother with books! Futhermore, at the rate Martin writes HBO will have to decide who wins the Iron Throne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly complicated structure","review":"This novel tries to provides too much structure and a ridiculous number of characters. On three attempts I could not get past chapter three. Save your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I watched the HBO series prior to reading this book, so I had an idea of what to expect. The tv series deviated a tiny bit from the book, but I like the way all the different characters' point of views were presented in chapters. There's not much I can say other than this is a typical medieval epic. It's a long read and I don't want to spend the money and time toward reading three more books. I think watching the series will suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Work of Fantasty!","review":"This is an amazing novel by Martin, with an engrossing plot and unique characters. Once you pick it up, you will not be able to put it down!

It lays the foundation for a deep, intricate plot that will keep you reading, and guessing, well into the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot, although long-winded","review":"I am a person who enjoys Russian authors and Robert Jordan, but the only gripe I have about this book is that is much too slowly paced. Other than that, the characters are very three dimensional with a great deal of background story (probably also why the story is so long winded). It was a great introduction to the series. After I read this book, I couldn't wait to get to book 2. Sadly, the rest of the series is nowhere near as good as the first book.Enjoyable read, but still second to the Wheel of Time for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"This book is fantastic. I've read the entire series at this point and the characters are like old friends!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome plot and character litely dusted with the mystic","review":"The writing is seemless and powerful. Every character seems given just the right amount of attention and they have personalities outside the cookie cutters. As with real people's lives, there isn't a clear cut end or complete resolution in the end (in any of this series) however I find satisfaction in seeing the characters progress through the intrigues. The story rings of the historical while very occasionally peppering you with the concept of mystical forces the might be real. Well worth your time to read for a taste of reality in your fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me AT ALL--way too much rape, dark and depressing","review":"I read all kinds of books, and I'm in no way an expert on the fantasy genre. However, I found this book depressing on many levels. All the characters are unlikeable, except for a couple of the children. I guess I really like a good protagonist because I found myself wanting to ROOT for someone, but I just couldn't. As the author kills of character after character, I discovered that I just didn't care anymore.Also, I have NEVER read a book with so much rape in it, and I really just don't need those images in my head. At one point, a raiding tribe pillages a community and a group of soldiers are raping a woman from behind while she is bent over a pile of corpses. I should have just put the damn book down at that point, but I was determined to finish it. I wish I hadn't. Never again George R.R. Martin. People ought to be ashamed to compare this writer to J.R.R. Tolkien. About the only thing they have in common is the R.R."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Novel- Kindle Edition RIDDLED with typos","review":"This is a review of the KINDLE edition of Game of Thrones, which is a wonderful fantasy novel, a sort of brutal, medieval soap opera.The Kindle Edition, however, has so many typos as to detract from the experience.

As in nothing of worth. Reminiscent of Top-40 music, where any originality and substance is eschewed in favor of exploiting recognizeable cliches ad nauseum.The characters are caricatures. Not a single one has embarked on \\"The Hero's Journey\\". I had zero empathy for any of them. The protagonists and antagonists are indistinquishable, like the clowns on WWF, not the characters in Catch-22. The violence is without purpose. The conflicts are predictable. The mythos derivative. The language is crude, the writing ponderous.I can think of no greater insult to Tolkien's LOTR than to be compared with this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Lame","review":"I don't know, honestly, what anyone sees in this book. It is substandard fiction and grossly boring: nothing happens in the first 70 pages. If the author does not bother to structure the plot to make something, anything, happen in the first 70 pages, he deserves to suffer in whatever literary hell there is.The prologue is good, and it made me think that I was about to get swept away into an exciting, richly immagined story. WRONG! The next 60 pages are just boring. The world describes is hardly richly immagined and the language is hard to fall in love with. The characters are just run of the mill genre cutouts. I hate being cheated. This book is simply lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"**Warning, this series contains sexualy explicit material**","review":"There are several passages in Martin's series that are so graphic, they could not be published on this web site.

I opened this book, excitement pouring all over me.........and guess what I got for 50 pages (that's all I read): Boring diolague, no action, super-long pages, to much swearing and sexual innuedo, no action and, worst of all, the characters were idiots. For one part, none of the women were strong, and the men were plain dull as well. No excitement. It's almost as if GRRM read 'Assassin Apprentice', loved it, and said 'I'm gonna write a book that's as boring as this one, but even more so, with even worse things: I'm gonna make everyone buy it cause there's a cool cover, and then they'll be so excited, when they find out they hate it, they won't bring it back.'Overall, this is the worst book on Earth, and, unless you thought Tolkien was exciting the entire way (I do like LotR, but at some times it's boring), you SHOULD'NT Read this book. Don't waste your money. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick just plain sick!","review":"This book is dark and dreary! Just plain depressing nothing good happens to any of the main people!

Anybody that can relate to this book is a sick sick monster!

It far surpasses Lord of the Rings and creates a world that is completely engrossing.

And don't get attached to the characters because he kills'em off more than the villains die, if they die at all...The deaths are also gratuitous most of the time and grisly to say the least.there just is no point to them at all other than to tick off the reader.Oh, and also I'm 15 not 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts of Ok, but...","review":"It took me a rather long time to read this book. No, not because of it's length (Just finished Eye of the World in a few days). I was saddened by the fact that a thread could not be continued for more than a chapter. It was something of a plot shattering idea to change the POV every few pages.I was so distracted that I finished a chapter and didn't pick up the book again for 2 months! ( I can barely believe I picked it back up at all!)Over all, the characters are well developed, but a little slow in the head. Could there not be one wise person among them all?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?!?!","review":"Am I the only person who was extremely uncomfortable with the portrayal of the female characters in this book? Sex with very young girls, rampant rape, and the general disregard/disdain for women through this book and the others in this series left me fuming.

Few of the characters are what we assume, one minute you loath them and the next you wish to champion their cause. The only other author that does this successfully is Tolkien. A truly epic fantasy! Expect the unexpected! You don't need to read far into the book before you realize that you can't anticipate the story, you must read on and let Martin tell his tale. A Game of Thrones is an outstanding book! After finishing the book I only hope that Martin continues to write, and fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quickest 800+ page book I've read in a while.","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Wanted to read it before I watched the mini-series. Might be a poor analogy but it reminded me of reading books by Jeff Shaara in that I saw the story unfold through the main character's point of view. Haven't read LOTR since high school (20+ years) but I found myself itching to read on and I was more enthusiastic about completing the book than Tolkien's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to the hype","review":"To be honest, I only read this book because so many people had been going on about it for so long, I just had to see what all the fuss was about. I was surprised how much I liked it, because I'm not normally much of a fantasy fan, but this was a very intriguing story told with real style. I might even read the next in the series, who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome book. The first book set in this time period that I've liked. One of the best books I have read. It took me a few chapters to get into the book but from then on I was hooked. Note there is an appendix in the back of the book that is useful as you read it. I referred to the appendix and map as I read which really added to the story and helped me remember all of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like formulaic fantasy? This book's not for you.","review":"If you require an easy read with a quick resolution, forget the Fire and Ice series. The books are loaded with detail, characters and subplots. This is good storytelling- if you take on reading the series with the intention of sinking your teeth into a well written, imaginative, substantive tale you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"A superb third book in his Series.

Objectively , very few good events take place in the story. The characters you can identify with seem to have, almost, only bad things happen to them. Maybe it is only setting things up for the future , but if you want something thats fun to read,and that buoys your spirits,DON'T READ THIS BOOK. If you want a story that holds your attention, has intensity, but at the same time brings down your ambient temperature of attitude and hope, read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome back, George?","review":"Well, he's back, and arent we all yearning for something new and refreshing? Yearning for male characters smart enough to tie their own shoelaces? Yearning for female characters who are more than scheming, conniving, or helpless babes in the woods who do not much more than make bad decisions and whine?Keep yearning.Martin's swords sans sorcery attempt is chock full of the banal and with nothing new to grab you with, so check it out of your local library if you've found some time on your hands, but for heavens sake dont buy the darn thing....it'll only encourage him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Fantasy - complex plot, great adult story line","review":"I loved the entire series. Not sure if i want to watch the TV series or not.The book was well written, the characters are well defined, but what i love most about his style is that he develops plots that are complex. Also, it is hard to find fantasy books targetting the adult reader!If you like complex plots with graphic stories targeting the adult reader.Succubus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"This was the second book I read of the series. I'd bought 'A Clash of Kings' and had read that immediately after watching the TV series.The problem with the series was that there was a lot of information to condense into 10 episodes. I finished the series knowing the major plot points and characters. I didn't understand the rest - the other characters and their motives - because there was far too much information to digest.I believe that any fan of the series should read this. The TV show was very faithful to the book, except for the addition of a couple of scenes. The main difference was that the book allowed me to understand the plot correctly.The book allowed me to understand all that. It has allowed me to understand what is going on in future books.I really, and unexpectedly, enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of fantasy, nor do I enjoy reading books after I've seen the film/series that inspired them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the Best Fantasy Book I've Read in Decades","review":"I felt the need to post my five-star opinion of this, the first book in GRRMs series, A Song of Ice and Fire. Hooked from the first page, the first chapter, the action never lets up in this amazing work of art. HBO has made this book famous, but HBO cannot possibly deliver the detail that is described in this book. Enter another world with Game of Thrones - a world you won't want to leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel for the Story Telling","review":"This is my first time reading from George R.R. Martin. As my first time reading an adventure book based on the hype of George Martin's book series, I was not disappointed. Don't come into this book looking for artistic literature, but rather artistic sensuality. He is very good at creating a great story, a story that lasts for hundreds upon hundreds of pages. If he decided to write the amount of detail described in a book like \\"The Road\\", then the book may have become two thousand pages long. I chose four stars because I am not a fan of some of the gross sexuality involved in the story, but of course, opinionated.Long story short, read this for the adventure rather than artistic language present in many popular novels. You will most likely be compelled to turn the next page every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for Post-Jordan entertainment?","review":"Having read the last published Jordan book in his \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, I was out looking for something as inticing and mysterious untill the next book comes out. I have come to the judgement that this is the best thing out there. Although there is rare mention of any metaphysical energies, the political double backs and triple crosses will more than make up for it. The author does a very good job of making that(political unrest, intrigue and games) aspect of the story line interesting, I usually find politics bland, but with the characters, who are rounded and believeable, the political intrigue filters smoothly between scenes of merciless masacres and righteous battles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing disapointment","review":"From what I've read below this seems to be a book you either love or hate. I am one of those who hated it. Martin seems to love making his \\"good\\" charaters suffer and letting his \\"bad\\" characters win. The only good part of the book was torward the middle, both the beginning and the end were dreadfully depressing. I felt like burning the book after I finished reading it. The detailed sexual content didn't help it any either. One of the below reviewers called this book a classic. I won't argue. I've read most classics. While most were well-written, like this book, most were also depressing, like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno...","review":"I gather most folks loved this book, and I am sticking with it, but it's a bit confusing at times. If you have a character named Eddard, why does he go by Ned?

I've never been one for this type of book and was quite honestly expecting to read a few chapters and walk away. My how I was wrong. This book grips you from the beginning and just doesn't let go.

If you like fantasy, buy it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZzzzz. *Snort*","review":"Oh, gods... I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books. His stories progress at a glacial pace. This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent. Or rather, the majority of them aren't. If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading. Or if the characters were dynamic, that would be alright. The characters are too often like pieces of flotsam tossed on rough seas. Life is like that sometimes. But it doesnt make for good storytelling.The books I'm reminded most of to compare these to are Brin's Galactic Civilization books. He also split the story among many characters. But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like. Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"After seeing the HBO series, I became very interested in the story.

The read is fantastic, it follow the story line of the TV series with certain minor twist. So far the book is not as bawdy as the show, but is more insightful to the characters. The best thing about the book is, it would be a good read even if you are not familiar with the show. The TV show with putting a face to all the characters, but the book dedicates chapters to the different folks to help with the confusion. I am about 1/2 way through the book, and I cannot wait for every opportunity to read it. Am real page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read","review":"It's an addicting read, and once you finish it you'll immediately want to read the rest of them.

A reader that doesn't mind sifting through a couple hundred pages before the fun begins. With endless lists of names and titles the first half of the book is reminiscent of history text books. However once through the tedium of learning who all of the characters of the book are and the author finally finishes his base the action begins. All in all not too bad, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a fun book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos!","review":"You will not find a better series in this genre, bar none.It's a tad slow getting started, but if you'll stick with it, throw aside previous prejudices about the genre, you will find an absolute perfect gem.This series will shatter all plot preconcetions you may have gotten, and it may unsettle you. This is much more like real life than Campbell's Hero; this is what may well have happened at that time and it isn't pretty.This is an adult series, and it may well be the best I've ever read. Main characters kick the bucket; regularly, the seemingly dominate characters maybe aren't...This is a brutal example of real life, and I can't compliment or recommend GRRM any more highly.You miss the boat is you don't read this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with the narrator","review":"I love this series but I personally can't stand listening to Roy Dotrice. He meanders on at a glacial pace and it seems to me that he's only got three different voices at his disposal. He uses his own voice for the POV characters, a voice that sounds old and fat for the non-POV guys, and a leprechaun impersonation for Tyrion. I'd skip the audiobooks for the actual books in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I am forcing myself to read it at this point, halfway through and if I could find something else to read, this wouldnt get read any further.Female characters get abused left and right.Its frustrating because you get into a characters story and then another characters story takes off abruptly. Tired of that.Lots of political intrigue, that I dont care about any longer, and didnt really care about to begin with.I thought I missed something at first because there was such a leap into the characters at the beginning of the book I wasnt sure if I had the first book or the second.I would say that I do wish to see the show and may buy the DVDs, but I sure as heck wont be buying the next books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game of Thrones","review":"WHY am I unable to purchase this book for my Kindle?

The narrator does a terrible job reading it and its hard to understand him and follow along. He slurs words, speaks real fast in some areas and normal in others. But the worst part is he uses the character voices when he says the 'he said' or 'he said with a shudder' or whatever. So as you listen, its hard to make any sense of it!Very disappointing. Guess ill have to just read it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Game of Thrones","review":"George R.R. Martins Game of Thrones has been by far the most compelling series that I have ever read. It is quite remarkable how he has one, the ability to create a whole universe in his head, and two, the ability to develop a masterful story line within that universe. The way in which he develops the characters are incredible, and really serve to engage the reader in the story, and make them feel a part of the world as well. The Game of Thrones is a must read for any fan of great fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I read this because I LOVE Game of Thrones on HBO. While the book played out just like the show, I couldn't finish the book. I kept putting it down and not picking it up for days. The book reads much slower than seeing the show, which is maybe why I didn't love it.The characters are great, have wonderful depth and while hating some of them, you still love them.The book just wasn't for me, but I highly recommend the show to anyone who has read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a lawn mower manual","review":"BEcause of the praise for this book, I struggled through. Halfway, I realized it wasn't worth it. The characters have little depth. The personalities are non-existent leaving the reader unable to tell them apart. Everything is handed to the reader leaving nothing to the imagination. It could be a stage play except it is as interesting as the stage directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning for pre-teen readers","review":"My eleven-year-old son is an advanced reader, and I've purchased many Kindle books for him. I usually don't have time to read as much as he does, so I just trust the reviews and read a synopsis here or there.He began reading this book, and he noticed there was a TV series. When we investigated the TV series on IMDB, we had to discuss the sex and incest in the book. My son said he was enjoying the storyline of the book, but he was bothered by the \\"sex parts\\" in the book and started skipping over them.The consensual sex between a brother and a sister is really not something I would like my young adolescent reading about. I'm willing to tolerate well-crafted characters who deal with real-life problems--even when those problems are difficult issues, but a character witnessing the incest and describing it was just too much.This series is definitely meant for older teens and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE","review":"George RR martin has really outdone himself, this is the most riveting and the best written fantasy i have ever read. The characters are done so well it's hard to beleive that this is an epic fantasy and not a history. the entire story is real to the reader, the plot is perfectly crafted with unexpected twists and turns. i would STRONGLY recomend this book to ANYONE, you don't have to be a fantasy reader to enjoy the song of ice and fire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"loved it.sent it sitting here in oz.sent to usa.so easy.my partner loves it.we have something to chat about.great buy for anyone.thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awed","review":"This is the first five star rating I have given since coming to Amazon. It is once in a very long while that you will come across a novel where an author is able to meld a story so broad of scope and interesting to read that hour after hour will slip by unnoticed as you turn the pages. A Game of Thrones is one of these books. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre and believe yourself able to handle realistic depictions of life in a medieval world (blood, gore, profanity and sexual situations included) then I strongly believe you would enjoy reading this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best book series since LOTR","review":"If you like fantasy/adventure stories a la LOTR than tiis is the book series 4 You!

Though the introduction of new characters later in the series forced me to stop to try to remember who these characters were, it added to the complexity of the story. I also love that the author is not afraid to kill off main characters - very realistic though sometimes regrettable. I also love that it is a long series - so much to enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining,","review":"This stor is one of the best i've ever read.

I am waiting for the fourth, if only because the story never ends, and I guess I need to find out what happens. It's a great story poorly told, interesting, with many plot twists and turns that are so unique and unexpected that they eventually become predictable--what is the worst, most depressing, shocking turn of events that could occur? And it usually does.It's the writing I can't stand. It's terrible, juvenile, wretched prose, with phrases like, \\"walking like he had a dagger up his ...\\". I've read the story once, and never again. It's a pity that a great story was delivered so poorly, when the author had at his disposal the same language of Tolkien!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It needs a little less sex and a lot more action.","review":"(...)I would read a book from the romance or erotica sections.

If you like soap operas, and obviously lots of people do, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbingly horrible","review":"Martin is one of the worst writers I have ever read in my entire life. He wouldn't haven't a clue if you handed him one. The child sex scenes with adults alone should be enough to give readers a clue that this is the sort of drivel that gives fantasy a bad name. If I read about another clueless 1 dimensional character I'm going to run away screaming. Were the editors of this book asleep at the wheel as well? Martin frequently confuses and misplaces pronouns, nouns and adverbs. I learned how to write better in the sixth grade. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Finish the Series","review":"This is a great book, but George Martin will not finish the series. He has left us hanging for years. By the time he finishes the series you are going to have to reread the entire series so wait until it is done with the series before you start it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea. Poor execution.","review":"My problem with this author's lack of writing skills can be summed up thusly: he crams 1 book's worth of writing into 4.He is the writer in most need of an editor that ever there was. 65% of his verbiage should be trimmed to make this book readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow sequence of books","review":"So... one minor caveat... if you prefer to read a series that will be finished in your lifetime, and you are not a vampire, tree, or sentient rock, you might choose another series. If you are a vampire, you'll need to turn Martin, because otherwise he probably wont finish the series anyways. :)Great series as far as it goes, but at the current state of the 'next book' being something like 3+ years overdue, don't hold your breath for a completed series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fantasy","review":"I just finished reading and I must say that together with Lord of the Rings it's my favorite fantasy book so far. It starts slowly and takes time for the action to come but once it comes you won't feel disappointed. By the 2nd half of the book I was not able to put the it away. I'm so glad I also bought 'A Clash of Kings' before so I can start reading right away :D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Better then LotR..

It was great. They stuck in characters perfectly in every situation and moves through the characters constanly which makes you read through the book faster than u can believe. What's sad though is how the author can kill off people so fast. Defianently, not your typical good and evil story. This book is a great start to a series that is sadly, going downhill. Hopely though with A Feast For Crows he can stick this series back up there with the best series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a must read!","review":"George LL Martin sees the story through a variety of characters without duplicating the same events. I was extremely impressed with this novel and also book 2 of the series, Clash of Kings. I found myself unable to put the book down because of the suspense brought to the book by the use of the different characters. It's a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I'm generally not a fan of epic fantasy series, but a friend recommended this novel to me, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I really enjoyed reading it--what appealed to me most were the characters, particularly Eddard because of his committment to his family, Arya, and Jon. Since you're reading from each individual perpective, there are times when you know more than your character-- and I found that sense of dramatic irony to be very effective. The episodic nature kept the action and intrigue fresh, so I never found myself weary of reading. My criticisms with the book are that there were too many characters to keep up with, and sometimes I felt like I was reading towards something that never happens. Additionally, I felt as thought Martin should have included a little more information about the 'common' people of the realm and the general economy (which seem to be tacked on in the next installment as an afterthought). Overall, it was a thoroughly fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"I have been reading SF since the 60's, and have been a fan of Martin's for many years. His Ice and Fire series is the best stuff written since Dune, in my opinion. This book, volume one, is truly great. Book two is very good, book three is the best so far in the series, and book four is a huge disappointment. Hopefully book five due sometime in 2009 will recapture the greatness of the first three books. This most recent purchase from Amazon is a gift for a nephew. Hopefully he will enjoy this superb storyteller, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better second time around","review":"I have apparently matured a lot since my early 20s - I attempted to read this shortly after it was first published in '98, but was only able to get through the first few chapters. I decided to give it another try after all the recent hype and the TV show (still haven't seen it). I'm glad I did - this book is fantastic. The story is incredibly engaging, very true to the medieval period, and despite the unexpected killing off of some great characters, a very fun read. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts from a reader who is not much of an \\"epic fantasy\\" fan","review":"I generally lose interest in epic fantasy novels, due to the habit most writers in the genre seem to have of including WAY too much dialogue about nothing, repeating the same ideas, concepts, and emotions again and again, simply for the sake of filling up a few extra hundred pages. For the most part, Martin does a great job of avoiding that pitfall. Although there is a ton of dialogue in this novel, most of it is actually quite interesting, and it likewise serves as legitimate character development and plot advancement. It still got a little slow for me toward the middle, but overall, this is a great ambassador for the genre. It's intelligent, deeply layered, and written with a gifted hand. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" starts strong, and finishes REAL strong. Looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!","review":"I am so invested in these characters I just love reading these books over and over.

If I had to get slapped in the face with one more perversion: incest, child murder, rape ( after selling your own sister to a barbarian chief that only knows 1 word of your language...\\"No\\") I wanted to bleach my braincells. Alas, what is seen cannot be unseen. So if that's your gig, have at, I'll take my good and bad guys without the hefty dose of Dr Phil-isms.

The print is too small. There are 46 lines per page with 55 characters per line. This is a huge book! I could not hold the book open with my injured hand. There are far too many different names of people and places. These are not oommon names like Bill and George but Daenerys and Illyrio.This book is fantasy. But there are 4 deaths in the first 20 pages, including one man who is beheaded.

The main family, the Starks, living on their winter land -- get it?, a Stark landscape. . . The map of the world - a poor rip-off of tolkien with geographic names like \\"Red Bay\\" and \\"Blue Cove\\" . . . and the writer's inability to build true tension \\"He felt something was wrong,\\" \\"he felt cold,\\" \\"he felt forboding\\" . . . all conspire to make this a mediocre book and reveal a mediocre writer.Get the real thing - Tolkien, and see what this guy is attempting to emulate. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for the inexperienced fantasy reader","review":"Not that anyone will ever find this review in the amazingly long list of reviews, but I feel I must write it anyway. This book is what I consider as junior fantasy. It ranks on par with David Eddings and all of the Dragonlance books. Decent story, decent writing, but the depth just isn't there. There is very little character development, the plot is more or less predictable, and there's little original about the themes. One of my rules of thumb is that if I ever hear an adult raving about this book or any of Eddings' or Weiss/Hickman's works, I can be pretty sure that they really aren't that experienced in the world of fantasy fiction. 1000+ cheering reviews for this book shouldn't fool anyone but junior high kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the characters, love the pace","review":"There were a lot of characters to keep straight, but I loved the Stark family, and all the supporting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel but very long and its pacing is not that good.","review":"As a writer myself I admire Martin's epic scope but I can tell that it is going to be a bad idea because of too many characters and plot lines.

The prose is plodding, the characters unlikeable and the prose tedious. A tenth grader could write better prose than Martin. I want the prose to sing and the story to engage, not bore me. I tried slogging through the next three too see if it would get better and maybe it did, but not much.Even Terry Goodkind is better than this Martin guy. If you want to read something good, try the \\"Way of Kings\\" by Brandon Sanderson. He is young still getting better, not over the hill and losing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and Complex","review":"A Game of Thrones, the first book of the Song of Ice and Fire trilogy, is a well-written work. The descriptive writing is layered and rich, intertwining with a fairly complex plot. Martin pulls off the essentials of fantasy well: strong world building, unique characters, and sudden plot twists signposted by subtle foreshadowing. If you're going to tackle this novel, be prepared for the deaths of key characters. Clearly, George Martin likes to kill off main characters so as to keep you on your toes. Also, he relies heavily on a Medieval influenced background where ladies are ladies and men are knights, with only the occasional female character choosing the sword. However, his characters leap from the page, and he sets up their internal action/thought in poetic fashion. Overall, worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"I am currently 2/3 of the way through this book. Love it, Love it, Love it!! The author is detailed & descriptive and leaves no doubt as to the scene he describes. This book has also been made into a mini-series or a weekly show (not sure which) but I have not been watching. I'd rather read it because a lot of times, something of the story gets lost in translation. I already have book 2 saved in my wish list because I don't want to miss a beat when I finish \\"A Game of Thrones\\". If you are a fantasy reader, read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"the story has you hooked from the beginning. I am flying through this book and intend to purchase the whole series. on a side note this book contain adult material and i don't recommend it to teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This novel can be appreciated by anyone, not just fans of high fantasy. It's a wonderful blend of violence, love, sex, deception and betrayal. Each chapter will leave you wanting more; and that's always a sign of a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Outstanding","review":"A Game of Thrones is the premier fantasy novel of the post-Tolkien era. Expounding the Tolkien view of the use of magic in the text -- namely that less is more -- and painting the complex relationships that underlie the various rivalries and factions in the text, Martin has created a believable world that is fascinating and engaging. The only problem is the long wait between the first and second volumes of what will likely be a four or five-book series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will grab you by the fingertips.","review":"A hard book to put down. The characters in this novel seem to come to life. If you like Robert Jordan or books similiar, then you will completely enjoy A Game of Thrones.The only sad part of the novel is waiting for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent. one of the best sci fi/ fantasy books I ever read","review":"Wow. I have never heard of Martin before but, after reading this book I am a loyal fan. It was one of the best books I ever read. He ranks up there with jordan, eddings and feist. I can't wait for the sequel. Hope to read it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - But a Tad Over-hyped","review":"This book is a pretty good read, but I really don't understand where all the praise is coming from. After the first 100 pages there isn't much mystery left in the world. It also seems like most of this book drags on for pages, then greatly advances the plot in just a few paragraphs. I suppose most fans of the genre aren't used to the 'shocking' sex exploits (poorly written IMO) and graphic combat so people give it extra credit for that kind of stuff.If you have high expectations on the book you may be dissapointed, otherwise it is better than most fantasy books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly one of the best fantasy series ever written","review":"I have a personal library of over 5000 books, mostly science fiction and/or fantasy novels. This does not include the myriads of titles I have borrowed over the years. I rarely write a review but this time is an exception. From the realism of the characters to the tight plot and the gripping story, this series has caught my attention. I am sure you have read many of the over 1200 reviews before this one, so I won't go into a synopsis of the story. I just wanted to express my opinion and tell you to buy this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't quite seem to put a fork in it","review":"I'm on page three hundred something and I'm stuck! The book seemed to start so promising, but now has bogged down. The writing is reminding me more and more of Robert Jordan. Too much detail about clothes and buildings and beards, etc. Can we just take it as a given that everyone wears the typical armor described in the story and only tell us on the rare occassion when someone isn't? I will say that, having read Ivanhoe several times, a couple of parts of the story that could have been exciting were only a pale imitation of that classic story (I have no doubt they were based on similar passages in Ivanhoe). Unfortunately, it seems modern fantasy novel sales are driven by page count, not story quality. I already have the next book in the series, but I'm going to have to be a masochist to get through them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adding my voice to the thousands","review":"Ser George R R Martin is, quite simply, a genius. Or perhaps a god among men. I haven't decided yet.A Game of Thrones is surprising, shocking, exciting, heartrending, hilarious, enlightening, and most of all: addicting.I could not put this book down and when I finished I read the sequel and then the third and now onto the forth. I am simply in awe of how breathtakingly awesome these books are.Even though there are a bajillion 5 star reviews up already, I wanted to add mine to the voice of thousands. This book is FANTASTIC. Read it.Read. It."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw dropping!","review":"An amazing world of fantasy, suspense, humor, intrigue, and deceit! I was continually eager to find out what was going to happen next. I love the way each chapter is named for the point of view of the person in that chapter, and I loved how the author sometimes ended each chapter with a cliffhanger that made you want to skip ahead to the next chapter told by that character!! I fully appreciate stories where things don't always work out, and aren't as they'd seem. It was nice to see those risks being taken in Game of Thrones. The ending had my jaw dropping for sure. I can't wait to read the rest of this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping story of kings and their thrones","review":"This book is the beggining of a wonderful story of a world of magic and kingdoms that seems so real you will think your there. The plot is so unpredictable you will never know what is coming next. The people are real and you will come to love them, hate them, and sometimes you'll feel a little bit of both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song of Fire and Ice vs. David Eddings","review":"I don't know which of you uninformed readers posted the review that stated that David Eddings's Mallorean didn't \\"compare\\" with this to recent novel by Martin and I don't care to. For all of you who are intrested in either of this two series by Eddings or Martin go ahead and read them. Eddings has a less believe system of using magic but the books are all really well written and will leave you with a sense of completion when you're done. The only con to this book is that all the novels are in 'small' bit sized chunks.(400-700 words long) I personally like a longer read so that I get to know the characters better. That's where A game of Thrones really shines through. You will read this book and really get into it. I remember have hard it was after reading the first to wait for the second to come out. Both books are equally good and I recommend both. If you're stuck for ideas on what to read next, check the 25 top books on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else is there to say?","review":"With so many reviews, it is hard to find something new to say. The multiple perspective format is sheer genius. This book will have you backtracking to re-read sections because you simply can't believe what you read. It is the start of a series that will bring you back again and again. You will struggle with wanting to read fast to know what happens next versus wanting to savor every moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"one word -awesome-","review":"one word -awesome- , this is the awesomest book ive read so far in my life. i give this book 5 stars because it has surpassed even the wonderful world of J.R.R Tolkien. There is not much to say just that this is one book that should be treasured. ( but mebe he went a bit overboard with the brothels:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last! Fantasy that is real, believable!","review":"The characters have depth. Martin shows the dark side of human nature yet weaves it into the fabric so that it adds depth to the story....makes it all exciting! The twist and turns of the story keep you in suspense for the entire read. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"this is the first of the Fire and Ice series and I have to say a GREAT READ. George RR Martin is a good writer one of the best in the fantasy genre. I highly recommend the books.Dealer is quick and sends what you ordered I also recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of thrones book 1","review":"What a book! The characters are fantastically written and it is impossible to choose a favorite. There is a lot going on and yet the thread of the story stays beautifully in tact. Although it is a long story every page leaves you wanting more! In so many instances when a book has been brought alive on screen,the book always proves to be better but in this case the Tv series and the book was very similar if not exactly the same, so if you have seen the series, the book will bring you nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"I never read Fantasy books, and rarely even read fiction. A friend of mine suggested I give \\"Game of Thrones\\" a try while traveling, and after downloading it to my KindleFire, I couldn't put it down. I am now halfway through the second book in the \\"Song of Ice & Fire\\" series, and am very excited to digest the rest of George R.R. Martin's books.I think the important part in Fantasy writing is doing it in such a way that the reader forgets it's Fantasy. I always assumed the genre was one for weak writers with over-strong imaginations, using fantastic situations to duck around ill-conceived plots and poor writing skills. I still think this is largely the case, but if so, George R.R. Martin is certainly a strong exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have not enjoyed a book this much since the conclusion of the Harry Potter series. Can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Word of Warning","review":"If you start this book, like I did, because you could not wait for HBO to finish the TV series - you will be disappointed. The \\"Game of Thrones\\" story is still not completed in written form, and is not expected to be finished for a few more years. As I understand it there are still two more books yet to be written. Personally, I will find it difficult to keep the multitude of characters and plots organized in my memory.Having said that, the yarn is a most engrossing read and I found almost all the books very difficult to put down.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Fantasy","review":"Boring, tedious, uninteresting. The only reason I finished is because I'd gotten so far in hoping for something to happen. Other reviewers compared it to Jordan and Goodkind, maybe if they wrote a history text! I didn't care about the good guys or the bad guys, so as they died it just didn't matter. Magic? It hints at it but never comes through. You want realism rent Braveheart; this is 700 pages of complete droll!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"One of the best books I have ever read! I have read things like The DragonLance chronicals (all four of them) All of the Drizzt Do'Urden books by R.A. Salvator and all of David Eddings books and I find this set of books the best so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down. Deserves an 11(best ever)!","review":"What a fantastic book!!800+ pages of pure joy and even after that I still wanted more. A Game of Thrones has everything - politics, plots, subplots, conspiracy, treason, murder, betrayal, sex, violence, romance, heroes, villains, hatred, love, war, evil, religion, royalty, savages, wolves, swords, horses, talking crows, castles, dragons....read it, today. You will never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astoundingly written, portrayed, and presented. Top notch.","review":"This is, by far, one of the best books written that I've ever read. And it will instantly make you wanna read the rest of the series.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely an epic","review":"An absolutely fantastic book! I cannot wait to read the next one! This book has everything - adventure, betrayal (lots and lots of betrayal), romance, and the characterization is excellent! I didn't feel like this book read like fantasy either. Aside from talk of dragons and The Others, it felt more like I was reading historical fiction. My favorite thing about the book is the way that each chapter is told from the viewpoint of a different character. It gave so much more insight into the characters and their way of thinking. Characterization is a very important part of a book for me. Also, no matter what I thought was coming, I was surprised! Sometimes, not pleasantly. It appears that Mr. Martin doesn't have a problem with letting you get attached to a character and then killing them off. That's okay though. It made for a very interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beginning","review":"I was lent this book by a friend and numerous recommendations, I settled down to read it. I was drawn into the violent and vivid world of Westeros. I followed the voyage of Ned Stark and his family from the cold reaches of the North and enjoyed the tangled web that permeated the world he found himself in. I sped through it, falling in love with several characters and crying bitterly when one failed to make it.An excellent start to the song of ice and fire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Work of Fantasy","review":"I was first a bit intimidated when I picked up A Game of Thrones, with the 800 and something pages it has. I thought that this was awfully long for a fantasy book but when I started reading it, I could not put it down. George R.R. Martin does a brilliant job in making the plot line flow like liquid but at the same time, giving every character their deserved description.This, along with the Riftwar Saga by Raymond E. Feist are some of my favorite works of fiction. I would HIGHLY recommend giving this enticing and thrilling game of thrones."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"It didn't look very good when I first picked it up, but oh was I surprised!This series is my favorite series, and books in the world! I am waiting for A Feast for Crows to come out now, and so I can enjoy another one of GRRM's masterpieces.This particular tale starts off the series, it is basically an introduction book to this series. But it is worth the eight dollars you spend on it. In fact it is worth alot more, I think.In my opinion it is 2x better than any Tolkein book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unimaginative, formulaic, and badly written","review":"Many people cite the book's darkness and violence and rape as their reason for hating this book. I think I would be ok with all that, as long as I thought the book was well-written, and had interesting characters and an engaging plot-line. I found none of that in this book. The only characters who leapt of the page were Arya and Tyrion; the rest were drab cardboard figures-- even when they were \\"complex\\". Ned, John, Bran, Catelyn just weren't made interesting enough. The plot, which is supposedly intricate, was boring and predictable and marched along at a snail's pace. The world-building was also lacking, and seemed to have been borrowed-- and borrowed unimaginatively, at that-- from every formulaic fantasy book out there. The old-fashioned style of language felt forced and completely fake. When I finished the book I breathed a sigh of relief. Thank god no one's forcing me to read all the rest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"broad but shallow","review":"I keep trying to like this book. The wordsmithing is excellent. But I just can't find anything beyond that to recommend it. The characters are flat, the plot is complex but meaningless. Lots of pointless violence and nothing seems to be resolved. The only really interesting part (the north wall) is never fully developed.I don't see what the fuss is about. It just isn't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"sexist flop","review":"It was suggested that I would like this book because I like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. However, those suggesting that forget that the reason so many women like Jordan's books is because of their strong, independent, and respected women. This novel treats its women in any way but that. How many times do breasts, \\"teats\\", sadism of women, and helplessness/insignificance of women need to be talked about in just the first few chapters? Men will probably like this book but I suggest women save their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do people rave about this book","review":"Why do people love this book, it is so tedious long and boring. You could have told the same story in under four hundred pages. Too many characters and the story is so predictable. I will not be spending money on any of the other books in this serious ."},{"rating":"1","title":"People must love porn","review":"I recently made a second attempt to read this book, and gave up again. I really wish GRRM had stuck to writing science fiction, because I love his work in that arena. But this fusion of medieval fantasy with graphic gratuitous sex just turns my stomach. What really infuriates me is that I bought the first three volumes of the series before I realized what they were. I donated them to the office charity book sale, and I noticed they sold within an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!","review":"I must say,... this book ranks as one of the best I've read in quite a while. I didn't pick this series up until the fourth book was already out. Rereading them all in anticipation of the 5th book, hopefully to be released in July! I love that each chapter is dedicated to the perspective of a single character and that, while there is some overlap, you get so many different points of view on the ongoing events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and Dull","review":"I don't understand the rave reviews for this book. I can only imagine they must have been written by entry level fantasy readers. Game of Thrones contains ideas, characters, plot lines, and props you've seen in other books, not to mention the medieval setting which is old hat. In addition, there is much flagrant borrowing from Tolkien without the scholarship or depth of imagination. The multi-thread plot structure doesn't work because there are far too many characters, and you don't care much about any of them. Daenerys was the only interesting character and I found myself skipping to her chapters. There are many spots were the writing is excellent and shines but not bright enough to save the novel. I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"I actually wished I could give it zero stars. If you pick up this book thinking you could connect with a character forget it! This book give fantasy a bad name. I'm all for multiple POV but this is ridiculous. A barrage of characters that you will plain out loath or are evil. There is nothing to look forward to in the book. No clash of good and evil or even a gray area villain to cheer on. Just a endless parade of bad people doing bad things! All in all if you want a book that you cant follow and mass characters die for no reason with no plot movment....here it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really fantasy","review":"I finished this book, and at 800+ pages, that means it has some value. However, I had the impression this would be a FANTASY book, not a medieval power struggle that happens to take place in an alternate universe. Aside from the preface, there are no fantasy or supernatural elements in the story until almost 500 pages in.There are many, many characters in the book, and that's certainly daunting when you first start. Add to this the fact that some characters go by different names, and it makes it a difficult book to get into. However, I did get into it enough to read all the way through, and certainly by the end of the story I knew all of the major characters.One other issue I have is that the book doesn't really stand by itself. Things happen, but there's no sense of a build to a climax. In fact, it really seems like a deliberate effort to set things up for the next book in the series. That's fine, but it's better if a book can stand by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to read","review":"I bought the book a couple of weeks ago and reading it is a pain due to some problem with the spaces between some of the words. Can not talk about the content. The product is poor from the editorial point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"TYPOS!","review":"Great story, and great writing. Too bad the digital edition is riddled with spelling errors and typos. It is very distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I wasn't expecting Lord of the Rings quality, but so many of my friends said it was a good series so I bought the first book in the series. Thank god I only bought the first one. I find it completely dull and it seems to jump without making decent correlations when going back to a character. I defiantly don't see the hype in it. Next book please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My #1 Fantasy Pick","review":"Gritty, dirty, creepy, bloody, realistic, suspenseful, and very epic. George RR Martin's Game of Thrones is any fantasy lover's dream come true. There is nothing here not to love (unless you have a weak stomach). If you think the HBO series is fantastic, the books will leave you breathless, sleep-deprived, and begging for more. In my opinion, Martin's Game of Thrones / Song of Ice and Fire series is the very best in Fantasy literature today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand alone - Good. Epic - Bad","review":"The first book is readable and even quite enjoyable, but the language (She was a women \\"flowered\\") repeated over and over gets a bit hard to take. In later books of the series you really have to been keen to keep reading as they become harder and harder to stay interested in each story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"The series has got to be one of the best ever. Beware, it's not for the faint of heart since some parts can be very gruesome. But don't let a little blood discourage you from reading this fine work. The only negative about the series is that you have to wait so long between books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is regarding the Kindle Version ONLY","review":"I love this series. I have read books 1-4 over and over again. When I saw HBO was shooting Game of Thrones, I wanted to read it once more before that series begins next year, so I grabbed the Kindle version.The amount of typos in this version is completely unacceptable. It was obviously transcribed and never even perused before being uploaded. It makes Bantam look bad, makes Martin look bad, and makes me so mad that I am having a hard time enjoying the book.The types of mistakes range from the most basic: a completely wrong word such as \\"he\\" instead of \\"had\\" or a basic typo such as \\"sex\\" instead of \\"ser\\" to the unexplainable: italicizing a word and splitting it into hyphenated syllables for no apparent reason. It is averaging an error each page near the end, as if the transcriber had checked out completely by this point.Do yourself a favor, especially if this is your first time reading this amazing book. DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book hard to read at first","review":"I enjoyed A game of Thrones it was different and interesting from what I'm usally used to reading in a fantasy book like DragonLance and Forgotten Realms. I had to re-read certin pages over to make sure I understood what was happening. From what I got out of it the main Familes are the Lannister's and the Stark's while there are a total of about 7 familes all together the main focus was on the Lannister's an Stark's. What really cought my attention is the Lannister's marrying with in the familes brother to sister and so forth to keep the Royal blood pure and strong. That was different plus it has become the survival of the fittest and who benifets from whos death. Reminds me of Drizzt's fellow people the Dark elves who fight to see which Royal House moves up the Ranks or dies from the Forgotten Realms books. all in all a good book that I highly recommened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but Linley 300 pages too long","review":"I'm off to read the second book, but know that while Martin is a wordsmith, he's also overbearing with his length at times. Skip a chapter of a little girl running around town? Yes. Skip a meeting in a King's hall? Please!Of course, I'll take all of that to read the intricately-woven plotline that he has going. It's no secret that he is crafting the modern classic of fantasy literature. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Different - but Good!","review":"It's a different type of book than I've read before and I like it a lot for that very reason. It's well written, colorful and easily imagined. I'll definitely buy the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasantly surprised","review":"Even if you are not a typical reader of fantasy/swords and armor lliterature, I think that you will enjoy this book. Very well written, engaging. It's like a gourmet mental potato chip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Games of Kings and Thrones","review":"I read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and loved it. It is one of the best fantasy books that I have read, and it is about how Eddard Stark becomes the King's Hand after the mysterious death of Jon Arryn. He decides to go to the castle to investigate. Meanwhile, the old king's son and daughter are at the Dothraki Isles, and the daughter, Daenyrys, marries Khal Drogo. A khal is a king over there, and leads a khalaseer. Many plots are in this book, and it is written beautifully. I'd tell you some, but that would ruin the surprise. If you liked this book, I would suggest the rest of the series (A Song of Ice and Fire), the Inheritance trilogy, and the Bartimaeus trilogy. All of them are great books, and I personally loved them. Many of the book nerds in my class loved them too, but only those that have read them of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is action packed and somewhat more realistic than other historical fantasy books-more gray characters, good guys get killed, etc. Some characters are interesting and likable and some are despicable. Sometimes the violence and swearing is over abundant."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book series","review":"if dance with dragons doesn't come out soon i'm gonna scream. This is the first book in an amazing adventure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Rich and Intriguing","review":"I must confess, I decided to read this book after watching the first season of Game of Thorns on HBO. I finished this immense novel rather quickly. I was amazed how HBO brought this novel to life. This is how good this author is. The show had dialogue from the book that was word for word, nothing was amended. While the show was only 10 episodes long, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book and understanding the vast cast of characters of this series. Martin is detailed and insane! He is not afraid to kill off main characters of the story. I was SHOCKED with the deaths of Ned and Robert. But it was necessary to begin the Game of Thrones.I will be continuing the series to see who ultimately wins the Game of Thrones. I am rooting for Jon Snow to win!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series ever!","review":"Ive read hundreds of fantasy books and A game of Thrones is my favorite series ever. Characters are complex and unpredictable. Rich and believable world. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult and confusing characters","review":"This trilogy was recommended to me but I found that I couldn't even get through the first book. The chapters are broken up by characters (which have unusual and difficult to pronounce names). It was an effort to follow on an e-pad because I wanted to flip back to previous chapters to remember who plays what part in the story. It's not clear about who are the good/bad guys, which can be fun, but not when the characters are numerous and confusing. About halfway through I gave it up. Probably would have been a decent read in paperback form."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Song well sung","review":"Unbelievable mastery in complexity. This whole series has so many plots, twists and faux pass that it truly is impossible to predict the ending of any of them. It is a masterpiece of ingenuity and storytelling that captured me on page 1 of book 1 and kept me avidly turning pages till page 924 of book 3. A rare feat.. and treat. A guarunteed must read if you enjoy books on kings, queens, swords, sorcery, heros, heroines and the all important bad guy and just how he gets it.. when he gets it, and IF he gets it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fantasy books and series ever written","review":"Fabulous book that you'll read several times, and its better every time. Maybe the best series in fantasy other than Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for GRRM","review":"Jordan fell by the wayside for me 4 or 5 books back. It astounds me that anyone still reads his books. Tad Williams quickly and easily filled the void with Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn and his Otherland series. Then I read the Song of Fire and Ice series based on reviews I read here and I was converted. I can't top or add to anything already written about these books. I highly recommend them for anyone who enjoys fantasy in the slightest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I started this series three times. It just didn't grab me at first. I decided finally in a fit of intrepidity to stick with it. I finished all three tomes in less than 3 weeks. It is that cool. The lack or archetypes mixed with moral vagueries makes each character both despicable and lovable. I have read MANY fantasy books and this is a series I would recommend to any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most anything else out there.","review":"Having read all of the books that are now available in this series, I must recommend it as one of my favorites in the genre. The plot is dynamic and varied, and the characters shift in importance as the story progresses. Finally, a novel in which good does not always win the first round, the hero is just as liable to get knocked off as the bad guy, and the bad guy can be the hero in the next chapter. This series keeps you interested, and I must say, is one of the only series out there that I still have no idea how it will end. Buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books, even for people who doesnt like books!","review":"Normally i dont like books. Never been able to sit down and just reed a book.But after seeing the series i television, i though, what the heck, lets try.And i am very glad i did! Great book. Amazing world, great characters. and a great story line, ill defently read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best...","review":"Being a novice to writer George R.R. Martin, I approached this book somewhat cautiously. Even though it had been highly recommended by my son, the immensity of the thing was intimidating. However, once I began reading I became lost in the world of Mr. Martin's fantasy. His style of writing is so lyrical it was captivating. The plot and characters, though many in number, were presented in such a fashion that I found myself wishing I could speed read! This was the first book I read on my new Kindle. Once I realized how simple it was to retrieve a definition of an unknown word, I was even more enthralled.In summary, it is a great story written in a beautiful way...enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive and I'm not sure why","review":"I've never been much for the fantasy novel but I had to stop my hand from clicking after the first three books. I mean, how many of these can a person read? There is something about this series, or more appropriate, the world in this series, that just grabs you. I don't usually overlook sloppy writing but I sure overlooked it in these books because of the content. The violence is a little contrived but I overlooked that as well. This is a very entertaining series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing fantasy... without much fantasy!","review":"This is a great book, one of the best fantasy books ever. The author is an amazing writer. He writes with such literary grace that I can't believe this is mainstream fantasy. The book also has very little magic in it. This story isn't about magic, it is about people, and the world they live in. Great book. Buy it but it buy it! Good book. Seriously.By the way, if you don't like realistic stuff don't buy it. Don't buy it if you expect a flowery world where the good guy always wins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adventure","review":"I enjoyed the Game of Thrones and look forward to the other books in the series. It took a while to get the characters straightened out, but they have become interesting now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferably dull... tedious... monotonous...","review":"I picked up this series based on the recommendation of several folks over on reddit and I have never been more disappointed in a fantasy series. I've read an awful lot of books, Tolkien, Lewis, Howard, Lieber, Zelazny, Brooks, Eddings, Jordan, even Martin's other works where he edits the sci-fi \\"Wild Cards\\" universe.Nothing is as completely uncompelling as this series of books. The first book which this review is about, features NOTHING happening for the first 400 pages. Nothing. If you're looking for something other than political back-biting you're reading the wrong book.There is room for castle intrigue as a part of any fantasy series, sure. But to make that the prime mover? The main plot itself? Someone please stick a sword through my head.Put it down. Walk away. Go pick up ANY other fantasy novel and you'll be better served."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy story","review":"After reading this book for about a day I couldn't make sense of it because it bounces around so much between characters that it loses it's heading. I quit the book and got a refund"},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle variant only","review":"The entire typeset for the kindle version is atrocious. The editing was done so poorly that most of the sentences make absolutely no sense and it seems as if its not quite written in English, or any variant of it! Overall the kindle version is not only bad but it's a disgrace to the book as it discourages new readers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not read this until the series is complete","review":"The book's very well written. However, there is no end in sight.He released four books from the series out from between 1996 and 2005. In six years since, he has not completed Dance with Dragons, the fifth book of the series. There are still two more books scheduled to be released after Dance.Be warned that he may not finish this series. If you start you may set yourself up for disappointment. Wait to see if the full \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series gets completed before starting any books.I was hoping that the HBO contract would entice him to finish up the series, but based on HBO's past performance (Carnivale, Deadwood) I won't hold my breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"a humble opinion","review":"This book is so well written, Martin has a great way of getting the reader involved with so many different characters. From the first page, I was hooked and could not put it down until I was finished. I'm looking forward to reading the other books as soon as I find a free moment in my hectic life.Here are some comparisons I have made:(1) If you enjoyed the strategy, and manipulation of books like Shogun and The Godfather, then this book is for you.(2) If you liked reading Lord of the Rings then this book is for you... keep in mind that this book is not \\"orc and goblin\\" fantasy, it's more knights, kings and queens, which for me is a plus!Read this book... you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible fantasy fiction","review":"Martin breaks all the rules, the least of which \\"the good guys always win\\". Granted, the series is far from over, but already it's believable fantasy with bitter twists where no one is exempt from death or dismemberment. Light years beyond other fantasy epics. A Song of Ice and Fire can't be compared to any other works comprising the genre, it's in a class all by itself. Not only will you have to use your head, you'll have to use parts of it never before tapped. Nothing is spelled out and Martin refuses to drop the \\"typical\\" hints for the simpler minds to get a leg-up - just try to guess what may happen. A literary rush!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stunning!","review":"There are some other nice reviews written above, but I wanted to add a few words. This series is definitely the best series I've read in the 17 years I've been reading fantasy. Martin has bumped Jordan as my favorite. Super story! Books 2 and 3 get better and better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"This book is a good book to read. I watch the HBO series and find this book to give much more background information. Wish I had read it before I started watching the series. If you like fantasy with dragons and swods and such you will like this. Can't wait to finish this book and get on tho the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game of Thrones","review":"THE STYLE OF HAVING EACH CHAPTER ABOUT A PARTICULAR CHARACTER SEEMED TO BREAK THE STORY LINE UP, IT WAS NOT A SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM CHAPTER TO CHAPTER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Scope","review":"I enjoy delving into complex fantastical histories that follow a grand scope of family legacy and conflict. This is the new LOTR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One","review":"I decided not to finish the book. I am all about dark fantasy and science fiction but was unprepared for the death of small children in this book. I have children of my own and found this quit dissatisfying. Therefore I stopped reading the book and moved on to a different author. I am sure the book is quit good if you are into that kind of violence. It was just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fantasy","review":"Don't expect fantasy. Expect a political book in a medieval setting. This book is lauded for it's ambiguous characters, however if you are ever surprised in this book by any character OTHER than Tyrion...If you like pages of descriptions of food, clothes, and weaponry with political backstabbing. This is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrrrr... avast, ye matey!","review":"Why on Earth does every single character in these audiobooks sound like either a pirate or a leprechaun?!It's all but impossible to tell one character from another when they all sound like they're doing a third-rateimpression of Blackbeard! It borders on the comical... and becomes tiresome after the 500th \\"different\\" character that soundslike every other character.Want to enjoy an audiobook by someone who knows how to perform asdifferent characters? Pick up any of the Harry Potter books as read by the brilliant Stephen Fry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of thrones","review":"Wonderful read for any fantasy enthusiast. Especially enjoyed the use of dragons in the story. I look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, Riveting and Enthralling","review":"This is not my typical genre of book, but I was hooked from the beginning. The author did such a wonderful job developing characters and weaving several different story lines together all into one major story.I thoroughly enjoyed the entire story. It was great to have an appendix with all of the characters to help me keep track.I can't wait to get into the second book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read the next one!!!!","review":"This was amazing!!! I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read the rest of the series!! Woo hoo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"Very interesting and driving plot, rounded and interesting characters, and great set up for the next book. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but warning!","review":"I loved this book. However I warn anyone looking to get into this series that the 4th and 5th have gotten horrible reviews. I have read the 4th and agree with them. I'm boycotting the 5th and won't read any more from this author unless he does a better job with one of the remaining sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Setting","review":"George R.R. Martin has a true gift for fantasy settings, and it shows in this series debut. Every main character is well crafted and typically likable, and the details are used perfectly. I will be eagerly diving into the rest of this fantastic series in the near future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome read","review":"Great book. Many characters to follow along with in the 3rd person. I really enjoyed it. Purchased book 2 immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"This writer 'puts you there' right where it is all happening. Your concentration is grabbed by each page. Unusually I saw the film series first and am now reading the book one. It is a pleasure that the films follow this intriguing book as closely as they do. I will buy the other later books without any doubt. Martin writes with a positive aliveness.It is cruel and bloodthirsty in places and there are several characters that you absolutely hate, ( as we did JR in Dallas!) as was Martin's intention. It is a page turner and could keep you reading well into the night. It is in the Potter and Tolkein genre in some way, yet more easily believable because it is less far fetched perhaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book but misleading picture","review":"Bought this book hoping for the old edition cover as a collecter piece as pictured above, got an overpriced (58.44) copy of the new reprints with the new covers. Not sure how they get off stating it is a hardcover import from 1996, when it has the new reprinted covers and stickers from Manchester Public Library, Whiton Memorial Branch, 100 N. Main St, Manchester CT 06040. Thanks for overcharging me and scamming me out of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting to me","review":"I was recommended to the Game of Thrones and thought I would read the book since I don't get it on television. To be honest, I got bored with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to a Great Series","review":"Great characters and great history, this book has it all and sets the stage for a great series, a little slower then the next two however"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this story","review":"I LOVE these books. They are very raw at times, but the characters are the kind that you get attached to and they make you NEED to know what's happening to them. i have never watched the tv series based on the books, but honestly, i don't think you'd need to. This series has made its way into my picks for all time faves that I read ovr and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game of Thrones","review":"The world of Westeros come to life in this first book of the series of Song of Ice and Fire. The story is very well written and told through the perspectives of many different characters. Also in this first novel you come to learn that in this time of war no character is safe from the ravages of conflict and deceit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely finished it (minor spoiler - no specifics)","review":"Why is it that some fantasy writers feel the need to have ridiculously bad, over-the-top villains pitted against really likable characters and then inflict so much pain and anguish on the latter? It's formulaic and predictable (gee, I wonder if the \\"bad\\" people will get their comeuppance in a later book?)My other problem with this novel is it's lack of really original ideas. Sure, all literature borrows from and expands on previous literature. This book, however, seems only a partially disguised regurgitation and remix of ideas from other fantasy books (especially Robin Hobb's Farseer series).Consequently, I was, in turns: frustrated, annoyed, bored and depressed. Like a long bus ride, I couldn't wait for it to be over. No thanks, Mr. Martin, I'll get off here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, misogyny","review":"I read the whole thing and wish I hadn't wasted the time. I will be reading Terry Pratchett next to get the bad taste out of my mind. So much didn't make sense. Disturbing death and child rape, all kinds of rape, torture, without sense. And unbelievable points of view from most of the women. 13 year old girls are not like that. I kept reading because I liked a few of the characters but they were either killed, or suffered horribly. What does it say about us as a culture that this book is so popular?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could review this better.","review":"Mr. Martin has created a fabulous setting rich in description and detail. Those who indicate that his world is realistic are all too truthful. There are elements of society and passion which can be cleverly expressed without the full breadth of their evil being obvious. Murder your king if you like, sleep with your sister too, but save me the atomic level of detail. Mr. Martin, you are a fine writer, and it is sad that you foul the otherwise crystal waters of this novel with your crude and tasteless fantasies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good I thought it would be. But I could see how others would like it.","review":"I am a huge fan of fantasy and science fiction. I have read J.R.R, Feist, Anthony, Goodkind, Salvatore etc. etc. From what I can tell in the reviews is ... if you like the types of books I read then you may not like this one. It appears that those who like to read say...Koontz, murder mysteries, medieval classics or even some romance novels would really enjoy this book. I, on the other hand, did not. It was extremely slow moving and had similar dialogue to \\"pride and prejudice.\\" The plots were very subtle and the switching from character to character was tedious and hard to follow. This is the first book I ever stopped reading half way through and have no desire to go back to it. With all the good reviews I wish I liked it, but I am glad others really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this guy is over-rated","review":"I don't see the why there is such a buzz about this book. I've read most of the fantasy/sci-fi authors that you can think of off the top of your head. I don't think Martin is in the same league with Tolkien, Jordan, Tad Williams, or Feist. I thought the book was well writen, but lacked novelty, wit, and most of all creativity. It read more like a romance novel. This book now holds up my window. I suggest raeding Fritz Lieber, Micheal Stackpole, Gene Wolf, and Tad Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the HBO series, you'll love the book.","review":"I'll keep this short. I read this after being drawn to it from the HBO series. The series followed the this book, which makes up season 1, mostly to a tee. However, there's great insight and enjoyment to see what details and subtle character and plot idiosyncracies that weren't covered in the series. Therefore, I highly recommend this book to those who enjoyed the series but would like to develop a deeper understanding of Martin's tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This is not the best fantasy story ever written, but Martin has the storyteller's ability to draw you into his world. I thought the characters were fairly well developed and usually not one-sided. I liked how even the \\"good\\" queen had a nasty streak when it came to her bastard son, and the \\"bad\\" characters can be almost likeable at times (the Imp, for example). Interestingly, the really bad characters are mostly spoiled children drunk on power. Overall, a very entertaining story and I'm looking forward to the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprise lurks at almost every chapter's end!","review":"The first time I read AGoT, I was entirely taken. The most important characteristic of this book not shared by other sci-fi, is Martin's ability to put in a suprise twist at almost every chapter's end. If you think you can determine who the hero/ine is, you will be surprised. Martin would do well to keep his style and add more dimensions to some characters. Cersei Lannister, Lysa Arryn, and Robb Stark well deserve their own chapters as befits the players in the Game of Thrones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"I purchased this book after watching a commercial for the TV series (which I haven't seen yet.) I only read the first few pages and had to give it to someone else. It was just talking and sword fights, which was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart people doing silly things","review":"The plot of this book relies too much on supposedly reasonable people committing unreasonable, rash acts rather than having a simple 5 minute conversation that would clear matters up entirely.It relies on supposedly reasonable people festering intense enmity rather than asking some simple questions.It relies upon layers upon layers of impossibly intricate schemes and machinations succeeding perfectly.It relies on authorial convenience, deus ex machina, and impossible coincidences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow!","review":"I ALMOST gave up on this book about halfway though. I was thinking to myself, \\"where is this book going?\\" Towards the end something DOES actually happen! Wow! I don't see how people can say WoT books are so boring then say this is great? There is so little action in this book, I truly believe there is more [harlets] and [intercourse] in this book then anything else. Believe me, this book isn't terrible, but if you don't read it, you're not missing all that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew I would like this, but didn't guess how much","review":"This may be a tale of grey skies, windswept castles that have seen better days, undeserved tragedy, and frequent violence, but those darker qualities are balanced by a lightning quick pace, likable traits in many of the characters (though precious few characters are all good or all bad), and even some humor. I started this series to kill time while waiting for the next \\"Wheel of Time\\" book by Robert Jordan, and was surprised by not only its quality, but its complete lack of \\"slow\\" parts (a facet of Jordan's writing one has to get used to). Also, though there's not a lot of \\"fantasy\\" per se in this first volume, wait 'til you see the final scene! On those last couple of pages, Martin certainly delivers a memorable scene of drama and enchantment to whet your appetite for volume two. Which I'm just about to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Classic But Not For Everyone","review":"A Game of Thrones, book 1 of an eventual 7 book series, is an epic fantasy novel. I'm not going to get into plot or anything that you can see from the thousands of other reviews, just note that this book is not for everyone. There is a TON of characters. Seemingly small details in book 1 may turn into bigger plot points in the later novels. I would absolutely recommend this book, but if you don't have time to read all the released books together, you may want to wait. You're not going to want to give enough time for yourself to forget some of the smaller details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw this book out the window into a steaming volcano","review":"There is only one author with a double R in his name which writes fantasy so well. And George R. R. Martin is not this AUTHOR! By all means stay away from this book. If you so choose to read this be warned that this book is not for the young. Many reasons point to that. To many to explain. The worst part about this is that every chapter there seems to be a new character. Then you never see the old characters again. There was only one character I liked and he never got the light on him. Terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Robert Jorden is better .............","review":"Yes, I am aware that Robert Jorden needs to get his act together but at least he dosen't have to resort to characters with a vocabulary limited to four letter words. I was disapointed to find that every other word in this series was a cuss word. I think a real writer can develop his character's thought and feelings without using bad words. For example, Robert Jorden uses almost no foul language or explict sexual situations in the 'Wheel of Time' series. For those of you who like a good clean book, stay away from George R.R. Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the action!!!!1","review":"1) I like books that have some action in them, If you want to read action you better just skip to the 2nd book.2) If you like to read about wizards buy a different book.3) If you like any fantasy buy a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a book?","review":"I cant even understand half the words in this book, i mean cmon. This book made me vomit every time i finished reading a chapter. My friend told me about this book and that it was amazing...i just figured out he was pulling a prank on me...a whole 1,000 page prank. You got their zack, u got me good. But just watch, Im going to make you read Wild Cards, you will be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"I got about 50 pages into the book before concluding that George R. R. Martin was writing about a disgusting Pedophile - Khal Drogo. I can't see how an author can write about that sort of thing without imagining the acts themselves in his own mind. No matter how richly the book is written this is unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading, even if you've already watched Season 1","review":"This is certainly one sprawling, epic read but is nicely paced with short'ish chapters that briskly flows from one character's perspective to another, each ending on cliffhangers of sorts to keep the reader actively engaged and eager to continue plugging along. Admittedly I did watch the HBO series before reading the book and came away surprised at how faithful the TV adaptation adhered to the source material. Even if you've already watched Season 1, I still recommend giving this one a proper read especially if you're at all interested in learning more about the details and lore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy at its very best.","review":"This book is by far one of the great fantasy novels ever written. In some ways I can't explain how good it is, reading this you almost feel like you are reading historical fiction. The worlds and characters are so detailed, real, and in some cases flawed that it makes relating to them an easy task. Can't say enough good things about it, if you have not got into this genre, this is the book to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives all future fantasy novels something to live up to.","review":"Highly entertaining, and leaves you wanting for the next piece of the story. Love the characters, and love the bits and pieces of this artfully woven tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song of Ice and Fire","review":"Simply put... a magical read, a modern day masterpiece.I enjoyed every page.. a must read for everyone.Looking forward to reading the rest of the series. well done . well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've GOT to be kidding!","review":"ALthough the style is magnificant, and the words well chosen and strung together, the story itself is a big disappointment. True, you have no idea what is going to happen throughout the book,but that is not because the plot contains many twists and turns -- rather it is because there are so many characters and each chapter does not contain much memorable action such that the book itself is choppy and not as interesting as the concept actually is. If the concept of this book interests you, you would be better off reading the actual accounts of English history. I was very disappointed by this book, the plot was quite blaze and the \\"fantasy\\" portion of this book was nonexistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh No!","review":"I'm sorry, but I just don't get this. I had to read this as I'm a big fantasy fan and this is all over the television. I tried the TV show and got bored and hoped the books would be better. This one certainly isn't. I half feel as if I'm missing something but this just reads like a huge list of made up place names and people and lots of talking and political plotting interspersed with bits of adventure as a sort of add on. Not my thing at all. Bring on the simple action heroes for me! No politics, just kill the bad guys and rescue the princess, that's what I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Cheerless Soap Opera","review":"I agree with all of the reviewers who only gave this one star. It's a boring, ridiculous soap opera devoid of any sliver of happiness or hope. I am so sick of reading about someone getting raped IN EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER!!!! Makes me think the author is a seriously dirty old man.Someone gave this book to me as a Christmas gift and I was excited to read it. When I had finished it, I came to Amazon to see if the reviews were terrible because I hated it so much. I don't know why so many people gave it a good rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huuugely overrated book","review":"- First of all, make no mistake, this is NO fantasy, but a rather a grim and depressing pseudo-historical novel in slightly unusual decorations. Rare attempts to make it different from the real dark ages look awkward more often than not. There seem to be no message, except that the world is a cruel place and it will only get worse;- It's hard to sympathize with the characters, since most of them are either children or teenagers with unstable psyche, plus the author enjoys killing those few that are likely to be considered positive figures (and he does it in a way to tease the reader the most);- Sex and violence descriptions are abundant and gratuitous, and often feel totally unnecessary"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Could Only Give Zero Stars","review":"This has to be one of the most over-rated books I've ever read. I honestly could not finish it.1. It is extremely slow. Only Jordan has this author beat as far as using the maximum number of words to explain the most mundane things.2. Dialog is unreal and contrived.3. I really did not care for the obscene material. I felt it was uncessary to the plot and character development. WARNING if you care about that kind of thing or are considering buying this book for your kids, I'd rate it X... Definitely. And there is no hesitation in that at all.4. Very trite. You'll feel like you've read about these characters before and you know what? You have! Fantasy does tend to be very restricted in its form but how come I don't feel this way when I read Stephen Donaldson, David Gemmell, or Raymond Feist?Do yourself a favor... skip this series all together and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"My biases: I love Goodkind, I like WOT but downhill seriously lately. I loved Eddings, Donaldson, Tolkien. I love magic, action, battles.I always read any new fantasy series I start at least a hundred pages before tossing it out. As other reviewers have commented the book has little magic and action and is very political. A soap opera fantasy is probably a good way to describe it. Perhaps comparing Star Trek Deep Space Nine to the other Treks is helpful. I like all the other Treks but found DS9 to be a space soap opera and tossed it. This is what Game of Thrones is like.I am very disappointed since, after reading other reviews, I was expecting great things from Game of Thrones. Starting the book is rather difficult also since the character you are reading about is constantly changing.So I am out my 7 bucks.If you haven't tried Terry Goodkind yet, I highly recommend his work. It blows WOT out of the water and continues to be extremely interesting and very moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Master At Work","review":"This ranks as one of the best fantasy books ever written for adults. Flawed heroes, sympathetic villains, greed and lust, pride and cowardice, this epic has it all.Unlike other books by lesser talents, Martin delivers period detail, world building and character development without ever forgetting to be a great storyteller. This plot really moves!!!I finished this massive novel in two days, my eyes totally destroyed, and then I rushed off to get his next book and abuse myself some more.The sweet joy of pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be 5 million stars...","review":"I will not/cannot review this book due to the fact that any info given will ruin the story. Martin unfolds twist after twist and it will absolutely captivate at every page turned.You will never want to read another series again. Ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Fanatasy Fanatic","review":"I am not much of a fantasy fan, but wow! This guy weaves an engrossing tale. I was warned by a friend who gave me the first book not to get attached to any of the characters. He was right as Martin has no qualms about killing them off. A previous reader gave this one star and I would dearly love to know his favorites because I have never read anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good.","review":"This could have been a really good book. The plot is unique, interesting and not at all predictable. The character development is great. But, I have a big problem with the unneeded and graphic sexual content. I had a difficult time finishing the first book. Incest, pedophile (grown man with pre-teen girl) and lots of graphic rape are not entertaining for me. I bought the 4 books set and decided to throw them away after reading just the first book. It felt dirty to have them around my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick subject matter","review":"The writing quality is excellent, however the subject matter is bleak and sickening. Tradegy, bloodshed, cruelty, death, rape, incest, drunkeness, murder, infanticide, and numerous other human atrocities and perversities abound in this tale about a world with sparse good qualities to provide solace or balance. Admittedly, I did not read the entire book, however the final straw was sex involving a child. Unacceptable in any world. Too bad such good writing skills are wasted on such perverse subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Soap Opera","review":"There's only one way to describe this book: a Fantasy Soap Opera. This has EVERYTHING you get in your favorite soap opera: 1. Lots of characters 2. A story that takes FOREVER to develop, and even longer for anything to happen, and has no end in sight 3. Sex and infidelity/immorality galore, sometimes more explicit than necessary (yes I know these things happen in real life, but we don't need explicit details to get the picture) 4. A story with many threads, each thread getting its turn in little snippets - VERY little snippets.Not to say that soap operas are necessarily bad, but they definitely aren't my thing, and neither was this book.Another thing that turned me off was that this didn't have any of the fun magical-type things you get in other fantasies. Isn't that what fantasy's all about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst waste of your time in a fantasy novel.","review":"Anyone thinking about getting into the Fire and Ice series should stop listening to this induced hype and read a better series. These books are a horrible, pointless waste of your time and money.Without giving away any real spoilers, I'll say this. There are really only a small handful of characters that you won't hate. All of them stubborn, mean, racist, incestual or greedy. ALL OF THEM expect of about 3... and those 3 end up dead at the end of the book or exiled or whatever. Without any heroic characters in a story where the ending can best be described as anti-climatic, what is the point of reading the book?If you want a good fantasy book, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the bunch.","review":"Mr. Martin succeeds in creating a rich world full of human characters. This book succeeds where his later works fail by maintaining a coherent focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, Too Fast","review":"I did not love A Game of Thrones, but by the time it ended, I felt like I needed to find out what more happened...So, I picked up the next book, and now I'm HOOKED! HOw many books are going to be in this series? I can't have another Wheel of TIme on my hands. I hope it gets wrapped up, so I don't have to wonder for the rest of my life how it ends or wait for a new book every two or three years..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST of the BEST!","review":"I have read very many fantasy books and series, in the past. Song of Ice and Fire is the best Fantasy series to date, excluding Lord of The Rings, of course. This is NOT Wheel of Time or Sword of Truth all over again... This is MUCH better: the characters are more interesting, the plot can be unpredictable, there are NO omnipotent characters. Yes, this is a fairly dark book, but it shines with quality... My personal favorite out of ALL the fantasy books ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"After hearing so much hoopla about the series I thought I would give it a shot. After forty pages into the first installment of the series I threw it in the trash can. Actually, I sold it to a used bookstore.I can't believe this guy is being compared to Tolkien. There is no comparison here.The dialect was terrible.The storyline was boring.The sex was offensive.End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No clear goal.","review":"We are introduced to a lot of characters, each with their own sub-plot, and you agonize over the ones that you don't care for. Unfortunately the story just gets bogged down with all this stories and all the characters have things going bad for them, none of them have a break. How can each of the main characters threaten the others if things are going sour for them; it makes no sense. After a while you just give up trying to cheer for one of the characters and don't care, all the knights are dumbasses, all the kings are arrogant and idiots, the only smart ones are the dwarf or the enuchs, just not charming at all. Bought the second book but just couldn't stomach it any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so done with Martin","review":"This book was really OK but the series is terrible. I will never pick up another Martin book. I don't know how he can keep readers when he continually kills off all the people you care about and rewards the ones you hate. If I wanted this type of story I would read the newspaper not a fantasy book. I borrowed the fourth book from the library and have skipped over about half of the pages trying to make it to the end.The bottom line is: If you like books where the good guy wins the battle and gets the girl in the end then read Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. If you want the good guy to have his head cut off and his girl raped and murdered then read R.R. Martin.I would not recommend starting this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the fuss all about?","review":"There is almost no character development at all and I found the foul language a bit incongruous with the setting of the story. I made it about 1/3 the way through, realized I didn't care a hoot what happened to any of the characters, and then read the end just to see if it got interesting (it didn't). At one point we read about dragons suckling on a human girl, and that's when I decided not to bother at all with the second book in the series, despite already owning it. Martin's work just isn't my taste. I prefer novels where something good happens to at least someone in the book, and less incest and gratuitous sex. For fantasy on the lighter, happier side, try Tad Williams, C.S. Friedman or Martha Wells."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!","review":"Maybe I am too young to read this and cannot acknowledge George R. R. Martin's style of writing others can. I find this book very disorganized and hard to follow. I had to refer to the back of the book several times. Each of the chapters are well written, but he changes the subject just as everything is about to get exciting! He could at least have TWO CHAPTERS on the same person! But no, he just has to keep changing and changing and changing. I absolutely abhor it! It's like getting someone excited only to turn them down at the end. I didn't even bother skimming the book to read the end. There are so many characters and each have their own chapter. This book is like putting numerous stories together! What the other reviewers see in this book I don't know. If you decide to buy this book, brace yourself. For the disgusting parts, the disorganization and switching of stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draws you in but doesn't satisfy","review":"Beware of this book, and the series beyond it! I was drawn in by the richly drawn world and characters that seemed interesting. Although events didn't seem to be unfolding as I had hoped, I kept reading, hoping that something would turn out right in the end. Midway through the third book in the series, I wish I had never started.Basically, the books are no fun to read because the good guys get the stuffing kicked out of them. Several major characters that one has grown fond of die to no purpose, and nobody avenges them. Worse, they die stupidly, from things they should have seen coming. I don't read books like this to end up feeling bad, and I hope you don't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great epic story with many internal stories","review":"Having read many epic fantasy novels it is difficult to find new and interesting material that will keep my attention. From David Eddings' fast paced, but numerous, stories to Robert Jordan's highly detailed works my interest is broad.Martin's The Game Of Thrones sits somewhere in-between the Eddings and Jordan. It has enough detail to make the world interesting and enough stories within the book to keep you reading. The story does take a while to grab hold of you but once it has you, you will be greatly anticipating the next book, as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"A one nighter. . . .","review":"This novel is one of the best pieces of writtenart that has been published. You will get involved in the story. You will hate, love, fear, weep and war with them; so vivid are they. A Game of Thrones is at the top of my I-Will-Reread list.The competition for best novel of the year has just stepped up in pace as Martin unleashes his prowess with pen and mind with this novel.Maybe we shall see a beging of a game of novels. . . Whichever the outcome, many will await his next in the Song of Ice and Fire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last!","review":"George R. R. Martin has succeeded where few authors have. This isn't a quest for a sword or a singing harp. We've all read about a bazillion of those. This book will surprise you. I don't want to give anything away. If you love epic fantasy or want to dive in to a new genre, read A Game of Thrones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin makes them real","review":"What makes this book so special is Martin's ability to make us care about each and every character. The story, while complex and fascinating, is secondary to the character development. The author juggles this complex tale with spectacular skill, never allowing us to forget that what really matters in fiction is what we feel about the people involved. This book should be a model for all who write in the genre.Even in fantasy, the characters must be real individuals who make us care"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to rich new series.","review":"Well-developed and well rounded cast combined with a twisting, turning roller coaster plot makes for a good, though heavy, read. Not for the faint hearted or those who need to reach the end in a hurry. I would rather a book that stood on its own and had a clean conclusion rather than one that will run over multiple thousands of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAME OF THRONES - A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE","review":"I loved this book.

I read at night mostly so the chapters are great to finish before I fall asleep. love the hbo series as well... but the book is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"I heard wonderful things about this book from many people. However, I couldn't get past the way it was written. Each chapter is titled with the character it is written about. There was only one character I really liked, I found myself skipping to those chapters about 3/4 through the book. If you are looking for an action packed adventurous book, I don't suggest this one. Poor format and lack of character development will keep me from reading any more. I will watch the series on HBO though, I am hopeful they can make this something enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K. But how did this become super popular?","review":"The writing style is so vague and the characters are so flat! Sure, the plot is interesting, but there really isn't much emotional development or tension. The T.V. series is more interesting than the book, and that being said I didn't even like the T.V. series that much either. I never feel like I properly know any of the characters besides Dani. I wonder if it's because there are SO many viewpoint characters and some of them are boring to read from the heads of. I don't know, but I purchased this book because of the hype and WASN'T impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"one wild fantasy type story\`","review":"This one wild fantasy type story. I have heard that there is some game evolved from this saga. Wonderful!! I was distressed that the good guys were so apparent and that has led me to feel like I am just waiting for the end to see who is left standing, good or bad.I like that way he setup the story: the characters are given chapters so you can follow their life as it unfolds. The physical world they inhabit is not ours, of course, and there is some magic out there, so later on the magic, like 'Doc Savage,' (who I have never read, only heard about) will make a dramatic entrance and solve everyone's problem and the good guys will win.Ho, hum, but I will read it to the end so I find out who wins, et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Not badly written, but I found it boring. The characterizations aren't bad, but nowhere near worthy of the hype this book (and the series) is getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I couldn't sympathize with any character. Characters were either evil or unbelievably naive. I read this when it originally came out, and it was rather disappointing that there was no definitive 'end' in this book for any storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely some slow parts","review":"This book definitely has some slow parts, but all-in-all it left me wanting more, as it picks up as the book moves along. If you are a book editor, however, or have the mindset of an editor, you will cringe. He always opts for taking five paragraphs to say what could be said better in five words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Fantasy","review":"Five stars. BUY this book!It's the story that started me reading fantasy again. (And wishing I hadn't because little else measures up to this.)Or don't, if you really like trad. 'high fantasy' because this isn't traditional high fantasy.There are no really dark characters, there are multi-facted people.There is little magic (and one weakness, I think it has, is that the magic isn't very convincing.)Good people (SPOILER) can die.But it does have great characters, interesting ideas and excellent plotting.As has been written elsewhere its more like reading Roman history (with all the gory bits) than a fanstasy novel.Oh, and it's much better than the TV version, which I found too gloomy and dark to hold me (though I alos knew what was going to happen).WORD OF WARNING: if you enjoy it you are in for a long read/ride: six books later we're not at the end yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched the series now reading book","review":"I watched the series while on vacation. I really enjoyed the series; can't wait for the third season to start. After watching the series I had to read the book. It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to a fantastic series","review":"Dont let the first 100 pages or so deterr you from this book. This is the greatest fantasy stor since Tolkien. Martin uses tons of detail to describe his world of Westeros. So much that you can visualize every aspect of the world the characters are in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the book, love the HBO series","review":"Reading this while watching season 1 on HBO improved my enjoyment of the epic. I am definitely a fan of several characters, and can't wait to see what Martin does with them over the next several books. This one is a bit hefty, but it didn't bog down as much as I expected it to. I'd recommend it to all fans of classic fantasy and large-scale court intrigue/epic battle stories. (I will say, I think the portrayal of characters in the HBO series is even better than their written characters, and I would likely not have picked this up if I didn't love the HBO show so much)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am hooked","review":"I have had to delay buying the next book in the series because I can't put it down once I start. Love this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I had been waiting for this book at my local library for a couple of months but as soon as my Kindle came in, I downloaded and had it read very quickly. A good book! Well written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle editions: get Voyager, avoid Bantam!","review":"I won't comment about the story of this great, gripping, 5-star book: I just want to clarify one thing about the Kindle editions (there are two), since there are many reviewers recommending to avoid \\"the Kindle Edition\\" altogether. I bought both of them, and what I have to say is that the kindle edition you should avoid is Bantam's [..], which is shamefully riddled with typos (some of them: \\"Dome\\", \\"torncat\\", \\"s word\\", \\"sept on\\", \\"arid\\" instead of \\"Dorne\\", \\"tomcat\\", \\"sword\\", \\"septon\\" and \\"and\\"). The Voyager edition, though, is much, much better (not only with none or few typos, but also with a table of contents and more maps)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The devils in the details and this book has many devils","review":"The first few hundread pages of this book are fragmented, complex and slow moving, it seemed to be leading no where interesting. I almost gave up on this book, untill the genius of story, jumps at you. By this stage I was unable to stop reading. I cant believe how satisfing the second half of this book is. The boring details of the first part become, the highlights of the second.

We both love Jon Snow, who couldnt? And also Robb and Bran. I have a soft spot for Arya because she reminds me so much of me. And When Eddard got his head whalloped off, i about tore the book into that time and killed the people who did it! Now we both share ideas for the upcomig book on who Jon's REAL parents are, what Arya will become, how Sansa may not live longer (seeing how her direwolf who were to protect her was killed), and who will take the throne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh look at \\"Fantasy\\"","review":"Superb story telling. Mr Martin does a splendid job of brining the multitude of characters in this book alive. His approach to developing the characters kept me enthralled. This is an exciting epic that will appeal to long time sci-fi/fantasy readers as well as those who have shied away from fantasy books in the past. Great reading...I can't wait for the next volume!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing","review":"I have read the Sword of Truth, The Wheel of Time, The Demon Wars, The Lord of the Rings, The Book of Words, Darksword, Shannara, Belgariad, and the Recluce series and this series is BY FAR my favorite. It may not be for everyone, but if you like scheming, backstabbing characters that you love to hate, this book is perfect. If you are sick of the repetitious garbage that Goodkind has been spewing in his last books, or the constant man/woman bickering that has come out of the Wheel of Time, then buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Well, what can I say that has not already been said? Plenty of people have praised this book with only a few acceptions, that should tell you something. My intial feelings after reading this a few years agos was that it was one of the best stories I have read. In fact I purchased the book again in order to re-read it before diving into the second one. My one fear is that it may turn into, and seemed at times to turn into, a Terry Goodkind series. Which means a wonderful first book in \\"Wizards first rule\\" to a long blown out plot that kept me mostly bored. Don't let that happen Martin! Anyway, if you have not read this I highly recomend it. For me it was up there with \\"Enders Game\\", \\"The Black company\\", \\"On Basilik station\\" as well as all the Jordan and Donaldson series. In short a must first read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM HOOKED!","review":"This is an amazing series! I am not a big Fantasy fan (at least before this series), but I am completely hooked. George R.R. Martin spins a enticing tale that leaves you waiting for the next installment. He takes you into a world so unlike our own, and makes you never want to leave. Thanks for the great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best High Fantasy I've read since Tolkien","review":"Martin's world and his characters and his storyline are fantastic - and plausible. Everything happens for a reason, and nothing is simple. I think Martin has found an excellent balance between the elegant but plodding Lord of the Rings and Robert Jordan's joyful but childish Wheel of Time. A touch of magic and monsters give this world color but the drama is very very human; for awhile I wondered whether this was even a fantasy book or if the characters' references to the paranormal were simply their own superstition. Game of Thrones is not a complete work in and of itself and all the major plot lines are left unresolved, some in a state of supreme tension. But at least so far the story unfolds at a determined clip and there isn't much filler. Many of the characters are very deep and I'm told that over the course of the series they change and evolve and force the reader to reevaluate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book, but somebody needs to edit more objectively","review":"I love the epic tales with multiple plots & complex characters. I love the blending of historical with mystical elements. What I could do without is an editor that can't control the flow. There are so many flowing descriptions that I find myself trailing back to remember the original thread. Every description is overwrought, like Shakespeare on LSD. That's why these books are so long, because 2 pages or more can be used to describe the most minute detail. This author is a genius, but like most geniuses some control is warranted. I have & will continue to be a fan, but please for the love of Winterfell...EDIT better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"This is a really good read for those running out of books. Sometimes though, you can get so overwhelmed with new characters introduced in EVERY chapter, that you just have to stop reading. Nevertheless this is a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I get it!","review":"I'm glad I got into this series before checking it out on HBO. I love the POV format. It continuous while breaking up the monotony."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fantasy novel","review":"An amazingly readable epic fantasy novel. Excellent political intrigue in a medieval world. A worthwhile read for anyone that loves the Lord of the Rings or any fan of the fantasy novel genre.It took a little while to break into the story -- lots of names and families to learn -- but once I did, I was hooked. I went through the last 200 pages like a glutton, reading faster and faster to learn what would happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"page turner","review":"The house didn't get cleaned for a week! Martin's character development is excellent, the plot is rich, and the layout of the book allows for instant involvement in the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"It was well written but incredibly frustrating at points. Almost as if Martin added extra intrigue just for the sake of intrigue. Also, if you want a book about Good v Evil...and you want Good to win, this is probably not the best choice. You see hope in these books, and then you see it dashed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Picked up this book long ago. Put it down twice. Third time a charm. Perhaps one of my three favorite fantasy series of all time. Glad I tried again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!!!","review":"To be honest I was never a big reader of fantasy/science fiction books. Game of Thrones grabs your attention and has the right balance between the scenario description and the evolution of the story by itself.Very entertaining but I would recommend to start reading in a moment that you can quickly go through the first 150-200 pages so that you can have a very good start, after that you have the full picture of the book and its characters and for sure will enjoy!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excitingly awesome","review":"The storyline here would have been great on its own. The addition of those Others and the walking dead makes it ten times cooler. Great read if you're a Tolkien fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"A world of its own and a Mythology every fantasy reader will love! This book could turn even a casual reader into a fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"If the next two books are anything close to this one I seriously believe this is one series no fantasy fan should miss.The characters are so complex and live-like you just can't stop falling in love with them. The story is so well developed and so interesting you just have to stay awake to read just a few more pages (usually until four or five in the morning). It's thrilling, well paced, intoxicating. One of the very best books I've reading this last couple of years and I've readen a lot. Highly recomended for mature readers.Like every work of art it has its drawbacks 'cause nothing can be perfect, but for me the only problem of the book is that Martin never stays with the same character for more than 10 pages. He switches characters just when you are starting to warm up to them. But, oh well, we'll have to live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"very slow, too much going back and forth between characters, would not recommend to anyone to read, the book lacks story line"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seires will never be completed","review":"If you are thinking about purchasing this book, you should know two things. First, as the first book of a series, it is spectacular. Second, it's the first book of a series that is unlikely to be finished. For the past ten years, Martin has been writing about a five year period of the story he never intended to write about. Originally the series had a five year time gap between books three and four. In that time he has published one book, containing half the characters and covering about two years of the gap. Five years later we are waiting for the other half of the characters contained in ADWD, a book that was half complete five years ago.If you don't mind unfinished stories, by all means read this book. However, I recommend keeping this on the to read list until the series is finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is crap!","review":"I wish I could give this book lower than one star.

I wish I had read the reviews of this book before I picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting.","review":"I'm new to fantasy books, but this is honestly the the most interesting and thought provoking books I have ever read. Fairly complex plot to follow with so many different stories going on, but I recommend this to everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I hear a lot of people raving about this series, so I tried it. But personally, it is not my kind of story. For those who like the genre it would be fine.

Like some of the other reviewers I agree, that I was less than satisfied with the turn of events. I also agree Martin has a little too much sex in the book, and describes it like some badly written romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glacial pace, definitely not a page turner","review":"I have now read the whole series to date over the last week or so, based on the recommendation of a friend, and I cannot believe I wasted all that time. I kept hoping, in disbelief, that the story would somehow move forward. About 75% of the narrative is plodding, unnecessary dialogue that adds nothing to the story. Martin keeps adding more and more characters until by the fifth book there is something like 500 different characters and 50+ different sub-plots. Just when you become interested and invested in a character's story, Martin moves on and you are lucky to see that character for another 2,000 pages (e.g. Bran, Arya, etc). Apparently, this is going to be another Robert Jordan Wheel of Time type series that will take 20 years to wrap up. I will not be continuing on with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it but","review":"an awsome book love the caracter ,the stori line ,is great the onli bad thing is to keep up whit all the caracter and there point of view"},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, you don't know what you're getting into","review":"This series is the best bit of literature I have ever read. While certainly not perfect, those moments of bewilderment that you get from this series are totally worth the slow parts. Even if GRRM does not finish the series, I consider myself an enlightened individual for having experienced the world he created. Since there are over 1500 reviews at the time I am posting this, I will leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah","review":"Poorly written, puerile, and formulaic. Within the first page, Martin displays all his weaknesses. Perhaps it gets better as one goes along, but Martin handles exposition so poorly that one becomes tired of his hamhanded efforts to introduce characters and backstory. The world he populates resembles a thinly developed D&D game from 1984, and the characters are the sort of adolescent cartoons that poorly-educated fantasy buffs probably think of as \\"complex\\", when they are in fact amorphous blobs of fatal contradiction. A very silly book from an author who knows the gimmick of marketing crudity as subtlety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I rushed out and bought this book after reading the reviews on this site only to be very disappointed. A novel is meant to be about somebody and something. This book changes viewpoint so frequently between a cast of unsympathetic or shallow characters that I could not relate to any of them.Though Martin's writing is well above average for the genre (except for the POV changes), this story is like watching a movie through a strobe light. For mine, Robert Martin's 'shades of grey' book just created a grey cheerless book. If he'd have written the story, as good novels do, with at least 70-80% of the story through a single character it might have salvaged the novel. I certainly won't be tracking down book 2.If you're new to fantasy, stick with Tolkien, early Fiest and Eddings, and Tad William's Dragonbone chair series. Newer authors like Martin and Erikson write unsympathetic characters and the less said about Robert Jordan's never ending story the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the deal with the love for this book?","review":"I started reading this book based on some fairly serious recommendations from good friends of mine. I have been reading fantasy all my life. There's a TV show that has gotten rave reviews, and it looked interesting. I would hate to watch this series without reading the books.Plus, this book seems to be the Lord of the Rings for the generation ten years younger than me. I figured I really should read it if only to say I had read it.Man, what a task. This book left me quite frustrated at the end. Nothing happens of any consequence. The characters are completely cliched people who are cardboard cutouts. I still finished the book, and I would say it is enjoyable only slightly, because his writing can be quite descriptive. But game of thrones is to High Fantasy what Pirates of the Caribbean is to the golden age of pirates. It's just a shell. This book bored me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing fantasy","review":"Book four was terrible. The last book (thank goodness) was worse. He leaves us with all the heros dead, no conclusions to any issues, Dannery wandering who knows where with her Dragon, the other two dragons gone where? No conclusions on the trials of Cersie, no resolution of the fight with the wights at the wall. It is as if he just ran out of energy and said \\"lets stop now\\". I will not read him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, cardboard, derivative and trite","review":"I'd read a few of Martin's short stories. He was hit and miss, but was interesting enough that I decided to try this famous series. What a mistake that turned out to be.I struggled to finish the book. The characters are pure cardboard and could be taken from a junior high school kid's first concept of what good and evil should be. There was no surprise in any of their actions, the plotting was plodding and standard, and it just wasn't interesting.Ok, no quite uninteresting. The two stories of Jon Snow and Dany, with the Wall and the mongol clones were passably interesting, which is what kept the book from being completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read past author's hatred of women","review":"The writing was good, the story intriguing, but I constantly stumbled over the author's clear hatred of women.I won't go into the inability to finish or even provide good background for any of the 8 story lines going on, it is, after all meant to be a series. What I found hard to read past was the underlying disrespect, hatred and contempt for women. There are no less than 8 rape scenes, including a whole culture where rape is an accepted means of procreation. Leave aside the incest, (you are suppose to hate those characters) even one of the heroes commits child molestation and rape.So let's set all that aside and consider that every woman in the cast of characters is portrayed as either conniving and vindictive, insane, weak or painfully foolish, except the little girl masquerading as a boy.Don't know what is going on in the author's life to make him hate women so, but it makes it difficult to read about the world of his creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel spoiled me!","review":"I haven't read a great deal of fantasy/adventure, though several were very enjoyable. After reading 'A Game Of Thrones' I fear it will be very difficult to find its equal! Extraordinary story depth and richness, twists and turns like your favorite roller coaster and just as thrilling. Mr. Martin opened so many doors it seems it will take many more volumes in this series to deal with all that lies beyond them. So much the better! I love, respect, take pride in, fear, pity, mourn and despise his characters. They've drawn me into their world and I didn't want to leave until all was well. Alas, all is far from well, and I ache to revisit them! Mr. Martin, promise you will take good care of yourself...eat well, exercise regularly, no smoking...you must stick around for a long while so you can continue to astonish your admiring fans with these wondrous tales. If I could purchase them in advance, I would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"This is it. I have found my favorite author. In my readings and I have read a lot. I have noticed that most authors in this genre tend to over emphisize the magic while bogging down the story. George R.R.Martin mentions the magic, describes it where itis nessesary but instead of delving into the how, he explores the why. That is so refreshing. This series promises to be one of the best Fantasy series that I have read. So far I put him up with Tolkien, Heinlein, and AzimovWow was my first reaction. The sybolic referances to the War of the Roses, delighted me. I can't elaborate enough how refreshed I was after spending a day reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book.","review":"If you have not read this book, read this book! It is as simple as that. With some books you can get a feeling of where the book is going, what will happen, who will die, so on. With a Game of Thrones, this does not happen. From the first page, you are thrown into a maelstrom of events and people, all going in different directions. Threads of people and events weave around other threads, and you never know when or if they will end. Martin never takes the easy way out, never taking the road most traveled. This book is truly a unique experience and a read worthy of any lover of fantasy who has found things lacking in other books. There is nothing lacking in this book. Wait, yes there is. The sequel is not out yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Genre, read this book !","review":"If someone told me ahead of time that this was a\\"Fantasy\\" novel, I probably would not have bothered. But this book reads like what a King Arthur type novel at it's best would be. Every character is real, and whether they are good or bad, you can't stop caring about what will happen to them. PLEASE don't let this book be a one-hit wonder. If the rest of the books in the series are this good, we are in for the best reading pleasure anyone could hope for.A great, great nove"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I bought this book after watching a few episodes on HBO. I read the reviews before hand and was a bit intimidated by them saying it was long and complex. I don't normally read fantasy so was hesitant. DO NOT HESITATE, it is an excellent read. It very well written and not a challenging read at all. The different characters are well fleshed out so you get to know them and their motives, the chapters are titled by character so you know instantly which character and storyline the coming chapter is about. I couldn't put the book down it was very engrossing and fast going. The book is very life like in that the characters aren't all saints or villans but shades of gray, there is also betrayal, incest, unfairness and other unpleasant human behaviors not just this happy fantasy land or all bleak doom and gloom. Also some of the characters you may like may die just as in life. I can't wait to read the next book and have now ordered the full series it will always have a place on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"gormeghast revisited","review":"I am reading with a nagging feeling I know this. Nothing is new. The Gormeghast trilogy same feel same gloom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Fantasy","review":"I read 5 chapters before tossing this novel in the garbage. In four of the chapters, someone or something was dead, dying, or about to be made that way. In the fifth, some out-of-favor lord is literally prostituting his 13-year-old sister as a means to regain power. Setting aside the morality, biology, and ethics of this situation and just considering a world of power politics and raw aggression, if this act constitutes a genuine power-play (as some other reviews suggest it is), then the political structure of that world is completely inane and fantastical (i.e. delusional). And if this tidbit was thrown in gratuitously, then it was disgusting. Either way, I'm not interested in that world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excitement with no redeeming values","review":"Clearly Mr. Martin has learned his Hollywood lessons well. Every chapter draws you in with some exciting plot twist and leaves you hanging on the edge of the page wondering how things will work out. But there is no humor, nothing to learn about the human condition other than life is nasty, brutish - and best over with quickly. When I finish a reading session, I feel like I have eaten the whole box of See's candy. It sure tasted good, but I am sorry that I even started. I gave my books to the local library - and did not even feel good about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Sexual","review":"I made it 6 chapters into this book before I put it down. I get that sex is part of the human experience, but I don't personally need an author to paint softcore pornography in my head to get the idea. This book is thick with overly descriptive sexual encounters that are unnecessary to the core plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"After being told just how great the series is by several people and reading all the glowing reviews, I started reading this book. What a disappointment! The whole thing was just an endless soap opera of cliched, flat characters in a story that doesn't go anywhere. Now I'm being told that the next book is better, really! I think I'll explore the shelves for something with more varied characterization and a world that isn't an obvious cut-n-paste job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter is Coming","review":"I first heard of this because of the HBO series, I know, for shame. But since then I am determined to read all the books. I will say, it is a bit of a tough read and I am slightly thankful that I watched the entire first season before diving in, mostly because it's a lot easier to put names to faces, and quite frankly there are an abundance of characters. I love this book, love the series and will definately be reading/watching all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of Thrones.. Fire and Ice","review":"Once one is used to the style of george R.R.Martin writing, the Story is intricate and absorbing, a 'can't put down' I found I was in so much of a hurry to see what was going on, I will be able to re-read and STILL enjoy.. I ordered book two and finished it in 3 days ( would have been sooner but had a house and family to look after.."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than HBO","review":"I saw the first season on HBO, but was almost turned off by the graphic nature of the production..so, I thought to read the source literature..In a word, FABULOUS!This book, and the subsequent parts 2-4,brougfht Westeros to life. The only good thing I can say about the HBO version, is that I now have voices and images to help with the reading.I will be picking up the fifth installment when finances allow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich content!!","review":"With the extras features of the book you can enjoy more and more your reading, this is the great value of digital books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of political intrigue","review":"I enjoyed this book because it delves deeply into a plot driven by political intrigue. The character development was exceptional. Martin is an excellent writer and he paints a very vivid picture of every aspect of his mythical world. I would have enjoyed more battles and action in the book, however I imagine he is working up to that in the upcoming novels. This may be a challenging read for individuals who prefer a faster paced novel, however I found it quite rewarding. I have purchased Clash of Kings and am looking forward to reading it.Note: This book features vivid sexual content, including depictions of violent rape. Parents or individuals sensitive to such materials should consider this prior to reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the story, not a fan of the \\"enhancements\\"","review":"The story is one of the best, and if my review was based on that alone, no question bit to give 5 stars. I LOVE the story. One star was lost because of the annoying \\"enhancement\\", where whenever your finger accidentally lands on a hyperlink to a character glossary, you leap forward to near the end of the book. If you are using an App on an iPhone or iPad, this is very annoying. The instructions to take you back to your reading place do not work on these devices - you are left trying to scroll your way back. Worse, you can no longer sync to latest reading page, as Kindle seems to use the character glossary as your furthest read page. The only way to fix, I have found, is via \\"manage my kindle\\" and clearing \\"furthest page read\\". This does fix it, but gets old quick. I recommend this book, but don't pay extra for the enhanced version. The enhanced version may work just fine on an actual Kindle, but I don't have one, so cant say."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"The odd thing about a lot of fantasy novels is that the ideas of what makes a good story do not consists of any really new ideas. The problem is trying to make them work. Game of Thrones creates a fantasy world that is full of mystery, action, intrigue, and suspense that is just plain fun to read. So many stories always have magical elements that sometimes seem to get too godlike or omnipotent at the cost of coherence. (maybe that's why it's magic eh?) Finally! It is refreshing to see a story that has magic as a strong part of the story but in a much more subtle way. No wizards blasting away at each other, but the characters all know and fear magic as something completely unknown. In short magic is actually mysterious and well, magical. Combine this with a chessgame of a story and I see an excellent series. Can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story and Plot. Outstanding by all means","review":"A very gripping plot that keeps readers reading and the critics quiet. An outstanding buy for all fantasy readers and even for those that are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"As hundred of reviewers have justly written before me, this an awesome book! Great in-depth characters, intricately woven plot with some very surprising twists. The author is not afraid to break the usual stereotypes of the genre and he weaves a wonderfully written story! A must read for lovers of fantasy (especially Tolkien fans and dissapointed fans of R.J.)!Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best Fantasy Epic in Years","review":"After reading the reviews, I picked up a copy of this book and began to read. Four days later and many sleepless nights I have finished and stand in awe of the author. Most epic fantasy series (for example Jordan) are so repetitive that while the story is interesting it takes forever to get to the point. Not so with Martin. From the very beginning you are in the action and the pacing is superb. The writing is also exceptional for the fantasy genre. It was a pleasure to read the descriptions of the places and people. The characters are multi-dimensional and a fully realized \\"otherworld\\" is superbly created and populated.I highly recommend this book to readers of the fantasy genre...Mr. Martin has taken this genre to new heights and readers will not be disappointed. I can't wait to start the next book and only hope that the fourth book is soon published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Mind Candy","review":"The other reviewers have already touched on the highlights, so let me just say that this is one of the only (series of) books I've ever bought in hardback. Worthy of my bookshelf and worthy of my time (I'm stingy w/ both!) If you open the pages, I believe G. Martin will dazzle you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fantasy novel for non-fans","review":"I typically do not like fantasy/science fiction novels, but I really enjoyed this one! The characters are fascinating, and you must...keep...reading in order to find out what happens. The only frustrating thing is getting to the end and finding out you have to read the next one to get some satisfaction. The first 50 pages are somewhat male-oriented, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR FANTASY READERS","review":"This is a great first book of a wonderful series still in progress. George RR Martin displays talent and inventiveness in this fantasy masterpiece.It is at the same level of writing as favored fantasy writers such as Robert Jordan. One interesting characteristic of the A Song of Ice and Fire series is the focus and importance of religion in the books. Whereas other books have one monotonous religion, Game of Thrones, and further books in the series, utilize the importance of beliefs and religions which adds a sense of intrigue and mystery to the story. The versatility of Martin's writing and the twists thrown in fit perfectly and will addict you from the start.It is well worth it to purchase this book and all others in the series. Each is a great read that will have you craving the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"I found myself getting caught up in the individual lives of the various characters, it was great. There is plenty of action as well as meaningful dialog and it managed to keep my interest thoughout the book. My largest problem with the series so far is that there are a lot of loose ends that never seem to get tied up by the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ode to despicable people","review":"I only made it about 2/3rds through the book before I just couldn't stand reading about these horrible characters anymore. I have never read a book with such a despicable caste of characters. The characters who weren't evil were just so ignorant that I despised them equally. I actually liked the writing and the plot generally, but just can't spend another minute reading about these horrible people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Years!","review":"Finally, good fantasy written so well that you just can't stop reading! The characters are real - so real you cheer,cry and get angry. This is not a simple good/evil story with outrageous magic and the \\"good guys\\" winning every step. There are heros you will love and characters you will hate, with plenty of people struggling in between. Martin tries to give various points of view by alternating chapters around different characters. He succeeds in drawing you into each character - they become familiar and alive. This is the best I've read in many years - keep it coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow","review":"I found the work to be vulgar and mellowdramatic. Characters had no substance and very little personality. It is nothing that I could not have found in the impulse-buy section at the supermarket. I will not read another and try to forget I was conned into wasting my time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Days of Our Lives... with Swords...","review":"First time I was ever MAD after finishing a book. Read all five, and I have only one question... ENDING? If I had wanted to read a soap opera I would have found one on some network on cable. I want a refund, and some one owes me about three weeks of reading time. Save yourself, read something more satisfying... like a comic book...That is what this is... A Soap Opera with swords."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane and unimaginative","review":"This book is written at the level of the young adult, yet lacks flow and originality. One quickly tires of the self-important over-written prose, and the back and forth between characters' points of view in each chapter. These are flat characters whose behavior is predictable and driven only by highly contrived and barely credible events.Moreover, much of the novel is derivative, \\"borrowing\\" from other books which eclipse it entirely. Don't bother reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infuriating, exicting read, could not put it down.","review":"If you haven't read the books or followed the HBO series based on them, you should. Martin throws the twin children of formula and predictabilty out the window and fills them full of arrows. Then tramples the corpses. A Song of Ice and Fire is a totally unpredictable, exciting series. I've thrown down my kindle in disgust and howled for vengence throughout reading the series. Absolutely NO ONE is safe! Do yourself a favor: Pick these up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not my genre","review":"I started this book because I know lots of people who loved it. I have no issue with the writing, I just don't like the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"This was a great Book!! I like the show but, the book as aways is much better. Give it a try,"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Author of the West!","review":"I won't lie, there were parts of this book I found rather dull. Mostly in the beginning. Then the more I read, I started to realize how essential the mundane in the beginning of the book was. The character development and key plot points take a while to develop, but like any house built, once the foundation is laid, the rest of the building is up to the imagination. Mr. Martin has done a wonderful job, in my mind, creating such interesting characters in a world so full of intrigue and adventure. Whether you love them or hate them, following the many different character story lines that all affect one another is truly a fascinating read. I can't recommend this book enough to the lovers of the genre and can't wait to see what's in store for me in the future! J. R. R. Tolkien may be the prized author of Europe, but here in America, I lay down my kindle for one man. George R. R. Martin, the Author of the West!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read: Kindle edition is rife with typos","review":"I'm mid-way through the Kindle version of this book. It's a good book, but I'm using this space to ensure people know: The editing on this sucks. There are random italics, odd characters in the wrong place (e.g., ( or } or a misplaced \\"), wrong words (\\"Ring\\" for \\"King\\") and one part where half a phrase was missing. I don't know if the bad editing (typesetting?) happened in the original, but it's VERY distracting. Amazon should clean this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on action, and the story develops too slowly.","review":"The idea of the story is good, but the execution is lacking. When something interesting comes up I am switched to another character, and not many of them are that interesting. I like the guy who is trying to regain \\"his\\" kingdom. Actually I wanted him to die, but that is the hallmark of a good villain. The bastard son is and his pet are interesting also. The rest of the characters could have died, and I would not have cared. The idea of switching character perspective seems like a good idea, but there is no lead off into the next person's PoV unlike a traditional book where one chapter leads into the next one. Reading the book is like talking to someone who just randomly switches topics mid-sentence without any warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The game of thrones a song of ice","review":"I read this after watching the HBO series. I was impressed that the shows were pretty close to the book. But of course the book is so much better. This book captured me and held me hostage until I finished only to start the next series."},{"rating":"2","title":"what I've been looking for","review":"Reading through some of the reviews posted about this book I was upset but at the same time in agreeance with the reviewers. I WAS initially surprised at the language and sex scenes portrayed in the novel. I hadn't encountered that in many other fantasy novels. Katharine Kerr includes some but they are more inventive and funny than offensive. Not to say that GRRM's use is offensive, however. It was refreshing almost to have an accurate portrayal of a kingdom vying for control of the throne by using some occasional swear words. We all know that those words were'nt invented for the '90s so people must have used them in GRRM's world also. As to the sex, its out there and its rampant! To not include it in one form or another in this type of story would leave out one very important key: the falibility of human kind. You can't have perfect characters set in this type of environment. the two just would not mesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fantasy","review":"Loved this book, just as much as I love the show. One of the best, and longest, I have read in a while"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Very good book. Very slow setup because of the number of characters and settings, but really moves once the setup is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Points of View","review":"1) I rated this book base on the face value of Amazon's rating system. I didn't like it so 2 stars.2) Martin has Joss Whedon disease. He has too damned many POV characters and this makes the book disjointed and fractious. On top of that, only 1 character in the whole book is actually interesting. The rest are just loud.3) It's BORING. Tedious to read. Just when you start getting into a scene, Martin switches point of view and throws you out of whack. And all the politics is just oppressive. I keep wanting to scream at the book \\"Just kill someone and get it over with!\\"4) Too many of the characters are unappealing. They simply aren't relatable. Beyond the dwarf and the bastard, there isn't a character in the book that I can bring myself to care about in any way. And the bastard is too whiny to be likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL","review":"I ve been a devoted fan of Robert Jordan and was reluctant to read anything else. Well, IM GLAD Im over the Wheel of Time and could finally grab the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire. I wanted to write a review even before I finished it because it is just TOO GOOD, a beautiful prose, agile, direct. Characters are so human, with flaws, talents, compassion and feelings. Turning points at everypage turn, just when you thought it was going to be a predictable situation BOOM! the unexpected happens. I really enjoyed reading Book 1 and I am now starting book 2 , happy to have replaced the commercialized endless Robert Jordan' s Series (sorry! I ve had it with you Mr Jordan). Mr Martin, count me in!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read!","review":"It was so hard to put the book down! Martin keeps you hooked the entire time. Even though it's a long book, it never had that dragging feeling.*SPOILER*Even though I hate it when authors kill characters I like, I've told myself that it would be a rather boring book if it was always \\"bad guy dies and good guy lives\\". Even J.K. Rowling showed no mercy in her last few Harry Potter books. So even though I don't like it, I've come to accept it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"Loved reading this book. I couldn't put it down. Great story line and surprises through out the book. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb fantasy - akin to the Wheel of Time","review":"There are those who find Robert Jordan's writing less than stellar. I don't count myself among their ranks. What Jordan's books do well (rather, more than well) is tell an evocative story that draws us into another world.George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire does the same. His characters (and there are many) are drawn in deep relief, even the best is a deeply flawed (and hence, fundamentally human) individual. The story arc concerns an island kingdom, with thousands of years of feudal history. The book teems with clansmen, leigelords, vassals, and slaves - alliances are formed and shattered.Ultimately, if you are looking for a good read, you could do far, far worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long but good","review":"I would have given this book 4-5 stars if Martin would have been able to condense his stories. His books are way too long in length. I enjoyed this book so I purchased his next 2 books in this series. Martin needs to take a lesson from Tolkien and learn how to write a book that is manageable to read. I quit reading the second book about 800 pages in when I realized there was still over 500 pages to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story...","review":"I didn't see the HBO series. It takes a while to get the characters straight, but well worth it. Many twists and turns... Can't wait to start the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This book is one of those every true fan of fantasy novels must have on their shelves. It will feel at home alongside your Tolkiens, Moorcocks, Zelaznys, Leibers, and Howards. Martin has created a rich deep world populated by interesting, if almost always morally questionable, characters. This epic spans continents and kingdoms, and is filled with political intrigue and battles and interpersonal stories. It's one of those that is truly hard to put down. I highly recommend it.Glenn G.

Book 2 didn't appear until 2002, book 3 in 2003, book 4 in 2007, and book 5 in 2011.Is it unreasonable to expect an author to have a plan for a book and follow it? Martin has clearly gotten lost somewhere in the land of imagination and can't get out.Don't get started, you'll regret it if you do.On the other hand, it's a great story, great characters, and I can't wait until the next in the series. But since I'm 66 years old, I'll probably be dead before he finishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written yet un-engaging","review":"I read this book with much anticipation because I read and heard so many great reviews. Very disappointed. I agree that the book is rich and very well written. However, there is not a single likable character in the book! It's just not fun to read when you don't care about any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but not a fun read","review":"I have to say that when people recommended this book to me, I expected another fantasy epic. I was sorely disapointed. This author seems to enjoy nothing more than torturing his characters, beyond the point where we would see their suffering end, even in real life. None of them have hope for a happy future, nor does any character have the least shred of dignity or honor. I have to say that if I lived in the world of the Starks and the Lannisters, I probably would have killed myself long ago.Why does anyone want to read a fantasy epic where nothing good ever happens?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother if you are over 13....","review":"Poor character development and plodding plot.

I started reading the book a couple weeks before the TV show began, and I am completely hooked on the novels. Game of Thrones is nothing short of a sublime read that is intricate, intelligent, and epic all in one. I thought I had given up reading fantasy novels years ago, but now with this series, my interest has been completely renewed. There are so many well-developed and interesting characters here it is near impossible to choose a favorite, but needless to say \\"The Imp\\" is definitely one of mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amzing Boom","review":"I thought this book was amazing. The level of detail that Martin uses to describe things is wonderful. The only problem I had with it was that it dragged on from time to time. Other than that, the continuity was great.

I can't wait to get through the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bomb!!","review":"Best book I have ever read!

It takes time to get used to the style of Martin and you should accept the fact that some of the characters are not of the brightest, but after that it goes very smoothly.

SOMETHING BIG IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters but change the religion","review":"What I really love about this book is how it focuses as much on the characters as on the plot (Neither are laking). The book doesn't waste your time with characters but you get to know them as the story develops and they have to make tough decisions. Also the characters are very substantial and commonly have lots of heart. When they are betraied or get lost in a dark castile its like your there with them. Martin women makes very good woman charaters.One thing I don't like about this book is the religion of it. The gods in this book are the same as in nearly every fanticy book I've read. I would like to see some Christian fantacy. There are Christian fanticy writers out there but their books aren't being published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely disappointing. Read to learn how not to write.","review":"Don't be misled by the high praise plastered across the cover of this book. The plot seems like it's going somewhere for the first 300 hundred pages, but the author manages to kill off all the worthwhile characters by the end of the book. The plot fizzles as Mr. Martin trumpets events that we're supposed to feel as significant but instead are yet more lurid, overblown escapades. We're left with a storyline that apparently is heading toward some cataclysmic \\"clash of kings,\\" without a character I'd like to meet left. All the remaining main characters are immature, delusional, or outright perverted. In sum, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is yet another sign of the malaise crippling modern fantasy: replete with gratuitous deviance and lacking in characters worthy of admiration (eg, Terry Goodkind and the later Robert Jordan books). Read only if you'd like to really know how utterly hyperbolic cover quotes can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!","review":"Although I am not particularly interested in fantasy, A Game of Thrones held me totally captive until the last word. I believe I have read criticism of the mind-boggling cast of characters and point of view shifts. I, for one, enjoyed the focus on particular characters--Catelyn, Sansa, Tyrion, Jon, etc., and through primary characters, that supporting cast of thousands. Martin helped me immensely by adding a few descriptive words when mentioning supporting characters i.e. lavendar-scented Varys. I immediately recalled who he was if I had forgotten him. I believe anyone who has read Game knows precisely what I speak of. I also must say this technique used by Martin could've become extremely tiresome, but didn't because of the riveting plotline. If you haven't read this novel and call yourself a fantasy fan, for shame. Pick up a copy and do so!!!

Being a fan of both genres, I was more than pleasantly suprised to find 'A Game of Thrones' which has apparently been released for some time now. Creating such a rich and action packed novel makes this a great read and very hard to put down. The threads that started in this book will not be woven for a while, which makes the for even more anticipation. What about the Dragons? What about Winter? Will there be a King of the North? I look forward to more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, phenomenal audio edition","review":"I'm not a big fantasy reader. I find the genre cliched and dull. And yet I love this book. I rank it in the pantheon of Susannah Clarke's Jonathan Strange, the Narnia Series, Philip Pullman's Golden Compass, and of course Lord of the Rings. I've not enjoyed and anticipated the next installment of a book in a long time.And at least as good as the book is Roy Dotrice's narration of it. He broke a Guinness Record for the number of characters narrated. Each is unique and powerfully acted. I love my drive to work in the mornings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but captivating characters","review":"A terrific beginning to a series (but then I said the same thing about The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan. But as long as Mr. Martin takes the high road and puts out sequels that continue to advance the plot or develop his characters, he should safely avoid the quagmire in which Jordan is sinking).Mr. Martin's ability to draw up characters who are unique and distinguishable, who stir up and spur on the plot, helps to deflect attention from the fact that the book is nearly 800 pages long. Very hard to do and very commendable.I am disappointed to hear that Martin plans to write 6 volumes in this series because I fear Jordan-itis setting in, with volumes of filler meted out over the course of a decade (or more) before reaching catharsis. I'm willing to give Martin the benefit of the doubt, hoping the remaining books will be as engaging as this one. If they are, I welcome him to write sequels until the Day of Reckoning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work !","review":"I read lots of fantasy and this is the best book I've ever read.

I normally don't read this type of book, and didn't realize it would have so much \\"fantasy\\" like events (like the woman that is very interconnected with dragons), but it was drew me in. The book is very interesting, an examination of different claiminents to the throne (reminded me of the war of the roses in England's battle of thrones, and King Alfred's small gathering of English soil into one hands), including one group belonging to the last crowned king (who had combined several separate groups into one kingdom). The only part that started to get annoying was the \\"supernatural\\" forces beyond the north wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read more reviews before purchasing this book","review":"Having just completed the 12th book in R.Jordan's \\"Eye of the World\\" series, and being new to the genre, I have been searching for a new series author that I can dig into and enjoy. This is definitely not it for me.Without getting into too much detail, I was put off quickly by the incessant use of foul language, sordid sex/incest scenarios, and generally disgusting behavior in the first pages I could get through. I was not intrugued by this, I was really put off by it and subsequently stopped reading.In retrospect I should have read a few more reviews of this book. In doing so I may have come to the conclusion that this is not the book/series/author for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After all the hype online and on TV with the new series, I was really looking forward to this book. However, I found it tedious and boring. There are intriguing chapters, but the plot was fairly predictable before I was halfway done. Too many characters lead to underdeveloped characters. Yes, girls did get married at 13, but reading some of these scenes felt....dirty even if it may have been historically accurate. The gap b/t the young playing at war and the adults living through it was too large a gap to bridge for me. Knowing the story continues on and on through more books made me tired just thinking of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Book","review":"This was the last book that I ever thought that I would read.

Martin's first Novel to his new series 'A Song of Ice and Fire' does not only break all the boundries of fantasy novels that you may have read before, it creates new one's, that leave you eagerly awaiting the second part to this series.

There is a reason for LOTR and othe FAKE fantasy books that were a lot more entertanig than this. This easliy consumed hours of my life that i will never get back.

Book 4 was abysmal, so my advice is to not start the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"XXX fantasy- Not for the kids","review":"There are a lot of people warning that this book is a little disturbing or graphic and some people have labelled it R. I think that is FAR to generous. This book should not be sold to anyone under 18. The scenes of graphic sex are more shocking and sick than penthouse letters. For example the graphic description of sex with an under-aged pregnant girl covered in horse blood really beg the question \\"was this necessary\\"?The only reason this was not labelled a romance novel is that the sex, while gruesomely graphic, is not fun, sexy, or romantic.In My Opinion, A fantastic, complex story that was needlessly dragged into the gutter by sadistically graphic tripe. If you can look past, or better yet, skip over these parts there is a very good story in there. But it is not the great fiction masterpiece that everyone is hailing it. A great masterpiece can be enjoyed at any age, this book cannot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the magic?","review":"The first book in George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire is a true example of \\"political fantasy\\", much like the Daughter of the Empire trilogy.While this book begins quite dull, the plot turns in many surprising ways. Martin is not afraid of using very, let's say, unconventional grips to make the story advance. The plot is nevertheless, or perhaps because of that, more plausible than the mentioned trilogy.The only thing that can be held against this collosal epic is the lack of magic and other elements of fantasy. Most of the time it feels like medival-story with a new map, save from a few direwolves. Only at the end does a few things show up, but Martin does not integrate them as well as Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO dark, and sexually explicit","review":"Robert Jordan writes some harsh stuff - but he has some light in his world. There is no nobility in this fictional world. This is not \\"realism\\". This book seeks to bring forth only the vile, base, and viscious - added is the VERY explicit sex scenes. I ordered book 1 and 2 on a whim (a mistake I'll not make again). I read some of book 2 as it came in first until I couldn't take any more (about 1/3). It was even worse! I skimmed book one and found the same when it finally came in. There's better fiction out there that won't stoop to \\"base vulgarity\\" and all that is course and vile to paint the moods."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not call it Fantasy","review":"I find it hard to call this fantasy. It is more like GRRM read the history of the War of the Roses and the Hundred Years War and then fictionalized both events by changing the names of the historical participants. Sorry it doesn't hold a candle to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. I find the characters hard to get interested in or even care about. I am not sure what all the fuss is about for this series, unless people have never read the actual history on which this is based. Believe me the real history on which this is based is a lot more exciting than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded and overrated","review":"Read many fantasy books. this is too long, too descriptive. i'm bored.

It is back to something a bit more toothy; like, Erikson's Malazon Book of the Fallen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me more","review":"The promising beginning of the saga stands as an example of how to weave stories of complexity. It is clearly not designed for younger readers and those without patience. It is not the kind of book where action flows with great swiftness, but every word is there for a reason. It has everything I like: intrigues, devious politics, mysteries plus an eerie, almost Lovecraftian touch. A must-read for more demanding readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have lots of time?","review":"I just finished A Game Of Thrones and have started A Clash Of Kings. They are both great if you likereading books in a series. If you just want to read one book this isn't it. As soon as you finish this bookyou really want to move on to the next one. There is very little supernatural stuff going on in A Game of Thronesand a whole lot of plotting and backstabbing. There is no Hollywood [content] in this book.

I can only assume it is consistent with the quality of writing you'll find throughout since I couldn't make it past the first two hundred or so pages. Martin wields his pen like a sledgehammer.Also, if descriptive sex between Genghis Khan and his thirteen-year-old bride makes you a little uncomfortable you may want to consider something else. I accept the reality of child brides in this setting, but couldn't Martin have just alluded to the fact that the marriage was consummated and the groom was surprisingly gentle?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time and money","review":"The first few pages are great, then the story stalls.

After whining about missing several conventions in order to work on the book he refers to his readers as trolls. I guess only those who worship him are worthy. It seems the man is too in love with himself to bother with the trolls who have made him rich.Think twice before investing your time and money with this egotistical jerk. He obviously has no idea what to do with his story. I have serious doubts as to his ability to finish this series as he seems to be more interested in other projects than finishing what he started."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible surprise","review":"From all the hype I had expected an exciting new fantasy series.

Worse than a waste of $10 and an hour - don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy? Maybe technically.","review":"I read this book followed by the second and about half of the third (before being too revolted to continue) and I have to say I'm surprised by the rave reviews. This isn't a fantasy book, its more akin to horror than anything else. The series became predictable in its own way. A disaster will happen. Every character will end up mangled, mauled, and mistreated without fail. Just like the hero that always saves the day, in this series, life will always get worse. Maybe this book is popular because gore, violence, and sex have become so popular in the modern world. I don't know. As for me though, since attempting to read this series, I haven't picked up a single new fantasy book. I used to like fantasy, but if this is \\"good\\" fantasy, then I'd rather stick to something more cheerful, like cyberpunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire:Book one","review":"I liked this book very much.

There is action and some of the descriptions are pretty graphic but probably accurately reflects the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book series is as boring as it gets.

It's amazing how the author throws you into the points of view of many different characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie script","review":"The whole book reads like movie script - I just got through 25% of it, trying to understand what is the hype. The chapters are broken up like they are made for a movie, go here do that, say that, then go there. There is no flow and there is no emtional flow . It is mostly just the plot. So to speak the book is all bones, without the flesh.And I am not liking all the violence too. Isn't fantasy supposed to be about good vs. evil . Well, in this book where is the good? The good gets you killed. If I wanted the real ugly life story I could just turn on CNN.To even compare it to the \\" Lord of the Rings\\" is a travesty. I should get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"a game of thrones","review":"'A Game of Thrones' is an epic tale of honor and betrayal that has enough twists to keep you reading. George R. R. Martin is a fantastic story-teller and really breathes life into all his characters. There was a lot I liked about this book (especially the characters and the settings) and it really felt like an original story, however it is a big book and only an introduction to the series. There was a point towards the middle of the book I really wished I hadn't started. The story slows in some places and it can sometimes feel like a chore, but I guess that's okay if you're someone who really appreciates fantasy.I personally recommend borrowing this one, and being prepared to wait a long time to see the end of this series. It's a good story, but not one to rave about. I will probably read the next in the series at some point though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fantasy series ever","review":"If you like fantasy and you haven't read this book you are making a big mistake. You really should read it. This book and the series after is wonderful. It's a great read. Even if this isn't your genre you will enjoy these books. They are for adults just so you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel, but drawn out climax","review":"This novel has excellent characters and an unpredictable, satisfying plot. The prose and descriptions are just the right length, and the style feels like a modern update to classic storytelling (not as dry as Tolkien).My main criticism is that the flow of the novel feels uneven. There is a revelation regarding the main mystery of the story quite a bit far from the ending, and the momentum for the last few hundred pages feels hectic. The quiet bits of character moments from the first half of the novel give way to a relentless avalanche of events all the way through to the end. However, the strength of the characters and the clever set up for the rest of the series leaves the reader wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad","review":"This bed was not a bad buy for what you pay for it. Of course, it's made of MDF(particle board) so I wasn't expecting a spectacular piece of furniture. It looks nice and the storage option is a big plus. Just make sure that you assemble it fully in the place where you are going to use it as it is NOT easily mobile. Since it is just a screwed together frame that sits on the floor it will become off-center if you move it and drawers will not operate properly. It may not be the highest quality piece of furniture, but after sleeping on a wooden futon frame for a few years, I wouldn't trade it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Expected more from this. It's more like pamphlet of scanned pages of original book. Although a good story, save your money if you are looking for a nice Airedale story. Not what I hoped for. Delivery was quick and 'book' was new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only bilingual book that my kids like","review":"My toddler son and 5-year-old daughter love when I read this book. It is funny and imaginative. The translations seem to work well. The illustrations are vibrant and I think they would work well in a classroom. This is the only bilingual book I own that my kids actually request often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-moving, Rather Silly Mystery","review":"I was hoping for better in this film by Merchant Ivory. I have liked some of their work and others not so much. However, this mystery set in India with an Indian police detective looking for diamond smugglers/thieves is definitely not one of their best and if a series was planned, I trust better was thought of the idea. The Indian detective who is the central figure is supposed to be intelligent but long-suffering and appealingly maladroit with his superiors and his wife at home. However, I found him boring and colorless, and at times downright sappy. Stellen Starsgaard, who looked very young here, plays an almost superfluous character, a visiting Swedish criminologist, who is even more inept than the detective. The plot, in addition to being slow-moving, is rather inane and jerky and overall not very involving. I don't know if the book from which this was derived was good but if so, I would have to say that it was not done justice in this film adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monsters In My Mailbox","review":"This is a delightful book filled with zany monsters who come via a \\"Monster of the Month\\" club.

I was specifically looking for an SUV bike rack, but have no hitch or roof rack. Most of what I looked at cost 2-3 times as much. The only real drawback to the rack is security. Even if the bike is \\"locked\\" to the rack, the rack can be easily removed by cutting the canvas straps that hold it to the SUV, allowing the thief to then remove the bike from the rack at his leisure. So if you need to have your bike SECURE, this isn't a good rack. If it's strictly to get from point A to point B, and you can lock it once you're there, this provides good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke at seconde use","review":"The first time we placed 3 bikes on it, the locking mechanism broke, since that we have had contstant problems, we can't put 3 bikes now, the max. is two and you have to be checking that the rack is in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main joint does not lock; bike also easy to steal.","review":"I trialled and retrialled this device using the instructions and several engineer friends. The main joint did not lock securely so that when the bike mounted, it collapsed, allowing the bikes to fall. Also, even if you use the cables to lock the bikes into the rack, it's easy to simply snip the cloth stays and take the whole thing right off the trunk, bikes, cables and all.

I asked a woman where she found hers and she said that she loved it for transporting her one bicycle around the area. This Christmas I added this to my list thinking it would be great to take our three children riding more often. I followed the instructions implicitly and was not at all put off by the difficulty I had getting the bikes fitted and tightly secured. Come on- I wasn't expecting cheap, convient, and easy to all come together perfectly, but I was extremely infuriated when the day after our first trip, my husband noticed a 4 inch pressure dent in the rear of our vehicle.

I had three light-weight roadbikes on this rack while driving up to school. While I was driving on the freeway, the horizontal bar that holds the bikes actually fell so that it was angled down. If I had not locked the bikes together to the bike rack, they would have slid off and hit the car behind me, which I'm sure would have caused an accident. When it fell, it actually made two big dents on my trunk and one of the bike pedals scratched up my bumper. I was extremely happy with this bike rack until this incident.

We used a bungee cord to get it situated nice and tight.My \\"girl\\" bike took some figuring out so it didn't wind up nearly perpendicular to the ground.I don't think it'll hold three bikes unless they're slim racing bikes.Overall, glad I bought it, and I would highly recommend it (and an extra bungee cord or two)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Rack","review":"I just upgraded to this after having to return the 2-bike rack due to the fact that with an infant seat on one of my bikes it was almost impossible to fit two bikes. On the second outing with this 3 bike rack, the locking mechanism that holds the rack vertical broke. Luckily, I had attached another strap around both bikes to the main frame, keeping them from hitting the highway. Needless to say, I will be returning this and looking for a better built rack.

It states clearly in the directions to make sure the area where you place the padded bars is clean. If there is any debris between the pad and car, it will scratch your paint.

I found it easy to use and it gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional; Serves the purpose for me","review":"This rack is working fine for my family. In spite of a few reviews from others about damage to car, I experienced no problems with damage. Perhaps user error is the cause of some of the problems indicated in prior reviews. I did discover one little problem. I have an infant seat on the back and my middle son still uses training wheels. Due to the bulkiness of both, I was unable to use all three harnesses no matter how I arranged the bikes. I had to put the bike with training wheels in the back of the van instead. The consumer's review is correct about the bike lock not being any advantage really. If someone wanted to steal your bikes they could just cut the straps of the rack. However you could use it to strap the bikes together which would at least make it more difficult to steal the bikes and get somewhere with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but will dent cars","review":"Both my friend and I bought the rack and was planning on hauling 6 bikes about 200 miles.

No? Okay, nice try.","review":"While this movie was extremely hyped as being the be all of scare movies, it was pretty much lacking any real scare factors, except the final scene. The entire movie is staged, with two mediocre actors walking around talking about a ghost or possible demonic entity being tied to the female character. Simple tricks, and some lighting was used to create those overly hyped scare scenes. I will not be wasting much more of my time on this review, because in the end it is left to you on deciding whether or not it is worth your time. If cheap thrills scare you then this may in fact be the film for you. As for me, I'll get my scares at HHN and will NOT be watching the second movie. Like the Blair Witch project, this was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad lead female acting.","review":"This movie has it's moments but I just couldn't stand the lead female character in the movie.

Think every movie should be a freakin \\"Titanic\\" or \\"Avatar\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\"? Maybe you need to sit down and re-examine your expectations of what you enjoy in movies. I bet half of the entitled, boring, 1-star reviewers here were the same kids years ago that went to see \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" or \\"Independence Day\\" and thought those were sublime film-making at it's best.

This is how the story goes: After a young, middle class couple moves into what seems like a typical suburban \\"starter\\" tract house, they become increasingly disturbed by a presence that may or may not be demonic, but is certainly most active in the middle of the night. Especially when they sleep. Or try to.The cast led by Katie Featherston (as Katie) & Micah Sloat (as Micah) is great! The directing and film editing by Oren Peli is excellent! The casting by Ricki Maslar is great!This is another \\"Blair Witch\\" like movie that is excellent!

It is a stupid movie, badly filmed and boring beyond belief. But having to view her little tantrums and unforgiving attitude toward her well-intentioned boyfriend is the ONLY disturbing thing about this movie. She is the proverbial \\"Hey it's my time of the month every day so I'm entitled to behave this way\\" sort of woman who gives the rest of us a bad name. Someone please medicate her. Heavily.

As a horror movie and paranormal movie/tv fan, I was bored to death and wanted to leave the theater.

It was not the least bit scary until the last twenty minutes. Even during the last twenty, it was not all that scary. The other sixty minutes is nothing but a video diary of a family that no one really gives a crap about. If you can get this movie for free, get it, you can use it as a doorstop, make it look like you own a lot of movies from afar, or you can take the DVD out and use it as a coaster.

Maybe you could hook a little string up to the microwave and open and close it all scary-like, get out your Fisher Price camera and start rolling ...As Helena Blavatsky used to say, \\"Shake a little powder on the floor, demon do a little chicken dance,\\" or something like that.The joke's over.

I think they did what The Blair Witch was supposed to, make you feel like you are watching someone's demise on tv. It starts out slow and very mundane, almost as if a couple is actually taping themselves. As it goes on, the occurrences get a little more intense. I disagree with many people that the best parts were in the commercial, those were only snippets. You have to go in thinking this is a real videotape edited by someone who found it. Ignore the acting, or reasoning behind what the people are doing. Most people are oblivious to danger until it's in their face and probably would act the way these people did because most people don't believe in the paranormal. Watch it, take it for what it's worth and use your imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough of this genre already","review":"I was stuck in a hotel room and made the mistake of ordering this movie not realizing it was yet another of the failed attempts to recreate whatever \\"magic\\" was generated by the Blair Witch Project.IMO, this genre outwore its' welcome after about one movie (the aforementioned BWP).Please, enough of these movies.

Not even a thriller, if you like. All I wanted was to be moved or touched in any way by the story - was I asking too much? Apparently. I just wanted something to happen and nothing did. As a watcher, I do not care about the budget of the movie: I care about liking the outcome.The only thing the movie did was make me hope something worthy would happen until the end of it; and I hoped and hoped and when the end came and nothing has still happened, I just picked another movie to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good entertainment but thats it.","review":"I saw this thinking it was based on a true story. Its based on one fact and the rest is fiction. I wasn't super impressed, to me it wasn't scary. Imaginative and interesting yeah but scary?? Not so much. The ol 'Blair witch' trick strikes again. See Haunting in Connecticut if you thought this film was scary then see the 2nd one mentioned and you'll jump out of your skin and all true too. Fiction can be scary too but nonfiction cuts right to the bone. Nice job guys try again for a better result next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this, as I love a good scary, non-gorey movie.

I rented this movie during the weekend,and by seeing the auidence reaction from this movie during the previews I thought that this would actually be a scary movie.Horror movies are my favorite genre of movies, so I know a good horror movie when I see one. In my opinion this movie was not scary at all, all you had were the bedroom door slamming shut, and a few loud bangs at night. They tried to make it scary towards the end but for me it was to little to late. The ending I couldn't take serious because someone was even smilling at the end. I feel sorry for the people who actually paid ten bucks to see this crap at the theaters. One last thing Paranormal Activity did not deserve half the money that it made at the box office!!Bottom line if you want to watch a movie by yourself and be scared rent or buy the \\"Strangers\\", \\"REC\\", heck even Animal Planets \\"Lost Tapes\\". But do not waste your hard earned money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..","review":"Dull, amateurish horror movie about a young couple in a haunted house. It feels like it was made by college students- it is simply the young couple running around with a camcorder, screaming at slamming doors etc... I found it just dragged on and on, even though it's actually a short movie. Same kind of thing as the Blair Witch Project, so if you go in for these zero budget horror movies that try to compensate for their amateurishness by pretending the events portrayed are a 'true story', then you might enjoy this.

For the first half of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" I was about to relegate it to the junk heap. Nothing of anything was really happening. The genius of the film is how it builds tension and claustrophobia until it ultimately grips you and by the end it has a visceral impact on you. It layman's terms it scares the bejesus out of you. Roger Corman would be proud of this terrific exercise that even he, the master of the shoestring budget, would marvel at how the makers of this film did with little resources. I'm not so much reminded of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" but a student film by effects wizard Dennis Muren, \\"Equinox\\", made in the Sixties with little more than it's auteur's ingenuity. \\"Equinox\\", a model for the DIY sensibility, has been given a first rate treatment by Criterion. Certainly not a horror classic but a marvel nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not scary","review":"Just saw this again after having seen it in the theatre.

Sad to say that, as I try to be quite skeptical about what the media feeds the public. So I couldn't help but think that many of those people who actually went to see this movie in the theatres must have felt duped. There really is nothing to this movie for the first 45 minutes or so, and after that the build-up of \\"paranormal\\" activity didn't exactly have me on the edge of my seat.

Other than some bed sheets lifting up as if someone passed gas in bed, there is nothing. I almost fell asleep and actually fast forwarded parts waiting for something to happen, it doesn't. Additionally, some of the same scenes get repeated. I have no clue what that is for. Remember those short Halloween videos people send where something jumps out at the last minute?

Even the ending was downright creepy as heck. A very, solid movie that should keep you on the edge throughout. I cant believe those who are saying that its boring????

I thought Blair Witch Project was a \\"dud,\\" but I sat through the WHOLE movie and even talked about it for a couple days afterwards.

I'd be thinking boy somethings really going to happen now... and nothing.The most intense \\"action\\" on the screen was the time lapse counter.So many missed opportunities to make things really scary or creepy.

I like the Blair Witch Project a lot, but this movie has too many flaws and just does not cut the mustard.

And no, you will not see blood or guts; nor will 8 teenagers loose their clothing and then their heads. And finally, sorry, but no zombies will crawl out of the grave and try to eat everyone.

It's an agonizingly slow burning candle if, like me, you're an empiricist and don't believe one iota in an unverifiable supernatural world. In fact it will quickly seem contrived and quite silly. In fact, the relationship between the two principals was more interesting than all the boogieman stuff. Their 'partnership' was downright annoying. It struck me as uncomfortably modern, without real affection and fraught with the certainty of future dysfunctionality. You will probably hate yourself the morning-after if you spend money to watch this decidedly unscary effort.

It is unfortunate that so many were impressed by this and keep spending money to watch the sequels.

It would've been cool if unrelated stress along with the camera etc inadvertently allowed the creature in. The confusion is the terror. The biggest problem I had was.... the lack of a good ole Priest!The FIRST place I would've gone is to the closest Catholic Church...and I'm not Catholic lol!By the end it was annoying.

Bad choice. What I had heard about this movie from my friends made it sound like I would never sleep again if I watched it, so naturally I had to see it eventually. When I first started watching it, the first thing I thought was \\"So, when does it get scary?\\", a thought that would stay with me throughout the remainder of the movie. For me, the scariest part was the last 20 seconds of it, and even the ending was less scary than one of those scary picture gags on the internet.

I consider it on the same level as that movie made by college kids on a school project in the woods. This is my personal opinion of this movie. You might really enjoy it.

Even the Blair Witch Project had some type of story. This SUCKED. These people should be barred from making another movie again.

You stare and try not to blink becuase you don't want to miss anything. Your eyes go left and right trying to focus on the whole room and hallway. It's creepy and you wonder what's going to happen. A few of the nights were very creepy and make you jump. The rest of the film is good too. I like the two main people and everything that goes on between them. What they do and their actions and responses, it's realistic enough.

I think it's a case of Hollywood(hyped)horror vs. genuine horror fans. There's the one side that believes it was different, creative and original. Then the other side that expects much, much, much, much more from a film about the paranormal. Going into this film, I actually thought I was going to see an innovation in the genre. What I witnessed was a smack in the face to the general viewing public. While I was watching, I actually felt like I was being laughed at by the cast and crew, for buying into the hype. I am not a gullible person but I almost felt like I was brainwashed into watching this garbage. I found it to be a half ass-ed reality TV rip off of a 4th rate version of Poltergeist. Annoying unbelievable characters + non-existent plot + mindless occurrences = Paranormal Activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like watching people sleep, this is the movie for you","review":"Half an hour into this movie we wanted to turn it off. We decided to keep watching because of all of the hype. Hoping that it would get better. At an hour, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to turn it off (hoping he would). We decided to keep watching because something had to happen right? No one would make a movie so boring without something really good happening at some point. Well, finally in the last five minutes something happens. Not much, but something. The best comparison I can make is it's like an hour and a half episode of Ghost Hunters except it's fake, so the few little supernatural incidents are not the least bit scary becuase we know it's fake. If it were real, it might have made a good Ghost Hunters episode.

If you want to be spoon-fed gallons of blood and gore, go watch the other 99% of crappy horror movies. The thing about this movie is that you can relate to it in real life. I'm sure everyone has one time or another heard noises in the middle of the night. Sure you know there has to be a logical explanation for it but sometimes, but you do get nervous because you don't know what it could be. With paranormal activity, you get to relieve those exciting moments as a kid when you dared each other to say bloody mary 3X in the mirror or told each other scary camp fire stories. This movie is psychologically scary which is a nice break from the other horror movies where it seems like the more blood used, the scarier its suppose to be.

It has the same single hand held camera look and feel. Apparently, we are supposed to wonder \\"is this real\\". It's not, and it doesn't look it.There are no special effects, but far worse, there is not much of a script. Yet again, movie moguls have figured out a way to rip us off.

This is not a feature film, it's not scary except literally he last 90 seconds or so and it's probably the cheapest scare in Hollywood history. The only reason I watched this was because of all the hype -- and that's all this thing is; pure hype.You know that part in the trailer where they show everyone in the audience jumping out of their seats? Yeah, that's the last 3 seconds of the film...the rest of the film is a snore.Has anyone ever sent you one of those pictures where they tell you to look closely for something in the background or follow a maze, then suddenly the creepy face pops up and it screams at you? Yeah, that's pretty much the summary of Paranormal Activity. Save your money and just Google \\"scary maze game\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first one was the best","review":"I was terrified after watching this movie for the first time.

In my mind the Discovery channel show \\"Haunting\\" is scarier than this movie. Nothing really creepy happens until the final few minutes of the film, until then it's just a lot of creaky doors and banging.I'd think if they gave the same budget to a local Halloween haunted house pretty much anywhere in the country they could have made a better, scarier, film.The real strike against it is showing the ending in the commercials though. I kept waiting for the bit where Micha is thrown through the door... sure enough it happens... RIGHT AT THE END OF THE MOVIE! Literally 20 or 30 seconds from the end of the film.Way to ruin things marketing department!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school creepy","review":"I'm a wimp. I can't handle stuff like this anymore.

I must say I was very disappointed in what I saw.Here's a quick rundown:The Good- The actors did a good job.- There was a good funny scene, which was the only thing I remembered when I left the theater.The Bad- This movie wasn't scary at all. If you're one of those people who closes their eyes and covers their ears when watching horror movies, you might find this one scary...because you won't be able to see/hear that it's not!- The movie was mostly boring. There was a little suspense, but not enough to make me care. I just wanted it to be over or for something interesting to happen. At least my first wish was granted. :)- The ending. Could have been a lot better.In conclusion, don't waste your money on this one. If you must see it, wait for the DVD and rent it.Also: Blair Witch Project was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual insights","review":"I have only watched 1 \\"horror\\" movie in 15 years so not very familiar with these things.

Paranormal Activity made an honest attempt, but even alone in the dark the scariest part of the movie was when I ran out of beer. The plot unfolds in a predictable manner with an escalation of \\"paranormal activity\\" until the climax of the movie. There is even a convenient sound effect (a low base rumble or something) that tells you when to pay attention because something is about to happen. Bottom line I've scooped scarier things out of my cat's litter box..."},{"rating":"1","title":"clich��","review":"Somewhat interesting in that the film is homemade and the filmmaker created the special effects himself, but the whole thing is a colossal clich��: the wife is terrified of the entity in the house, the husband insists on provoking it (while the wife screams at him to stop), and in the end the demon takes over the wife and she kills the husband.This movie would never have been seen if Steven Spielberg hadn't come upon it and gotten it released.

Yet another movie hyped to be \\"superscary\\" that was anything but. All but the last 10 minutes were just an ass-numbing bore. Even then, those last 10 minutes were hardly what I would call superscary...I've seen scarier stuff on Youtube.Basically, this movie is a good hour of watching people sleep, with some weird noises thrown in. Oh, you also get to see them eat, surf the internet, etc....Yaaay! I only paid $1 to rent this from Redbox, and I considered trying to get that back.I didn't buy into the hype, and was glad I didn't.

The girl should have ousted her boyfriend sooner for being such a douche and making things worse. Also, I would have ran to a catholic church after seeing the demon footprints. I especially would have ran directly to a catholic church after being dragged out of bed and bitten by a demon.

It wasn't to be. There are a few moments of genius but they fail to scare. Whatever is haunting the couple's house is an uncreative spirit. One night it only manages to move their bedroom door a couple inches. Gasp! Terrifying! If I was the ghost I would place their hands in warm water or drag their bed downstairs so they would wake up in the kitchen! The film spends too much time on miniscule \\"scares\\" with the only legitimate \\"scare\\" coming at the end, it's cool but predictable.You could probably fast forward 40-50 minutes of the movie and not miss anything.Not bad, not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"really weak","review":"Very disappointing.

Well this book makes a wonderful counterpart to the movie (although the soundtrack is the first thing you should buy). The script is the original shooting script, so you see some minor changes and additional scenes that were apparently cut from the film (i.e. an extended storyline involving Stanley, The rapping kid, and \\"The Worm\\"). There's plenty of behind the scenes pictures, and a forward by pta, as well as an interview that offers some insight as to not only the meaning behind the title behind the film, but the stunning climax.

In fact, it conveys not the slightest degree of good cheer. I have half-a-dozen Nutcrackers on DVD, with that of the Royal Ballet (featuring the always graceful and lovely Cojocaru) being the most entertaining, best-danced, and most professionally produced, and that of the Kirov (with Lezhnina) being a close second. Forget this production--which is in a wholly different and vastly lower league, in almost every respect one might care to mention. It is cheerless, musty, drab, and dismal. (The audio is also unappealing--with the audience audio pickup sounding very odd indeed, as previous reviewers have noted; but the audio in general, audience aside, sounds as lifeless and drab as the performance and production is.)

It's a cold, tough-talking book, with the f-word the first choice for all parts of speech. It's so talky, in fact, that it's hard to consider it a real thriller-more a mystery with a high body count. I was drawn to read THE BITE because of its setting, the suburban Towson-Cockeysville area north of Baltimore with which I thought I was familiar. But I didn't find much that was recognizable, or compelling.

Not only could we not follow the story, certain elements were downright irritating (dialogue, names) and it presented a mish mash of complicated little plots while at the same time seeming to go nowhere. On about night 5 of this, that's when I found everyone asleep, from my grade school daughter all the way up to my husband.

The original software editing disk arrived cracked. Mattel replaced it, but the second disk was inoperable as well. He used his camera off and on the entire first day and kept deleting and retaping.

I find the .60's are just a bit too thin, but for more chord strumming style playing, such as playing rhythm, the .73's are perfect. They are flexible, but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However, they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So, i dont see how you can go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the price and shipping, it's a rip-off","review":"Dunlop .73 picks are the best picks in the world as far as I'm concerned. At a music store they range from 25 to 40 cents each. The description for this item does not show a quantity. Now that I received it, I find you get a dozen for less than four bucks, which wouldn't be bad, but then with the cost of shipping I ended up paying close to nine bucks for twelve picks. I did not see anywhere in the description of the item where they told how many picks you get, and I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picks","review":"This nylon pick has great play feel.

Xero/G's Are You Weightless is, pun intended, weightless. The arrangements (all synths) are standard without anything original or interesting standing out. It's utterly derivative. You've heard it all before and most of us with a mid-priced synth could come up with equally mundane stuff. But that's not what kills it for me (I usually enjoy such stuff for, at least, background to everyday life)- the vocals (female) are amateurish. As much as I hate to be harsh and insulting, this singer should keep it in the shower and/or car. She has no range, no style, and, worst of all, no ear. If you have any sense of pitch (which the singer and producer apparently have not), this music may even make you cringe a bit.

It ain't gonna' happen.Learning to defend yourself requires mental and physical toughness, which can only be learned through personal training. Technique is secondary. You've got to hit and be hit. You've got to sweat. You don't sit at home flipping pages.And no matter what some \\"expert\\" says, no one method of self defense is better than another. A method is only as good as the person using it. However, if you simply want to read a good book on self defense, read anything by Col. Rex Applegate.

But I liked what he had to say, from my experience it is mostly true. Boxing because of the way it is taught and practiced makes it realistic and applicable to the street. There are other fighting forms, thai-boxing, brazilian JJ, valetudo that are also streetwise but I guess Ned's point is that boxing should be the starting point of anyone's street style and I'd have to agree. As one of the other reviews about Ned states, his attack on other styles is at times a little over the top, he sometimes comes across as the kind of guy who likes to beat on small guys and call orientals 'gooks' but all things considered, it's worth a read and there are some good anecdotes about the 'golden age' of bareknuckle boxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This book is excellent. I have been doing martial arts and boxing for over 10 years now, and all I can say it, this book is excellent. Anyone who has seen real fights knows that they are over within 3 seconds or 5 at most (95 % of fights, the other 5 % will drag out, but that is rare. Usually, the first guy who gets a head shot in wins and/or ends the fight. Anyone who has seen real fights knows this). The fact is, martial arts are great (I do more martial arts than boxing by far), but for a real street confrontation, I will take boxing any day. The author even details how to end a fight against someone using a knife or stick or club. Like I said, get that first shot in, fast and hard.The book really is good on offense and defense, and has interesting historical stuff from previous boxing eras. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on western fighting art","review":"Ned Beaumont has done it again another great book that is full of info that most people could only learn by training and fighting in the ring , ned saves many the pain of doing this and provides details on boxing that comes only from years of hard work ,research and commitment .Well done Mr Beaumont i look forward to your third book on boxing ( i,m sure you have more than enough info to write several )"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're only picks?","review":"Picks may not seem like a big deal, but they are.

Winchester writes with a kind of distant, haughty prose which comes across as rather ... Victorian. You'll be reaching for your own dictionary more than once as you read this book.Of course, this is entirely appropriate considering the subject matter. Winchester could practically be \\"channeling\\" Professor Murray himself. The book is full of heavily researched footnotes and asides. More than once I imagined it must have taken the author a week to get the facts for a single tangential sentence.But it all goes down easy thanks to his good sense of humor. There's a lot here for word lovers, of course, but also for those with a casual interest in Victorian intellectual society."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful story","review":"Until I read this book, I always thought the OED was just another dictionary. How wrong I was! This book begins with a short history of the english language, then proceeds to discuss why the OED was undertaken, and all the players involved. I've come to think of James Murray, the main editor of the OED, as a hero. The OED is a complete listing of ALL the words ever recorded in the english language, and it took 71 years to complete. The Meaning of Everything was a great introduction into this endeavor and left me wanting to know more.One problem with the book is that it, rightly so, discusses James Murray's involvment at length, however, I feel that it short-changed the editors who took over after Murray. This book is really about Murray and the OED, not the entire project. I wanted to know much more about Craigie and Onions -- their personal history, triumphs, and defeats -- as editors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Subject","review":"This is clearly a fascinating subject, and Winchester does not disappoint in covering this grand endeavor. He starts by showing us the untidy history of the English language and the first attempts to catalogue its words. Then the challenge of the OED is underway -- to fully document the words of the language in its entirety. From the master lexicographer, James Murray, to the diverse and msyterious characters scribbling down millions of quotes, Winchester shows how this monumental task came to succeed over a period of decades. My only complaint was that the book was not longer, and did not go more into the modern reworkings of the OED, although it is touched upon in the epilogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Delight","review":"Anything by Simon Winchester is bound to be a delight due to his mastery of the English language and his ability to tell a fascinating tale. In The Meaning of Everything he returns to much of the same subject matter as he covered in his best known work, The Professor and the Madman.The Oxford English Dictionary is a peerless reference work. Winchester tells the story of how it was conceived and brought to fruition by the work of numerous talented men and women from the mid eighteen hundreds up until the 1920s. He describes the painstaking work that developing each etymology and definition involved and the many personalities involved, most especially the greatest of the Dictionary's editors, Sir James Murray. There are also many vignettes of some of the others who spent time and energy creating the Dictionary, including J.R.R. Tolkien, who created many of the W definitions.This is a delightful book that will entertain you even if you rarely have occasion to consult the OED."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of pure genious","review":"Absolutely one of the finest books/audio Cds one can pick up! This is a wonderful, elucidating account of the creation of the OED. The author, whose prose has graced the subjects of Krakatoa and \`The map that changed the world' now sheds light on the processes by which the OED was created. His enlightening sketches of the many gifted souls who lent their knowledge and intimate knowledge of the English Language is a tale of greatness and heritage. Reading this will make you feel like a flower that has just been watered, enriched by the greatness of the English language and its diversity and many influences. The authors grasp on his subject is overwhelming and many topics are covered. This book should not be missed. The audio version, read by the author, is truly perfect.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story ruined by bad writing","review":"I loved Krakatoa, the only Winchester book I'd read before this, and I'm fascinated by language history and evolution, so I had high hopes for this. I was disappointed. I had noticed Winchester's tendency to lapse into flowery, overwritten prose in Krakatoa, but apparently when he wrote The Professor and the Madman he hadn't yet learned any control over it at all. This pompous style makes the elementary usage errors and sloppy style with which the book is riddled even more irritating. What is his editor's excuse, I'd like to know?There's an interesting story here, and on the level of the entire book it's actually structured very well. I love Winchester's digressive writing style--at its best, it conveys an invigorating curiosity about the world and an almost childlike enthusiasm that's contagious. For me, though, the execrable prose style kept the book from being enjoyable--and given the position of strength it was coming from, that was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The meaning of everything shot out of a cannon","review":"I knew I was in trouble with this book when I found myself fantasizing about cleaning my bathroom to avoid reading.I'm in full agreement with the critique posted Octobert 22 by a reveiwer from CT.

We had a bad tick infestation and used multiple brands of topical treatments (Frontline, Advantix, etc.) and sprays on our dog, none of which did a thing. Our vet told us that oral pills such as Comfortis are very good at treating fleas, not ticks, and recommended Preventic. The number of ticks found on our dog was greatly reduced and the ticks that we did find were not nearly as \\"burrowed in\\" and easy to remove. Used in combination with house and yard treatments, it has been very effective in controlling ticks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preventic Tick Collar","review":"I do not recommend the Preventic Dog Collar. My schnauzer developed sores all the way around his neck after wearing this collar for 4 weeks. He also developed a limp and weakness in his back legs.

Four days before that appointment I removed the collar because of the sores that I discovered and ironically the limp and weakness in the legs started to go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"awesome collar -- updated, now unhappy","review":"Since putting this on my dog, I've found 2 ticks and one of those was a day or two after putting the collar on. It was dead when i found it. The other tick was dying. Normally in the 6 weeks or so that the collar has been on, I'd have found at least twenty ticks at this time of the year. Great advice from our vet to get this!--After being on my dog for a few months, he became extremely lethargic like he was a very old dog. He also would recover from minor joint or tendon injuring. After removing for a few days, he was like a puppy again.

Kerry has created a Masterpiece and these guys from earlier Kansas are stunning in there own right. I was drawn to the Kansas sound by the beautiful melodies and arrangements along with the power, but this CD has all of that too. Although the lead singer sounds perfect for this music, I can't help but imagine what Steve Walsh would have added to compositions like Axolotl..... my favorite track. Words of Honor also has a great middle section. The CD is filled with Kerry Livgren's lush keyboard works and powerful but tasteful guitar playing. This is a true GEM. Kansas fans especially should check out this CD. You will definately not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown away","review":"Being a long-time Kansas fan I can honestly say that this one simply blows me away. Knowing a bit about the recording industry, how this group did not make it is of little surprise, but THAT they did not make it is a mixed set of emotions. These guys are amazing, but if they had made it, would the classic Kansas that we all know and love exist? Inversely, where would these guys had gone if they had been given the opportunity to continue? ..... which begs the question ..... will they continue? My vote is to write more songs (Kerry, get busy!) and get back into the studio. You guys are amazing and should be proud of this fantastic collection of extrememly high quality and well crafted music. If you are a fan of the early and classic Kansas, or simply a fan of progressive rock, or simply a fan of good music, I would highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and easy to install","review":"The door knob came nicely packaged and was easy to install.

The end of history may have crimped the style of those who are not driven by entertainment values and the opportunity to make money on things that go up, down, and sideways in free markets. Near the end of the book a section on Art, Philosophy, and Morals provides some caution about how far in any one direction a society is able to go: \\"It is by a sense of possibilities opening before us that we become aware of constrictions that hem us in and of burdens that oppress.\\" (p. 999 in The Modern Library, 1939 edition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hazard","review":"This product is a camping hazard.

The Dramatic's signature vocal arrangements (\\"What You See Is What You Get\\", \\"In The Rain\\"), are missing in this 1990 break-beat galore album, replaced by a generic, indifferent collection of songs that indeed are stone cold. Twenty years after their biggest hits, The Dramatics sound like only producer's property willing to agree to the typical light jazz, rhythm and blues style of the era. No outstanding tracks, no defining moments, the horns are the best thing about it, and they seem to want to wail over many songs in an attempt to hijack this misguided production into jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine contemporary R&B album from The Dramatics.","review":"Although plagued by many of the excesses which typified most post-1986 R&B, I found the \\"Stone Cold\\" CD quite satisfying--especially when compared to the \\"music\\" being put out by most major labels at the time. \\"Let's Make Love 4-ever\\" is a great tune that shows how hard The Dramatics tried to keep their sound contemporary.

I use the Dunlop black nylon pick that is 1 mm in thickness. I still have the first one of these picks given to me by my guitar teacher in 1978! This pick has made quite a change in my playing. It has forced me to address my guitar with some confidence. If you are timid with your guitar, this is not the pick...it will show you up right away. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Picks","review":"I have a habit of purchasing and trying every guitar pick material, shape, and size. I've recently purchased and played celluloid, rubber, gel, and steel picks. Nothing compares to the shape, thickness, and feel of these nylon picks when it comes to playing various styles of music. I had one of these when I started playing about 20 years ago and I'm very happy that I came across these again recently and gave them a try. These picks are super durable, easy to grip, and the perfect thickness for heavy picking or light strumming. The only problem I have with these picks is that they seem to find their way into my friends pockets after a jam session!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best pick you can get","review":"I've been using Jim Dunlop 1 mm vinyl picks for 20 years, and I will continue using them until they are no longer available.

What caught my attention was the development of the operational thread concept. Operational threads being a conceptual sequence of events, activity, and data that describe how the software should work. The book shows what they are, and how to use them to develop regression tests and other test forms. The down side is the use of the term \\"thread\\". It creates confusion with the \\"thread\\" used by operating systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful Examination of Software Testing","review":"Software testing, being one of life's most bewitching pursuits creates challenges for its practioners.

Criminally ignored on its release and sadly near forgotten for decades, it has received the royal treatment on this reissue. Excellent remastering and terrific bonus tracks. Sandy and Dave Cousins are both in fine voice individually but their harmonies are near-perfect. Essential listening for fans of folk rock and psychedelia. It has two versions of 'Who Knows Where the Time Goes' -- the second is almost definitive. When commercial success proved elusive, Sandy Denny moved on to Fairport Convention and The Strawbs became an influential prog rock group. But this album is young, brash, confident, and very special. A time capsule from the universe of what might have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"The paper used to print this book is of better quality thant the text. The \\"research\\" Mr. Meylan has made, at least in the case of Spain, is simply inaccurate.

Don't see if you don't like the sight of needles sticking into peoples' bodies. I'll give them credit for making something pretty creative here. I just didn't find it too compelling.

I thought at first I was having an especially bad break-out, but after a week or two, it wouldn't improve. I ordered Panoxyl, and withing 24 hours there was a BIG difference. I honestly think the 10% label is a lie. I have always had great sucess with benzoyl peroxide, most people think I don't have an acne problem.

However, as a girl, she can not hope to inherit, though her mother insists that she should. Her father's plan is for Athena to marry his brother Poseidon, an arrogant man of few morals. Yet, it is a commoner who Athena loves. Moreover, she knows she can be a better queen than her uncle can be king. In a series of adventures that strips the magic from Greek myths, rendering them in mortal terms, Athena comes into her own, preparing her to face the final challenge, where she will prove she is the better of the two.** Though this is a pleasant enough story, the characters are somewhat hard to relate to. The myths are better with the magical element intact, simply put. However, Athena's Tale is fairly interesting. If Morgan Llewlyn's novels are daunting yet intrigue you, this is a lightweight choice for you. **Amanda Killgore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellectual Bridges link Spain and Germany","review":"This splendid book is a must for anyone interested in Spanish-German relations over the last several hundred years. Since Spain was long part of the Habsburg Empire, and since Franco's Spain was allied with Hitler's Germany, those relations are both complex and significant. The book's 21 essays cover three periods: The Middle Ages and Habsburg years, the Enlightenment, and from the Spanish Civil War to the present. Most are well written and contain useful bibliography. In addition, 38 pages are devoted to bibliography on German-Spanish relations and there are good onomastic and subject indices. I was particularly taken by the essays linking literary traditions (Kabbala and mysticism, Calder��n and German theater, Schlegel and Cervantes, Heine, Unamuno, Neruda, etc.), and by Conrad Kent's well-illustrated essay on the Spanish Civil War as interpreted by German photographers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"This book has interesting pieces but overall it is disturbing. The main character Antonia is extremely naive and her relationship with Adam Savage is creepy. He is significantly older then her and was potentially going to be her stepfather. There is one point where she compares him to ALL male figures in her life, including lover and father. The book would have been better if her deception would have been carried out until Anthony arrived back in England and the hero should have been someone more appropriate rather than her much older guardian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I'm not a big romance novel fan, I read maybe one or two a year. But I picked up this book to take to the beach one afternoon not too long ago and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Most of the time I just skim through romance novels for the \\"juicy\\" parts--and then toss them aside when I get home. But this book kept me riveted! I loved the whole gender-bender quality to it. I actually took the book back up to my hotel room and finished reading it in one night. I felt the main hero \\"Adam\\" was a bit over done; but I really enjoyed the book. It would have been better if the author could have given a bit more philosophical insight into the effect and impact of breaking some of the gender roles of the time--but hey, it is just a romance novel and a very enjoyable one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This was a great book with a wonderful plot.

What grown man is going to mistake a female for a male?! I don't care if she cut her hair, put on pants, and lowered her voice an octave. Any reasonable human being is never going to believe that a beautiful young woman is a man.This leads me to my next gripe. Antonia was WAY too young for this situation. She is seduced and sexually experienced before her 17th birthday! Call me naive and a bit narrow minded, but that's kind of disturbing. Especially when the seducer is a man over 30. Yuck.Other than those two points, this was a good book. The steaminess was good and the dialogue was good. Not my favorite, but definitely not the worst out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING STORY THAT WENT ON FOREVER!!!","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. The story just dragged on and on and on.... It's just so slow paced and makes you want to skip a lot of pages which I did. I read the first chapter, the middle one and the last one.

I can tell you that I work with Lise in Atlanta and she has helped me sell 4 houses not to mention 1 recently in less then a week. I can also tell you that Lise is the only stager I use but after watching Home Staging 101 I realized that she is the same in action and in person as she is in the video. That's incredible because in this video she walks you through your home just like she does in person and you'll know immediately what furniture, rugs, accessories, pillows and colors you need to make it look fabulous whether your selling a home or just wanting a polished designed look.

I've probably spent over $100 on racks that fell down almost immediately. I wish I'd found this rack before I wasted all that money on those cheap racks!This was not the rack I originally wanted, I was thinking that I'd need the rack that holds 400 lbs, however, after I did the measurements, I realized that the Z-rack wouldn't fit in my closet, too tall.

While the text is at once faithful to Dante's original and at the same time brash and a bit irreverent, the images setting this classic in contemporary urban American wastelands give it new depth.

It also refers to the Catechism of the Catholic Church as its source as well as documents of Vatican II. This indicates that this has been thought out and not something just dreamed up the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).

Mr Alton is a very good writter and will only get better as time goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding sequel to Meg","review":"The trench has plot twists that are teriffic. Well written sequel to his number one seller Meg. If you liked the trench, let Steve Alten know about it by e-mail. His address is on back inner flap of the book cover. Would make an excellent movie which would scare the pants off of you. Take that JAWS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trench","review":"This book is a must read, terrorfing book that will keep you on your seat until the final page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes JAWS look like a guppy....","review":"Steve Alten has once again brought us a tremendous thriller with The Trench, sequel to his hit book MEG. I was a big fan of the book MEG, it was a great story with characters you cared about (and some you didn't care if they became Meg bait) and a creature that was both beautiful and scary as hell.The Trench is a continuation of the storyline, one that gave me a further interest in both the Megaladon and the Marianas Trench. The book is a great mix of science fact with science supposition, weaved together so well as to be very plausible. Could Meg still be alive? I don't know but I do know if she is, I don't wanna be anywhere near the water!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trench","review":"This book blew his original book \\"Meg\\" out of the water. If you're a true fan of underwater terror and suspense this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trench is bone-grinding terror","review":"The Trench was excellent follow-up to \\"Meg\\".Mr. Alten's profound knowledge of the Meg is astounding and builds fora great plot. If you are looking for an exciting and thrilling bookthat you will not want to put down, go to the depths in \\"TheTrench.\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Movie it will Make....","review":"Well, I emailed Alten 2 years ago commenting on how much I liked the book... And he sent me a promotional poster via email, showing what the \\"movie poster\\" would look like. Some names in it were Mel Gibson or Kurt Russel, Anthony Hopkins and Tia Carerra. I am a huge movie buff, and my dream is to direct a movie like this... Big budget, thriller, predator, and NON FICTION that has come to be called SCIENCE FICTION. I dont believe this book was sci fi at all.... just like Jurassic Park. A mission to the moon 500 yrs ago was Sci fi.... I love, as many do, where science collides with technology and nature. You will be hearing from me Alten... Hollywood is my calling, and your book makes for a GREAT plot. Another thing. The surprises in it alone make for ENTHUSIASTIC audiences. And, this is no spoiler, but killing the shark in a different way than the Jaws movies and Deep Blue sea..... was incredible.... even though a little weird. I promise to do the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, but you can't beat the original","review":"I found this book to be a be great read(me being into sci-fi movies). Lots of plot changes along the way. I found it a bit frustrating though because it switches beetween two diferent parts of the story virtually every chapter which I found anoying but maybe that was just me. Didn't think it was as good as the first book. It's like jurrasic park followed by the lost world, all the suspence is gone so they make up for it with lots more action which is okay. So that's it, good but you can't beat the original.( I also think these books would make great movies)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel","review":"This story was a great ride before Mr. Alten ruined it all by going third person, present tense. The Trench was a well-written thriller about another Megalodon coming up from the deep and harassing mankind.I enjoyed his crisp style, tight narrative and easy prose.This sequel continues the saga and I enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great book series, for all the people bashing it cause it is to \\"blah blah blah\\" or \\"bleh bleh bleh\\" they must read books about a normal guy, that does normal things, and nothing out of the ordinary happens to them, and the book starts normal, and ends normal with everything being exactly the same as what happens in their lives... wait.... so why dont you just re-imagine everything you did today and not bother reading in the first place? Fun book, good twists, keeps you interested, you learn a little and use your imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping. It kept me on the edge of my seat!","review":"Really enjoyed this book. I could not set it down once I started reading it. It was better than MEG. The shark was devestating. I real tongue biter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Meg, but.....","review":"Maybe two and a half stars. This book was an improvement on \\"Meg.\\" The writing style is a bit better, and the plot was more complex. However, \\"Meg\\" was so badly written that this isn't saying much.Now that he's figured out how to plot, maybe Alten should work on character development. Clearly, we were supposed to care deeply about what happens to Jonas and Terry. I didn't care one bit. And these are holdover characters from the first book! He did his best development with the bad guys. And we all know what happens to the bad guys in Alten's books.The bits about the sharks and other sea creatures were interesting, and will most likely induce me to read another installment. I have to admit, I'll be taking it out of the library. There's just not enough here to make me want to purchase even a paperback copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last gasp from a would-be writer","review":"Basically a slightly more polished version of the dreadful Meg. If English is your 3rd or 4th language and you have little grasp of it, or you are a comic book reader, or pro wrestling fan you'll love this. After Doubleday took a big loss on Meg they dumped this turkey of a sequel. But without all the hype and promotion of a major publishing house it will be interesting to see if this is Alten's last gasp. Probably, time to pick up the basketball pal."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 1/2 stars??! You're all nuts","review":"I couldn't even finish this poor sequel to \\"Meg\\".I got turned on to Steve Alten when I read the fantastic \\"Domain\\", and proceeded to read \\"Meg\\". Well, \\"Meg\\" was enjoyable (3 stars) yet extremely silly. I was able to swallow alot of nonsense due to the neat ideas and fast pace which Alten delivered during it's pages. THIS novel, however, is pointless.Sure, the pacing is quick but it costs the reader a coherent STORY. I felt like I was reading the screenplay for a bad direct-to-video movie. I can't begin to describe how weak the storytelling is here. I don't like to use the word \\"hack\\" when it comes to describing writers, but with this sorry novel Alten almost earns that crown. Honestly, if it hadn't been for his stellar performance on \\"Domain\\" I would never consider reading another Steve Alten novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither good science nor good fiction","review":"As in Meg, Alten has taken a heck of a promising villian (Megalodon) and turned it into chum. His science is considerably off, which spoils a lot of the enjoyment for me. We know there is no hydrothermally-warmed layer of water at the bottom of \\"The Trench.\\" If we make the logical assumption that Meg would behave much as modern sharks do, this weird-acting anthropomorphic creature is impossible to accept as a shark. The humans are no better. Simple one-dimensional figures, they stumble through one miraculous surival escapade after another. The only thing Alten gets right is pacing. The plot hums along nicely, and the book is a fast read, but neither the creatures (reptiles evolving gills? If it's possible, why hasn't it happened in 400 million years?) nor the humans hold the reader's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaws 5","review":"I love shark stories, for light reading they are always fun. This story is okay but Alten writes like an amateur. Instant character delvelopment, rushed dialog and way too many cliques. \\"He thought of Terry, and his heart ached for her. He tried to recall the last time they had laughed together....\\" I guess I'm just mad because I paid full price for the book and I was looking forward to a fun read but the poor writing distracts beyond enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It blew my mind like a hurricane over a sewage plant!!!!!!!!","review":"In a class by itself. The trench draws on the same well of creative genius and originality that Vanilla Ice and Milli Vanilli have mined with such success. Has any one ever heard a giant shark story before? Gee, it seems somehow familiar, don't it. Kudos to Mr. Alten!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AUTHOR'S FRIENDS OBVIOUSLY REVIEWING THIS BOOK","review":"This \\"book\\" is worse than what's on Cinemax at 4am. Just terrible: plot, characters, the writing. It couldn't be more obvious that all of the great \\"reviews\\" here are obviously written by the author himself and/or his friends and family. If it's the latter, it's nice that they are so supportive."},{"rating":"1","title":"been done","review":"Nice monster, moderate suspense, but it's been done. Sharks, whoopty-doo! Seventy feet? Wow that's that's uh, that's real big I'm sure. The bottom line is, Megaladon, as countless people seem to beleive (due to films and books like this), is not the largest, most powerful predator the world has ever seen. That would be LIOPLEURODON. At eighty feet long and weighing one hundred and fifty tons, it would make a snack out of the Megaladon sharks (who only grew to about sixty feet inlength). Liopleurodon was not only larger and stronger, it was probably smarter, I'm talking killer whale intelligence. All you have to do to imagine this guy is combine a crocodile and a killer whale, boost it's size up (waaaay up), give it a sixteen foot long skull, and you've got it. I'm extremely surprised no one has written a book about this true king of the deep. The good thing about this book is that it did involve a Kronosaurus, a smaller and less impressive cousin of Liopleurodon, in it's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to be a sequel?","review":"This is the first Steve Alten novel I ever read. I was in the airport in Portland, Maine getting ready to come home from a vacation. While browsing through the book store I picked up \\"The Trench\\" because the description sounded interesting. Talk about a pleasant surprise! I didn't even realize this was a sequel because so much pertinent detail was given. Of course, I had to find \\"Meg\\" as soon as I finished this one and that also was a great read.I don't read a great deal of novels but this one instantly hooked me on anything by Steve Alten. I have read most of his books multiple times (something I rarely do).Anything by this author is well researched and certainly exciting. Pick any Alten novel and I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST ANOTHER \\"JAWS\\" SHODDY REMAKE","review":"PROBABLY ONE OF HE WORST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. THE PLOT WAS PREDICTABLE WITH A HUGE, KILLER SHARK ON THE LOOSE. STEVE ALTEN HAS SOME INTERESTING IDEAS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN THE ABYSS COMBINED WITH THE WHOLE EVOLUTION CONCEPT. HOWEVER, I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO SAY A LITTLE TOO MUCH IN THIS BOOK. THE STORYLINE WAS VERY CHOPPY WHICH MADE FOR A RATHER BORING READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure, thriller, horror? Something for all.","review":"If you thought a 60 foot prehistoric ancestor to the great white shark in \\"MEG\\" was frightening then her 72 foot female offspring will have you glued to your seat reading through this fast paced thriller as the monster escapes and searches the coast lines for food. You literally cannot put the book down for fear you will spend the time worry about what will happen next. It's exciting and well written. And while all that is happening there is another plot taking place at the same time. Steve Alten manages to bring both together in an exciting conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, Suspense and a Little Mystery Makes Up The Trench","review":"The Trench is a great thriller that involves a larger shark than the one in Meg. There are plenty of action scenes where the shark, named \\"Angel,\\" attacks unsuspecting humans, and creatures! My favorite scene was the battle of the two titans of the sea, \\"Mad Max,\\" and \\"Angel.\\" Jonas goes through the weeks experiencing his nightmares unfold. A woman named Celeste tries to get close to Jonas, only to use him and ruin his marriage. But luckily Jonas has enough will power to the withstand her and keep himself from dieing in her trap. This book is a must read, for those who like a lot of action, suspense, and mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REWARDING READ","review":"Couldn't stop turning the pages, and was rewarded with one grisly scene after another. I loved it! Now, I'm hoping it'll be made into a movie so I can be scared senseless all over again. And, by the way, you don't need to read MEG first to enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellenty thought out sequel","review":"After writing the most expensive B-movie never made I wondered how Steve Alten could work a sequel out of his set-up ending from Meg. Quite well as it turns out.The narrative picks up four years later, with the baby Meg named Angel now overgrown and itching to escape as two nefarious scumbags have managed to wrest control of the Tanaka Institute from Maseo Tanaka and Jonas Taylor.Soon enough the shark does escape and Terry has become a prisoner of the book's real villian (Benedict Singer, an excellent piece of work cut from the James Bond supervillian cloth) in the deepest part of the Marianas Trench, where some other nasty monsters are lurking.The Trench will have you on the edge of your seat until the exciting conclusion. Highly recommended for monster buffs. Steve Alten sure knows how to write them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trench","review":"This book is one of the best ive read, and ive read quite a few. it has a lot of interesting twists and turns in the plot, keeping you interested. if theres one book to read at the beach this summer, this is it.

It gets two stars, only because I'm a sucker for deep ocean tales, and there's some interesting stuff there. Mind you, the prehistoric deep-sea dragons were a bit of a joke - well, the whole thing is a bit of a joke, and it must be hilarious to Mr. Alten, with ourselves as the butt thereof for buying this tosh. Never again (well, yes, OK, I said that last time too, but I have reformed, really, I have...I am cured, Hallelujah!).

A sequel to MEG (released 2 summers ago), THE TRENCH improves on the original in every way. The story telling is tighter, the main characters get more developed (though Mac needs more story time), and the ending is much more satisfying. Though I thought MEG was entertaining, I did have a few (minor) problems with it. Thankfully this sequel is better in every way. Maybe some day that movie version of MEG will get made just so we can see the finale of THE TRENCH appear on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"This book is a great sequel to \\"Meg\\". A real page turner with new twists and surprises. Professor Jonas Taylor returns in this book and so do his fears. A great combination of suspense and horror, you won't be able to put the book down. This book will make you think twice, or maybe three times, before going back into the ocean. Mr Alten's descriptive words paint very vivid pictures. This would make a SUPER big screen movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An author who is right up there with Crichton.","review":"Two years ago I read a review of \\"Meg\\" and had to buy the book.

I was thrilled to find out that there would be a sequel - \\"The Trench.\\"Hats off to Steve Alten who, once again, has done a superb job of getting and keeping his readers attention.I will admit to having become so interested in sharks after reading his books that I have contacted the Woods Hole Institute and am getting more information on sharks in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as MEG","review":"This book revolves around the offspring of the shark from the first book. The plots very interesting but it doesn't pack the same punch as MEG. This time they go down into the trench and encounter prehistoric marine lizards as well as giant, glowing great white sharks. >rolls eyes< I hate it when they try to cram too much into a story. It's still a good read. If you liked MEG then you'd like this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"First off I'd like to say that 1 star is far too gracious for Alten's gravest failure. This author made a substantial effort in trying to write a \\"so called\\" novel. This book was a complete and total blunder. I scorn Alten in his worst hour for this sorry excuse for a book. In this utter failure for a book I have found my mental capacity to be greatly diminished. At no point in this book was I at all surprised by a fact I didn't know. Alten tells of a prehistoric beast of a shark who ravages through its binds at the Tanaka Institute only to slaughter hundreds. I will not give away the end of this book in fear that it will make you vomit. Alten's gross use of sexual content was utterly disgusting and blatantly insulting. I wish I would never have wasted my time money and effort in reading this god-awful monstrosity of a \\"book.\\" May God have mercy on the reader's soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written jaws rip-off fluff","review":"The first half of the book is defensively written, trying to make up for the countless hilarious mistakes in MEG. The result is a slightly better written yet somehow flat story. But as long as shows like Power Rangers and Tellytubbys(spelling?)make it to the market so will milktoast drivel like this. It is clear that the author's primary experience with the sea is gazing through the glass of a fish tank(probably with thumb in mouth). At least Cussler was a real diver. This ain't Shakespeare for sure, but it's not even up to Free Willy's low standard.

I threw it away, so I can't sample the actual dialogue for you, but it sounds like it was written by a 13-year-old boy with a predilection for science-fiction and the martial arts. I'll approximate: \\"His name is Jonathan\\", Maysuhiro said, with wisdom shining from behind his old but still powerful eyes. \\"He is skilled in the arts of war, but prefers to impress with quotations in latin and french. He is not to be trusted, and may reveal dark recesses of psychosis when threatened.\\", blah blah blah, I'm not kidding. I can't begin to approximate the abysmal (ha!) nature of this book.

This is the Star Wars Episode One of the literary world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first one was better","review":"I really can't understand all of these great reviews. I mean, the book was so poorly written, it had to be rushed. I made it a third of the way through and I couldn't take it anymore. I just kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.The dialog in particular, was awful. People just don't talk to each other like that. And I know writers struggle with ways to tell the reader technical background while at the same time working it into the story, but this writer doesn't even try. And the characters, I didn't care about any of them. And why should I? They weren't believable, their back stories were far-fetched beyond belief. Did I mention the inane dialog?The first book was a good read, not great writing, but still enjoyable. This one was painful and embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve's next best","review":"Angel is back but there is more to the story then just that.

The subject matter was not an easy one to tackle, but I think Lowenthal did a great job of balancing each of the characters. While there is a main character, Jacob, the book is not entirely about him. I would not characterize this as a religious book, yet I feel I learned something about what it means to be Jewish through the story and dialogue. I also would not characterize this as a gay romance either, yet there were moments of feeling and physical passion to make the story appealing on that level too. For a first book, this is an impressive effort for Lowenthal and I enjoyed and finished reading this book much faster than I thought I would. It felt good."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellant read","review":"From start to finish the writer holds you with his tale of life. His Jewish background parallels so many of our lives that are gay and Jewish. Michael Lowenthal does a superb and gripping job of a not so uncommon struggle for today's gay Jewish male. Hopefully, he will continue the story where he leaves off, as he has left me hungry for more details of what happens between jacob/danny/jonathan/their father/aunt ingrid etc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are Gay and Jewish, it's a must read","review":"I liked this book for a few reasons... first of all, I too am gay and Jewish, and this book helped me look at some of the problems that I have rectifying those disparate elements of my life. And thank goodness for \\"gay fiction\\" (althought I hate to pigeonhole) that does not solely exist to complain about AIDS. Second of all, it's a well written book. It ranges from funny to serious and heart-rending. The prose is eloquent, not superfluous, and it is, overall, an enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting variant of the story of Jacob & Esau","review":"I enjoyed this book, although I certainly agreed with prior Amazon.com readers who thought it would have been better had the author developed the story from Jonathan's point of view as well as Jacob's; otherwise, it might have worked better had it been written in the 1st person from Jacob's point of view. I had a striking insight, though, when I attended services at NY's gay synagogue the same day I finished reading the book, and the rabbi delivered a sermon on the portion of the week: Jacob & Esau. It struck me quite forcibly, especially with Papa Isaac and the younger twin being named Jacob, that Lowenthal may have gotten some of his inspiration for this book from the Bible story. So, not perfect, but certainly interesting. Some of the set pieces (like the Coffeemate story) are truly hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible the first time, but it almost grows on you","review":"When I first read this book, I thought it was the worst thing I had ever read. But thinking it over, I realize it does have some good points, and I give Lowenthal credit for trying. I htink the thing that bothered me the most was the overuse of metaphors-and bad ones at that. The book is full of them! I agree with the other reviewer in that it should have been written in the first person. The third person pov takes this intensely personal story and makes it into a movie of the week sort of deal. You can't get into the characters heads, understand their motives. I also found the ending to be a little bit too neat and tidy. After hundreds of pages of arguments and strife, Jacob and Jonathan suddenly just patch things up with hardly any discussion or adressing the issues between them. Again, it's like a movie of the week. Lowenthal has a lot of potential-I hope he realizes it on his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"There is no real story here.

Excellent Horror Film !","review":"Stuart Gordon's \\"Castle Freak\\" is a fun and creepy classic. I personally love this flick. The acting is well done, the story is quite a chiller and the \\"Freak\\" has got to be one of the most ghastly, realistc & underrated monsters within the world of horror films. There is a sprinkle of cheese on top of what is mostly a solid substance filled scary movie. I also enjoy the straight fowardness of it. What I mean is with Re-Animator we get zombies(not real) and with From Beyond we get fantasy horror(again not real) but with Castle Freak, although it has some illogical cheesy-ness mixed in, it also is very believable/conceivable that the going's on in this movie could really happen.

A little sex, nudity and violence (very little) make some scenes worth the price of admission, but they are brief and not well acted. Jessica Dollarhide (playing the blind daughter) could have saved the film, but she never even lost her bra, let alone her virtue. If you are REALLY into old \\"B\\" horror flicks, this one is a MUST. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Gordon's finest","review":"I think this great little film is up there with Stuart Gordon's other two finest films : Re-animator and Dagon. Very, very gruesome in places but it's clever in the way that Gordon manipulates the viewer into feeling some sympathy for the pathetic creature of the title. I like the look and feel of this little gem too."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHIP ME BEAT ME HURT ME","review":"Ten minutes into the film I was bored with the formulaic writing. Monster child chained in castle. Owner dies. New owner comes in with a blind daughter. Monster child takes a shine to the blind daughter, although the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" aspect doesn't blossom. Toss in a few sidetracks and you have a very boring film. I prefer the American version of this type of film.Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb, sex, nudity.

If you like Jeffrey Combs in Re-Animator and From Beyond and you're expecting that caliber of horror, prepare to be disappointed. This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. It's just not scary, and most of it feels like a Days of Our Lives-esque soap with all the boring dialogue between Barbara Crampton and Jeff Combs. Combs has a drinking problem and killed their son in a drunk driving accident, this boring subplot dominates the tension for most of the film and I simply DID NOT CARE. When the freak actually does show himself, the film places all of the shock factor on the fact that he has no \\"private parts.\\" Lame, avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie if gross is what you are going for....","review":"This is purely a video for those of you who enjoy gross special effects.

Only one really bloody scene is worth watching...not because of the blood, not because of the gore.....just, because it is the only bloody scene in the movie...a nice looking woman is eaten by the \\"castel freak\\".....If you have seen Re-animator, The Evil dead, From Beyond, Hellraiser and maybe The Thing, then skip this one..you will be disapointed like me....Even a John Woo action movie has more blood in it....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mip","review":"Hey!

Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick \\"The Unnamable\\", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I came to this book after reading The King David Report, and found it stylistically similar but considerably more subtle in its subject matter. Through three interconnected narratives Heym poses a number of questions, chief among them being in what way and to what extent an individual is responsible for their own actions. The characterisation is beautifully observed; his Jesus is indecisive and pathetic, his Lucifer intelligent, sympathetic, generous and even moral. As with The King David Report, his ability to highlight human weaknesses is employed to great effect. Few writers place you so effectively inside the minds of their anti-heroes. It is a wonderful book, by virtue both of the story itself and of the ideas that underlie it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Clip Sucks!","review":"This case is attractive with all the right cutouts.

I would rather it had been broader. When it comes to collecting dust and wood chips they seldom go in such a small area as this. It should be broader and the sides more gently sloped toward the central hole.

This album is a classic of the pre-Beatles era! It is to the Boomer generation what Glenn Miller was to our parents. It first appeared in our house in the original vinyl version around 1964. I still have that original, albeit, badly scratched and abused from being played on everything from a late 40's Hi-Fi (before Stereo) to that ubiquitous plastic portable record player that every preteen owned. This album, Jan & Dean, & Roy Orbison were the early 1960's. The Beach Boys didn't hit the Midwest until after the Beatles. It was played everywhere from the laundrymat to the local Root Beer stands.

I highly, highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever! Couldnt even finish it!","review":"First off, this book started off great. Laughed my butt off the first couple of chapters. Once you get about a quarter of the way into it, u get the sudden urge to want to punch the author for his incredibly annoying writing skills. Every single sentence started to become long and completely over analyzed. Totally reaching when it came to attempted humor. Ive read a lot of books on the lives of runners. Some were funny, some instructional, and some just stories on their lives. He attempted all 3, and failed miserably. Mr. Bob Shwartz needs to put that dictionary away because his attempt at sounding intelligent made him more or less sound like a moron. This book kind of reminds me of college days when writing a term paper consisted of an extreme amount of adjectives just to meet that certain page quota. Im thinking he should get an award for the most run on sentences within a chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Schrader's best film","review":"This movie is hard to take at times.

I had hoped to see more tutorials on how to \\"perfect\\" a 3D female form, or human form in general, using applications like: Lightwave, Max, Maya and Softimage etc. with a heavy focus on anatomy. Instead, the bulk on this book is filled with Photoshop detailing techniques used to create a single STILL!!! image/scene and a gallery with many images that were obviously done in Poser and not very original. There are, in my opinion, better 3D anatomy tutorials around the web than in this book if you are interested in perfecting the art of building a realistic human figure.

Each chapter was a page or two, followed by a quote (from the book) in bold type, followed by a blank page, followed by the next chapter...You get the idea. Another major gripe: this book was filled with typographical errors. Virtually every page had one, or several typos. I guess the main idea of Mr. Colt was, 'get this thing printed and sold'.

Believe me, it does. It seems that the author has a vast command of the obvious and inane, though not so much so that he does not have to resort to unusual spacing and a number of blank pages at the end to fill 139 pages in this slim and vacuous volume. If self-help is involved then possibly the only person on the planet that could benefit from reading this book would be the author.

This game clearly does not utilize the full potential of what the PS2 can accomplish. The voice-acting where horribly done, and the graphics appear like the lowly N64 could've pulled it off. The story wasn't that great either, and this is a key aspect in creating a good rpg. The battle system however, worked fairly well. It provides a nice change from the average \\"stand still, attack, move back to position, wash, rinse, repeat.\\" It did, however, move a bit too slow for me.

Just remember, Walmart is the largest corporation in the world and they don't sell to the affluent. There's an old adage in sales that says \\"sell to the classes, live with the masses.

Due to stylistic sloppiness, the read is unintentionally ridiculous on almost every page, greatly damaging the suspension of disbelief for this true story. By avoiding character complexity, Carlson attempts to create mythological prototypes, but falls short of bringing the book to the level of an epic.

Into This Air was an extremely well written account of a similar type expedition by a seasoned author, but this book just doesnt add up.

The audio CDs were of similarly poor audio quality, and thus quite unsuitable for language acquisition. The book is bulky and cumbersome. The CDs just repeat phrases over and over.

Unfortunately, I just didn't like this book. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly why, but I just didn't find it either amusing or entertaining. It was an almost non-stop rant, both bleak and depressing. Occasionally the Irish slang was offputting, but I overcame that as I went along. There were many times that I just wanted to throw it against the wall and not finish it, but I felt a duty to see it through if I wanted to write a review. The one good thing about this book is that it was fairly short, so I didn't waste a lot of time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Do I start???","review":"First thing I noticed about this tool rig was the weight of it, or should I say lack there of!!! With this full of my tools, hammer, 35' tape, speed square, utility knife, chisel, screwdriver,torpedo level,cats paw, and nails, it stills weighs less than the Dewalt leathers I owned before.Next thing I liked is the barrel bags feature itself. I am a fan of just dropping my belt and getting to break as quick as possible, and I haven't dumped any nails yet. Big difference in comparison again.These bags were recommended to me by another carpenter, and I got to admit, great call on his part. The bags are very well made, with plenty of storage spots, and easy to get stuff out of.The only negative I can even think of is there is no hammer loop in the back of the belt. But you can purchase one seperately, and that problem is solved. Or you can just get used to grabbing your hammer from the loop provided.A great deal for the price, I STRONGLY recommend them to anyone looking for a new rig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"When i purchased this controller, i was expecting it to have a nice grip and a comfortable hand position.

It came with a free game and a starter pack. Of course the Cubicon controller was in the starter pack. At first, the Cubicon was all I used, but then I actually tried the Nintendo brand controller that came in the Gamecube box. I am glad I tried it! Because when I tried the Nintendo brand one, I was amazed! It felt so much better than the Cubicon! One reason why I hate the Cubicon is because the B button is down too low and when you reach for it the C stick gets in the way! The reason I gave it 2 stars was because it has a rubber grip on it (I like grips). But now I don't even touch the thing! It is a waste of money!!!!! DONT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you have a lot of cash $$$","review":"When I first got this controller I thought is was good, cheap, and better for my big hands.

The interesting of this book is that it was written during the 1970s running boom and has much of the spirit of running that inspired many runners through the last 30 years. Jim Fixx and its history deserves the honor of having his book bought and his knowledge preserved. Good for beginners and intermediate runners. If you are a pro-runner, I believe you don't need to buy it, because you already have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and hugs!","review":"I ordered this on the night of October 1st and got it into me on the 4th.

Unlike all other golf books, this one isn't trying to improve your swing, but instead improve your enjoyment of the game. The pressure to perform like Tiger makes many of us forget to enjoy the game for its recreational value and the pleasure of being outdoors. The book encourages golfers to forget their score and concentrate on those things that have made golf such a popular sport.I especially liked all the old photographs, postcards, and golf history spread throughout the book; it makes it fun for even non-golfers (my wife!). The book is a refreshing look at golf. The authors have a good sense of humor, and a love of the game.

The first few tales are very, very good. Towards the end of the book, Sade loses steam, but that doesn't mean that the stories are any less imaginative. I guess I thought it was hard to follow up \\"Florville and Courval\\".I would definitely recommend reading the \\"essay on novels\\" thoroughly before reading the stories. Also, read the explanatory notes! Sometimes, it is trivial biographical/historical information, but occasionally there is some very insightful analysis of the text that help explain the point Sade is trying to make. A few of the devices that Sade employs will seem like cliches, but it should be kept in mind that much of his writing is reactionary.Finally, his stories should also be read in the context of France immediately after the revolution. As the biography points out, Sade escaped the guillotine on a technicality. Hence his disillusionment with liberal republican ideals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"This is better than the last book I read of Marquis de Sade's.

The suspense is psychological as well as the norm, and the characters feel like real people. (Okay, except for Amber and PJ. Having one of them would be fine, but both of them together is just over-the-top.) And there are some seriously screwed-up teens, like the \\"ghost groupies\\".

Strangely, unlike most American military writers, the Germans rarely use blasphemy to express themselves and this book is no exception. Very interesting read and at times fairly funny. Gives lots of insights in the Third Reich and its internal political struggles. Although, Skorenzy comes across as a gentlemen and an intellectual-he's eloquent even in a foreign language- one wonders what his SS training/indoctrination was like and what became of the hate that was the hallmark of the nazi party. But overall very very good read. It also gives the reader an interesting view of which Allied leaders the Germans respected and feared and which ones they didnt. It also makes some interesting comments on which Allied technology the Germans admitted was better than theirs. One interesting point, the Germans had a plane called the Fielser Storch which could take off or land in roughly 20 yards. You can see one do both of those feats on youtube."},{"rating":"1","title":"While once a great resource, information is now dated.","review":"This book was great during the 1997 time period when it was first published.

The boy's teacher, Mrs. Green, was infamous for being an unpleasant teacher, and he dreams that she eats and dismembers parts of her students' bodies. The boy was more than happy to wake up and realize that his teacher was just a nice, normal, friendly young lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting","review":"Parents beware! This message of fear of the unknown can be given in infinitely better ways. The writing style is for a very young child. However, before you find out the main character is having a dream, children in his class have been beheaded, half eaten, turned to ashes, entirely eaten and \\"is digesting\\", or had a head shrunk to the size of a pin (picture given of small head on girl's body). At naptime the teacher says \\"Everyone who still has one, put your head on your desk.\\"I do not find this flight of fantasy amusing. Where, one might wonder, did this boy become exposed to such violent images? This book is more likely to create new fears for your children, than to calm their fears.I also reacted a little to the teacher ending up as a blond with, if not blue eyes (they are just black dots), then blue eye shadow.Violence and stereotyping. Worst children's book I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for 5 year olds!","review":"As a parent of a 5 year old I was shocked when the teacher sent this home for reading homework. A child this age doesn't need to see images of a child without a head, or half a body, or being consumed by fire. My child has a great respect for teachers. Just because a teacher doesn't look like the supposed all-American female doesn't mean she's going to be a monster. Do we want to teach our children fear of teachers? The age rating on this book is too young. We're the kind of parents who screen T.V., movies and even commercials. Violence in the media is rampant.

It gave an opportunity to explain how rumours start and how older kids might exaggerate facts and for them not to be afraid or apprehensive about their schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate content for young children","review":"My son who is in kindergarten, was upset and freaked out about this book. Apparently his class watched it as a video in class and he was so disturbed by the story that he could barely fall asleep tonight. Apparently some kids and parents think this book is funny- but it had the opposite affect in our house. When he was telling me about the story, I had a hard time believing he really watched what he was describing. I did a general google search on \\"teacher blowing fire at kids\\" and this book popped up right away. I knew immediately he was describing this book- no one could make this up. Obviously the author had intentions in his writing other than to freak kids out, but for some, that is the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you gave this a 1 star rating you're missing the point.","review":"This book is tongue in cheek. It doesn't intend to instill fear of teachers at all. If, as a 1st grader, when I read this for the first time that I was able to comprehend that then I am sure these delightful children with parents that overshelter them can as well. If your child can't handle the content of this book then you might as well revoke them reading Shel Silverstein, Jack Prelutzky, Robert Munsch and many other great children's authors.

Roberts researched the subject by interviewing dozens of elderly women and men, and she includes long quotations that lend poignancy to her work.

I don't use it all that often, though since it's annoying to clean (I'm not sure if it's dishwasher-safe, but I don't have a dishwasher anyway, so it takes a couple minutes). It's really convenient for chopping a lot of garlic, or a lot of spicy peppers (to avoid getting the oil on your hands). For anything larger, though, you've got to cut it into small enough chunks for it to fit into the chopper, which is annoying. Still, if I'm chopping 3 onions, I'd rahter use this than go by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garlic chopper","review":"I bought this chopper because my household LOVES garlic.

I don't like biting into ginger chunks, and had trouble mincing the ginger small enough by hand. I was trying to avoid yet another electric gadget, so picked this item up at the hardware store. Yes, it minced the ginger, after SEVERAL press-and-lift motions. Definitely NOT a timesaver. Then I tried it for garlic, with the same result. My last try was with fresh cilantro - what a mess. Again, it took forever, and did more bruising than chopping. I wound up finishing up with the knife after all. The blades just seem way too dull to do a good job.

What a letdown. This chopper will only let you chop 1/4 to 1/2 of a *small* onion. Put in anything more than that and it will jam. I needed to chop four onions for a recipe (the electric food processor chops too finely for this). By the time I had cut the onions into small enough pieces for this chopper I felt like I'd done half the work myself. And each time I added fresh onion I had to dump the first batch out, and it wasn't so easy to get the lid off, and half the time this plastic part that goes over the blade would fall out. This product is extremely frustrating to use.

I couldn't put it down, and had to go take a long swim after completing it! I am not involved in swimming, but my kids do compete in sports, and if their coaches were ever accused of what Natalie's coach was, I think I would be a little skeptical of the coach instead of calling the writer a liar.I have read other copied of Silver's books, and I find him to be a fine writer indeed.(As far as what Water Baby said): Maybe the Terrapins should invest more time into practicing to be as good as Natalie instead of spending so much time on message boards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Girl","review":"This book provides a very unique perspective of women swimming. The book brings forward, briefly, problems such as eating disorders and weight management that afflict females swimmers.

It portrays very positively the swimming lifestyle as well as the early burnout of young swimmers. It is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Book","review":"This book, written by Micheal Silver, is poorly researched and very one-sided. The book tells a tall-tale about a famous Olympian's path to Olympic Glory. Rather than speaking about high points in her career she instead tears down organizations and people. Also, the book tends to go off on tangents that have nothing to do with the Olympian's story. The story is over-dramatized and only shows that the young woman is selfish and ungrateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I have rarely read a more poorly written or researched book. I am convinced that the eyes of an editor never saw a page of this book. Mr. Silver repeats himself over and over and often contradicts himself. It would be laughable if that were the only flaw.As the parent of two swimmers, I have followed Natalie's career eagerly and thrilled at her successes. After reading Golden Girl, I didn't even like her! She is portrayed as a whiney, vindictive ingrate who blames everyone around her for the misfortunes of life. The sense you get is that she is totally self involved and though her teammates may respect her abilities, she certainly has very few friends.I was looking for an inspirational book for my kids to read. Not only would I not give it to them I tossed it in the trash. I would be horrified for the Natalie portrayed in this book to be used as a role model by either of my children.For those looking for an inspirational book on swimming I recommend Gold in the Water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fools Gold","review":"Michael Silvers book is an unfair account of the sport of swimming and it's training methods which have been used for years by coaches at all levels in this country and abroad. I didn't see anything in his book where he credits any individual or organization for information which leads me to believe that his work is unsubstantiated. He also sensationalized a story that is not one that only Natalie Coughlin could tell. Many high level athletes have injuries they \\"come back\\" from.

There is little doubt as to why there are no footnotes, the book is not based upon fact. It is purely a work of fiction at its worst. It is a character assasination of James Longstreet and certainly not worth the time required to read. I found no redeeming qualities whatsoever in this compilation of half-truths, inuendos and outright lies based solely upon an agenda to rake a historical name through the muck and an attempt to shift all the blame for Gettysburg, indeed the entire war, onto Longstreet. If you wish to read about general Longstreet, I suggest your time be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Cause Biography","review":"The first major book written about General Longstreet, it is an adequate read, but A.J. Eckenrode's bias against Longstreet is pretty strong and not particularly objective at this stage of the game. The author was definitely influenced by the anti-Longstreet writings of the time. More objective biographies and other books on Longstreet have been written in recent decades, with more research to boot. I found some of the explanations of the complex battles wanting. If you have a good working knowledge of the big battles you will find things missing in this book with a few of confusing narratives. Unless you are one to own every book on a particular figure in the war, this one is not a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent if dated biography of James Longstreet","review":"This biography of Longstreet was written in 1936 during a time when Longstreet's career was still causing controversy.

Overall the book was enjoyable to read and even though it was dated in some areas it was still a well written book.

The pin spanner is only one size, which runs the risk of being useless if the bottom bracket needs a different size - a much better option is buying the Park Tool adjustable pin spanner, which fits every size. As for the other end, I give the same alternative to the headset wrench: a 12 - 15 inch adjustable wrench that has the added leverage to produce much more torque on extremely tight bottom bracket cups.Again, if you work on bottom brackets frequently or simply have money to waste, then buy it.

IT WORKS.","review":"This book tells you what you need to know to accomplish any of the following- or any combination thereof:1) Lose fat2) Increase the size of your muscles3) Increase your strength.One important fact to understand is that while working out often seeks to accomplish all of the above, there are some trade-offs and which goal you would like to hit the most depends on the types of exercises you do, how frequently, etc. This book explains it in a nice, easy-to-understand way, and to be honest I got in amazing shape going to the gym TWICE A WEEK with this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid information","review":"This is a straight foreword meat and potatos kind of program flexible enough to last a lifetime. I have two B.S. degrees one in physical education and the other in sports medicine. I worked in physical therapy field for over 4 years. The gym is probably the greatest place to get the worst possible advice on strength training. This is a great book based on proven science and avoids the \\"miracle program dogma\\". Although Schuler's prose can be a little silly at times it is based on tons of reseach facts. This will remain in my library for regular use and reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"No gimmick, just results","review":"In a world filled with unrealistic training routines written by internet gurus who've never really trained anyone, it's great to see some legit, effective program design from a guy who's been there and done it at a high level like Alwyn. A year's worth of training programs by one of the top trainers in the country for about $20. No brainer.Lou's conversational writing style takes the science and makes it understandable for any level of education. If you read this book, I'm certain you'd have a stronger grasp of the the science and methods of building muscle and losing fat than most personal trainers.Buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logical Extension of T-A-P","review":"I've read and enjoyed several of Lou's other books, I like his style of writing and find his work entertaining and informative. This book, to me, is the logical successor to his popular Testosterone Advantage plan. The diet advice and planing is similar but updated, and the exercise plans follow a similar periodization scheme. Fat loss circuit, Hypertrophy, and low reps for strength. While there is a break in routine, I would not recommend this book to some one who has not worked out regularly for at least six months. But for some one looking to move from beginner to intermediate, or an intermediate looking for a change of pace, this would be an outstanding resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Page 13. of the book, \\"when I conceived this book I had a brilliant premise: I would take every excersive in the gym and look at it in terms of possible role in human movemement.\\" Then later goes on on to list the moves they think are important, even debating what should be included. There is no scientific method to this, only apparently two individuals conceiving an idea for a book. I'm sure there strength books are good, but this a \\"me too\\" book on core performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with the book.","review":"I was expecting this to be an easy read and easy to follow workout program,but this was not the case.They gave you workouts telling you to do 2or3 or4 times a week and this was misleading. Im more advanced and wasent sure what to do. I would stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No usefull information","review":"This book has very little useful information in it. It proposes a bunch of exercises based on \\"natural\\" everyday movements and discourages focused single muscle exercises or anything involving sitting (i.e. rowing). NO SCIENCE nor does the author quote any studies to support his exercises.Author is not an expert nor a real body builder. Co-author might be but is pretty uninvolved in writing the book.Big print. Lots of words. Nothing useful to a beginner or a pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is the worse bodybuilding book that I have ever read it's garbage.

Second simply define full rest superset in one sentance! The Author seems to know he goofed and then goes on this scatterbrained tirade about people not having basic information. lol Quit the bs dude and simply define your terms!! I still can't make out from your scatterbrained english (no not having basic subject verb predicate sentances does not make you seem 'in the know). Who has gotten ripped from this plan? Has the author? Or is this another pseudo science money making essay??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, informative, concise, witty...","review":"About the only thing that could have made this book the perfect purchase would have been an included CD-ROM/DVD with video of what some of the more complex moves really look like in motion. Aside from that, the principles are articulated with wit and clarity. Read this book, never do another boring bicep curl, and make working out fun and challenging once more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for motivation but actually learned something","review":"I bought a copy of Beyond Brawn from McRoberts and was hesitant to buy this book because of the writing style and extreme abbreviated routines promoted. This book recommends excercises I can accomplish and get results.Going from leg extensions, leg press, and leg curls to barbell squats, deadlifts and lunges is like starting over. I got joint soreness initially I have not felt since I started lifting a year ago. Felt burn deeper in muscle when I lifted weights too. Need to have maturity to start at low weights with good form.Watching guys lift 7 1/2- 45 pond plates on a hammer strength machine with 50% range of motion is actually funny as he mentioned! Written with some wit that makes reading enjoyable.I really do believe the squat excercises made me constantly hungry and was able to eat protein required easily. Never used drugs and others should not too. I think the avergae trainee only needs barbell squats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really loved it","review":"I am an experienced lifter and i am always trying to learn more.

So he was grateful when this book came along and inspired his routine. Good for the man who doesn't really know what he wants to do next in the gym and is a little stuck in the rut. Works out all the major muscle groups and includes cardio (interval) training on the off days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I wish I'd been read up on the Kindle return policy.A fair amount of the movements were flat out silly like, and I am not kidding here, a barbell lunge with the barbell held not on the shoulders but under the groin.Not to mention conflicting information such as why you should always squat to parallel (which is true BTW) then a few pages later describing how to get used to heavier squat loads by doing quarter squats (ie above parallel). So don't do shallow squats because it's hard on your knees, unless you're going to do it with really heavy weight?Save your money and pick up Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe instead, it'll get you sorted on the important compound movements for strength, muscle mass, and health and spare you the silly BS."},{"rating":"2","title":"new rules of lifting","review":"excellent, Great sence of humor,instructive and has more excersises you can do in a life time,good for self improvement.Realistic and clear for the lifter(non profesional) and resourcefull for the professional.Pleasant to read throught.I really have enjoyed this excellent buyIgnacio Salzman MD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, well written","review":"I like the information. It's straightforward and honest. AND FUNNY! The author is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent approach to fitness, strength and health","review":"The writing is very conversational and the information will probably surprise a lot of people that have been \\"lifting\\" for many years. But \\"New Rules\\" is an excellent book on what people really know about building complete, strong, functional bodies.You'll find a lot of commonality, and some differences in approaches, with the methods in books like \\"Outside Fitness\\", \\"Core Performance\\", and \\"Muscle Logic\\". All of these are excellent as well and fundamentally get down to similar ideas of building strength and stability.Like other reviewers I loved the routines and thinking behind them in New Rules. Outside Fitness uses a similar approach as do some other books but New Rules takes a different approach and the writing style if great. I am looking forward to many months of fun applying the routines and enjoying this book again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready to wade through a TON of info","review":"It was way longer than it needed to be, imo.

The Stage 1s were great. Very good at keeping odors in - not much on the smelly side. Unfortunately it seems that the Stage 1s are being discontinued and we are left with these refills that we have tried, but we couldn't have the Diaper Genie in the same room with us because of the very strong odor of these refills!

Because Kahn is now 81 years old, the story of his life and careers spans several important art movements including Color Field and Abstract Expressionism. Early on he was a teaching assistant for Hans Hoffmann, and his contemporaries include Larry Rivers and Jane Frielicher. Anyone interested in art will learn a lot in a pleasurable way by reading this book. And the paintings are luscious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf Kahn by Justin Spring","review":"I love the paintings of Wolf Kahn. The book was exactly what I had hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf Kahn","review":"This is such a beautiful book and the text is very informative in so many ways. It tells of his life and mentors and it tells about how his works have developed. I love this artist and knew nothing about him so this is just perfect to have the gorgeous paintings so perfectly reproduced and the history of his life too. After seeing a video of Wolf Kahn in which he tells us he is suffering from Macular Degeneration and so he has had to let go of some of the preciseness of his paintings; he gives the viewer a gift in that we must look at each painting harder and deeper.

The hotel recommendations are the worst part of the book, most of the hotels on the list are major chains and the author doesn't seem to have ever stayed in most of them, and the descriptions mention that some of them are overpriced and dirty. This book was a complete waste of money. Also, the author does not provide website addresses for many of the listings, only phone numbers. I had to buy another book in order to find a hotel that was under $400 per night that wasn't a major chain, youth hostel, or YMCA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Amy Correia has a voice so unique and perfect. I am in love.Too bad more people have not discovered this true artist.Lakeville is a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"I, too, can't bear the bad consumer reviews! This is an amazing CD. I also am in love with \\"Carnival Love,\\" her first CD and adore the fact that these two CDs are entirely different. On \\"Lakeville,\\" Amy shows us -- much like Sam Phillips, the goddess of all music -- that not everyone needs perfection in a CD -- the voice can crack, the guitar-playing can be wobbly, but we are hearing the heart, so to speak, of that performer. We are hearing a moment in time. There are some songs on this CD that bring me to tears -- just simply 'cause they're beautiful and capture a fleeting feeling or moment. There isn't a bad song on here. Amy is a smashing new talent (I have also seen her live, and it's one of the best shows you'll ever see) -- thank goodness she created \\"Lakeville\\" and is sharing it with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unknown talent","review":"I saw Amy live last weekend in Anaheim, and I must say, she is so great live. I wasn't into her music at first, but I was drawn in and now can't stop listening!Amy has a way of transporting you to another place in her songs. They convey the feelings that we have all had at one time or another. I thoroughly enjoy her music, and am delighted that I stumbled upon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waters don't always run deep","review":"In response to those who think that the less than favorable reviews of Lakeville are somehow tied to expectations of a recycling of Carinval Love -- I say baloney! (though I never eat the stuff)At least in my case, I'm giving this album two stars because it is dull, dull, DULL - and I'm a guy who likes dull. Heck, I read Thomas Hardy for FUN. I expected the unique arrangements and the fascinating storylines of songs like Carnie's \\"The Bike\\", but they are almost entirely absent. In trying to sand off the rough edges, Lakeville leaves us with a pile of dust. I love her voice, and gosh knows I have listened to Lakeville several times over the past few months, hoping it would grow on me the way Carnival Love did (an album which I disliked so much the first time I heard it that I darn near tossed it out the window). I don't mean to be, well, mean, and I fully expect that she will not disappoint with her future work, but I was not at all taken with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring & Brilliant!","review":"Brian Doerksen needs no rating as he is beyond the need :) Once again he's written and performed such soul stirring music!

Elswhere manual appears to contradict itself: on p. 47 it says that \\"you cannot clone a volume over a network, but on the following page it appears to tell you how to do so.But my main concern what appears to be non-existent support. There is evidently no telephone support. The Intego web site has provision for requesting on-line support.

It is not a book about \\"whining\\"-it is a book about emotional honesty and growth. I love Ms. Mori's writing and this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All of her books are the same story","review":"I greatly enjoyed the book \\"Yarn-Remembering the Way Home\\" but all the books that Kyoko has written are the same thing-whether fiction or nonfiction. They're about her mother's suicide, how Koyko felt, moving to the U.S., etc. Reading about it once was enjoyable. Reading the same story in all of her books is very redundant. Kyoko obviously has many emotional issues concerning her childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence Steming From a Honest Understanding of Life","review":"This book may have alot of mixed reviews but, it is a honest work! The author does not mask emotions in order to make the reader feel comfortable. While reading this work you may feel as if you are on an emotional joyride. However, this is an account of a highly personal experience. One that may help you put things into perspective by comparison. This book does not suggest a way for the reader to discern her life. It simply invites the reader to explore through her eyes. Wonderfully written!! Highly expressive. A must read for anyone who may wish to understand Japanese/American insight. The same review can be made for Polite Lies. You absolutely will not feel the reading of either books to be a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book of whine","review":"I sympathize with Kyoko Mori's troubling childhood, but enough is enough. She whines, wimpers and complains throughout the entire book, and demonstrates neither compassion nor maturity. Halfway through the book, I began to wonder when the \\"breakthrough\\" would come. The answer comes in the final pages, when she throws away a arguably ugly piece of jewelry given to her by her hated stepmother--the \\"breakthrough\\" would never come. I began to tire of the author's consistent whining, moaning, complaining and self-pity. Many women have had troubled childhoods, Ms. Mori, and they have managed to get on with their lives. Your inability to do so was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional and Provocative","review":"The Dream of Water\\" was chosen by my teacher to read in our 12th grade English class. There was a big gap between those who loved it and those who thought it was simply a waste of time. People who enjoyed the book really got into the story right away. It's not a very difficult book to read. However, if after reading a few chapters, it seems boring, I suggest finding a different book to read.I think it is wonderfully written, very provocative. Kyoko has a way of writing that engages the readers. Her emotions are expressed very strongly and magnificently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read slowly to savor","review":"This is a book I relish so much, I limit myself to a chapter a day just to stretch out the enjoyment and savor each sentence. I am an American who has lived in Japan for seven years, and it is so interesting to see the view through her eyes -- she really does capture aspects of Japanese culture that are below the surface, not normally visible, but nonetheless palpable. This girl definitely has a way with words!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Japan-bashing!","review":"She totally bashes the Japanese country, culture, and family.

It is totally not worth the money that was spent on it and I would not recommend it to anyone. I felt compelled to review it so that someone else doesn't make the same mistake. I assume that for $5 more, maybe $10, a cake pan that does the job it's supposed to.I didn't experience anything in regards to the cake falling apart, but this experience certainly wasn't like with my last bundt pan that met an untimely demise.

This band is more than a nostalgic act...it is a viable group with valid things to say musically. They belong alongside any top act currently performing. If you get to see them on their current American tour, don't pass up the opportunity. This DVD, which I purchased along with the CD set when it first came out, is a first class document of this wonderful band. High caliber performances and fine recording quality. Of all the remaining British Invasion bands, the Zombies, along with the Moody Blues, are simply the best. Pick up this set for a truly great listening and viewing experience. Fine, fine stuff, indeed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"How wonderful to see this classy group perform live. Colin Blunstone's breathy tenor is still swoony, Rod Argent's keyboard work is still exceptional, and it is a tearful joy to hear those magnificent \\"Odessey & Oracle\\" tunes, which--as Mr Argent points out--were never performed live back in the Sixties. Technically, it's great: there is little of the frantic, jump-cut editing that spoils most concert videos these days; well-lit; clear sound. Every Zombies fan should get this, even the abridged American version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I love the 60's music and this really brings me back to my childhood. This was and is one of my favorite groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there","review":"I expected more. Many of the DVDs that I have purchased of classic bands have been a joy. This one falls short. Yes the band still has a jazzy style and play a number of great hits. The musicianship however is without emotion. That would be acceptable. The lead vocal is painful to listed to . Off key on its own but ruins the harmonies. Many of the songs just had to be skipped over. Usually I play concerts many times. This one will sit forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE TRY, BUT.....","review":"I love the Zombies. loved them since I heard Summertime on one of their first albums in 1966. They had a pop jazz groove that was unique. Argent and Blunstone made magic. They had sidemen that complemented their song writing.Their live concert is marred, no, ruined, by the rechanneling of Led Zep's Bonzo on drums that is all pounding and no nuance. The drummer, son of the guitarist, leaves no space silent. You hear every cymbal, tom tom, bell, etc that he has all the time. The music deserves a better hand than this 4/4 head banger can manage. He finally gets it for summertime, last song, when he is mercifully behind the song.I'd like to hear more of the guitarist and the bassist, but the drums fill the tracks. Other than that, Colin and Rod do as best they can to make themselves heard over the din.Skip this one. Except for the rave up on She's Not There, all these songs are better done elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very unusual","review":"I bought this item for my husband it was a story he read as a child and he has good memories of it.

Upon receipt I opened several. Each had clearly visible thin spots as well as many pulled threads. I was very disappointed and shipped them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!","review":"This is NOT a high-end luxury towel by Grand Patrician and is not ultra in ANY way. Even if they were firsts, they are second rate. Mine started to self-destruct after the first wash, and never had the absorbency of a wet dish rag.Am disappointed Amazon would carry this product, which would be a bad deal at half the price. Next time I will look for more reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great towels, big soft - don't smell","review":"We got these towels because our regular Fieldcrest towels got musty smelling and nothing would wash away the smell. It's the first time I've had that problem, and living in dry So Cal you don't expect problems like that. But anyway, these towels are large and soft and we like them very much. The worst thing was no matching bathmat, just bath rugs. But I found a mat that matches perfectly at Linens & Things, same Supima cotton and everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Free","review":"This is an amazing herbal supplement! I was experiencing gall bladder irritation/attack and it was recommended for that. I did the protocol for 2 weeks, then a liver flush. I released dozens of stones with no pain.

I cannot express how pleased I am with this purchase! Although I was reluctant to pay a premium price for a sterling and semi-precious locket, the craftsmanship is marvelous and the chain by itself would cost $25.00 or more in any jewelry shop.This is truly an heirloom quality piece. Again, I am so happy I went again and purchased a locket by Anatoli... it makes everything look cheap and silly by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice item!","review":"The BIGtrack has a 3 inch trackball which makes it the largest trackball available. The large ball requires less fine motor control than a standard trackball and it is ruggedly built. It has a left and a right mouse click button located behind the trackball to avoid unwanted mouse clicks. The BIGtrack also allows for 2nd Mouse Connection both the BIGtrack and a second mouse can be connected allowing simultaneous participation. The bright large 3\\" trackball helps to make mouse movements easy and accurate. While the oversized buttons make mouse clicks simple for those with poor motor control. For even more access the BIGtrack is available in a switch adapted version. The switch adapted BIGtrack comes with two standard 1/8\\" plugs for two switches. Its left and right mouse clicks have been adapted so that you can use a switch for activation. (Switches sold separately)"},{"rating":"1","title":"twice broken","review":"I work in a special ed school and thought this was a good idea. But it has broken twice, without any abuse.

Too bad- it was a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"took 2s for my son to start using","review":"First thoughts:So it took my 5yo son two seconds to start using it.

It becomes difficult to use. Still, its great for beginning (small) children because of the large yellow ball.Buy it for your small child. Then ebay it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for computing","review":"A five star review said \\"great for games\\". This seems true. It looks like a toy. It is a toy. The ball flows very well. It is NOT, however, a replacement for a mouse. Nor is the Kensington because it has a bad ball. Put this ball in the Kensington frame and you'll have a very good mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Review: Schoolgirl Devotionals plus Nationalistic and Death Poetry","review":"The content of \\"Canadian Wild Flowers\\" bears no resemblance to its title. Don't bother downloading this. Unless you are related to the author maybe. Or have a penchant for 1850's verse penned by a dying young woman. There is plenty of religious content. And some patriotic pieces written upon the marriage of Prince Frederick William of Prussia to Victoria Adelaide Mary, eldest daughter of the Queen of England in 1858 and the visit of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1860. And there are the inevitable verses penned under the title, \\"Thoughts on Death.\\" Oh, yes, there is a piece entitled \\"To a Dandelion,\\" hence the title of this book (although to me this is misleading...) Also \\"To a Rabbit.\\" \\"The Watcher.\\" You get the idea.I archived this but even over there it will get in the way and wasn't worth the trouble. I am writing this review to save you the trouble : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Bad Try","review":"This is one of Bill Shatner's \\"Tek War\\" series' books. It is not bad, but also not particularly memorable. For all those Star Trek fans out there, don't bother, as this is nothing like Star Trek . . . although if Shatner hadn't been riding on his Star Trek fame, this book would have probably never have been published. His writing style is very gritty, something like Robert Heinlein, although not quite as bad. The book is really more of a detective/police story (the \\"T.J. Hooker\\" influence, no doubt) set in the future. If you like police stories, you might like this, but frankly, I was not much impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to par with other travel video series","review":"We enjoy travel/music videos of places we have been. I bought this to try this series. It is totally disjointed - one moment the history of Knossos, History Channel-style recreations of life in antiquity, then a visit to a modern olive grove - and on and on. There are a few nice scenes of villages and beaches on the islands but for me much of the video does not fit well together, and the History Channel insertsdetract and devalue. I won't buy any more of this series. The Shepherd series and Naxos series are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Madness blah blah blah.","review":"If you are not a G.B.H. fan, and or you are looking for the usual sounding punk from this time period; you will not like this album!On the other hand; If you like metal, and or hard driving rock then you will.I picked this up out of some nostalgia over my school years spent listening to this album over and over on a cassette tape, it's a c.d. but the sound quality is no better!With all that said; this is in my top ten favorite albums!G.B.H. really know how to put out an album, and in spite of the funky mixing job, this is worth picking up if you want something from that time period that sounds more underground than it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to profit from the art print market","review":"found alot of fundamental info and insights into this area that i'm researching"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a complete waste of time.","review":"Unfortunately, for all the book provides, there are enough problems with it that I have to wonder if it missed out on some much-needed editing.

Davey informs with great wisdom and wit, and makes a book about marketing as much of a page-turner as some of the fiction novels I read! I am a painter, and my husband a sculptor, who tired of the gallery scene years ago...now we are readying ourselves to re-enter the art arena once again, and this time, armed with Davey's fabulous information contained in this book, we are well-informed as to the choices we have.

Lasdun is one of our truly beautiful modern authors. But his style timeless. This read will truly take you along the downward spiral into the rotted soul of a battered man. You can see the corrosion of his being progress from a young age during the middle of the Cold War in East Germany. It has a snowball-affect that takes you through the rest of the novel. All the way through, as in the Horned Man, it is a pychologically gripping read. Recommended to all who would like to introduce a very worthy new author into their catalog. Read, and then spread the word of the beautiful writing that you have witnessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful structuring","review":"Picked this up after a strong review in the Economist, and found this a wonderful novel. The impeccable plotline structure and beautiful writing call for re-reading the novel immediately after finishing it. Characterization is a delight, as is the psychological depth and rendering of post-war East Germany. I will most definitely be reading more of Lasdun in future"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasdun an undiscovered gem","review":"The previous two reviews say it all. Just want to agree with their words and hope more people discover this undiscovered author. I first knew his name when I saw the Bertolucci movie Besieged and got the collection of short stories at the library, the title story upon which the movie is based. Somehow he fell off my radar and he's come back to me and I've just recently read Seven Lies and The Horned Man--loved them both. His writing is to use the overused word nothing short of brilliant. In the case of Vogel, Lasdun will bring you down down down into the well of Vogel's spiritual decay. Lasdun writes poetry as well and has several books but I only know the short stories and two novels. To anticipate other books by Lasdun is a reason to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must read for students and new managers.","review":"Change at Work is a must read for high-school students, college students, and those seeking careers in management. Cappelli has a no nonsense approach with detailing those issues impacting our careers, the work environment, and the future. For those wondering if a technical or college education is worthwhile, Cappelli gives you good reasons for furthering your education. Cappelli and his co-authors do an outstanding job detailing those issues and circumstances faced by today's workers and managers of all business, i.e., corporate America, government agencies and other nonprofit entities, and the smallest of ma-and-pa companies. Cappelli does not offer good solutions for any of the issues he raises in this work. Unfortunately for professionals and management already in the work force, Change at Work offers no new knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME RULES!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is so cool the annoucers are so relistic and the graphics rock you HAVE to get this game!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a game that is not to be bought it is a waste of money.

I would recomend this game to anyone looking for a time to smash some people in to the boards and be able to control the players like no other. This game can't be talked about in words it is so awesome. Well enough bull buy or rent it to find out your own opinions about and take my word you will not set the controller down once you start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Wood","review":"These sleigh bells were a good choice for my small singing group. We needed bells to accompany Jingle Bells and other Christmas songs but that wouldn't be too loud for a small ensemble. These are excellent. I would recommend them. They are constructed well on a solid wooden handle which makes them very easy to hold and not affected by outdoor temperatures as metal handles are. They probably are not as effective with a large orchestra or a large singing group simply from a volume of sound produced, but for a small group with usually just piano accompaniment they work very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Australia","review":"I give this one three and a half stars. Great I-Max photography as usual, however maybe just not enough time to cover more of Australia, being such a vast land. Seemed to be focused on just a few points. But, great family show. Glad to have it in the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully I paid less than $6 for this!","review":"This is 40 minutes of video of Australia - mostly of the interior and some coastline shots. Probably better than the average tourist home movie - but not by much. Some of the scenes probably looked impressive on an IMAX screne, which is apparently what it was made for. In 16:9 it's between 'nice' and 'interesting' but far from stunning.A LOT of kangaroo footage - some bird (mostly flock) foootage. One crocodile snippet that was a big animal. A few lizard shots. Some scenic storm scenes.Unctious narration by Alex Scott - I couldn't take him twice but it depends on what you like I suppose. The back says 75 minutes but that must be with the bonus material.I think it's worth a few $ but never $22 (to me)! Of the half dozen Australia videos I have, this is the bottom of the heap. Get it (only) if you collect everything you can find on Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment, thy name is IMAX","review":"Once again, an IMAX documentary where the only thing that seems to matter are pretty pictures. While the image quality is superb it's the only real redeeming feature. There's no real exploration of the ecology of the Outback, there isn't much discussion of the wildlife (yay, kangaroos, yay perenties). What discussion there is is basic, repetitive and about on par with what you'd get in a 3rd or 4th grade science class. It's amazingly pretty, but there's nothing else there. It's like a screen saver for your TV basically.The subtitles were also horrible; words were misspelled, just flat out missing, sometimes out of sync with the audio... I use subtitles because my hearing is so/so, and that was a real pain for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover mislead me, not for 2009 HDTVs","review":"The cover says this is a 75 minute DVD. Well, the program is only the usual IMAX 40+ minute version. Also, this says \\"large format widescreen\\" and \\"16x9 widescreen\\" format.\\" It would have been better quality if they stuck with the original IMAX dimensions, as this low-detail letterbox is not anamorphic and has relatively low quality by today's standards (it has been for some years now!). The program itself is OK to good in places but not exceptional. Some years ago (right after VHS), this would have been acceptable. Production standards have increased substantially (see BBC productions like Planet Earth and Galapagos, for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Let Down","review":"Australia: Land Beyond Time (IMAX) [Blu-ray]Only 45 minutes of video, not the advertised 75 minutes. I guess they took into account the \\"B Roll\\" stuff, which did not look like it was filmed in HD. The production was quite bad as well. Look at desert, look at kangaroos, look at desert, look at more kangaroos. No cities, just outback, a few more animals, and a brief lesson on continental drift and quite repetitive concerning...kangaroos. Don't waste your money in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film","review":"Very good film about Australia.
