I personally hope that a Civil War Brass Band will play this as an instrumental. A Civil War folk song; it has more meaning to those who are near the Shenandoah mountains and river. In the Native American Indian's translation--it means \\"Daughter of Stars.\\"The Ashokan Farewell instrumental, as is played; there is no better to be found. I am of the belief, that Ken Burn's \\"Civil War\\" will be forever linked to this music.The rest of the music, in my opinion--is better played by the Americus Brass Band and Camp Chase Fife and Drum Corps. By using the authentic type drums; it makes a huge difference on the entire 'recipe' of the music piece/selection.If you're not fussy and not hungry for period instruments only--then it would be a higher ranking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War Music","review":"I enjoyed this music after visiting Gettysburg Battlefield and two Civil War battlefields in Virginia.

Choosing a soundtrack for a film this well is a skill that few to no filmmakers have in this day and age. The tracks on this CD range from joyously uplifting to horribly sorrowful. It conjurs up all the photographs you have seen of the civil war. If you have seen Ken's series documentary even once, you can see it all again in your head while you listen to this.

The clamp that holds it to the book requires about 30 pages, and even then it is not very stable and flops around. When we bought this unit, we bought two different brands to compare.

First, no cheap, plastic off-gassing smell. Number 2, stays in place. Three, can adjust in all different directions and angles towards any part of either page. Ever since I've found this make and model I've been terrified of it being discontinued. Which is why, just in case it wears out or I lose it, I've come to Amazon to buy several.

If you have notes or printed documents/journal articles, then there is no way to use this light.It cannot be affixed to anything except for a book spine, and that makes it extremely inconvenient to use.When I bought it, I was happy that it would use only one AAA battery, but I quickly saw the downside to that when I bought it. The LED bulb doesn't burn very brightly at all. This light would help ONLY if the light above your bus/train seat would work, but not otherwise.I recommend buying the only slightly more expensive Mighty Bright light with a clip, that can be attached to a computer screen, the seat handle in front of you, anything.

Questioning everything from organized religion to society's perception of the the less fortunate, Ian Anderson's song writing comes to full growth on this album. Many called it a concept album, but it was really a great rock album that set the stage for the MOTHER of concept albums, Thick as a Brick. This is a good album to start with if you aren't already into Tull. Just about everyone will recognize the tile track and Locomotive Breath!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angry,Sentimental, Moving","review":"I havent heard the gold issue, Im just reviewing the album. I know its the most famous JT release, but it truly deserves to be. This piece shows Ian at his most introspective, yet rocks incredibly too. Created when Ian was 24, its less a band record and more an Ian solo album although the band delivers a lot and Martin's guitar work is pure diamond. The lyrics to the title trck were written by Ian's first wife. The themes to this are religion and love, and ecomomic desperation. It reaches deep down and hits you in the heart. Made before the days of vocal enhancement, Ian's voice is at it roughest and also at its smoothest. Lets see Marilyn Manson sound rough without distortion laden over his voice. He would sound like a choir boy. You will never forget this recording and will feel thankful there was such creativity and talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great After All These Years","review":"I started looking for this alblum after seeing Jethro Tull in Mobile, Alabama.

The combination of hard-driving jazz-rock (\\"Hymn 43,\\" \\"Locomotive Breath,\\" and the title track are classics) with stately British folk-rock makes for a very rewarding listen. Ian Anderson & Co. were one of the most distinctive sounds on the British scene, and \\"Aqualung\\" is, for all intents and purposes, their \\"greatest hits\\" and \\"best of\\" in one compact studio release. The lyrics may have been pretentious, but the music is just plain great."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Jethro Tull is an excellent band.

From the first to last track, every song on this album is of hit quality! This album marked the beginning of a great string of hit albums for Tull. Anderson, being multi-talented is the driving force here and captivates with his outlook on religion and life as he sees it. The Songs: Aqualung,Cross Eyed Mary, Locomotive Breath and My God, are timeless classics. Anderson's flute playing is flawless and Martin Barre's Guitar is awesome. If you like the song Aqualung and haven't heard the rest of the cd , you wont be dissapointed. A++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jethro Tull in Babylon","review":"Jethro Tull's worst would come a few years later with \\"A Passion Play,\\" but this rates as their second worst. The songs are all overblown, pretentious, and grating. Ian Anderson apparently felt divinely called to try to trash the Christian faith one-handed. He makes a fool of himself. \\"Aqualung,\\" \\"Cross-Eyed Mary,\\" and a few others are good songs, but the bad outweighs the good on this one. Buy their first three, or their later (excluding \\"Passion Play\\") including \\"Thick As A Brick.\\" THIS WAS one of the great bands, a great band of musicians, always exciting in concert, and makers of great albums. This is the bad apple of the bunch. Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Profoundly Nettling Listen","review":"This album was played by the high school deejay through the speakers in my school cafeteria virtually every day, and I could not stand it then, just as I cannot stand it now. Why this group is so highly regarded is baffling to me. I think Ian Anderson's singing and fluting have an inexplicable, innately irritating quality that makes my skin crawl when I hear it. I think the best way to attain any Jethro Tull CD is to simply not attain one, just as the best way to hear Jethro Tull is to not listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jethro Tull rocks with meaning","review":"Aqualung is one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. Ian Anderson's powerul lyrics are done great justice by his menacing vocals. The album is full of religious overtones which are brought together in the song wind up which is sung with passion and feeling by Anderson. Aqualung sheds light on the human condition as well as religious freedom. This is a legendary album you'll be sure to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Flute Playing Homo","review":"How could I have underestimated these guys for so long? I recently picked this LP up from a friend, yes a record. I do not know how it may sound on CD, but the true sound of any master piece should be heard from Vinyl.Having the right speakers to listen to this is key, hearing the scratching of the guitar, on Locomotive Breath. The precisely timed cord ripping through the song Mother Goose.The true way to hear this is on a quality Turntable, via nice vintage speakers.I will not deny I passed over this for many years, always digging the radio cuts on the FM. I am glad that I discovered it in it's entirety in 2011. So it's all new to me. I am lucky"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of All Time","review":"Not only is this a fantastic Jethro Tull album, but it is simply a fantastic Rock n' Roll album.

Despite Classic Rock stations across the country who play Aqualung, Cross-Eyed Mary, Locomotive Breath and Hymn 43 only, there are more songs here to enjoy. \\"Mother Goose\\" is a catchy little song that will keep you humming. \\"My God\\" is another fantastic tune, and a tune that only Ian Anderson could write. There is good reason why Aqualung pushed Tull to the forefront of the music scene in the 70's. Like \\"Van Halen\\", \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Aqualung\\" is an essential CD for your rock collection. Once you put Aqualung on your CD player I guarantee it will stay there for days, and will stay even longer in your head!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If the sound quality were there...","review":"Terrific album, lousy sound quality.

For the life of me I can't see why it's supposed to be so great. The interlinking song themes are good, as are some of the lyrics, but the music is quite unadventurous and Ian Anderson's voice is gruff and monotonous. I think one difficulty may be the sound quality of this CD reissue - maybe with better sound i would have a different opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aqualung, piece of art","review":"Legendary, this album is a piece of art that keeps getting better with time.

Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST sound out there, remastered??","review":"This is the WORST sounding CD i have ever heard, HANDS DOWN!! What's with these other reviews that the audiophile freaks say is sounding good on this cd? Even Ian himself has admitted there is no good master of Aqualung available anywhere. The original master was destroyed and an inferior master was used. This album was recorded in an old church turned into a studio where the sound and acoustics were terrible. Led Zeppelin had the same studio except a smaller room which made the sound better and more intimate. I have to turn my cd player up all the way on volume just to hear it. Ian himself says this is not one of their better releases in their day. Stand Up and Benefit blow this away. Not to say there isn't great songs on this release if only you could hear them. What a shame NONE of the Jethro Tull catalog has been remastered properly. I guess i'll try the Tull blu-spec cd and see how that sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aqualung - The Height of Jethro Tull","review":"Aqualung is without a doubt THE best albumJethro Tull has ever produced... Okey,Songs from the Woodis unbelievably Good.. The same with Benefit,Stand Upand the rest of Tulls work..But this album really stands out from the Bunch..If you ever are to buy JUST ONE Tull-album,then this is the one to buy..It is a concept-album which thumbsthe nose at establisment, and remindsus that not everyone falls within whatwe would define as the Norm..Aqualung (The main character) certainlydoes not,and he's quite happy with that..He lives his life as he pleases andscorns those who would try,in their ownselfinterest,to change his life for himwithout his consent..In short.. A Pearl of an album,which demands listening and thinkingat the same time.. Not an album for theaverage Britney Spears or Boyzone-fan.."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top ten of all time classic rock albums.","review":"I had to donate the vinyl version of this album last week and was heartbroken to do so.

Also, even though this album is amazing, please don't think Aqualung is the ultimate Jethro Tull experience and that you need look no further to fully appreciate them. You must check out a few other albums to comprehend the many facets of this incredible band. The short list: \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" and \\"Songs From the Wood.\\" These are often overlooked, but are two of the musically strongest Tull albums. Start there, and then add \\"Heavy Horses,\\" \\"Too Old...,\\" and the blues based \\"This Was,\\" to better appreciate this finest ever art-rock band. There's much more, but this would be a great beginning introduction past \\"Aqualung.\\" Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remaster sounds excellent","review":"This is the first Tull album I bought while in high school in 1971. The newly remastered CD contains bonus tracks recorded during the Aqualung sessions but not included on the original vinyl Lp. Also included in an interview with Ian Anderson and two songs recorded at the BBC, A Song For Jeffrey and Bouree. This is a must for every music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Locomotive Breath","review":"The song is powerful and has static of its own.

Loud repeating beats, until you want to crawl into a fetal position and scream. I will never ever comprehend how it can be that people enjoy this soulless tripe. So there you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"A techno classic","review":"This is one of the best techno CD's ever. A very solid album with few weak tracks, all of which are more than made up for with songs like \\"Absurd\\", \\"Atom Bomb\\", \\"Amp\\", and \\"Goodnight Lover\\". If you like techno with more than just the generic 4-on-the-floor drums, there's no way you won't like this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is very good indeed","review":"This album is one of my favourites.

When I first got it I listened to is so much I thought I was going to wear it out. It never happened. The grooves are so precisely put together on each and every track that you hear something new every time you listen to it. If you are beginning to move into the techno/electronica scene and are wondering where a good place to start is, then look no further. I have over 100 electronica cd's and this one still remains at the top of my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rave-atious!","review":"i have just bought the cd and at first I wasn't really impressed with the songs. After awhile, I began liking them. The song \\"Absurd\\" is the best song on the cd. It starts the cd and blends into the following songs after. Deep bass and fast rhythem are incorporated in some songs. \\"Kitten Moon\\" is very hypnotic and soothing. \\"Bermuda\\" is very sultry as the lead singer's voice coos over electronic beats and slow rhythem. \\"Setback\\" and \\"Amp\\" are two songs that blend as one. The beat gets faster and faster til the end-totally rave. The song, \\"Squirt\\" sounds like a rave going on in a circus ring. The last song, \\"Goodnight Lover\\" is a good song with mute bass beats but fast tempo. One of my favorite CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"lost in the sound","review":"This is one major mix of emotions. from the extreme bass of \\"absurd\\" and \\"atom bomb\\", to the melodramatic tunes of \\"setback\\" and \\"reeferendrum\\", this CD is sure to have you in a strange world of fast paced drum beats to the slow, wonder-inducing tranz styles. I definitely recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy. Transporting.","review":"An album to listen to all at once. There are no real move it and shake it tracks, though a few come close, but the entire thing holds together very, very well.

Is it FAST? *YES* Energetic?? *YES!!* Intense? **YES!!!** The sound is hyper, spacious, crystalline and full of substance. It lends sensations of flying and spinning and all sorts of exciting kinesthetic suggestions to the body and spirit. The songs are completely original and have excellent structure and development. Not as personal as Underworld, Fluke has more of an \\"aerial\\" perspective.

The problem witht the this book is that the book only gives enough information to give the player a false hope at the game. While the book doesn't offer any \\"bad\\" advice, it doesn't offer enough \\"good\\" advice, in that it addresses the basics of poker theory, and then goes about how to apply these basics to no limit holdem. To really win at no limit holdem, the basics just aren't enough. Psychology is much more important, and this book just leaves the player too predictable and too uninformed to do some serious damage at the tables. This book has the player playing a more limit style of poker, which doesn't work in no limit. It doesn't discuss the difference between a big pot or a small pot, which has a major affect on whether a player is a real winner or not.

It gives no-limit novices- not poker novices, The book assumes that the readers are familiar with poker- a good introduction into no limit holdem.

It's worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners","review":"Well I think this is a quite good book, but especially for beginners.

Of course there are chapters that are good, for example the Odds and Betting Strategies and the Position. If you are new you should read it, but be ready to buy other better books that can give you the essence of no-limit hold'em. For example the magnificient Little Green Book by Phil Gordon or if you want to play absolutely an expert level and want to take part in tournaments the Harrington's books are waiting for you.

The fusion speed-demon that burst on the scene with Chick Corea has given way to the mature, passionate artist that has created this beautiful album. The music he has created with his World Sinfonia group has to be one of the best examples of how an artist can be positively influenced by being open to everything the world has to offer. In Mr. DiMeola's case, it seems that the music of Astor Piazzolla has been a major catalyst for the dark, mysterious, smoldering music of World Sinfonia. The combination of DiMeola's guitar, the beautiful piano of Mario Parmisano, and the sensuous orchestral arrangements make for a great sound-think of the Gipsy Kings with much more musicality.I would suggest any of the World Sinfonia albums to those with \\"big ears\\" and a taste for the exotic and soulful-\\"The Grande Passion\\" is a wonderful place to start the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIMEOLA on fire,","review":"this album is a amazing... great passionate playing...also\\"Di Meola's own music sounds next to those of the late Brazilian tango avatar\\"as said by the REVIEWER here, 1st of, there is no such thing as brazilian TANGO...ASTOR is from argentina, not brazil... sad that the person who'd review a DIMEOLA record isnt aware of that///"},{"rating":"2","title":"You got to get this CD","review":"I'm not sure if you've heard of this guy but can he ever play the hell out of his guitar !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for the whole family!

The plan seemed fairly simple and his shortened version made sense. When I received the book, however, I did not know that if I followed the plan according to his direction I would be spending over $300 a month on supplements. He is basically trying to sell his supplements, which can be purchased on his web site, at an unreasonable price. A lot of what he focuses on is inflammation that cannot be detected without a microscope and cannot be felt. I do not understand why I would take all these supplements for symptoms that are \\"invisible\\" and \\"undectectable\\".

The so called \\"inflammation\\" is a hypothetic which I am sure will be rejected by the medical community. The only doctors that recommend this book are authors of other books. By giving recommendation to it they get in return advertisement.There is one thing for sure and it is that you have to buy MANAY supplements from Perricone's web site which as you may know are very expensive.

There are healthy snacks throughout so that you are never wanting, and the best part is (besides the 12 lbs) that my skin has never looked more radiant. I've been on diets before where my skin greys and sags as I lose weight and I actually look older and tired. With this plan, I actually look and feel more radiant than I have in 10 years!

In fact I have been know to skip the last couple of tracks because I simply don't like them very much.Having said that I do love the bouncy nature of the opening tracks and I have many times restarted the CD just to hear the bubbly synth work. As an ambient album it is great. It's good to work to, and I happily have it on in the car on a mellow morning.If you've grown up with Enigma over the years and miss the regular injection of the Enigmatic synths then get this album, if you are looking for a first introduction to the music then I recommend picking up one of the earlier works first.

Few months before Enigma released \\"Hello and welcome\\" that was promoting \\"LSD\\" compilation but is included on \\"A posteriori\\" as well.

I always enjoyed it, but the last song, \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" has come to be a bittersweet experience for me. My wife Denita passed away on May 26, 2007. As she requested, I scattered her ashes in front of the beach condo we used to rent in Fort Fisher, NC. I remember it was about 2:30 AM and a full moon was shining down on the water. And as I drove back to my motel I turned on the CD player: \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" started to play. When I heard the words \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" all I could hear was \\"Goodbye Denita.\\" Every time I hear it I have to choke back a tear. Thank you, Enigma.Goodbye Milky Way. Goodbye Denita. I love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Phenomenal","review":"This new work from Enigma is by far my favorite. The sounds and rhythms are so incredible. I listen to this almost once a day just to remind myself what good music really is. I would make this a must have for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to move on","review":"One reviewer has nailed my sentiments to a \\"T\\". I no longer look forward to Enigma releases. What I have will do me fine. I may break this out once in awhile, but I'm guessing that it will more than likely collect dust. There's a lot of exciting music out there and it's time to move on.For example something I found refreshing along the lines of Enigma is the music coming out of Cirque du Soleil. Try the remix album of \\"Tapis Rouge Solarium\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated.","review":"Hammer made a handful of mummy movies, of which the very first one, 1959's \\"The Mummy\\", naturally is the best. This later one is usually quite underrated, and often treated like dirt by critics and many fans. To me it's actually the 2nd best Hammer mummy. I really don't know why some people say it's boring and slow, when it almost has more mummy-action than the dull \\"Curse Of The Mummy's Tomb\\" and the overrated \\"Blood From The Mummy's Tomb\\" combined. Stuntman Eddie Powell is (next to Christopher Lee) the most scary and effective \\"dustman\\". And in what is probably his largest role for Hammer, the excellent Michael Ripper shows us why he should have been given much bigger parts. The rest of the cast is very good too, especially the slimy John Phillips. This DVD is a must for Hammerphiles everywhere, and those good humanitarians at Anchor Bay deserve all the praise in the world for giving us another rare jewel from the studio that dripped blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift for son","review":"My son who is 16 has been looking for this video for years (The Mummy's Shroud). So I was very excited to find it here! He likes zombies so The Plague of Zombies was a bonus! He has watched The Mummy's Shroud and really liked it. If you're into the older movies, then you'll like it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Scary","review":"I bought this initially because anything that has \\"zombie\\" in the title is something I am interested in seeing, especially around Halloween! \\"Plague of the Zombies\\" was sleep-inducing, the only time I saw a zombie was towards the end of the movie and by then, I could care less! \\"The Mummy's Shroud\\" spent more time telling the viewer the background of the Egyptian king who became the Mummy then it did in being scary! Both Hammer films in one set but unless you are a Hammer horror fan, I would skip this one entirely. Thankfuly I didn't pay much for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute for sandwiches","review":"My daughter had a butterfly princess birthday party, and this was perfect for cutting the sandwiches for the kids. It's just the right size for standard slices of bread. We have used it for cookies as well - it's a great cutter. I would only share that for sandwiches, I would recommend making them and THEN cutting rather than trying to cut out individual bread slices and then assemble the sandwich. We made PB&J for all of the girls. The ones where I tried to cut the bread and then assemble it were very messy and didn't look as cute. When I made the PB&J on regular bread and then cut out the butterflies, they were trouble free, quick and easy to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fancy cookies for Fancy Little Girls","review":"I get a warm fuzzy smile whenever I run across this particular cookie cutter in my kitchen. My niece used to spend weekends with us and we would always bake. One of her favorite projects would be to make \\"Fancy Cookies\\" and this was by far her favorite cutter. We would make the Butterfly shaped sugar cookies. Once they were cool we would take pink or purple rolled fondant & cut it with the butterfly cutter. Lightly ice butterfly cookie, place fondant butterfly on top then decorate the top of the fondant with contrasting icing. Even when she was very little her butterfly cookies would look professional due to the fondant. (Just make sure to have a good tasting fondant!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"good product & price, hairy service","review":"Received the product today after 10 days of waiting. I don't know where they are stored, but the rubbery grip on all 3 pieces was covered in animal hair, both straight and wavy! This is a health hazard for families with allergies. Luckily, we don't, so I just wiped them off and will keep them. I'll pour some boiling water on them before use though, as this sounds gross to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerry Kelly, Salisbury, England","review":"This album is every bit as good as I expected it would be, and more. I have been an admirer of Geoff's for about twenty years now, since hearing ' .. a wonderful time' and 'Blues Boy'. This album is soo wonderful it makes me want to get all the others on CD.

He has a virtuoso voice. He's doesn't imitate Black blues singers. He's a White man singing the blues. He only wrote two of the songs, but he owns them all. His music is more than authentic - it's playful, inspirational, and soulful.

If you are on a journey to coach with help from a spirit, maybe start here, but definitely continue on in your search. Two reviewers, Ms. Gagne and Ms. Schuler are contributors in the book, so maybe a little biased giving their five star reviews. I'm curious as to why they are submitting reviews five years after the book is released. Perhaps to counter the critical reviews they received.At any rate, the book is lightweight in content. Hopefully, I don't have any misspellings in my review, since based on a previous reviewer, the author can have a critical spirit. She apparently has since deleted the review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did your spiritual base go?","review":"I picked up this book hoping to find a resource to assist me in helping others. I wasn't able to finish the book, perhaps because I understand spirituality at a deeper level than the author appears to have ever been. It is interesting to notice the author's mean spirited response to the sole critical review of her work. Perhaps Cathy is the only person who doesn't personally know the author to put in a review. A spiritually based person would not respond to a critical review in such a narrow minded way. She even attacked the person's character because of misspellings.

I bought the CD just after hearing Malice. So i decided to go and check em out. I was soooo amazed. These guys are so good. The vocalist has this freaky Marilyn Manson/Kud screaming voice, and a descent singing voice. His rap voice is pretty kewl too. When he does rap, it sounds wierd because the music doesnt go with it, but it's for the better i guess. If you're looking for a heavy metal band that sounds like a mixture of Marilyn Manson, Nonpoint, Mudvayne, Primer 55, and Factory 81, then get this. My favorite tracks are G.A.D, Leave Us Alone, Penicillin, Malice, and Suffer. So yeah. And the bass guitar is really strong in this CD, and the drummer somtimes gives off some nice double foot pedal to go with the heavy guitar riffs.

Very sturdy construction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"So far so good with this coin sorter. Turning the handle does not bother me, it sorts the coins easily. Sometimes you get one stuck, so it you then need to reverse. But this is true with most coin sorters, it's never going to be 100% flawless. You feed the coins from the top and turn the handle. The coins get sorted into the paper wrappers and you're good to go. I recommend this if you don't mind a manual coin sorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Coin Sorter","review":"I just got this coin sorter and put it to work. It works perfectly. Hardly ever jams and when it does the fix is to just rotate the lever in the other direction and then back, easy as pie. I recommend this for anyone who has a jar full of coins. I love that every aspect of it you are able to control. I wanted to see if it actually counted out the right amount of each coin (since there is no screen) so I filled it and manually counted once, and it did! All you have to do is watch until the coins reach the top and then they'll start bouncing off it and replace the sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is your better choice - I know!","review":"I've had the cheap electro-mechanical coin sorter/counters. I strongly urge you to buy this manual crank model!The electro models jam easily and you end up spending a lot of time clearing the jams. This Royal Sovereign crank model does not jam! YOU are in control of the rate of operation. You can put a lot of coins in the hopper at once.I'll be honest: It's downright FUN to turn the crank and watch the coins get sorted!Even more - THIS model is less expensive than the electro-mechanical models.I'd buy this as a gift for friends. I'd buy the battery-powered one for other people.KFarm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coin Sorter","review":"I wanted a coin sorter that was fast, cheap, and accurate. This is it. It is fun to use. I'd guess it sorts almost 250 coins per minute. I haven't had any problem with jamming. I did not place coin wrappers in the tubes, so the coins entered easily. When a tube filled, I dumped the coins into a plastic bag (one for each coin type). This makes sorting fast, no stopping to roll. Since coin thickness can vary with wear, I don't trust the tube height to get an accurate count. I'll find a different way to count and roll. Maybe making stacks of 10 on a table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"I bought this to deal with the huge volume I get from my side job selling newspapers and it works great. I put about $80/week in mostly quarters through it with no problems. All you have to do is stir it a little as the coins go through and it does the rest. The only problem I had was getting the correct amount of coins in each tube. But after I got that down, smooth sailing. Definitely recommend over any battery-operated machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"I save my change in a jar at the end of the day. Last week, I was shocked to find out that my bank no longer had a coin sorter/counter. My choices were to take the jar to a grocery store and pay a 8-9% fee or 'roll my own'. After doing a search and reading the high reviews the MS-1 received, I decided to order the coin sorter.Once I got the hang of getting the coins into a flat wrapper from the plastic sorter tube, it only took me 2-1/2 hours (at the most) to sort and wrap $140.50 worth of coins!The MS-1 is simple to operate (perfect to use in front of tv). In case of jams, you reverse the crank.This little coin sorter is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coin Sorter review","review":"I am happy with my purchase. It works as expected. IMO it works better when you don't put in the coin wrappers. Fill up the tubes and then put them in the coin wrappers."},{"rating":"2","title":"MS1 Coin Sorter is a Great little tool!","review":"I have been reviewing and considering coin sorters for some time. Based on the the reviews and warnings of other consumers I put aside my love for electronic gadgets and chose this manual model. Just as they said, it is very dependable. Jams are not a concern, since you can just reverse the handle a partial turn. This has been a great investment, and I would recommend it to anyone ready to turn the piggy bank into a bank deposit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not sort pennies or dimes worth a damn","review":"THis item will sort quarters nickles and dimes just \\"OK\\" If you have pennies they end up in the nickle slot.

I haven't yet figured out how to get exactly the right number of coins per tube but, from what I can tell, the banks aren't all that picky either! That's the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars.I put a piece of scotch tape on one side of the tube(s) to prevent coins from overshooting the tubes; an easy fix. It works best when I don't pour too much into the hopper. Be gentle when cranking it backward to un-jam it. Now tell all your friends you'll take their pocket change and soon you'll be wealthy beyond your wildest dreams! (OK, I made up that last part, but the rest is true)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This worked great for me. I unscrewed the 3 screws that keep the housing on so I could clear jams easy. In $80 worth of change i had about 3 jams (jams were due to foreign coins and debris). Slow and steady is the key.Hand counted each sleeve of coin then weighed them on my postage scale. 2 of the sleeves (I think nickels and dimes, I don't remember and its already packed away) you are better off not inserting the preformed coin sleeve and just waiting until the coins are flush with the tube. Other than than it took about 15 min to count $80 with of coins. It could have been less time but I did a lot of double checking to verify accurate counts. It was fun. It would have gotten 5 stars if it was 100% accurate at counting. For $30 you cant go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coin Sorter","review":"This coin sorter does exactly as described.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & easy to use","review":"I got this for my husband who tosses coins in a can. It was easy to use and did not jam if you went a medium speed.I would purchase one again for someone I know that needs this help with coins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad For The Price","review":"This coin sorter is not bad for $31.00. I sorted out about $300.00 worth of change in about 1.5 hours. I did not experience the problems other buyers did. I left the coin wrappers in the tubes, loaded the hopper with coins and cranked the handle. When a tube filled up I replaced it and kept cranking until I needed to replace another. The hopper will become jammed from time to time, but it is nothing to worry about. Just turn the crank in the opposite direction a little and it will clear the jam. I think it was the dimes that caused the most jams, but again it was nothing that caused me any real trouble. Accuracey was also very good. A couple of pennies ended up in the nickel tube and a couple of dimes in the penny tube. I think it was well worth the $31.00 and it will last me a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nifty little coin sorter","review":"Got this for my husband who collects his change and was accumulating quite a stash. He loves using this coin sorter and now rolls up his change regularly.It works very well as long as you go slow and don't overload it. Sometimes it jams just a little but this is easily remedied by jogging the handle in the opposite direction. This allows the coins to redistribute in the hopper and continue to load into the proper slots. Its a nice little low-tech device and we are glad that we purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic coin sorter","review":"If you are looking for a manual coin sorter, this is a good one. I was eager to use this when I received. I poured my coins in (all silver) and began to crank the handle. I quickly noticed I put in too many coins so I removed some. Works pretty good once you learn how many coins to put in and how to turn. I turned it medium speed and occasionally it would jam. I just reversed the handle a little and that usually solved the problem. The other problem I had was determining when a wrappper was full. Dimes were the hardest, but once you do several times you can tell. Overall, I recommend this sorter, just be gentle with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"I gave this to my son (6 yrs) for xmas and he loved,loved, loved it.

I think you have to place the coins a certain way to reduce jamming.Anyway, this is going back.

I always had to add a quarter, nickel, or dime to make a full roll after the coins started sliding off the tubes.After sorting about US$600 of change, it started jamming. I had to disassemble it more then once to clear coins out of the machine. Once the jamming started, the jams became more frequent. Eventually, the crank started skipping. The jamming apparently caused the plastic gears to become stripped.Now, the crank spins and spins. When it 'catches' about every tenth crank, it works fine.

All you have to do to sort your coins is dump them in the funnel and turn the crank. No need to charge or replace batteries, no need to worry about jamming. If a coin does jam, all you have to do is turn the crank backwards for a moment.It is true that the dimes and pennies travel so quickly down the chute that they sometimes pass over the paper roll that is supposed to collect them. All you have to do is fashion little backboards and tape them onto those plastic tubes, and the coins will bounce off the backboard and into their tube.It is also helpful to turn the crank slowly to make sure the coins pass into and not over the tubes.

The quarters and nickels sort fine, but the dimes frequently sort into the penny slot and at times the pennies sort into the nickel slot.

I love the hand crank and is fun to do with a child. No batteries to worry about. Like other comments, do not crank too fast or put too many coins at once.

I would recommend this product to any one trying to sort coins quickly and effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I searched for a coin sorter with decent reviews, and thought I had made a good choice. I boxed it back up the same day I got it for return because it did not accurately sort the coins. IThe other problem I found is, even with filling to the brim of the individual coin areas, they were about 3 coins short on every roll. I used this properly and it did not do what it says it does. If your bank doesn't care about short stacks or wrong coins in the stacks, you may not mind. My bank is not so easy-going. From now on I'll use CoinStar and get an Amazon certificate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Easy To Use!","review":"I purchased one of these a few years ago, and it was probably the best Coin Sorter I had. Even if you accidentally mix random things with your pile of coins (like paper clips, larger coins, etc.) it sorts it out. Kids seem to enjoy it as well. The only drawback is that you can not crank the handle too fast and that if the paper that holds the coin gets folded, you have to try to even it out, or use a new one. At the most part, this machine is pretty accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I rolled $500 worth of coin with this roller with no major issues. It jams occasionally, but you reverse the handle and then continue. Sometimes its tough to get the 'flat paper' cover from the bank over the coins. But that is not a design issue with the machine. Its just hard to get them round. The round rolls work almost flawlessly in the tubes. A few coins are rogue and flow over the collection tubes, but a low percentage. Works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"money sorter","review":"I found this produect very useful and a great time saver.All in all it is an excellent product.Occasionally a coin will miss the slot but that is a very minor problem.The most efficient way to use this sorter is to purchase tubular coin wrappers. I do not recommend flat wrappers as you would have to transfer the coins from the slots. Round wrappers can be put directly into the unit, filled and closed on the one end.I was able to wrap all my coins in about 15 minutes. Would have taken me hours by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"coin counter","review":"i am pleased with the coin counter. it works well. sometimes the coin doesn't go in the tube but that is no problem. also i use the paper wrappers and have no trouble getting the coins to go in. it also came very soon after i ordered it. shirlee larotonda"},{"rating":"1","title":"It can get annoying.","review":"Changed my mind. What an utter annoyance. I had to continuously dump out the coin tubes to get at the pennies and dimes that were sorted inaccurately. I had to turn the crank so slow it was not worth the hassle. I wound up, after 5 hours of use, manually sorting the coins and then having to count the tubes to verify they contained the accurate number of coins. For all that hassle, I can save myself $30 and just do it by hand anyways. Returned the item. Perhaps it is okay as a kid's toy, but not for anyone who seriously is looking for a time saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coin sorter","review":"This is a great coin sorter.

I was a little leery about the all-plastic design, but felt it stood a better chance of holding up than an automatic sorter with a motor.The hand crank turns easy, and the coins do sort with speed and accuracy. It's the perfect coin sorter for my home needs, and my kids think it's fun too.I wouldn't buy this for business reasons, but it's sturdy enough for years of use at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccurate and inconsistent","review":"I don't have that much change, so I thought a hand-crank coin sorter would work well for me as opposed to an automatic counter/sorter. I put over $40 of change through this product and had an absolutely terrible time with it. It did not put an accurate OR consistent amount of coins in the wrappers. I found myself counting each roll of change, some were off by a coin or two... some were off by as much as eight coins. At the end of the day, I'd rather spend a little more up front and not worry about double checking each roll of coins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - but inaccurate counting","review":"This is a really cool idea and works very smoothly. My kids had a blast sorting all their change.The real problem is that when I double-checked a few rolls, the count was short by one or two coins in each roll. This was using the manufacturers own paper rolls. I ended up not putting the rolls in the plastic tubes before sorting and instead transfering the coins into the rolls after they were sorted into the plastic tubes. I had to note for each coin, the fill point for each tube to get accurate results.I could get around this problem, but for the money, it should provide an accurate count.One other note - if you turn the handle the wrong way (counterclockwise) the coins go into the wrong slot. Must be turned clockwise to get everything to go into the right slot. Not a big deal, but I noticed this was a common complaint. Unlike the inaccuracy, the sorting problem is easily avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not perform","review":"I bought this unit based on other reviews and of course cost. Found the unit easy enough to operate but the unit jams easily and is sometimes difficult to unjam. if by chance you have a foreign coin in the mix it really becomes difficult. the wrappers i think are best if they are the stiff ones which are sold with the unit i found it very difficult to use the ones you get from the bank.there is alwasy the question as to how full is full when it comes to filling the tubes, very easy to put in one too many or one too less which creates a tendency to want to manual count the coins. I had high hopes but had to return the unit.

I bought one back in Jan 2008, so I've been using it for 7 months now. Occasional, it will drop a dime into the penny column (2 occurrences after sorting $200 worth of coins). Also, when I first used it, it was obvious I needed to modify the coin catchers as coins would frequently miss the catcher and drop down the front. Don't put the coin wrappers in the catchers. A quick fix was to put painters tape half-way around the catchers, thus making a backboard. Haven't had any coins miss since. I have yet to jam it, but I only drop a handful of coins into the hopper at a time. Best part...no batteries; will work for a lifetime.Its quick and easy to sort coins. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coin Counter","review":"Great little machine! The only thing I don't like is that you can't tell when you've got the right amount of coins in the roll. But, the bank ends up counting them anyway...so you may just be off a coin or two.

Dr Eggerichs explains the \\"crazy cycle\\" that so many of us fall into and how to stop repeating it so that both husband and wife get what they need from the relationship, bringing about more of what the other needs and turning the crazy cycle into a healthy one.I also appreciate the Scriptural basis for the logic and reasoning, as Christ is the center of all good marriages.

Are men the only ones who have sexual desires that need acknowledgment? Do women not deserve respect? These stereotypes of women are so over-the-top insulting, that I can't believe there are so many crazy brainwashed \\"Christians\\" out there in the world buying it.If you want help with your marriage,leave Jesus out of it.

It was one of the few things that caught my eye in the airport store. I finally decided that I would rather read the vomit bag. That was at least useful.I just sat there thinking, It is not wrong for me to be financially independent from my husband. That is not disrespectful to him. If he takes it that way, then his ego is the problem. Not anything that I have done.I need/want my husband because we are equals.What happened to thinking that we were grown-ups and that we could treat each other that way? I have no use for these mind games.Yes love & respect each other. But don't force it. Don't change who you are.God gave both men & women brains to avoid this type of right wing preaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is an awesome book for any married couple (or anyone in a relationship for that matter). It helps to understand the needs of your partner and why someone may be reacting the way they do. I would highly recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new.","review":"Maybe this book isn't the first one out there to focus on the \\"respect he needs\\" and the \\"love she desires,\\" but this book definitely puts a new spin on the idea that I haven't seen anywhere else.Dr. Eggerichs puts into words what I and other men I know haven't been able to articulate, but it all rings true. I've heard a similar response from women readers. I've read dozens of relationship texts over the years and this is, by far, the most insightful and practical text I have come across. Dr. Eggerichs uses one verse from the Bible and demonstrates how simple the idea of love and respect is. In practicality, marriage isn't easy, but if you're seeking wise, straightforward, and understandable advice, then check this one out.You'll hear this throughout the book: \\"not wrong, just different.\\" This book is different than the rest, and definitely not wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love & Respect: fulfils a modern need","review":"Love & Respect hammers home an important truth which many married couples today, including Christians, are missing, to their own detriment; but with which those who study and live by the Bible are familiar: Husbands, love your wives. Wives, respect (KJV: reverence) your husbands. Much of the book seems to be saying the same thing over and over in different words, and thus can be rather boring. And might there not be situations between spouses rather different from the typical, stereotyped situation referred to throughout the book? Perhaps I would have enjoyed or profited more from the book if I were married, but it is a universal truth, helpful to know, that what men need and want is respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST Read","review":"This book saved my marriage! My husband and I were in the early stages of divorce and I ordered this book on my Kindle 2 years ago. I am a \\"modern\\" woman who fit into the category of cringing-when-respect-is-mentioned. This book helped me to open my eyes to the things that I was doing in the relationship that I could change. The book is not overly religious, but does reference the bible and scripture. I am not religious, but found myself reading this book everyday, and I have read it several times every year since. Just to put things into perspective.Dr. Eggerichs focuses mainly on the respect because it is not something that my generation of thiry-somethings has been taught very well. It is insightful and gives gret examples of how the book has helped women and men see how they can change their own behavior for their benefit.I have gifted two copies to friends who need it and they both agree that it is a Must have for any relationship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Respect Eggerichs","review":"This book brings a great deal of understanding to the table about men and women. It points out the difference in each and how God created us to follow His example in our relationship. The book breaks down just how a man is to respond (love) to his wife and how she is to respond to him (respect). It also, reveals why we respond the way we do when the need is not met.Every couple both young and old, engaged or married should read this book. It provides a biblical solution to our conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biblical Principal explained in modern language","review":"The wisdom of how a man and woman can maintain the early love and respect that hopefully occured when they started dating is explained in clear words. The key instruction, which Emerson explains so well has been right under our noses for over two centuries in another Book that happens to be the number one best seller every year. I won't give away the key secret because you have to get this book and read it -hopefully- with the one you care for. I lost a dear wife 8 years ago to sudden illness. I hope I was applying some of these principals. I see, thru this book, why she was acting the way she was at times. I am sure I misread some of her signals. I see how I could have done so much better and made her happier. I have a freind who attended the conference's that are associated with this book and she said it was incredible as is the DVD series that they also own. I am so glad she told me about it. Required reading for any future or current couple. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for couples!","review":"I had heard many good reviews of this book so I was excited to read it for myself. What an encouraging book!! Realizing the crazy cycle that we all get on and how to stop it was eye-opening. I appreciate the author's openness in giving personal examples and his honesty to us as the reader. He gives ways to stop the crazy cycle for men and women and let's us see how women see the world in pink sunglasses with pink hearing aids and men see the world with blue sunglasses and blue hearing aids. He gives the COUPLE acronym for ways to help the husband love his wife and the CHAIRS acronym for ways to help the wife respect her husband. I would recommend this book for engaged couples and married couples whether they have a bad marriage or a good marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Marriage Book out there!","review":"If you're constantly fighting with your spouse and think \\"this is insane..,\\" you need to read this book. This book was given to me as a present, and it truly, saved my marriage. I completely understand the other side of the argument now and can better the situation immediately before things get worse. It did such wonders for our marriage, that I purchased 4 books and already sent them off to family and friends. Honestly, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Impact on Marriage","review":"No book other than the bible itself has helped my wife and I more than this one. Simple, yet profoundly helpful and relevant for any marriage. Paul exhorted husbands to unconditionally love their wives and wives to unconditionally respect their husbands. This is the needed clarity that every marriage needs to fulfill their God-given purposes and experience true and lasting joy. I can't wait to go through the video series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a 'must read' and SO right on point.","review":"I have read this book by myself and am now going back through and am reading it along with my boyfriend. Even though this book is specifically geared towards married couples, the concepts in this book can apply to all male-female relationships, whether it's your significant other, friend, brother, father, etc. Once you understand these principles it's very easy to apply and makes a huge difference. I can say from a female's perspective, the author is right on for almost every point he makes, and I've seen the difference it makes when I talk respectfully to my boyfriend during conflict. It definitely encourages him to speak lovingly to me. I honestly can't say enough good things about this book, and everyone who I have let borrow my copy has agreed how great it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Marriage Book Ever!","review":"The truths presented in this book are simple and powerful. In such a love-saturated culture, it's easy to overlook a man's need for respect. Even though my husband and I attended on of these conferences just over a year ago, it took me until now, by reading this book, to finally get it. I have learned a lot and am looking forward to putting it into practice. Not just to get my own needs met, but because respecting my husband is obedient to Christ's command and reflects the reverence we are to show Christ. I feel like my entire way of thinking has been revolutionized as a result of reading this book. This is going on my list of books to read every year. This book should be required reading for all engaged and married couples!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb.","review":"Never have I heard anything like this before. And it's so simple! Inspired.

After almost 40 years of marriage I can say that Love & Respect by Dr. Eggerichs is a book that I would have loved to read in my early years of marriage. I can attest that there are no other two elements to a marriage then a husband loving his wife and a wife respecting her husband. This book is a must read for any newlywed couple, any couple who might be experiencing difficulty or just wanting to recharge their understanding of one another. After reading this book I would recommend it to anyone who is married, thinking of getting married or like me, have children who are in the early years of marriage! I give it 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Your Marriage Work","review":"As a counselor, I have recommended this book over and over again.

Anyone who is looking for an answer to the communication gap between men and women should read this book! It also explains the role of the man and the woman in a marriage and how we use our relationship to glorify God. This worked wonders for my marriage and I think it will for anyone else who reads it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so poorly written","review":"This book was practically torture to read through. I could not get over the fact that he never defined respect, or even what he meant by love. Also, enough with the quotes already! His book is half letters from (mostly women) who have read his book or attended his conference and \\"have never heard this message before now.\\" Really? You've never learned that it's important to love and respect your spouse??? Huh?? Who are these people is what I want to know. And, doesn't everyone, regardless of gender, need both love and respect? How do you love someone without showing them respect? Why does he never state that a woman also needs respect? To top it off, it is really poorly written. Ugh..Please, do not waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the other posters who gave it one star. Nearly all the material was opinion based and no research to back it up. The author suggests that women need to forget being tired and give sex to their men. It is more geared toward men than women. And my fiance said that he needs love more than respect.This book is mainly commentary and nothing else. I wasn't impressed and I won't read the book any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Foundational Marriage Book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I had some great conversations with my spouse on the importance of love and respect in a marriage. I believe that this book should be used in all pre-marital counseling sessions.

This book can help two selfish people to begin to show the other the love, attention and respect that they need.

No matter what the situation is in a relationship, one must reserve their own self-respect. I felt as though all will be well if she respects her man is crazy. I felt like he was saying \\"just keep lovin'your man and all will be fine. Love must be strong and tough.

All people need love. Christianity openly dis-respects women calling us weak to our faces in \\"sacred\\" ceremonies that our impressionable daughters hear regularly. It orders us to be subject and enslaved when our liberty is essential to our dignity and our deepest authentic selves. You cannot love unless you love yourselves. Love and respect are the same. Women raised in these religions never know either. Slavery and subjection is neither love nor is it respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of gospel message","review":"I didn't appreciate this book because it lacked any kind of gospel-saturated ideals of marriage. It exalted the Author's theory of what makes a good marriage over what the Bible says makes a good marriage. The Author does use scripture but only to support his \\"secret recipe theory\\". This theory, in a nut shell, is simple: The wife needs to feel loved by her husband and the husband needs to feel respected by his wife. The focus of the book is on the characteristics of the two individuals of a marriage and not on Christ, the Church, the Spirit, or the Father. This is why I did not appreciate the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Respect","review":"When my new girlfriend told me that she had bought this book to read with her old boyfriend who wanted no part of it, I decided that I will purchase a copy so we could read it together, and learn the techniques that the author had cleverly outlined in it, for the benefit of having and maintaining a good and healthy relationship. We are currently in chapter two, and are enjoying every minute reading this book together.I have learned, which this book has also outlined, that the secret to a good relationship is as follows. \\"In order to have and maintain a great and healthy relationship, your level of commitment has to be higher than your feelings.\\" If we all should keep this in mind, we will have great relationships. In my opinion, the biggest devil in most relationships is \\"selfishness.\\" This is an awesome book, and I will recommend it to anyone who is seeking the techniques that can used in everyday relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long","review":"I thought this book was very enlightening and practical. The concepts made a lot of sense and i believe they would help any marriage out of the gutter or a good one get better. I thought that the book was much too long for the content covered. It gets very repetitous and I found myself skipping through pages that seemed to be exactly like the previous ones. It kind of becomes like an extended attempt in trying to prove his theory. I believe the theory but it didn't take over 300 pages to get there.

Enough testimonials from married couples affirm that the consequence of this reciprocal neglect is often an endless cycle of bitter behavior. Eggerichs asks partners to stop the cycle by supplying their mates with the absent attribute. I agree that this is an inherent blind spot to the respective genders; and consequently, an achilles heel in most marriages.

The author may seem a little long winded in the beginning, but it's still worth the read for the nuggets of gold hiding in each paragraph.

If your marriage is not so great, don't give up just yet, this book might be able to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value in being female","review":"Helped me understand myself like I never did. Put great value on being feminine and gentle. I loved that part because I grew up kind of a tomboy and there wasn't very much value put on the sensitive side of women. So it was very refreshing in this dog-eat-dog world to be appreciative of womens natural gentleness. The beginning is a little redundant and got a little slow.

They make this point really well in about 10 pages. The rest of the book is a broken record containing this same point told over... and over... and over... and over... and over... and over... and... well, you get the point. Some of the stories are humorous, and they definitely help make the point in the beginning. But after about 25 pages there is no new information, just a repetition of the same mantra. Don't waste your money. Just ask someone to share the DVD with you from the back of the book. The DVD is a 30 minute book promo that gives you the basic gist of the entire book in only 2-3 minutes. Stop watching after that unless you enjoy watching infomercials. Good point, but it's overblown to sell books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it!","review":"Great book, if you can get past all the G*d talk. Some fundamental, key principles to live by.

This has been a blessing, to both her and to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Blame the wife' should be the title of this book","review":"This book basically blames the wife for all of the breakdowns in a marriage. It bills the husbands needs as valid and important. It indicates that the wife's needs are silly and trivial. Basically, if the woman does everything the husband wants, he will see fit to do these silly trivial things that are 'not in his nature' as the book says. Some parts of the book basically give the husband a license to cheat if he doesn't feel he is getting sexually satisfied, and if that is the case it is the wife's fault. They tell the wife, \\"think about how you would want your son to be treated by his wife\\". Never once did they ask the husband to consider how he would want his daughter to be treated by her husband. This is a totally one-sided book written by a man, trying to manipulate women with scripture. I view it as the same as LDS men trying to tell their wives that God wants them to have more than one wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it and recommend it to everyone","review":"This book is for every couple either married or thinking of getting married.

Looking at Marriage there are so many preconceived ideas that you entertain but getting the Biblical perspective of someone who has been at it for a while as well as the perspective of someone who looks at the man and wife relationship from a different angle than most has proved most helpful.

What he talked about could have been done in two pages. The writing was bad, the examples were not only sexist (and I'm a man!) they were not helpful or clear. I expected that his wife would have some impact in the writing of this book. Perhaps she might write a chapter or add a paragraph but no. It was all him repeating the same chapter over and over and over and over again. His Needs Her Needs was much better. I recommend an even better book, A Lasting Promise, wholeheartedly.

I had the feeling the author was on the man's side and telling us women to show some respect then we'll get love. But I gave it a chance and found that he was fair. He gives both husband and wife their responsibility to give to the other unconditionally. We've been married for 8 years and the book revealed to me what we have been getting wrong. Not every book is for everyone. But this book was definitely for me. It's worth giving it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature Choices","review":"my wife and i have been going through some difficult times.

My wife has not read the book yet, i haven't thrown any hints to my wife , i changed my behavior.

I don't understand why this book is so popular (well actually maybe I do - because it is filled with the simpleton partner manipulating but practical advice that normally sells marriage books). The author makes some interesting observations but does little to address the root cause of problems in marriage.

Is this a reflection on his own marriage, I wonder?Dr. Eggerichs ideas of how women think are very narrow and stereotypical.

He has a couple of good points, such as men are energized when a wife just sits with him, and women want to connect with their husbands by listening and talking. He claims men want respect and women want love. This concept is too rigid. Both men and women want love and respect. I believe God is not pleased at all with the attitude of the author. He is disrespectful when he portrays women in a very negative light. He describes women as being contemptuous, complaining, and negative through out the book, while he portraying men as helpful and serving. He tells women it is a command that they unconditionally respect their husbands, while he is disrespectful to women through out the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny and not helpful","review":"My husband and I were given this book for pre-marital counseling by our pastor and also by some of our Christian friends. I am a therapist and have read many other similar books by John Gottman and others. My husband and I are both Christians, but this book was ridiculous. The way in which the authors explain concepts was very corny and my husband and I spent a lot of time laughing at it. I don't think we even finished the book because it was so unhelpful. There are a lot of other really great books out there that teach the same or better lessons. Don't be fooled into thinking its a good book just because it comes from a Christian base. By the way, we just celebrated our 2 year anniversary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Love and Respect was referred to me from a friend. I believe this is the key to all male/female relationships. This book is a must read for ANYONE that is interested in having a chance at maintaining a working relationship with their spouse!

I like the CDs because I don't have time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Respect","review":"This book does a great job of summarizing the basic needs of men and women in relationships. He describes the cycles of relationships and how we get trapped in \\"The Crazy Cycle\\" vs. putting forth a little extra effort to start a more rewarding \\"Energizing Cycle\\". He defines fears and worries that men have that prevent them from truly loving their wives as well as fears that women harbor, preventing them from respecting their husbands. There are several \\"ah-ha\\" moments when reading this book. By breaking it down into such simple explanations, it is pretty amazing to see how we get easily trapped in the destructive cycles. However, his acronyms \\"C-O-U-P-L-E\\" and \\"C-H-A-I-R-S\\" show and simplify the ways that men can truly display love to their wives (COUPLE - closeness, openness, understanding, peacemaking, loyalty, esteem) and that women can show true respect for their husbands (CHAIRS - conquest, hierarchy, authority, insight, relationship, and sexuality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women won't like this book","review":"This book presents a well balanced view of the marriage relationship. There are many books on how to love your wife but this is the first I know of on how to respect your husband as well as how to love your wife. How many people that travel in Christian circles have ever heard women say \\"I'll respect him as long as he loves God\\" or something similar to it.This book addresses the fact that your obedience to Scripture shouldn't be based on how the other spouse is behaving. It gives you advice for dealing with a difficult spouse who's not being loving or respectful. It tells what their fears may be that are hindering them from giving love and/or respect. The \\"Crazy Cycle\\" section is eye opening.In this book it shows that men can easily be the victims in bad marriages. This book is revolutionary for it's time and won't be received well by many women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Respect Book excellent","review":"This is scripture driven and has helped my already good marriage.

Sadly, I found this book sexist and offensive. In reading it, I find it difficult to conceive that my husband is somehow more deserving of respect than I am because I am a woman. I work full time, just as hard as he does. The main reason our relationship is failing is because of how he's treated me and his spending habits. At least for me, this book is out of touch with my beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Misinterpretation of Biblical Concepts","review":"Love & Respect is one of the worst so-called biblical books on marriage that I have ever read. Dr. Emerson Eggerichs clearly hates women and uses twisted biblical concepts to degrade and humiliate women while promoting male superiority. At no time does he acknowledge that love is God' first priority. His video series is equally demeaning to women and glorifies the male ego to the exclusion of a woman's God given needs. He is rude, caricature-ish, disrespectful, and abusive to women all while attempting to be funny. Eggerichs essentially blames women for the majority of all problems in marriage while giving a free pass to men on their sinful nature which is the result of the fall of man from a Christians perspective. I would never recommend this book and/or video series to anyone seeking to seriously understand and improve their marriage in God's way.

As a Christian woman and counselor, I did find myself offended at some of his presumptions about women, and feel that he did have a biased view. I did not feel understood as a woman. This book is helpful for a couple where the woman is the main problem (being disrespectful and nagging), and the onus seems to be on her, wheras the man's issue seems to be much less offensive (not demonstrating love). It seems to take the personal issues of his relationship with his wife and generalize them to the public. I found Ken Nair's book \\"Discovering the Mind of a Woman\\" to be much more insightful and helpful, where the man takes the role of the servant leader and takes the first step in fostering change."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Our marraige counselor recommended this book and I so glad she did.

I really did not agree with the fact that every woman is the same as every other and so is every man. I also found it very repeatable.

Then this is a must read!","review":"This book was one of the most life changing books I have ever read (next to the Holy Bible). As a married man I knew exactly what I wanted. I also knew exactly when I wasn't getting it. What I did not know was how to convey that to my wife without seeming as though I was condemning her. After I read this book I was armed with an onslaught of new information that became the catalyst for what is now a happy, thriving marriage. Big surprise that the bulk of the changes started with and in me. Realizing what my wife needed allowed me to focus on meeting her needs, which in turn freed her to meet mine. If you are thinking at all about getting this book, DO IT! It's a no brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"the title says it all","review":"I bought this book with my fiance as part of our marriage-preparation studies. IT WAS TERRIBLE. It basically reiterates the same principle over and over and over again in every chapter in not altogether different ways. A DVD (about 15 minutes long) came with the book and after viewing it, the book became meaningless. It was all on the DVD - the whole principle of the book.Furthermore, I am far from a feminist, but the book is very slanted against women. It claims that it's really the woman's fault that the man reacts unlovingly. This really bothered me. My fiance was also sorely disappointed. I do NOT recommend it.

He asked that we read it and out of respect for him I did. Every. Last. Page. My husband and I must be the exception mentioned briefly. We don't match up to any of the stereotypes the author uses.My biggest problem is with the concept that my husband should make all the decisions and that if I disagree with him I should be respectfully quiet. My husband has insight that I as a woman could never have. I should defer to him because God made him in His own image. I however was made in the image of man and therefore lesser.When you take out the pleasant words it boils down to . \\"Keep your stupid female mouth shut and if your unhappy it's all your own fault.\\" Very nice.

Wish this book had been around back in the stone age when I was young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it or Leave it","review":"Ok so I get the concept behind the book, but thought the book was very biased against women. Eggerichs very clearly points out women's faults and that we should respect our husband no matter what and they will love us in return, but he doesn't call for a husband to love his wife even when he isn't feeling respected. I felt like I was being beaten over the head that it's always a woman's fault no matter what the man has done. I also felt that it gives a man an excuse to use or misuse his authority. If a man is not feeling respect, it excuses him from loving his wife and gives him an excuse to be unfaithful while she is expected to not only forgive him but respect him. Not all women are the nagging and yelling type but it portrays all women this way and the men get portrayed as always doing the right thing because they walk away.This book had some good points, but could have been summed up in just a few pages instead of many chapters. After reading it, I felt very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant, Flawed Exegesis","review":"I just got married, and my wife is shocked that there aren't more Christian women that have a problem with Eggerich's assertion that men hold 51% of the responsibility in the marriage. I simply don't deduce that over the Ephesians 5 passage. I have read and studied many commentaries on that passage, and it's just amazing to me that the \\"submit/love\\" call and Eggerich's denunciation of a \\"mutual submission\\" idea is so widely accepted. It's not about feminism or sexism--it's about outright exegetical misinterpretation. I'm surprised no one else in the reviews has mentioned the \\"51% doctrine.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"love and respect","review":"this book was great, however amazon messed my order up completely. i was supposed to get a cd along with the book, but no cd came with it, even though i paid for the cd and the book! kinda frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy delivery and in perfect shape","review":"Title pretty much sums it up.

Not only is it sexist to both women and men, some of the ideas in here are just offensive. There was one line about domestic abuse and how if a husband abuses his wife, he's probably going to do it whether or not she respects him so she might as well honor him. There's another line about the horrors of daycare and how women should stay home with the children. That's great if that's what the wife wants- but what if works fulfills her? What if they can't afford daycare? Most importantly the overall premise of the book is flawed. Every man I've known wants love as much as respect. If he doesn't value love, what is he doing in a relationship? And in 2013, if men don't respect women and honor what they do in and out of the home, they're probably going to end up alone or divorced. Dr. Eggerichs took one ridiculous, simplistic idea and ran with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible acting, weak plot, poorly filmed.

The \\"scene\\" dynamic once again taking something relatively innocent, and putting price tags and labels on it. But this movie is a true classic, and some how captures that era so well. A time when stage diving, being in the pit, and wearing anything and everything to offend others wasn't the status quo. But, all good things must come to an end.

Anyone who has, or now is, experiencing these things will surely relate to and appreciate the reality of this film. I would also suggest anyone pursuing a degree and/or career in sociology watch this film, as it represents an important part of our society - much better than any college textbook ever has. Suberbia according to some so-called film critics is full of gratuitous violence. This is not true, and I bet that if it was rated today, it would easily get a PG-13 at most.

More probable is the diplomatic, strategic and political situation of the country. 60% of industrial output of Switzerland (including chemicals used for manufactuiring of poison gas used in concentration camps), was to Germany in 1940-1945...with no real choice of doing otherwise. So was it an army, probably tough to crush, (but not tougher than Russia's), or the poissibility of having a diplomatic, neutral, semi-\\"friendly\\", country, with banks to put the spoils of war in, to deterr invasion.

Unfortunately, this book consists entirely of quotes and truisms; the so-called author, who would more accurately be referred to as an editor, did no more than compile a bunch of sayings and quips from others without any commentary. On occasion, the quotes are repeated from previous pages; was she just trying to take up space?There are some color illustrations from medieval art included throughout the book, which greatly enhances the book. I find the art to be about the only thing of value about this book, being bored easily by the uninteresting quotes like, \\"Live while ye may, yet happy couple (John Milton).\\"I would not have wasted money on this book if I had seen it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced and cheaply made.","review":"Not worth the money.

The current single \\"Better Off Alone\\" is burning up the charts currently, and many of the other songs on this CD are better. \\"Back In My Life\\", \\"Celebrate Our Love\\" and \\"The Lonely One\\" are more eurodance flavored, while \\"Who Needs Guitars Anyway?\\" and \\"Everything Begins With An E\\" are more techno/trance flavored. Another one of the hot tracks on this CD is \\"Got To Get Away\\", a darker techno song with a great vocal hook in the chorus. Perfect for late night summer parties. As an aside, the [EXPLICIT LYRICS] warning is more for the cover of the CD, as a new cover has been released for more \\"tamer\\" stores like K-Mart & Wal-Mart.

Alice Deejay is enjoying success on the charts not only with their debut single \\"Better Off Alone\\" which has an amazing hook, but also their debut album.In order to respect this album and group, you have to like eurodance. It is a genre of music all its own, aside from pop, house and electronica. To the albums discredit, much of it does sounds repetitive at first listen, which may detract some people. Certain songs like \\"The Lonely One\\", \\"Better Off Alone\\" and \\"Alice Deejay\\" are catchy and will most likely catch fire.In order for a group like this to survive, they will definitely have to diversify their sound to include at least other forms of dance music besides eurodance.

Nobody dislikes Alice Deejay. I was a eurobeat DJ in the 80s but this new eurobeat music will put me back in buisness. Eurobeat was an underground thing for a long time, now the music has more high tech and more energy and much better lyric content than 10 years ago.

Typical post-SNAP euro-dance Robert Miles BOOM-bzz-BOOM-bzz \\"trance\\" schlock with poorly recorded cajoling diva vocals on top. \\"Oooh ahh baby oooh aahhh oooh baby.\\" Make it stop.

Proper musicians need guitars. They make real music which has real lyrics which mean something, and proper instruments. This is a despicable piece of filth. It combines all that I most despise in music; disco beats, hi-NRG rave, vocoders, and chart pop filth. Still, at least it doesn't feature Spanish guitars. It is despicable. None of the tracks have proper guitars or drums, and it is a record for gurning hardhouse morons and brainless teen girls who should be destroyed.

Spent last week and the week before doing dishes, and earned enough to get it a week earlier than my schedule had predicted I'd get it. Songs on it are mostly techno with a little piano here and there. Of course Alice sings, too. Listening to waiting for your love while typing and thinking about my favorite songs. Back in my life is excellent. My favorite right now. Everything begins with an E is good too. Makes you think of water and sun.

And while this CD is not exceptional, it is still very good and worth the money. Better off ALone is apopular favorite, but the CD introduces you to Want you back in my life and others. We even get some MONO type of music. Out of the 14 tracks, 7 are excellent....5 are very good, and the remaining two are somewhat passable. This is still a very worthy effort, especially from newcomer Alice Deejay. Perhaps the most popular artist in Miami for Trance...if you like Alice you;ll LOVE George Acosta's trance mixes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I don't know why this CD got an average of 4 stars.

I became interested with it automatically. Then I heard \\"Back In My Life\\" on the radio. I liked that too. So, I decided to buy her album, \\"Who Needs Guitars Anyways\\". Well obvoiusly, I am not happy with this album. Mainly all the songs sound very similar, or exactly the same. You can tell that most of these songs were written in 5 minutes. All they did was write a catchy sentence, found an annoying beat, and repeated that sentence over and over again. It just doesn't seem fair that a group can make an album like this and become rich. Anyone can do what they do on this album. So please listen to my advice.

Without fail every single track is uplifting and catchy, and there is some variation in the tracks too, from the chilled out vibe of 'Fairytails' and 'Everything Begins with an E' to the energetic 'The Lonely one' and 'No More Lies'. If you liked the singles that have been released so far, you'll be surprised at the quality remaining on the album. 'I can see' is simply the most amazing dance tune ever and is compemented by 'Waiting For Your love', whilst 'Who Needs Guitar's Anyway?' is the sister of 'Everything Begins with an E'. The weakest tune on the album is 'Got to Get Away' (which still is ok) simply because it's less catchy than the others. However this album overall is fantastic, and if you are a fan of pop/dance music and liked the singles, failing to buy this album would be one of the biggest mistakes of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"here we go again.....","review":"Well, let's see.... you put vocals on newer style electronic beats, repeat, and then repeat again and you have a CD that will sell.

Boy, was I ever wrong. this entire album sounds like an 8-track recording, with little more than a 909 thump kick and hat (Boom-tsch-boom-tsch) and ridiculously simple, predicable basslines. Once and a while there's a synth lead that goes nowhere and does nothing, musically or sonically. Seriously, I don't think anyone with a substantial collection of dance records would enjoy this. The remixes are spectacular, but the album really falls flat. I would suggest exploring the Trance[]Control or DJ Tiesto material if you think this is worthwhile. Honestly, this is truly thin and uninspired. I don't understand the warm reception, excpet that perhaps its evidence that the current lack of standards in trance / dance pop really has had a deep affect on the average casual listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun stuff","review":"I have to be honest, I bought this CD blindly and completely upon the strength of their chart-topping \\"better off alone\\" track. I have to say that I was utterly amazed how good the whole disk sounded as a whole. The disk starts off with Back in my life which sets the tone for the rest of the disk (50 minutes of catchy dance anthems). This is an extremely fun indefatigable dance album, crazy good party music.

Check this out and have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phosphor Bronze Bass Strings","review":"The bass strings sound pretty good on my new resonator bass (It came with strings for an electric bass guitar). The only thing I can find to criticize them for is that the \\"knots\\" (little rings at the bottom end) are a bit too small for my application. I got them to hold in the tail-piece notches, but just barely. I wonder if they will hold for the long haul.

In stead of a new surprise with every song, we get a carefully selected list of songs that sound commercially enough to make it sound good to anyone -but where's the excitement ? This album is plain boring, except for maybe 2 or 3 tracks... (Sergio Mendes' \\"What is Love\\" to name one).

Few composers come even close to the emotions in this piece - they seem genuine, heartfelt, and unforced.

Dawn Upshaw's vocal performance is like another instrument in the orchestra - so gently does its sound become heard.

A remarkable piece and perfect music to accompany the reading of a good book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing piece of music","review":"This opera is absolutely amazing.

Stefania Woytovicz's performance on Schwann/Koch (released as early as 1978 on LP and long before this million-seller) not only has that, but is simply heartbreaking, and Kamirski and the BRSO sensitively support her. The ascendancy of this Nonesuch recording says volumes about the power of publicity vs. true artistic merit.

It is a very moving symphony. Dawn Upshaw's voice is transcendent. Benjamin Britten's, \\"War Requiem\\" is another highly recommended CD of similar scope to own and listen to over and over. It is highly recommended to read the poetry in the liner notes in both of these CD's to understand the music completely--as any astute music lister would do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanity At Its Best","review":"In his straightforward way, Gorecki cultivates a seed planted by an anonymous victim of horrors perpetrated by humanity at its worst. His result, the most beautiful and compassionate elegy for innocent sufferers of the 20th Century, cries out to God in a way no other music ever has. Were my soul to be put on a CD, I like to imagine it sounding something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorecki:Symphony no 3/Zinman,Upshaw, London Sinfonietta","review":"This album must be listened with upmust attention, in a serene atmosphere and by a very good stereo system. My car stereo was inadequate in capturing neither the harmony nor the range of crechendo - decrechendos. 24 Score harmony and the wide range of decibels creates a harmonic distortion, if not listened by an excellent audio system with powerful woofers. This is one of the best music ever composed; at least it feels like when listened in the right mood. Dawn Upshaw's voice and interpretation is heavenly. This probably is her best performance and should place her on the top of the short list of sopranos of our time. David Zinman's conducting haunts the listener.He sounds like he has Gorecki in his soul; almost like they are the same. London Sinfonietta's performance is impeccable and raises the bar to unreachable levels. This masterpice should be heard by all music afficionados.Timur Sumer"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor playing quality","review":"CD of Henryk Gorecki Sympnony 3 Sorrowful Songs, had extremely poor playing quality at the beginning and then as it played through had areas of variable sound throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unbelievable Piece of Music","review":"I just heard this symphony yesterday for the first time and I couldn't believe my ears. It is without a doubt one of the worst pieces of music I have ever heard. The music droned on and on and kept repeating the same theme over and over. Dawn Upshaw has an attractive, even alluring voice but I couldn't wait until the piece was over. I have heard her sing other music which I found thoroughly enjoyable. I can't believe someone in their right mind could compose such a horror as this. If I have to listen to this piece ever again, I will become a mental patient.

I then tried to grate cheese and not only did the disc come loose and make a crack in the bowl, the motor slowed down to the point where the machine stopped working. This was a regular block of cheddar, not even frozen! I then tried to slice carrots and celery. Not only were the slices totally not uniform in size, the motor was straining to slice them.

The opening chapters lead one to expect another chapter in the tedious history of \\"Griffith bashing\\" whereby one film has led an over-critical evaluation of the director's other works. But, instead, the author supplies not just a recreation of 1916 Hollywood and its contemporary players but two leading characters affected by deep-rooted prejudices, one of whom will change remarkably by the end of the novel while the other will, at least, recognize his limited perspectives. HOLLYWOOD AND SUNSET thus becomes an engaging early twentieth century comedy of manners dealing with recognizable characters trapped within their own particular ideological perspectives but who, sometimes, have the chance of transcending them. This is a really interesting achievement demanding wider readership and recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"After all of the publicity surrounding this novel, I found the content disappointingly non-stimulating.

He continuously insults and criticizes the religion as well as the prophet. The book is written wonderfully in terms of literary concept, but the information is flawed.

This is a lousy book and not even worth the effort of a death threat. Obscurity is a far worthier fate for it. Yes, it's blasphemous to Islam but the sacrilege is in the context of the rantings of a mad man who's in the throes of a crisis of faith. So once you're over the shock, and once you note that most of the characters in it should be committed, the blasphemy''s pretty easy to dismiss. What's harder to ignore is that as a piece of literature, this is a hard to read and schizophrenically written book. What exactly is it saying? What's with the weird fantasy plot - two people falling off a plane and one turns into a devil and the other an angel - that meanders without any discernible purpose? It's funny in spots and brilliant in others but it's so uneven in quality and has very dull long stretches it's as if it really is written by someone insane.

It portrays an exiled Islamic cleric, the Imam, who surrounds himself with bodyguards to avoid seeing London (where he lives). Upon his return to his homeland, he metamorphoses into a man-eating monster. That this segment is a thinly veiled comment on Khomeini himself (who was exiled in London during the reign of the Shah) should be obvious to anyone. The (ultimately rather respectful) portrayal of the prophet Mohammed merely provided a useful cover for the Ayatollah's childish revenge on Rushdie for his satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"Terrific book.

His word usage is unique but a more boring tirade I have never read. It is a shame the author has been so long tortured by a gang of religious fanatics who took this thing seriously. It took me years to get around to it after hearing all the fuss and I still do not know the source of the commotion. My sense of art has never been mainstream, but,Allah,please return the hours I have just wasted on this tripe. I can not even pretend to be on the band wagon."},{"rating":"2","title":"complex, thought-provoking, funny","review":"This perhaps one of the greatest books I have ever read. What I find so fascinating and compelling about Rusdhie's writing is his ability to address mutliple cultural, social and political themes within a single work. His witty and darkly satirical writing style also lend tremendous humour to this work. Mr. Rushdie explores everything from the legacy of colonialism and neo-colonialism, questions the basis of Western notions of good and evil, challenges religious extremism and ponders the complexity of human relationships. Certainly, this isn't an easy book. However, I feel that the issues that Mr. Rushdie seeks to address are not simple ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Classic","review":"Rushdie's The Satanic Verses is aruguably on of the most important works of the last half of the twentieth century. Full of Middle Eastern metaphor and sensibilities, Rushdie propels the reader into a world little seen nor understood in the west. The lyrical and poetic style reads as in a way that is timless, the reader may well forget that this work is a modern text. Yet at the same time the themes are as meaningful today as when this work was first published. Rushdie's work is required reading for anyone seeking understanding of our post-9/11 world"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most original book I have read in a long long time!","review":"I can't put this book down! Mr. Rushdie is a classicly skilled writer - not a beginner to the art - and those of you who hunger for well written prose will not be disappointed. Satanic Verses is a classic reiteration of the age-old question \\"Who are we and why are we here?\\" There is much provocation for the mind in those pages, and I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought out!!!","review":"In this book, Rushdie does an excellent job of bringing out creative ideas. Metamorphosis, the description of Saladin and Chamcha's life has made this book one of my favorites.

It is absurd to suggest that Mr Rushdie has merely 'stolen' and degraded a story from Islamic culture. While this may not be Rushdie's greatest novel (subjectively, I would rate it lower than both 'Midnight's Children' and 'The Moor's Last Sigh'), surely one of its most remarkable achievements is in the way in which he synthesises material from the Islamic tradition with pure fiction. It is unfortunate that this book mainly became famous through the fundamentalist reaction to it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing with words.","review":"I found this book difficult to follow. I know I wasn't getting all the references to religion. I'm not very well versed in the area. Overall I wasn't able to understand what was going on, but individual scenes made sense. What I like most about this book was his use of language and the bizarre flow of the book. I had to read aloud for the first half of the book until my brain could cope with the style. As far as content, no wonder muslims wanted to kill him. But, he takes pock shots at every other religion too. I guess muslims don't have a sense of humor, or can't take a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"satanic verses","review":"I'm having trouble sticking with it.

I got to be honest, I could not finnish it, I tryed 3 or 4 times. My mind simply closed of. First of all I found the story extremly boring and second af all I dislike his style very much, the way he goes back and forth in time! I do recomend people to read it though, because there seems to be very different ideas about it; people either love it or hate! For me, worst book I have ever read...and I have read a couple! Would give it 0 stars if I could! Arni"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow up!","review":"It is all very well to make a tand against Islam, if that was Rushdie's want, but over this book; its not worth it. I don't see how any religious leader could really have taken offence over such a puerile novel as this. The writing is amateurish, the premise is stupid and the attacks against the Islamic faith are contrived and ill-concieved.This novel is not worth the time, effort or controversy which is lavished upon it. I give this one star only because it is a required minimum it isn't even worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read ...","review":"... and I've read a lot of books. I've said more in a 40 word article than anything written in one paragraph of this book. The hype about the author writing the book and his being on the receiving end of a personal jihad make a better plot and captivate my interest more than the plotline of this book. My deepest regret is that I couldn't rate this book with negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, over long, over the top","review":"This is a really very disappointing read. If it had not been for Rushdie's networking and the controversy he courted this book would gone out of print long ago. Too many critics were too afraid to say that emperor has no clothes, and praised this book, because of politics and not for reasons of literature. This book is nothing but second rate magic realism applied by a third rate mind- whose odepial conflict and self-loathing is given free rein, to produce a fourth rate text. It is stange that such a purile work is considered to be philosophical. His treatment of Islamic history is both bigoted and ignorant, his ideas regarding unbelief and faith never go beyond bar room bluster. Reading the book is like being trapped in an elevetor with Cliff from Cheers- but without the humour or humanity. Don't waste your money- the book is no longer chic and its expensive to serve as door-stop. Spare the trees that would die in vain for such a rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I read it.","review":"When I started reading the book, I thought something wonderful was going to happen. But, unfortunately, with no sense of humor,I read thousands of words written aimlesly.

I truly believe this is a book that would be more interesting if one increased their medication level way past the recommended daily dosage.Mark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit for a bonfire","review":"There are few books which I have started but not finished but this is sadly one of them. The Muslims made a big mistake giving this the publicity they did. It should have been ignored. Do not waste time on Rushdie. He is not worth it. Sadly there is no option less than one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll laugh a lot with this one","review":"Hello,I read other reviews (for the paperback format) and there were a lot of customer complaints about Mr. Rushdies's writing style for the novel. I agree that it takes some concentration to follow. So I advise future readers to take their time and absorb this funny, and emotional ( i thought that the end was tearful) story.You will often find yourself reading a hilarious and often ridiculous paragraph and then come to a part that will truly make you think about life.Now the book does have quite a bit of religious references that went over my head as I'm not familiar with them, so I took in some of the stories in an obvious and superficial fashion. Ultimately I enjoyed this book and encourage others to read it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I am very satisfied with the condition of this book.

But I did not finish the first chapter, as it was a very diffficult read to me and rather convoluted. Item arrived in good condition and on time,"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just A Story","review":"In the Satanic Verses, Salman Rushdie, goes far beyond the bounds of mere storytelling, and brings poetry back to the art form of writing.While it is hard to describe the style in which Rushdie tells this seemingly all-emcompasing story, a read of the first few pages will hook any serious literary student.Not many people have mastered the english language (James Joyce and Leonard Cohen to name two) well enough to truly write a poetic novel.Being my first rushdie book I will immeadiately begin to read another. As a writer I cannot express how inspiring this book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming","review":"This one goes into my library of shame, among the very few books that I ever failed to finish. I tried hard but could not connect with the whole theme, topic and the message, whatever it was. It is not that I expected it to be a breeze, but still, Satanic Verses overwhelmed me completely. Too many allegories, symbols and chaotic scenes as his mind and writing jumps from past to fantasy to supernatural.

It's filled with human compassion and every emotion you have will be tested reading it. I have done a lot of research on Islam and see how Muslims could get upset. But to place a death-sentance? I'm 17 and sorta understood things, but I am buying the book to read when I get older (and wiser!). I encourage everybody to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped because of the controversy.","review":"This book's high sales are solely due to the controversy it created. Rushdie has written far better books such as Shame and Midnight's Children. Although Rushdie is famous for his abrupt shifts in scene he seems to lose the thread of the story himself in the middle. His chatty style can also get irritating. The few lucid parts are engrossing, however. Not worth the effort, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Difficult Read","review":"This is not a book for the faint of heart. It is a difficult book to read. The allusions to the Qu'uran are clear. While the Muslim extremists took umbrage, there wasn't any religious put down that the majority of readers would find offensive. Readers will ultimately wonder if the book sold because it's a really good book or if the fatwah against Rushdie made readers want to find out what might have made the Ayatollah declare a death threat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick and satisfying questioning of authority","review":"Don't be put off by the insidery folks' ... that \\"you have to know Islam.\\" It's an easy read. If you know that Mohammed is Islam's prophet, you'll understand the book and exactly why the Muslims are upset. It's an interesting enough tale, well-spun, and I enjoyed Rushdie's unique voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rushdie Fan but this was a waste of my money and time.","review":"I read \\"Shalimar the Clown\\" and was smittem with the beauty of Salman Rushdie's writing. When the Joseph Anton Biography was released I enjoyed learning more about Slaman life. After reading all the difficulty that the Satanic Verses had caused so many people I decided to go ahead and pay the steep price charged for my Kindle copy of Satanic Verses. Well I really tried and tried but after about a third of book I decided to quit beating myself up by trying to continue a book that was offering me nothing but stress."},{"rating":"2","title":"a complex story with ingested criticism","review":"The author is an expert when providing criticism that is interwoven into his narrative. I was drawn to this book bcause I read his short stories and because of the criticism by certain religious groups. What I find most interesting is that this book is not easy to read and the remarks he makes are not blatant. More than anything, you can easily find yourself bored at times when reading this book. No author in the world should be able to trigger any group this literally. ---Get something else to do. Go to a movie. Get laid. There is nothing here that couldnt be discounted the same way as changing the channel on the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring book","review":"I could not figure why the author had a jihad on his head, but then, I could not read beyond half the book. May be it is a funny or meaningful book for Indians as there are many references to their religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm....can you say overrated ???","review":"thought i would check this book out after having heard for years how amazing and clever it is.it is rare for me to completely abandon a book mid-way through, but it became unbearable.i think this book would've ended up in the scrap heap of whatever publisher put this out originally if khomeni had not made such a big deal about it.rushdie's writing style is annoying and non-sensical. the pretentious reader may find the prose enjoyable, if only to impress others in their social circle.maybe there are deeper meanings and references for indian and/or muslim people. but since i am neither, i really didn't care.if you find it provocative, you may want to shock yourself into numbness by watching south park.overall, not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read, even more difficult to understand.","review":"A bookclub I belong to read this book.

I am sorry for the time and money wasted for this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Hype","review":"This book is not as good it could've been. Rushdie has talent but there were two major stories that could've been (Gibreel and Salahuddin) and should've been two different, shorter novels. It would've been a different story, obviously, but it would've been a better one.The book was too long, too wordy, heavy on description and history of characters for it's own sake. Almost 500 pages into it and then SOMETHING starts to happen and even then, it's three heavy chapters of further explanation of two events that aren't necessarily spectacular.I did not like the book and felt that i put way too much into trying to understand a book that leaves the reader, as MANY reviewers noted, \\"disoriented\\". The first ten pages are hard to get into. I was about to drop it but i decided to finish and i did. It's not the worst book I have read but it's disappointing because you have a talented writer, an interesting idea for a story but poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story first, jihad later...","review":"I don't get why the Ayatollah wanted this guy dead. Don't pick this book up expecting some blasphemous, controversial diatribe, cause it ain't there. But there is a great story here, which will suck you in and steer you to places far and wide. If you like writers whose imaginations are boundless and whose language is pristine (unlike mine), then read The Satanic Verses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it from the library","review":"If you would like to read this book, don't support Rushdie by purchasing his book; just borrow it from the library. Better yet, skip his mind games and go straight to the primary source, the Holy Qur'an, and find out the truth for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent text on practical self defense!A real classic.","review":"Kill or Get Killed, despite the rather ominous sounding title, is probably one of the best texts on self defense and unarmed combat ever written.Many of the techniques shown are still very useful today,despite the fact that the book was written during W.W.2.It's a real classic, yet very practical book that anyone interested in true self defense and hand-to-hand combat will treasure and learn a great deal from.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only if you are a police officer","review":"Classic, must read book basically because it is a milestone in hand to hand combat manuals.BUT: of the 400+ pages, only the first 50 or so actually speak about unarmed combat, the rest is all about guns,shooting tecs, knife fighting, riot controlling (the book was written when that was a major conflict scenario), immobilizing a prisoner, handcuffing a prisoner etc etc etc....That is, if you are not a law enformcement agent, completely useless, as in a street fight you don't want to handcuff your opponent, you want to beak him the nose and leave !To learn the few basic tecs to strike the opponent, the book is quite accurate and detailed, even more than W.E.Fairbarns \\"Get tough\\" , plus the photos are clearer (although black and white).I would say, a must for your combat library, but for training/skill developing, look elsewhere and use other books (I strongly recommend the 2 \\"Solo training\\" series)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Killed","review":"This is a pretty interesting book on the way of fighting that was taught during world war two and up til the 80's or 90's. As far as an effective fighting system...I dont see how this system was effective in making soldiers from the OSS to the First Special Service Force effective killers. Seems to me that if you practiced this every day youd still get your ass handed to you. Good read but some of the things used here is more like girly fighting. The thumb locks and all seem pretty cheesy. I cant believe this was used to teach the military how to kill. Its a joke of a system if you ask me. Just like U.S. army combatives its a joke and it sucks compared to Eskrima...a REAL and EFFECTIVE and PROVEN fighting system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor quality","review":"Some pages looks like copies of copies.Pictures are very old and dark black and white.Interesting book though and very relevant to self defence students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Ramblings","review":"Do not get this book.

The author continually extols the virtues of using your natural arm swing to swing a golf club without describing how to actually perform the swing. To summarize the book...rotate the left arm counterclockwise on the takeaway and use your natural arm swing to deliver the club to the back of the ball. What? What the heck is the natural arm swing? Apparently all I have to do is swing the club the same way I walk because that is the only explanation.Apparently this guy was a lawyer too.

InAustralia during the early 20th century, half-caste Aboriginal children weretaken from their mothers and placed in orphanages. It was thought that ifthey intermarried, their Aboriginal blood would be 'watered down' after threegenerations.This movie, based on a true story, is about three sister who escape from anorphanage and make a trek along the Rabbit-Proof Fence, the longest fencein the world, in order to find their way home again. It is a movie that willmake you cry and get up and cheer much likeSlumdog Millionaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"I was fortunate to see this movie while visiting Sydney, Australia in February. Having heard about the stolen generation, I was ignorant of the policies established concerning the legal abduction of Aboriginal children from their families until I saw this film based on a true story.I was expecting a documentary-like, low-budget film. Instead, I found myself captivated on so many levels by a film that was not only well written, but well produced, directed, and acted. I was shocked to find out that this practice was legal until 1970. More importantly, I was amazed and inspired by the determination of Molly, Daisy, and Gracie as they journeyed 1,600 km to return home.I am presently reading \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" written by Molly's daughter Doris Pilkington (Nugi Garimara).

It's a damning take on society and could represent any big city in the industrialized world but I think setting it in London works so well given the way British society is.The movie also works as a thriller which is what it is really with the social commentary not overbearing or preachy at all.

The characters are unconvincing, Tatou's attempt at a Turkish accent is completely incomprehensible, and the central conflict is absolutely undefendable.As a whole, this film depicts immigrants in a overwhelmingly one-dimensional manner, becoming, by the end, an insult to the very people it is meant to \\"represent\\".

Besides, this version is a real delight both because of the presentation (it's a double album) and the recording quality. Don't think it twice and get it. You certainly won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good recording of an unpopular musical","review":"I played Ann Draper in this musical in high school, and had never heard of it, but many of the songs are very well known. The plot is mostly composed of love stories and a war fought with the Swiss over cheese because it was made with Grade B milk. VERY CHEESY! But it is really a fun show, with upbeat music and some really funny lyrics. This performance is especially good, Rebecca Luker's voice is just perfect for Joan. And I have yet to find the entire musical performed as on this disc. And if you're a real Gershwin lover, you'll appreciate all of the deleted songs at the end, as well as a very good libretto. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photography, boring story","review":"I expected a movie full of awesome camera shots and an interesting story. I thought this movie was rather boring and the photography was not particularly impressive.The film was well edited and produced and IMAX footage is always really great but I was expecting alot more. HD quality was great. I found the bonus features (making of the movie) much more interesting than the actual film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment...","review":"This game had potential...before I beat it after about 9 hours. Extremely short game, with very little replay value makes for a dissapointing game! Every mission seems the same...Chase a villian through New York for about 15 min., then if you kept up you'll end up fighting the villian. Playing as Venom was cool, but his missions were more or less the same as Spidey's. Chase, keep up, boss battle, thats all the game was about. Gets old real fast! This game is barely worth 10 bucks! The Limited Edition didn't really have anything extra worth mentioning. When are they going to make a Spider-Man game that is more like GTA? I need more free roaming fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hold up that lets down","review":"I bought this product because I was looking for the product I was useing and could no longer find. I was let down. When I applied it to my damp hair it made it stiff like straw. It was hard to pull a comb through it without breaking my hair. After I rolled and dried it, It did look good and it held the curls but it is not worth the hair pulling for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 year old not impressed.","review":"My son has not played with this toy twice.

Maybe a younger child would like it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping","review":"I'll echo the other reviews here except for the shipping issues. Maybe they've cleaned things up a bit, but my bike came in a box with a half-dozen compression straps holding the box together and everything was intact and nothing was broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus.The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"This is by far the best exercise bike I have ever owned. Easy to put together, easy to operate and extremely quiet. I am so glad that I purchased this bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bike, Awful Shipment","review":"I have been using this bike for a week now as a replacement for a broken bike from a different manufacturer. The bike is very smooth in operation and very quiet. No problems at all. The shipping condition is a different matter. As other reviewers have experienced the bike arrived via UPS in awful condition. I took pictures of the shipping container before I even touched it anticipating a damaged shipping claim. Upon assembly I found one piece completely destroyed - the end cap to the rear support tube. So, the bike is functional and Schwinn has promised to send me a replacement support tube cap. Anyway, so far I do like the bike a lot and the purchase was well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful addition to my home workout space","review":"I just love this bike. It was easily assembled, and it is totally silent! It is easy to conduct a conversation and/or watch TV while biking. The price was more than reasonable. I think if you are in the market for a stationary bike, this is it! IT takes little footprint, yet is sturdy and competent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and quiet (but needs a better seat)","review":"This is a terrific bike for the price -- assembly was simple, and the finished product is virtually silent. We had a minor issue with a \\"thump thump\\" from one of the pedals, but it turned out to need to be really, REALLY tight.The seat, though, isn't the most comfortable in the world. It's a bit on the wide side (to accommodate American butts) and not padded well. Luckily, it has a standard bicycle mount, so you can visit your favorite bike store and replace it.One other nit: The programs are all six minutes long. Five would have been more convenient if you like to do a round-number workout. I like to do 20 minutes, so it's 18 + some. Still, it's a minor thing in an otherwise well-made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy another schwinn!","review":"We have a C130 upright less than 3 years old. The resistence died. Called their customer service and they'll send someone out for over a hundred bucks to look at it, order the part and then charge us another $75 to come back and install it. After a lot of research -- the schwinn site is useless for support info -- found an aftermarket parts and repair site and it looks like the unit we'd need to fix this is >$400!

I used mine a total of 23 times at low resistance...now its at the curb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schwinn Customer","review":"One star is too high a rating, but I can't put in a zero. I received this bike in defective condition. After I assembled it, it would not crank at all-not one turn. Since it was supposedly under warranty I called the Schwinn Customer Service number. The representative wanted me to check the pedals and adjust the support bracket. The pedals turned freely and the bracket is welded in place-no adjustment possible. I insisted that the defect was internal and needed a trained technician to fix. The representative finally agreed to arrange for a technician to come to my house to fix it. Then she told me a technician would contact me within 5 days. There was no promise that the tech would come within 5 days or 5 months. This is no warranty at all in my opinion. I'm returning the bike through Amazon who was very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy assembly","review":"My boyfriend and I had this bike put together from the box in 30 minutes. We couldn't believe how easy Schwinn made it for the layperson to assemble. I haven't had a chance to ride it yet, I'll follow up with that soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon has the wrost customer service","review":"The bike delivered to my door was damaged in a completely broken package. Directly sent it back and asked for a replacement. Because of it, the delivery date was much later than promised. Now, Amazon want to charge me with the damaged and returned bike. Amazon had no reposne to my complaints. All the communications (e-mails) got retuned back. Amazon purposely does not let their customers to send them complaints by returning customers' e-mails. Their e-systems are just for orders and credit card numbers. Had to call credit card company to dispute the charge. Shame on Amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Bike!","review":"I was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations. It's more than quiet, it's SILENT. Very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs. The bike is sturdy and easy to put together. It's compact and doesn't take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable. I couldn't be more happy with this purchase. For those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised, my box had a dent or two, but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"This bike is compact and a great deal as mentioned in the other reviews. It works for taller people (my husband and I are both over 6 feet) just fine, but is a little strained when trying to do a standing biking workout-- great if you remain sitting the whole time. Manual and programs work great and it is lightweight to move in and out of it's storage spot by the wall to its use spot in the middle of the room. Be sure you have a plug nearby for it is a short cord, or get an extension cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems to work but have earplugs","review":"we bought this unit because our son has some allergies. after using it, it seems he has gotten better but when you turn this on from 2-3 on the fan, it's like you're sitting in a AC unit. it's pretty noisy, but i guess this is the price you'll have to pay for better health.read jerry bond's review to save some $ on the filters which cost an arm and a leg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"Love product and would buy again.

But, I had a guy come into my working studio, (art studio), and when he sanded the spackle on the ceiling, the dust went everywhere. He didn't take the right precautions to contain the spackle dust, powder or whatever. Well, it when EVERYWHERE ! ! I couldn't go into my own studio without chocking on that ***%^##% dust, power. I had it cleaned several times, and when the contractor suggested that I get an AIR PURIFIER to clear the air, I did. Well, it DIDN'T !Anyway, perhaps a much larger unit would do it. I'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot see a difference at all!","review":"Have been using nonstop since I received it August 17, 2010. I have not noticed one bit of difference.

Bad mistake purchasing this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamma Mia!","review":"I absolutely love this movie!!! The music is fantastic, the singing phenomenal (the girls mostly), and the acting incredible!!! Meryl Streep is absolutely at her finest (yet again) as Donna while up and comer Amanda Seyfried has the perfect mix of ballsy innocence and moxie as Sophie. The bonus features are fun (Karaoke anyone??) and the commentaries great. Blooper reel is funny and I could go on forever.

The acting and singing were superb, except for Pierce Brosnan. Sorry Pierce, but singing is not your forte! But who cares - he's still great to look at! And please watch this movie through the credits. To see the Elvis impersonations at the end...LOL. This movie made me smile...laugh...belly laugh until I was crying. I rarely buy a movie, but this one I had to have it. If you love Abba, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, etc. get this movie and watch it. Watch it often. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining & Fun","review":"We saw this in the theatre and was very excited when it came out to purchase. Such a fun and entertaining movie. The scenery is awesome, especially with the blue ray... Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I got this as a present for my father. He really enjoyed watching the movie, and thought it was great in blue ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls Night in","review":"Grab your girlfriends and get ready to sing! If you like ABBA and can look beyond the totally contrived plot of the movie, you will have a blast singing along in this totally feel-good movie about friendship, mother/daughter relationships, dreams, and love. I promise the songs will stay in your head for DAYS! The scenery is gorgeous and the movie is fun. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, watched more than once","review":"If you loved ABBA when growing up, you will love this movie. It's not just a girls flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamma Mia!","review":"Loved this movie in the theatre and love it more now that I own it. Even my 8yr old son loves to watch it with me. We go around the house singing the soundtrack. We would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, so it's not an Academy Award winner...","review":"But it's a lot of fun to watch! And come on people, who doesn't love a little ABBA once in a while? I'd bet that most of us have an old ABBA song that we remember well enough to sing along with in the privacy of the car, maybe even an old ABBA album stashed away somewhere, even if we'd never admit it to the guy that sits next to us at the office. Mamma Mia suits the mood, soothes that 30 year old memory of listening to ABBA songs. This movie is really cheesy in some parts, but that's easily overlooked while you're tapping your toe and singing along under your breath! Forget the cheesy, don't be too critical of Pierce Brosnan's singing, kick-up your feet, relax and enjoy the show, cuz it really is a light-hearted, entertaining movie. And in this world today, light-hearted entertainment may be just what you need!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too contrived...","review":"Don't get me wrong....I like Meryl Streep a lot, Pierce Brosnan is okay, too. Individually, the cast has some credentials.I even like the music of ABBA.But when you put them all together and try to spin a story based on the lyrics it is more than very very bad. It is moronic. The movie Hard Days Night was more imaginative. Any episode of the Monkees flows more smoothly.If these were my friends I would be embarrassed for them. It is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go See The Play","review":"The actors were too old. Meryl Streep is a great actress but, let's face it, she was way too old for the part as were the others, I saw the play and it was alot better than the movie, the actors \\"fit\\" thier part and could sing better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling sexist drivel","review":"As a woman, I found this movie unbearable and gave up after 45 minutes. Every female character is a vacuous giggling drama queen who should be on meds for bipolar disorder. To be fair, the men aren't much better. Surely the cast saw the script. Shame on the whole pack of them for sinking to this. I hope whoever holds the rights to Abba is suing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the play, you will hate the movie","review":"If you loved this play, you will truly be disappointed in the quality of the acting and singing in this movie. It was laughable at times. Very Hard to watch and painful to see Pierce Brosnon singing. It just does not work for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a musical?","review":"I saw the stage version of this and it was a delight, so I thought I'd try the movie & like an idiot I even bought it! What a disappointment!!! It is ESSENTIAL that the actors in a musical can sing!! It should have made like some old musicals: The King & I and South Pacific, etc. dubbed those atrocious voices, then it would have again been a light, fun film with great ABBA music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is AWFUL!!!!!","review":"I cannot believe all the 5 star reviews. I was looking forward to this movie because EVERYONE LOVED IT! I guess I am in the minority, because the movie had no plot plus the singing is really bad. Meryl Streep, a great actress, is not right for this part as is most of the cast. It is almost like the cast is having a ongoing party and forget they are making a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal ABBA music","review":"It does not matter what this story is of-ABBA music says it all.And nice semi-naked bodies of any gender performers either add to a visual pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama Mia","review":"Dear Amazion,The service outstanding,I am planing order again in the further.The book was in excellent condition.Delivery was fast.Thank youDouglas Coad"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN! FUN! FUN!","review":"The title says it all! Great music, great actors, zest for living and a beautiful Greek isle. Watching this movie is a wonderful escape and a chance to revel in ABBA all over again. I'm 65 years old but this movie makes you want to get up, dance and sing. Thank you Meryl Streep and ABBA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews on this film; there must be a lot of curmudgeons out there. First of all, most people who went to see Mamma Mia love ABBA and all their songs. Obviously no one can sing these songs even half as well as ABBA did, but so what? Bjorn and Benny's music is so wonderful it stands on its own no matter who sings it. This film is fun, the gorgeous Greek setting makes it pure eye candy, the songs no matter how \\"imperfectly\\" they were sung are still infectious and make you want to jump out of your seat and dance, and you will sing along with most of them. This movie does exceedingly well what it is supposed to do: entertain. As for the ABBA music, I probably wouldn't buy this soundtrack and rather, I would buy the original ABBA music if I wanted a CD of the songs on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Meryl Streep is pretty good. Pierce Brosnan is awful - he can't sing and shouldn't try. There is a kind of peculiar slant to this movie - all the strong roles go to women - the men are weak and have marginal roles. Most of the emotional and physical intimacy is between women with men shut out. If this is your cup of tea, you might like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have seen the play, you'll hate the movie","review":"This is movie is a turkey. Actors who cannot sing well, a director who must have been inspired by MTV videos, a poorly conceived production, all come together to nearly ruin a fine play and great music. Brosnan bombed as a singer. One of the funnest dances from the play (with swim fins) was cut to a few seconds. Sometimes the photography was so close it cut off arms and other parts of the actors who were dancing or otherwise needed to be seen. Mobs of extras suddenly appear to dilute dances or songs or just pad the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I'm not sure how all of these top-notch actors were convinced into performing in this film, and so horribly. Even Meryl Streep couldn't save this disaster of a movie. It was overacted cheese, cheese, cheese from start to finish. I like Abba, I like musicals, I love most of the cast in other films, but the best word to describe the whole production is embarrassing. I blushed for Streep, Brosnan, and Firth, as they inexpertly belted tunes off-key with a melodramatic exaggeration I would expect to see from a child actor in a low budget Disney movie. Who gave this director money? Who edited this? What producer didn't put their foot down when they saw the end result, and stop this movie from ever hitting the theaters? This is definitely one of the worst five movies I have ever seen in my life. I should have watched High School Musical 3 instead. It was probably better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Abba's Greatest Hits instead!","review":"Acting (if you could call it acting!) horrible, the singing shrill and does not in the least compare to Abba, the screen play ridiculous.I can't understand serious actors like Meryl Streep and Colin Firth even accepting this disaster screenplay - what a MESS all around - simply ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"This may be one of the worst films I've ever seen -- even just for fun, it's just plain embarrassing! If you like/love ABBA's music (which I do), get their CDs. If you like/love all these truly wonderful actors (I do!), watch them in something else!!! I just hope they were paid well and had a ball on location. There is no plot, no script, and no, Pierce Brosnan, fine man and fine actor that he is, can't carry a tune in a ten-barrel bucket. I just kept waiting for this to be OVER! Glad I checked it out of the library instead of paying anything to see it. The best thing about it is the end titles. Don't waste your time -- if you're looking for fluff, for fun, there are many other movies worth the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"I love movie musicals.

The acting is very bad and they could have done a better job on Meryl's sloppy, red-nosed complection, especially when she is \\"upset\\".

I expected to have mixed reactions, because while I adore Meryl Streep, I never liked the music of ABBA.My reactions weren't mixed at all. I hated Mamma Mia: the acting, the story line, the music, the lip-synching, the dancing. It was frivolous, shallow, vapid.Yeah, so? All musicals are frivolous, yet there are many I love. Cabaret. The 2005 version of The Producers. The Sound of Music. What was it about Mamma Mia that riled me so?I think I hated Mamma Mia because it was such a transparently cynical attempt to exploit a stereotype: the \\"female demographic\\" pandered to by morning news & entertainment shows, The View, Oprah & Doctor Phil, Access Hollywood. I suppose there are women who fit that stereotype, just as there are men who fit the \\"male youth demographic\\" stereotype movies like Transformers aim at.

The people at the \\"RAZZLE\\"awards should be ashamed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!His singing would be received by Donna as extremely romantic. The four actresses were also, excellent.The bachelors and her young man also made for a heartwarming Musical ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for fun!","review":"This is not a movie for people who are looking for a deep, thought provoking two hours. It's for people who are looking for fun, pure fun. It's also for people who are Meryl Streep fans. It's obvious how much fun these A List actors are having with this material. I read somewhere that Colin Firth has said this movie was the most fun he ever had making a movie. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it is a bit jarring when the songs don't quite fit the situation. It's obvious that the plot was written around the songs. Musicals work best when the songs are written around the plot. But these are some truly inventive, playful and joyful tunes and the choreography is fresh and energetic. It's just for fun A One!"},{"rating":"1","title":"silly and fun in an awful sort of way","review":"Pierce Brosnan really does suck in this and I think was completely miscast.

Meryl Streep is fantastic (as always). Pierce Brosnan is great. I had no idea Pierce and Collin Firth could sing and very well I might add. The music numbers were outstanding. The only other musical I've ever liked is The Sound of Music and this ranks right up there in my opinion - even though the story line isn't near as accomplished.

It's Greek island setting is beautiful.It's worth the price just to see Pierce Brosnan sing and dance in disco drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposed to be a Musical","review":"Listening to Pierce Brosnan (and to a lesser extent Meryl Streep) sing in this movie is an uncomfortable experience (especially in surround sound). That being said, the daughter in this movie (played by Amanda Seyfried) has an outstanding voice, and as a relative unknown in the movie industry, she pretty much carried the entire movie on her shoulders (musically speaking). Somebody however, forgot to tell the producers that this movie \\"is a MUSICAL!\\". So rather than attempt generate box-office revenues from the reputation of high profile actors with bad voices (Streep, Brosnan, Firth), they would have been better off casting actors who can actually act AND SING; doing so may have made this movie as enjoyable (and as profitable) as the stage play.Sadly Mamma Mia is not worth watching, but if you must see it, rent -- don't purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casting ruins the movie and the music","review":"I was a huge ABBA fan as a teenager. I have all their music and still enjoy listening to them. I even liked the stage play Mamma Mia.However...the movie stinks! First of all, why on earth did the filmmakers cast actors who cannot sing? And if they had to cast these actors, at least let them lip sync. I adore Meryl Streep but she is not that talented when it comes to singing. Pierce Brosnan is so atrocious that I had to fast-forward his numbers. Ditto for everyone else in this movie (well Christine Baranski is not too bad). I don't see how anyone could appreciate Abba's music after hearing it here.The only thing I did enjoy was the cinematography and the incredibly colorful Mediterranean setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the widescreen instead.","review":"I absolutely adored this movie in theaters and am a big fan. I was very excited my sister got this for me for Christmas but the transfer to fullscreen is just horrible. There is so much \\"pan and scan\\" that its distracting and half the time someone will say his or her line and you can even see them say it because they got cut off off-screen. Even my non-movie-buff friends said it distracted them. Get the widescreen instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all fun","review":"This movie is just a good, wonderful, fantasy, and shouldn't be taken for anything more than that.

Enjoy the adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Most reviews were so good that I expected to be blown away by this movie. Image quality was not good at all. I thought maybe I had turned off the 1080 setting - but my settings were correct. Acting was good, but this was a musical - and other than the daughter's voice, all others were forgettable.

However, I can't run to Mandalay Bay in Vegas often enough to see this production live. Therefore, this is a close second which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music was the only enjoyable thing","review":"I watched this movie and gave it away.

Pierce Brosnon was not the best choice forthis roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible singing!!","review":"I rented the Bluray and couldn't finnish it. The singing is horrible!! Its like a bad karaoke!! I wonder how ABBA has allowed this brutal killing of their music. Professional singers please... Shameful..How can this be distributed as a musical? VERY BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie! Don't bother seeing it.","review":"The acting and singing was TERRIBLE!!! but the girl on the cover is such an amazing singer. I'll buy her album, but the other well known actors should not have gotten their parts. They were sooo bad. And what was with having some guy (Mr. Darcey) being gay in the movie? Must Hollywood include some gay character in every movie nowadays? How distasteful! Hope there will be a remake, because that didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Atrocious To Watch","review":"I am a complete ABBA fan, so the thought of watching the movie \\"Mamma Mia!\\" sounded right up my alley!! Plus the idea of a story revolving around Abba's songs was a novel idea too, which was another reason I was game for watching this movie.Okay, let's just say the story line is cheesy! The singing was horrible and the acting was bad on all counts.... I would have thought with the all star cast of Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Barabski, Julie Walters, and so on that this movie would have been great... at the very least acting wise!!I say skip the movie and listen to Abba's Greatest Hits!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mama Mia","review":"I really enjoy seeing Meryl Steep in all her movies.

Its worth watching and if you ever get the chance to see the play, by all means go. It will make you smile.Randy Chapman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who did the casting","review":"Streep and Bronson in a musical? This could have been a cute film, but the tone deaf over-acting by the leads ruined it for me. Will have to wait for the Broadway version."},{"rating":"1","title":"No relation to music","review":"Anyone who grew up hearing Abba will be disappointed. The singing voices are mediocre and the acting basically phoned in with the exception of Christine Baranski, a seasoned Broadway actress, who gives an amazing performance. Abba needs to be heard sung by Abba."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Girls do Greece","review":"A fun show on stage, this became ridiculous transferred to the screen because of the casting. The actresses playing Donna and her cronies were all pushing 60 when they filmed this. It should have been played by actors about forty give or take a couple of years. Why did they do this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\\"?","review":"I like ABBA music, and I'm in the target demographic, but I cringed continually watching this. There is a scene right before the wedding where Meryl Streep is singing for several minutes about how she doesn't want to talk, while Pierce Brosnan is standing there in what for him must have been an excruciating reaction shot. But I also felt he was thinking: \\"This is dreadful. Thank heavens we're filming at a great location and tonight we can get drunk at the taverna in town.\\" The acting seems forced and phony, and I could not identify with anyone in the movie. The idea that a young woman would somehow think it romantic (which is what the bride-to-be expresses in her opening song) that her mother had sex with three different men in succession strains credulity. The giggling didn't help. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most mis-cast movie in history","review":"The review title says it all. Meryl Streep is a great actress but in this role looked totally out of her element. She appeared wooden throughout. Pierce Brosnan was a joke as a singer. Perhaps with some genuine musical theater stars in the role, it may have worked. Even so, I got so tired of its teeny-bopper mentality, even from the adults, that I soon came to understand why the late-night comedians made such fun of this film. Is it a feel-good film? Yes (my 81-year-old mother-in-law liked it), but much of the \\"feel-good\\" comes from laughing AT it. The blu-ray transfer was excellent, which befits the great ocean-front scenery, the movie's greatest asset. It sure wasn't the musical performances from Streep and Brosnan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful and horrifying","review":"The 80s died for a reason. They should stay dead. This revival? SLIGHTLY less horrifying than the Yellow Submarine. The main character was a manipulative, wishy-washy bitch (and why was and Streep the only ones with an American accent?) The plot... who am I kidding? WHAT plot? At least MOST musicals make SOME sort of cohesive sense! I'm not entirely certain WHY I watched the entire thing, other than it was the soul-destroying train-wreck that, once you start watching, you have to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is still great, but.....","review":"ABBA's music is wonderful, no doubt about it but there is still something so annoying about old people shaking it. Isn't it sad enough that we are aging? Did we have to go through the pain of watching old people acting stupidly? It was excruciatingly painful to watch it.Yes, the movie became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom of all time, but that's how ironic life is. I wouldn't watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Results","review":"It does not pay to buy cheap-I did, and the DVD stopped playing after 3 minutes.I did get full refund though. That's why I like buying from AMAZON.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Unacceptable piece of manure.","review":"The reason that I have such a firm dislike to this particular DVD is that I am an ABBA fan. I have every vinyl...first cut vinyl...that they have ever done. I have ticket stubs, plane ticket receipt, and hotel receipts for ever tour that they have done.I am not a purist. The contrivance of this particular use of their material is pretty good on the stage. They just did not translate the material well. Whether it was the London Stage, New York Stage or the ABBA road show, they had better voice and acting talents.I saw this dog (I apologize for insulting any dog. It is just that the appelation works in general.) via Netflix. It is a good tool to weed out movies like this. Stick with the DVD/CD's of any other stage performance. Save your money until the dog becomes so cheap as to maybe rate having it as an addition to the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mamma Mia Doesn't work !!!","review":"I have never had any problems with an Amazon product.

I also did not realise that I was in fact ordering a USA version which is completely useless in Spain on my player anyway. So I shall not order anything from you again.

I watched the dvd not expecting anything more from the story but was looking forward to a first class rendition of the songs. The actors and acting are so disconcerting it will be virtually impossible to watch in its entirety for many folks. The vocals are generally horrible and to see Meryl Streep in this movie is like watching a good actor on the Love Boat or Surreal Life...you know their career is over.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this movie from any point of view and could imagine that even great fans of ABBA would find this embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"Having grown up in the disco era, with ABBA on the radio every ten minutes, I thought this would be an interesting and enjoyable movie.I was wrong.It tried too hard in some places, not enough in others, and plodded along for the most part.The pretense was actually quite the setup for a good comedy. Strong actors was a good move also and the location was great! The unfolding of the plot was weak, at best. And it seemed some of the songs just didn't fit well to what was going on.I'm not sure what I would have done differently here... the story was made to be wrapped around songs by the group ABBA. These songs weren't written for that purpose and therefore the fit just isn't quite right.This is definitely a chick flick and geared for the teen section. Which I'm sure it will win over. Myself? I watched it and returned it. Don't think I'll watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh so fun","review":"I have to admit I was a skeptic. I was not a huge fan of ABBA growing up but after the broadway show came out, which I did not see, I started to think maybe I will give it a shot and see what it is about. I like musicals.I sat down on a cold January 4th and watched it. I love it!I think my favorite part of the movie is Dancing Queen. I loved how the older woman carrying sticks on her back just threw them down and joined in the fun.By the way, the other reason I wanted to watch it is because it has Colin Firth in it. Not bad on the vocals.As for Pierce, back off people I have heard a lot worse. I think it catches you off guard more than anything. I have watched it twice now and even the second time, I really don't think he sounds that bad.It says a lot throwing yourself into a role that is completely different from what you normally do. He took a chance and had some fun.I like this movie. Guess I need to check out the Broadway production sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have fun with it!","review":"This isn't designed to be high art. It's designed to put a smile on your face and, if you're middle-aged, a little nostalgia in your heart. I grinned like an idiot throughout the movie the first time I saw it. You can't help it. The music makes you happy, and the actors are obviously having a good time. Production values? Who cares! That's not what this movie is about. It's about a rolicking good time and a romantic fantasy come true. On those levels, it more than delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamma Mia!

Knowing most of my favorite movies are hated by critics, I knew I had to see it. On my birthday in August, I decided to see Mamma Mia instead of Dark Knight. Beside dealing with getting a year older, the economic outlook, gas prices and everything else going on just made me want an escape where it took me away from the dismal real life crap. Mamma Mia did that. I adore Pierce Bronsan and no one can claim he is a great singer, but he did it. Colin Firth wasn't much better. The good thing was the theater wasn't that full and so I hope no one heard me much singing along. I did hear others laugh their heads off and sing too.Mamma Mia also dealt with life changes and shows how important our friends and family are for good and bad times. We also have to be able to laugh at ourselves, even when not wearing polyester and platform boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dumb","review":"The best thing about this movie is seeing Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Barananski in a musical. That's a real treat. They did a great job with limited material.However, I'm a little confused at the hype around this movie. Many of the songs just don't make any sense. The whole time that Pierce Brosnan, who really shouldn't be cast in a scene where he sings, is singing to Meryl Streep about how can he go on when she's gone, I'm wondering what he's talking about since he hasn't seen her in twenty years. The only way to enjoy this movie is to never ask what anyone is talking about or why they are doing what they are doing.

I knew the songs would be fun and just be an enjoyable movie to watch. Wow was I wrong. I suffered through an hour and fifty minutes of for the most part terrible singing and hyperactive acting. If your idea for entertainment is listening to Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep sing then go ahead and enjoy.Yes the actors looked like they enjoyed themselves and the song Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia were fun, that is why I gave it two stars rather then one. I felt the acting was over the top and I caught myself laughing at the movie rather then laughing because it was actually funny. I would recommend taking a pass on this one even if you like musicals.

However, I found the pacing of the movie incredibly slow compared to the stage play. It was, in a word, boring. To add to the disappointment, the leads (Streep and Brosnan) were not up to the vocal requirements of the score (especially Brosnan). While I enjoy them as actors, they needed to have their voices dubbed or at least their performances improved.The other disappointment was the change of the script towards the end adding the reference about families being of all types. That was not in the original as I remember. That could have been left out. Also, the producers could have left off the tacky ending with the cast parading around in those horrid suits. True, the stage play has that addition but it comes off much better on stage than on screen.If you are a fan of the stage play, I believe you will be disappointed with this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review MAMA MIA","review":"I throughly enjoyed this movie when I watched it on a flight and it made me feel good as the songs from ABBA are familiar and then I decided to buy this and keep it for viewing when I need to feel happy.

Very nice and touching songs.However there were more songs than dialogue, which kind of made us bored after a little while. I also wished it didn't include these little inappropriate scenes because it could have been a great family movie.Overall, the movie was nice to watch. I rank it second after Moulin Rouge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama Mia","review":"This is now my Favorite Musical. I've seen the stage play (excellent also) and I saw the movie in the theater. Now that I have the DVD, I'm looking forward to watching it many times. It threads around a cute romantic comedy, and how do you best ABBA's music? The songs, for the most part, are sung by people who do not sing professionally which makes it even more believable. The scenery is to glory in, a breath of fresh air! Adding to all that is Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan and others that make this DVD - WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamma Mia","review":"If you love the music of Abba you'll love this movie. It may be thatMeryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan don't have the quality voices of Abba, but they have enough personality that you don't mind the less than perfect Pitch.

OMG, how awful is this???? They butchered the songs beyond belief and the actors couldn't sing, nor act. Plus the entire story or whatever, was completely boring and exhausting to watch.

Well, at least I can return it.I had high hopes and was excited to watch this film and felt like I just wasted my life.Dont get me wrong, I love showtunes but this one was a HUGE let down.I like only the very few ABBA songs used, and the others to me werent my favorite.The singing was not the greatest either. I wont pick the cons out b/c most negative reviews explain everything that I didnt like about this film.Plus its total chickflicks, I dont like chickflicks and Im a chick. I'll stick with ALW, Moulin rouge, the marraige of figaro, sweeney todd and repo, thankyou. At least with the few crappy songs in those shows, I leave happy. ^_^Also it beats me buying overpriced tickets to the actual show and be disappointed. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD didn't work.","review":"I was very disappointed witht this DVD.

My friend who invited me to see this movie with him apologized for choosing such a bad flick. I was only able to watch it all the way through because I did not wish to hurt my date's feelings.

As I think about it, she may have seen it a third time with friends. We really enjoyed it every time. The movie was not half as much fun. Pierce Brosnan was a terrible casting choice. He can't sing at all. The actor playing Bill was not really all that good either. Finally Meryl Streep overpowered her role. It was supposed to be light and fun but she brought way too much depth to the role. Way to weighty. This was supposed to be light and fun folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all","review":"I saw this movie after taking a trip with several girlfriends.

Story and music test credulity, but so did West Side Story and The Mikado. Performances are spot on, with average talent in some roles being lifted to very good by enthusiasm and professionalism--Brosnan is best example. The four leading ladies are breathtaking. It's not Abba, and not meant to be. The Abba music is transformed into a different form by its original composers and criticizing it as 'pop' simply misses the point. It was great music in the 70's (second only to the Beatles, worldwide) and has been re-imagined as great music in this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a feel good movie.

As long as you like ABBA music, I'd recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Horrible","review":"I have seen the theatrical production 4 times and the movie once. The movie was terrible! The movie cut songs that were in the play and destroyed the continuity of the music and story. Pierce Brosnan might be eye candy, but he can't sing and looked uncomfortable. Worst of all was the direction by Phyllida Lloyd. I cannot fault the actors and production for her inability to make the show go. I recently had the misfortune of seeing a theatrical production of this show directed by Ms Lloyd. Her version chopped up the music and interrupted beautiful songs with inane conversation. It was painful to try to sit through this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can only call it a musical if the actors can sing","review":"First off I really love musicals and ABBA music. This musical is really bad. The only one who can sing is the girl who plays the daughter. Everyone else just looks uncomfortable to be there - especially Brosnan. The acting is terrible...very campy. I was actually embarrassed for the actors/actresses while I watched it. It was like they realized part way through filming that since no one could act or sing they should make it as cheesy as possible. I would rent this instead of buying it if you feel you have to see it.....buying it is just a waste of money.

Before I knew it, I found myself dancing in my seat, tapping my feet, humming along, smiling, and sitting until the very ending of the credits and singing along once more to the songs.

How can you go wrong with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the music... I hated the movie","review":"I LOVE ABBA... I might even say I liked Mamma Mia, on stage. (I saw it two times, on stage...)But I HATE the movie. Total miss-cast. Merryl Streep SINGING? And Pierce Brosnan? Are you kidding? Who ever chose Merryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan for this movie, when they could have chosen good SINGERS... A SINGER-ACTRESS, like Barbara Streisand, or Madonna, either one of who can act as well as sing... whatever happened to Antonio Banderas, why wasn't he in this movie?And Merryl Streep is NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR, for this silly movie... and Kate Blanchett is NOT nominated for an Oscar... that's Hollywood justice for you.I give it two stars...

IT MAKES YOU HAPPY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mama mia! this is a good movie","review":"If you liked the music of Abba when you were younger this movie is for you.

The short answer is you can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"mamma mia","review":"Okay, I bought this because my wife insisted... But I really do like musicals, and this was a very good one. It wasn't Chicago, but very enjoyable to watch. Meryl Streep really throws it all into this one, and the cast looks like they're having a fine time doing it. Mr. Brosnan isn't the greatest singer, but he does a good enough job not to detract from the overall movie. And the locations are excellent, they really pop on the blue ray disc. And who didn't like Abba? C'mon, you know you did. Enjoy this one for what it is, a funny musical with a great soundtrack that you can't help but smile and laugh when you watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe how quick this purchase was recieved. standard shipping, and recieved it within days, perfect shape. thank you!","review":"This movie is a awesome movie.

Fun musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I loved this movie. The music is wonderful, the location beautiful and the story sweet and positive. There is just something about it that makes me smile. The music is great.I loved Meryl Streep in this movie. Her acting was fabulous. I am not as happy about her singing. She tries hard and sometimes does well but other times she is not as successful. It almost makes me wish for the days when movies were dubbed by a better singer. That being said I like her in this role so much that I am willing to accept her sometimes less than stellar singing ability. It is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unparalleled joy of a film.... !","review":"From the gorgeous prologue scene with Sophie singing \\"I have a dream...\\" in the skiff, to the hillarious credits with the cast breaking up while mock-performing, this is a joy of a film to watch and experience. One of my favorites of all time.The first time that I viewed it I found it mesmerizing... the fantastic scenery, the most beautiful water scenes that I have ever witnessed, and then the music... the music! I ended up seeing it a half-dozen times in the theater, and never once did I not feel a flood of true joy bursting out from the spirit and beauty of this special film."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't they find famous acotrs who can sing?","review":"This movie is a train wreck. The only one who can carry a tune is the actress that plays the daughter. I don't know how this made it to the public, anyone watching the dailies could have told you it stinks. The story was terrible, the camera work was worse & the actors except where noted above cannot carry a tune. It was like watching 2 hours of Jr. high bad music. I can't figure out why so many people love this movie. I'd rather have a toothache than watch it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embrarrassing","review":"I can honestly say that this is the worst film I've seen in this decade.And I like musicals. I was open to the ABBA music. But the directing and cinematography looked like an afterthought to a home-made video of some vacation in Greece. I actually looked away from the screen several times because I was so embarrassed for the participants in this film. The acting was horrendous; similar quality might not bother you if you paid $2 admission to a small town high school stage production, but this is supposed to be a professional film. Even Streep's performance was embarrassing, though she at least surprised me as a much more competent singer than her peers. Some of the actors' singing was jaw-droppingly bad. I found it almost unbelievable that the producers would release this in its current form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Song Every Five Minutes....","review":"There are apparently two types of musicals...ones where there is a solid story and the actors sing a song every now and then...and ones where there is like only five minutes of dialogue before the next song began. This movie is in the latter group. I hate musicals like that! I tried to forward through all the songs, but it was obviously a hopeless cause. Not that I don't like ABBA songs, I do! In fact, that's why I stopped watching this movie in the first half hour; I was afraid if I continued, I would end up deleting all of the ABBA songs from my iPod, and smashing all of my ABBA CDs.The funny thing is I was watching this DVD as a break from three other DVDs I have been watching for two weeks--the mini-series \\"Holocaust\\", which was one of Meryl Streep's first works. I thought it would be nice to see her in a happy movie in a happy place in a happy time. Much to my dismay, I ended up rather seeing her in a Jewish ghetto in WWII Europe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama Mia!","review":"Perfect transaction, fast, fair, courteous, great quality, great conditions, excellant price.

The AF footage is good but then the next few bands all sound the same. The Poison Idea and Vibrators stuff is cool too, but overall this DVD sucks. How can you have a punk movie about CBGB and not at least throw some 1975 Ramones footage in there? Or the Dead Boys or early Blondie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights went out after 5 days","review":"Tree is horrible. (We got the clear lights version) Comes in three sections.

His voice gives the songs the subtle intensity needed to get people moving, and the horn arrangements are simple yet wonderfully effective. My only complaint would be that there was not much varation in the styles of songs. Too much blues, not enough of that Latin feel that they do so well. Still, swing fans should not pass by this one; it really stands out in what seems like an endless crowd of mediocre swing bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't do justice","review":"Just a quick comment on \\"Safronia B,\\" James just does not do justice to the writer, Calvin Boze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin swing music, cd is consistent from song to song","review":"This cd has great swing music with lots of horns and percussions. Starts off with a bang with \\"Jumpin from six to six\\", and continues right on through to the end with only a little slowing on the fourth or fifth track. Definitely a good basic cd if you like swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing \\"sequel\\" to classic album","review":"The eagerly awaited follow-up to \\"Colin James and The Little Big Band\\" fails to ever really get off the ground. The first album was a departure from then current popular music and incorporated aspects of 50's swing, blues, and big-band. With swing now a revived musical phenomena, LBBII finds James playing it safe and sticking to formula. There is little to distinguish this album from the current onslaught of \\"modern swing\\". Better for the discriminating listener to seek out the masterful and (sadly) out-of-print 1993 album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready To Feel Good","review":"If you're a fan of Colin James you will love this album.

I however, was totally impressed with both the video quality, extra features, and DTS capability.Few normal audio CDs offer the same quality of DTS surround sound and low-frequency bass levels as this DVD, and because it's Prince playing only his biggest hits (coupled with Lenny Kravitz and the old Purple Rain-style Morris Day and The Time as cameo appearences) makes this a great concert DVD.

He becomes the castrato section of the characters of the story, as when he shirks doing his chores assigned by Mama Bear in the Chore book. This TV book is much needed, however it can help create problems with proper respect for parents with the dominant portrayal of Mama Bear who constantly has to put up with Papa Bear's bad habits while she is remediating the children.

Mother Bear supposes the increased TV viewing is a result of the family switching from a black-and-white TV to a color set or, perhaps, because Papa Bear installed a new antenna atop the tree house.Seriously, in a world of satellite TV, digital video recorders and on-demand movies, do you think upgrading to color television is the issue?The rest of the book, which focuses on outdoor activities and the value of a family dinner time, is still valuable, but could use an update as well.Skip this book and pick up \\"The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Commercials\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring, lets watch TV","review":"Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text. This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read. I lost attention, and attentiveness. My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone. If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The world lost a real gem of a writer when Stan Berenstain passed on November 29. Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.Too Much TV is one of those issues that is becoming more and more prevalent. What's wonderful about this book is that it shows that not only the kids have trouble with TV, but Papa does also. That's a great message: kids are not the only ones who have flaws, adults have them, too! Everyone can get stuck into bad habits sometimes, and in this modern age of more and more technology, it's only getting worse. But crafts and other hobbies that don't involve a tube are just as much fun, and it's a lifelong pursuit to remind ourselves of this. This book is a wonderful place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute hat","review":"The fire hat is good quality. Fits both my 1 and 3 year olds, is adorable on both. They both like it very much.

Data is entered using RPN, other reviewers have covered this.The big advantage over more modern calculators is the very logical and easy way to access the procvided functionality. No searching throug menus and no remembering of function names. The functions needed most in daily life (as a student or rofessional) are directly accessible through the clearly labeled keys.Of course there are some points I like less. Eg the very limited operation stack (depth of 4) and I am not too pleased with the way HP's once outstanding quality is going. My model has a slightly bent case. Not enough to really worry me, but the calculator is never sitting firmly on the 4 rubber pads. In contrast to some other reviewers I have no problems with the keys, but I do agree that they used to have a more solid feel in earlier days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculating making money","review":"Money!

Compared to my original HP 12c, the new one I received has a \\"slower\\" processor and the numbers seem to \\"creep\\" up to the display (I've check the performance with multiple sets of batteries). Also, the keys do not seem to have a firm \\"detent\\" and one needs to check the numbers before entering or performing any calculations. These two issues alone compel me to question the integrity of HP products - currently and future purchases. The bottom line.... I feel I should have spent $10 for this calc rather then the $70 HP asked for.

I just just bought my 3rd 12C and I have to say I am really disappointed in the quality of the product. This product is a cash cow for HP and it seems they are trying to squeeze more margin out of an already high margin product by cutting corners which reduces the quality. Prime example are the keys. In the past the keys were well fitted in the calculator casing to give it a solid feel. Now the keys jiggle within the casing, especially if you hold it upside down and lightly shake it back and forth. I would suggest HP to have a serious discussion with the product manager in charge of the 12C. You have gone from a quality product to a cheap Chinese knock off. Had I known this when I bought it I would have found another alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an HP","review":"This HP works really well and is very handy, powerful, and flexible financial tool. If you are an engineer you will probably have to get used to a change in notation.

What's really bad is the way you select the pen, mechanical pencil or the stylus. Basically, you have to hold the pen at a horizontal position, turn the pen so the small markings idicating the type of tip extension is facing up and press the button at the end of the pen.I usually go back and forth a lot between the three tips and it is a hassle. There are pens out there that simply require a twist at the barrel to select the tips. These are great because you don't even have to look and its so much quicker. I've seen these for less than $10.The actual ballpoint pen is not much better than a $.05 plastic pens you buy in bulks.

Cuba Gooding Jr. does an excellent job playing the role of Carl Brashear. I like the fact that George Tillman brought to life a story about a great man who is widely overlooked in our history books. Robert Deniro put everything he had into Chief Sunday and then some. I have had this movie for years now and I keep watching it over and over.

That said, this movie would entertain only the least demanding of viewers. It's so entirely predictable and formulaic that I wonder why they bothered to make it in the first place. Maybe it is a worthy subject, being based on a true story, but that isn't enough to make a good film. Quite what De Niro is doing in this kind of trash is beyond me. If he keeps making these terrible films he's going to do his deservedly great reputation a lot of damage.Save your money, save your time, and save your brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and Boring Biopic","review":"Yes, the navy is good. No, racism is not. There's the movie's plot, really - that's it. This movie's characters have absolutely no depth. It seems like this movie is 4 hours longer than it is. It squanders some terrific actors like Cuba Gooding Jr. ,Robert DeNiro, and Charlize Theron (who has about 5 speaking lines). Robert DeNiro even attempts to feign the most ridiculous southern accent I've ever heard. It's not a terrible movie, it's just very dull and unoriginal. It's also directed in a generic manner and the script is written in a workmanlike fashion that resembles every biopic from the 50s. If you like boring, inoffensive \\"feel-good\\" movies with themes that might have been controversial in the latter part of the 19th century buy or rent this film.

However, I passed my Potential Officers Course yesterday, which is the first examination you have to do in order to gain entry to the Royal Marines.

A cliche ridden, unintentionally comic, and hackneyed piece of work. The film is also an insult to the real Carl Brashear. A great story has been turned into a piece of overblown hollywood pap. The only redeeming feature is Cuba Gooding Jnrs performance. As a long standing admirer of Robert DeNiro I can only say this is arguably his worst performance--he even uses his CAPE FEAR accent. The film is filled with stock (and underdeveloped) characters and situations. This film is mainstream filmmaking at its most lamentable. It's as if film narrative has stood still for 35 years. Please avoid this dross at all costs. Im just waiting for the comic spoof to come out with Leslie Nielsen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh What Could Have Been","review":"Carl Brashear is a true American Hero. After watching this movie, I was so inspired that I took it upon myself to do a little research. As much as it is an unbelievable accomplishment for Mr. Brashear to have overcome extreme obstacles (starting with racism and leading to amputation of his leg), the disappointment lies once again in Hollywood's need to sensationalize rather than tell it like it is.If I wanted a inspirational movie based on fiction, I would have rented the Karate Kid I through IV (wax on, wax off Danielson),The Best of the Best (Do it!!), Over the Top (Lincoln Hawk) or not to forget Cole Trickle's inspiring portrayal in Days of Thunder (oops I meant Tom Cruise as Cole Trickle).In all seriousness, Mr. Brashear is a true American Hero and I look forward to sharing his real life story with my three sons. Remember, a son never forgets. My sons will never forget the true heroism of Mr. Brashear. They do not need Hollywood to appreciate his efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honored to watch","review":"Men of Honor is one of those special movies that truly inspires you. Anytime a movie focuses on a heroic story of one man or woman's life, it's bound to be inspirational and a joy to watch.Men of Honor was both of these. I give an A+ for the story itself, but there were problems with the technical side of the movie.First, the acting. I have never really thought Cuba Gooding Jr. was that great of an actor. And this movie hammers that thought into my head even deeper. His facial expressions and the such are OK, but sometimes his words just don't sound right. He was the only actor in the movie that I had a problem with though.The directing was good, except it just seems the movie jumped around a lot. It moved too fast at times. But really that wasn't too much of a hindrance to the overall movie.Men of Honor was a great film that hasn't gotten the recognition it surely deserves. 4 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Men OF Honor","review":"I have the dvd version i found this film to be very authentic andbeing an ex navy man and what divers do it bringing home point that us navy divers do when they it is very rough"},{"rating":"2","title":"Personification of Grit and Determination","review":"This movie is full of character. Cuba Gooding Jr has done justice (a very convincing performance indeed) to his role of a small town guy trying to defy all odds to be the first black in US naval history to be a master diver. Robert de Niro is superb as usual.After all, If you will it - it is no dream. This is a story about shaping your destiny against all odds.An excellent movie to show the kids, as movies with character are out of fashion these days and movies with a lot of special FX and sound effects but lacking substance are sadly the in thing.

I love a good disney movie but I think that this was one where they should have left well enough alone & concintrated Lindsy Lohans abundant talent on an original piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"you must see this one","review":"hello lindsay fansthis movie is realy verry COOOOOOOOL YOU MUST SEE THIS ONEi love itgreeting from the netherlandsgerben van den bosch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky Friday","review":"Well, I thought it was pretty good movie. I like it a lot. I hope you like it. I also hope you like my really short reveiw!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Enjoyable","review":"For a movie based on a mom and daughter switching bodies, this was very entertaining for the whole family. It was enjoyable to see the mother going to high school in her daughter's body, just as it was hilarious to watch the daughter counsel people while in her mother's body.The events that occur and the script provide for many laughs. Of course, you can't expect it all to be realistic, due to the premise, but once over that, it is funny throughout.The mother and daughter both learn their lessons after walking in the other's shoes.this is a good wholesome fun-filled movie that parents, teens and young children can all watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining!","review":"A much better version than the original. As good a performance as Jamie Lee Curtis gives, the young actress who plays her daughter is phenominal and convincing. Some very hilarious moments especially when the daughter must sit with her mother's paranoid psychiatric patients and listen to them while giving a bored teenager's attitude.I saw this with my young son and we both highly enjoyed it!Great music too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie!","review":"I have never seen the original Freaky Friday, but I really enjoyed this one! It's a great movie for the whole family and especially for mothers and daughters. Of course the plot is that the mom and daughter switch bodies and lives for a day. This movie was cute and funny! I think it's worth your time to go see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky Friday","review":"Freaky Friday is a great movie for the entire family. Actors Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan are exceptional actors in this mother-daughter reversal role film. The movie has great acting, great music, and laughs through the entire performance....A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - Not a dull moment","review":"I loved this movie. My daughter, her friend and I walked out happy and laughing about parts of the movie.The mother and daughter switch bodies and go through the entire day in each other's bodies. I don't want to give too much away but I will say that the movie doesn't have a dull moment. Usually during a movie I will notice people stepping out for drinks, snacks and so on but this movie grabbed everyone's attention and kept them in their seats! Freaky Friday also presents a good moral perspective for teens, showing how teens can have fun, get along with their parents and still be individuals. If you have a teen daughter, pile her and her friends in the car and go see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Teenagers Loved It","review":"Four teenagers, two parents and one grandma loved the movie.

This is a very good comedy which is very simple and I have to say, better than 1977's Freaky Friday. It is a good movie if you want to relax and have fun. Also, the songs they perform in the movie are cool (Take Me Away and Ultimate), they actually sing very well. In the documentary, hosted by Lindsay Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis makes lots of jokes and you start laughing when you watch it, and she is so funny, as an actress and as a real person.The performances of Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are very good; they act very good, and the movie really make you laugh, in the whole movie; starting right after the titles, until the last 5 seconds of the movie.I hardly recomend it because it is a great comedy, and a great movie for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Watch","review":"If you have been looking to watch this movie, I'll save you the trouble of going through a complete horror! This is the WORST movie I've seen. The plot is very bad. Too bad that those great actors had to be wasted on this. Also, Freaky Friday doesn't deserve deserve the music that plays in it. This plot could've worked, if in the plot, there weren't so many monkey events! If you're interested in watching a supernatural comedy, please try Back to the Future or some other classic like that. Don't go so far to watch this movie at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crappiest of the crap","review":"this movie really sucked. It was so bad, that it actually slowed down time to make viewing it all the more painfull. it is your typical disney movie, with all their little crappy disney one liners and thier stupid disney lesson to be learned at the end.

The movie has everything you could every want in this type of flick. Not only that the acting of both the daughter Anna and Tess are awesome. In the movie when Anna and Tess switched bodies, both actress made you believe they actually had switched bodies, that's how good the acting is. jamie lee curtis stole the show though. It is so funny. I can relate very well to the mother daughter relationship, maybe that's why I liked it so much. What a great movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome, Amazing Remake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OMG, OMG, OMG!!!!!!!!! I just saw the remake of Freaky Friday with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis and it is now one of my all time favorite movies! My friends and I laughed until the very end of the movie and so hard sometimes we were almost crying!! The acting is fantastic and nothing like the aweful first movie made twenty or thirty years ago.

It is SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Some Things Could Be Taken Out For Little Kids","review":"I think that Freaky Friday was a pretty good movie, except for some parts that they could have left out. You know, the stuff that \\"supposably\\" makes the movie \\"funny\\", but doesn't. Some things aren't good for kids under the age of 9 or so, which stands to reason that it's rated PG. If you have kids older than 9, this is a good movie. It is about a girl and a mother switching bodys. It is pretty funny, and you will probably enjoy it! Go for it! I hope this review was helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This movie was funny, sad, and interesting all at the same time. It could touch so many audiences. It really explored the mother-daughter relationship, which so many women have a problem with. It was a sweet movie, and I really liked it. The mother and the daughter, no matter how different they were, ended up loving each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family type movie, worth seeing with the kids","review":"I watched this one with my 8 year old niece and my almost 3 year old. The little one didn't care for it, nothing for her to follow or understand, but I'd say the 6 to 14 year olds will all probably really like it judging by the reaction from my niece. I thought it was well done and acted and mostly entertaining. The movie is wholesome without anything I found distasteful or objectionable for the young.I'd recommended owning this one it has lasting value as a family or preteen girl flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lohan shines","review":"This movie was completely hilarious and a total shock to me. I wasn't going to give it a chance because I don't usually like \\"teen\\" movies but Lindsay Lohan has proven to me that she is a genuine actress. The reason I watched it because I love Jamie Lee Curtis but it was Lindsay who stole the show for me (though Curtis played a very significant, funny role). Most of you know the storyline, the two get switched and have to play in each other's lives for a day. It's actually really funny, don't throw the opportunity away like I was going to. Lohan is one of the only teen actresses who stands a chance because she can actually act and she's gorgeous as hell. 'Freaky Friday' is a must see for anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie for the family!","review":"We saw this in the theater and own the DVD. We loved the movie and so did our 8 and 5 year old daughters. The interplay between Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan is fantastic. The movie is often comedic and over the top, but ultimately pulls at the heartstrings. The identity switching gimmick isn't original of course, but it gives a great glimpse of how a little change in perspective helps us understand each other.Now my 8-year-old is an aspiring rock guitarist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but NOT as good as the orginal one.","review":"I liked this movie very much. But, it doesn't have the funny feeling that the first one had. Anna (Lindsey Lohan)was really more into boys. In the orignal Freaky Friday, Annabel (Jodie Foster) didn't really go out with her boy friend Boris. Also in the remake, there were so many stuff that was not like the book. I read the book after I saw the remake. I was so suprised that they didn't have any characters or scenes from the book. Well, the up side about the movie is that they had some funny scenes like the Rock band concert and more. If you have scene the original one, I don't think you'll like the remake as much!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky Friday rocks-beats orginial","review":"I'm a guy (20 yearse old), and my parents and I went to see it. We orginially wre going to see something different, but there was a time mix-up, so we chose Freaky Friday at the spur of the moment.First let me say, I felt a little fuzzy during the opening credits and in the beginning. I felt like, \\" great, this is going to be a waste.\\" I was surprised. I enjoyed this movie. This movie was funny, and very good acting as the mother and daughter switch roles. NOw I'm sure that females will enjoy this movie better since this movie is targeted towards them, but Guys, do not feel bad if you see this movie and liked it. I loved it, it was funny, and I think it beats the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I got the product in good time after I ordered it and the product was also matching its description.

And the movie is as good as i thought. I haven't seen the old FREAKY FRIDAY so i don't know how much the movies are alike except for the name. But i must say that the movie contains some shadows of \\"THE HOT CHICK\\". This movie covers two main characters Tess (Curtis) and Annabel (Lindsay Lohan). Who are always arguing with each other, simultaneously wish they could be someone else, they somehow exchange bodies, as they both learn what it's like to be in the other person's situation. As far as the acting concern Curtis and Lohan both did very well and it is very hard to judge who is better among the both. It is a family movie. I recommended it for all ages who love to watch fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Remake!!!","review":"To me, Disney's 2003 version of Freaky Friday is a lot better than the original. I don't hate the original, I just think this one is a lot funnier and more up-to-date! Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan were hilarious trying to be the opposite of each other. After having a big fight with each other on Thursday, Anna (Lohan) and Tess (Curtis) switch bodies on Friday morning, and throughout the entire day, you see hilarious moments as Tess acts like a rebelious teenager and Anna acts more mature. Tess is supposed to be married on Saturday, and if they don't switch back, they'll have to post-pone it. It's also awesome to see Jamie Lee jammin' down at the concert later toward the end of the movie! If you love comedy, you'll love FREAKY FRIDAY!!!p.s. Back in 2003, a cousin and friend of mine helped me make a movie that spoofed this movie and Freddy Vs. Jason. It's Crazy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsay Lohan was Great!","review":"Lindsay Lohan was great and Jamie Lee Curtis was great to. both had a hard roll to play they did great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky Friday, an awesome movie!","review":"very funny and entertaining.

The acting was hilarious, especially Jamie Lee Curtis's. She expressed the state of mind of a teenage girl wonderfully. Jamie Lee Curtis was really talented!

You will definitely enjoy this ride!!!Story B+Acting A-Direction BVisual B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for pre-teens...and parents!","review":"My two girls - ages 7 & 9 have watched it 10 times and they love it. I've never been a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and wasn't interested in seeing it, but after seeing all or part of it several times I must admit it's funny and engaging. Lohan and Curtis both give great performances - having to act both as a highschooler and as an adult, and the supporting performances are all solid. And there's not much in the way of objectional material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs way up!","review":"Entertaining movie for the entire family.

Family Fun","review":"See Bret Fetzer's editorial review for a right-on capsule analysis.

This movie is definitely one of mine and everyone i know's all time favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie You should watch","review":"I loved this movie. It is about a mother and daughter who fight over who is right. They get into a fight at a Chinese restutrant. An old woman gives them both fortune cookies. The next morning they find out that they have switched lives. That is where the trouble really begins. Ana the daughter is a teenager who is in a rock band, gets in trouble at school, and has a crush on the school janitor. Ellen the mother is a physcologist who everybody thinks has the perfect life, perfect boy friend, but she really doesn't. You should check out this movie. I know that you have a teen age daughter or a perfect mother. You will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky Friday Review","review":"The movie Freaky Friday is a very good movie because it's funny and clever. It shows reality for some people. Sometimes mothers understand their daughters and sometimes they don't understand their daughter. Although what happened in the movie will not happen in reality, sometimes to understand one another you need to be in the other person's place. That's what the movie shows. All you need is love to keep one another together and to keep you relationship going for a while.I thought this movie was very well done. The acting was wonderful and it was just funny. I recommend for anyone who wants to laugh to see this movie. Just in general anyone who hasn't seen it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"ethnography of corporate cultural control","review":"This book provides an excellent portrayal (though an ethnographic study) of a company which utilizes corporate culture as a means of control. The company expends great energy at inculcating an ideology that results in the employees putting the company and their work at it above all else, exhibited not only in discourse, but in failed marriages and overtime. This text illustrates how employees are converted into missionaires who will follow productions schedules and management strategies with religious zeal, oblivious to their personal lives and the cost of these new commitments. It would be interesting to see what these types of companies are doing today to manipulate and extract full faith and commitment from employees. A must read for software engineers and those who study organizations and org. psych."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't cover the steps needed to burn DVD's.","review":"I do video production for a living. I am in the process of upgrading my business/equipment to include the ability to burn DVD's for my clients. This book didn't teach me the steps to accomplish this goal. This book was very general covering video production generalities, case studies, lots of technical jargon. I have a degree in television production, and the technical jargon in this book was WAY over my head. It did suggested some different DVD authoring programs for both a PC and MAC. Chapter 17 was the only chapter that really somewhat covered the differences in DVD-, DVD+, DVD+RW, DVD-RW, DVD-Rom, etc. But most of that chapter was hard to understand with technical terms that weren't really explained. I guess you could go thru the glossary and try to decifer the meanings, but I'd recommend looking for a different book. Out of the 304 pages, I found maybe 30 pages that were useful to me.

That was a year and a half ago. The cup has served flawlessly. It is the perfect size for a double-shot of espresso and I'm amazed at how long the shot retains heat. Get lost reading an article (or pondering great things)? Your espresso will still be warm. Perhaps the durability I've enjoyed was luck of the draw, as other reviewers report flaws; but then again, I don't subject the cup to ice or boiling. In any event, to whoever the glass-blower was on the day mine was made, \\"Thank you.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Espresso Shot Glasses Ever","review":"These espresso shot glasses are excellent.

They are well made and I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's worth it","review":"They're a little gimmicky, but if they add to the espresso experience, why not?.

I never dropped them and never use too hot water.Not impressed as i have used them only this year maybe ~100 times.Bodum's web site say they do not warranty glass but i emailed them anyway.I did email and they replaced them at no cost. Thx!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought 4 sets","review":"I was going to get the Pavlina kind, but what drew me to these is the 3oz size (vs 2oz on the others) - so a 2oz espresso with a huge head of crema fits nicely, or you have space for a dash of cream, foam or whatever you temper your coffee with.The design is very conventional and pleasant to hold. It kind of reminds me of a shape-holding balloon, no sharp edges and fits perfectly in the hand, like you were pressing on it (even if you aren't)There's a kind of satisfaction that's hard to quantify. I love to hold these, I love the layers of espresso, crema and occasional cream visible from the side. They even feel nice when being washed, maybe the lack of sharp edges and corners. I always prefer function over form, though in this case it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins, and they don't trade off against each other.The only problem I have is that my son wants to drink milk from these, and it takes him four fill-ups to get through his normal glass of milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous but....","review":"The glasses are gorgeous, very light and almost don't get warm to the touch so you don't burn your hands with an extremely hot espresso, but... they have a small hole on the bottom. I am not an expert in glass blowing techniques but I would suppose the small hole is the result of the technique in order to make the double wall. Well, the problem is that one of my glasses has gotten water inside and I am unable to dry it out. I have left it several days over my Rancilio Silvia which has a warming tray on the top, hoping that the heat will evaporate the water inside but no result. Next step is to place it over a higher heat source, I'll try also to microwave it unsure of the results. Be careful when washing them by hand and I would advise they are not dishwasher safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superior Shot Glass!","review":"The double wall does its job holding in the heat, allowing you to take your time sipping.

The only remaining question is whether this book offers true insight to the CLEC industry and how it thinks of itself, or if this book is merely McDermott's attempt to capitalize on the fact that he was an important player in the industry.

However, I hate leaving loose ends, so I started reading \\"Crystal Line\\"...and was quite pleasantly surprised! Oh, the adventures here are still rather irrelevant. Killa and Lars could have been doing anything, that's not really the point. The point is, in THIS book, the profession of Crystal Singing, the joys and triumphs it brings and the hazards of the job are finally explored, and it's...haunting. Lars is sweet, though he still doesn't do much for me. Killa, however, finally stops being the diva and faces the past she struggled for so long to suppress and has to find what her heart is searching for.

I loved the first two Crystal Singer books, but I read them many years ago, when I was much younger. CRYSTAL LINE, short as it is, was very difficult to get through. The prose is pandering, and the dialogue is downright nauseating. Make no bones about it, this is a romance novel with token trappings of science fiction.

I just read, sat and cried for three to four hours, forgetting to eat at all that evening. I found the aspect of loss of memory caused by crystal singing heart-striking, especially combined with the centuries-lasting love story of Lars and Killashandra. Even the terrible amnesia or a long separation cannot erase their love.

THANK GOD for Dr. Moore- I can follow the teachings of CHRIST- without the wierd 'invented by man' doctrines of the Church! I had come to this conclusion (after studing other religions such as Hinduism, etc.) just before reading this book. For awhile though, I felt like it would be hypocritical to continue to call myself a Christian, when I could not swallow the intolerance of the Church! I felt like I would have to find my own path.

The songs of Patricia Kaas (I went out and sent for two of her discs as soon as I got home from the theatre)as well as her acting is superb. Jeremy Irons is also excellent.

THE MOVIE IS POETRY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Child of a Legend","review":"I saw A Man and a Woman in 1967 and was struck deeply by its cinematic beauty and sensitive depiction of life's joys and sorrows. This new movie forty years later by Claude Lelouche with music again by Michel LeGrande strikes me in the same way. It is the first movie that I would compare with A Man and a Woman in that way. Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas are excellent as are the supporting players. If you enjoy this type of movie, you will likely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes an iron will to sit through this one","review":"Jeremy Irons makes this worth a look, but it takes 45 minutes too long to get where it's inevitably going. There are some good comedic bits, but most of the movie is given to French characters reciting their lines in ennui-laden tones. A lot of screen time is spent on lounge singing numbers; it might be more pleasant to listen to the soundtrack than watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD POTENTIAL, BUT A LITTLE CONFUSING","review":"Ok, maybe I need to go back and give thsi one another try, but I just could not get into this movie. I purchased a used copy becuase a co-worker highly reccommended it to me. I usually like musical style movies and I also like foriegn films... so I had high expectations. In the end, I liked the cast, and I liked the music. But I ended up really confused! For one thing the movie goes back and forth between french and english.

This is my favorite album of his, just above Nashville and Good Dog Happy Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wit","review":"Why do reviews of jazz albums so infrequently mention the sense of humor that often is reflected in the music, even with, say, Sonny Rollins or Sun Ra. Notwithstanding the truth of so much that is said in these comments on the music itself (and this is a fine CD), why so little mention of the sheer exuberant and hysterical joy of, especially, Don Byron (whose sense of humor as well as musicianship is illustrated in so many of his CD's),Guy Klusevsek, and Joey Baron. The accordion and clarinet harmonies and the modernized march drumbeat on Sousa's Washington Post March is truly laugh-out-loud funny. It's a gas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Bill","review":"I'm sorry to say it but I dont think this is a very good Bill Frisell album. It sounds a bit over-pretentious to make covers of orchestral music and it doesnt come out very well in my opinion. Besides anything that contains a song by Madonna, by definition cannot be good, right? These songs are all cover stuff that might be \\"interesting\\", if you like these songs in their original format, but for jazz-people: obviously there was a reason why we chose to listen to jazz and NOT to pop. Instead I would highly recommend listening to Ghost Town, Good Dog Happy Man, Nashville or Sound of Summer Running to get some real fresh genuine samples of Bill's harmonic world and abilities as a composer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this","review":"I have an exact clone of this cheap little thing with the \\"GE\\" label on it.

But what really bothers me is the display. The contrast to get the menu's to work is awful. You have to look at the display at just the right angle to see the numbers. Really poor design. If they corrected this flaw, which i consider major, then i would vote for it over the 12C. With the display flaw however, my vote goes to the 12C.

Together they decide to open a crime scene cleaning service.Although heavily advertised as by the makers ofLittle Miss Sunshine, this movie has none of its charm, wit, and poignancy. \\"Cleaning\\" suffers from a weak script, a complete lack of humor, and characters that are tragic but unlikeable. Adams alternates between whining too much and grinning too much and Blunt is just annoying. Even Alan Arkin is boring as the girls' father (who looks old enough to be their grandfather).24's Mary Lynn Rajskub does her \\"Chloe\\" character in a completely pointless subplot.The story is depressing and the writing is unimaginative. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Is Not Complete","review":"There is something missing with this film - it is not complete. There is only a glimpse into a few days of these character's lives. Amy Adams is great, but Alan Arkin is turning into a caricature actor - this is NOT Little Miss Sunshine. The film's setting is New Mexico and is beautifully filmed. Amy Adams' Rose is \\"strong and a winner\\" as she tells herself each morning from a Post-It on her bathroom mirror. Then why is she stuck in a going nowhere affair with her married, ex-jock high school boyfriend? Emily Blunt's Norah also has issues - she cannot keep a waitress job at a \\"restaurant\\" that is really a lunch counter which does not need a waitress. There are tragic family issues beyond the Dad's business schemes that do not work out. And the crime scene cleanup business does not work out the character's or the family's issues. There are some cute scenes and some touching scenes; but this film leaves many, many questions unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"It bored me and I lost all interest in trying to work out the purpose.

It's not family friendly and I ended up throwing it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunshine surprise","review":"It was definitely different, but deep down I think this was just a good old-fashioned finding yourself flick. It was an emotional roller coaster, too, but it had a nice happy ending and wrapped up well.I like how Adams' character looked at the cleaning as a way of helping people, even if it was a little morbid. It was helpful, and that is what counts.Alan Arkin is always a treat, and I really like Emily Blunt. Her fake American accent is so convincing, she's good. I loved her in The Jane Austen Book Club. Amy Adams is a doll, and I think she was perfectly suited to her role.I watched the special feature about real crime scene cleaners, and I thought it was entertaining. I like how they compared the movie cleanup scenes to what goes on in real life, and I just think it's so neat that there are people out in the world who really do this type of work. It's kind of interesting, and I can't say I would be opposed to trying it. I just don't think I could actually handle it stomach-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant Story Line","review":"First, the not so good \\"how many movies have been made\\" in which:(a.)

Other sister is finding her way in life - also somewhat poorly.(d.) The mom to both sisters died a long time ago and the sisters haven't resolved the event yet.(e.) Dad hasn't resolved the event yet either or raised the sisters to resolve anything.Second, how this movie succeeds:(a.) Unique story that presented death with both an instructional and entertaining perspective.(b.)

I like Stuart's writing style, and the first third or so of the book is wonderful. It is about how Danny and Katharine first fell in love, and I really did believe that he loved her. Which is what made me dislike the rest of the story. I was nearly as distraught as Katharine to realize that the man who supposedly loved her so much was able to make himself forget her completely for a decade, to the point that he no longer even recognized her. That's not only unbelievable to me, it is also unromantic. Mac was able to convince Katharine that he had re-fallen for her, but Stuart didn't convince me. I will avoid any more of her books that have a time gap/reunion theme, because this was not a fun read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, you CAN grieve for a long time","review":"There is one plot device here that some readers question: whether someone can grieve for a loved one for a decade. I did, so I know that it is possible. Therefore, this book makes emotional and psychological sense to me in that respect. However, when the hero doesn't seem to recall the heroine after all these years...that does NOT make sense. Otherwise, this is a good read, with an alpha hero who is trying - but not succeeding - in becoming a gamma hero. Anne Stuart is currently famous for her gammas. If you prefer a somewhat more redeemable man, her earlier works are preferable (actually, I love all her books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious!","review":"This book was incredibly full of wit and humor that I was laughing almost every time I turned a page. Colin Songsmith sings a local song to an old witch who takes an unlikely revenge. Her granddaughter rescues him from a certain death of being eaten alive by the cat and hears the song herself which happens to concern her recently married sister and a gypsy.

New vocabulary and phrases are introduced within the context of different \\"sketches\\" where the cartoon characters are in different situations (at dinner, at the farm, in the playroom, before going to sleep). Therefore, what is being taught is generally quite practical. My daughter can now say \\"please pass me the bread\\" in Spanish and answers with \\"gracias\\". This DVD may be a little fast-paced for younger children, but was appropriate for my 8-year old daughter. Since I don't speak Spanish, I found it very helpful that an English-speaking narrator (a funny lizard) sets up each scene. The dialogues, however, are completely in Spanish which was fine because we understood the context. We need more educational tools like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"This DVD is terrible! The graphics are awful, the pace is too fast, and their is nothing appealing about the characters. I am a Spanish speaker and a Speech/Language Pathologist, I decided to buy this for my 4 year old to aid in her acquisition of the language. She did not even make it through the first 5 minutes and I can't blame her. Who really cares if a duck says Cuac Cuac? Instead of introducing words like \\"mama\\" and \\"papa\\" in isolation first it begins with sentences. The whole video is in Sapnish except for an intro to each section, since my child does not know Sapnish and is being told sentences with no explanation she was not able to follow along.This DVD is definitly not worth the price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality and low budget at best.","review":"This was done very poorly and my kids are not even slightly amused. They jump at a chance to watch anything on the TV, because we have no channels, and they asked me to turn it off.Poor sound, so the annunciation during the songs is not discernible. The music is louder than the words, which is typical of Hispanic music, but not really functional here, lol.Pay a little more and get a better program.I thought it would be good for the car entertainment system, but it's a little too unnerving for driving.It seemed to me it would be something with a story-line, maybe about a boy and his dog, but it's not really.

It was so nice to see a movie that featured Afican Americans in a light that didn't focus on the typical stereo-types that Hollywood presents. You follow these two true to life characters through their journey of love and the game that they adore. Not only does it focus on the relationship between Quincy and Monica, two very likable and wonderfully portrayed characters, but it focuses on Monica and her drive to succeed as a woman in a man's sport.

Omar Epps does his usual fine performance as Q, a boy striving to be better than his NBA star father who learns that a man doesn&#65533;t necessarily have to be a star.

As an avid WNBA fan who cannot play basketball, I marvel at the skill and dedication that these women have to and for the game of basketball. This movie illustrates that basketball is so important to the young women who work hard at the game and never get the publicity or respect for their efforts.

I didn't really expect to fall in love with it. I am a female athlete in college and I could relate to Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and the struggles that she had to deal with to become an accomplished athlete. I understood the underlying double standard that is present in sports and the director, Gina Prince-Bythewood, does a masterful job of portraying it.

But one good song does not a cd make...and the song does get boring over and over again. The remaining songs are either just plain bad, strange or both. I listened to it numerous times hoping it would grow on me but sadly it has not. \\"She's my man\\" is passable but only because of the beat really, otherwise it falls short as do all the other songs. It goes from dance to rock to country sounding and somewhere between all of them at once. I know others like or even love it however I gave it a big chance and was sadly disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No soul.","review":"I like the first album because it has a lot of soul and it has a quirky playful sound to it. This album fails to deliver in the songwriting department, save 2 or 3 songs. Even though their debut sounded retro, it still sounded completely original in its delivery, and thats what made it special.This album sounds like a carbon copy of late 70s songs, and extremely boring ones at that. I was extremely dissapointed, I was hoping for a more original direction for this band. I thought they could stay around for a long time. Maybe they still will be popular after this album, but I found it quite a step backwards from their debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bad","review":"Like most songs here in Europe, the single 'dont feel like dancin' mysteriously came out almost simultaneously on ALL radio stations. The song has since been played relentlessly non-stop 24-7 on all stations. Even if a song I liked was playing, I'd certainly get sick of hearing it so much. Didn't need to wait that long to get sick of this one though. At the first sign of the manufactured falsetto vocal, my skin cringed. The bridge to the song is a blood curdling synthesizer that pierces one's ears like a chain saw - a truly horrid tone. It's like the totally annoying whine of an infant at 4:00am - impossible to ignore. The 'music', if you can call it that, must have listeners attention, though it offers nothing. Brings no heart to the table. I can usually tune stuff like that out but this is appaling.There is absolultely no orinality whatsoever. Beegees with no smooth. Great marketing though(hence the 1 star). Five years from now you'll never admit to your friends that you bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sister Sludge","review":"I am an open minded person and I like many different genres of music but I can not beleive the praise the some are heaping on this group. It is one thing to be a cover band on a local sceen, it is another to call yourself a tribute band and tour, but the Scissor Sisters rip off so many artists that is is pathetic. Not just sounds and vibes mind you, practically entire song structures... At least when you hear Al Yankovic you know he is a put on... I had to endure this band live as they opened for Depeche Mode and it was so hard to respect their campy-rip off act. Sure, all artists borrow and steal a bit... the trick is to add something of your own to the mix... and that is where these Sisters fail. One star for being out and proud... they should save the rest for musical theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ta-Dah cd by Scissor Sisters","review":"This cd has a good selection of pop music including some danceable tunes. I have listened to it several times and have enjoyed the upbeat and lively tone of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"None as good \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\"...","review":"Fun and well crafted album, but none of the other tracks as good as \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good, But I Don't Feel Like Dancin'...","review":"I really can't come up with anything that hasn't already been posted here in terms of rave reviews. The new CD is great. That said, I'd advise the Sisters to maybe watch what they say the next time they tour the UK, as it WILL eventually reach the other side of the Atlantic. Quoted in NME, Ana Matronic said at a London show that London was the group's new hometown, and that \\"British people are smarter than Americans.\\" Which begs the question of why American fans should even bother parting with their hard-earned cash. But I'll be fair, their sound is as good as ever, and the first single is addictive. But it's hard to feel like dancin' after you've been insulted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scissor Sisters Slice The Beat","review":"With the deserved help of Sir Elton John on, \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\", The Scissor Sisters continue on their unique road to pop glory. This is more of the same glam-rock, disco, dance ballad mixture that got them noticed on their debut and it still manages to work. \\"Ta-Dah\\" is electric metrosexual Bee Gees, except the vocals are simply Scissor Sisters (and that's fine). The dance beat is not quite as funky as the Gibbs dance period, but it's much, much more current. There is no doubt that the Sisters have created a niche long lost thrown away and have brought new life to it. Sure, they aren't quite Blondie, the Bee Gees or Elton john, but they sure get damn close and with the mix of all of these influences, they soar on nearly every song to a frenzied euphoria. The Scissor Sisters have been said to be the musical equivalent of \\"Jacks of all trades and masters of none\\", but they sure master what they have here and that is a feat in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible.","review":"The first CD was inspired, but this CD is a complete failure. It seems like the band produced a CD just for the sake of producing a CD. All the songs sound similar. Please, save your money this CD is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading for spiritual emergencies....","review":"Everyone who thinks shamanic illness / an awakening kundalini / Spiritual Emergence is all fun, light, and rainbows ought to give this book a pre-shaktipat gander, written by a man brave enough to suffer through and go public with his own version. If the rather quaint, New Ageish attempts to explain the phenomenon in scientific-sounding terms get on your nerves, bear in mind that he had no better concepts with which to work. Thank God that he wasn't a citizen of the U.S., where he'd be given a diagnosis and medicated senseless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a thought.","review":"..suddenly it struck me..How come that countries with \\"Gurus\\" and and a tradition of mental mastery and such are dirt poor, have lots of thieves, child labour and much else. Why isn't it that, at least one time in a tousand years one of these gurus was clever enough, and free from ego to mastermind a regime that could create decent conditions. How come that countries like Norway or Denmark have better conditions and less crime? They were berserks! Think about it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Amazing, about as close to the game as you can get, although most songs are short and you get about 55 minutes(no more, not much less)out of 36 songs.

New York was a wasteland for NFL football back then, and so the live games were bad. To learn the the game, I watched \\"This Week in the NFL\\", and later HBO's shows. Ah the players - Bradshaw and Harris, Stabler and Branch, Staubach, Griese, Csonka. It reminds me of a time I used to hate John Madden, raving on the sidelines, his white tent of a shirt flapping around. This music (instrumentals and the Facenda poetry) is the soundtrack of more than a show, it's of a period of great teams and rivalries that just don't exist in the period of the salary cap. Anyone in their late 30's and older will remember this time as when the only look you would get at the out of town games was a few minutes a week, with this, this magical evocative music and the Voice. Pure rapturous memories come pouring back. A must-own. And where's Volume 2??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chills","review":"My brother & I and most men I talk to get chills listening to this CD.

I looked on the website and the cd was still for sale. instead of a refund why not just send me the cd that I ordered. there are 3 steps to this process. 1. I order cd. 2. they charge me for cd. 3.

This CD would no doubt be playing on in the scene in my head... everyone moving in slow motion.... the voice of John Facenda describing the action...Great CD. Definitely one for the archives."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will fire you up","review":"Nothing can generate the feel of excitement that you get at the stadium unless you are actually there, but this CD brings you pretty close. It is particularly helpful if you have a team that is not doing too hot because the music can, at the very least, get your juices flowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hike, Hike, Hike!!!","review":"I you ever sat in front of the tv on super bowl sunday watching hours of NFL films highlights from past superbowls, then you need this CD. It's all here. From the orignal scores, to John Facenda's immortal narrations. This is a must have for any football fan. Warning: Driving while listenting this CD in the car may cause you to go faster, and dodge traffic (but hopefully not plow into another car head on). Take the snap, drop back, and throw it deep!! Touchdown!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Facenda: NFL Films Voice Gave Viewers Goosebumps","review":"If you watched NFL Films from the Sixties and Seventies, you know the sound of the voice of NFL Films, John Facenda. Facenda became the Voice of the NFL long before guys like Madden and Michaels reigned on high.Facenda's recital of epic-sounding poetry made the game of professional football seem like a life-or-death struggle for much larger stakes than the simple outcome of a game. He helped make the film clips of games seem like visual poetry, and he helped created a soundscape of the game that will never be captured again.If you have ever enjoyed the NFL Films TV programs of the past, and you appreciate the contributions John Facenda and composer Sam Spence, this CD is a MUST for your Wish List."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like NFL Films, you will love this CD","review":"Being an avid football fan, I had to have this CD. When it arrived I was not diappointed. The music, the voice of John Facenda (the voice of NFL Films) and an excellent mix of real sounds from the NFL make this a real keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun puppet","review":"We got this for a long plane ride with my eight month old.

I would recommend it highly for playing with friends you already know but would like to get to know better. I don't think it would be nearly as fun to play with people you hardly know. But for people you are getting to know, or good friends you think you know, this is the perfect game for a night of laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had higher hopes","review":"We LOVE to play Wise and Otherwise (the favorite), Balderdash, and Beyond Balderdash. This game seemed much like those. Unfortunately, the six of us that played it could almost always guess who had written which answer. It was not very exciting and we were all bored quickly. It was disappointing. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great party game with new friends or old friends","review":"Playing the game \\"Loaded Questions\\" adds fun and intrigue to any gathering.

Overall Loaded Questions is a great game concept for a group of people to enjoy themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"C. Patterson","review":"Great game for adults. Children under the age of 16 don't seem to understand the concept of true answers. Marvelous game for family or close friends. Allows a deeper understanding of each other. Lots of fun but takes longer than an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad game - annoying questions that no one cared about","review":"I got this game to play with friends when they visit. We played this one time...and hated it. It wasn't fun, and it was annoying to answer the questions. The questions were dumb and if you know the people you're playing with, it's way too easy to guess who wrote them. If you like games that \\"break the ice\\" then maybe this is a good game for you, but it was just kind of dumb trying to pretend you cared enough to answer the questions. Returned it after 1 play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Boring!!!","review":"Got this game in the hopes that it would be as much fun as \\"Apples.\\" Although the instructions are simple enough, as we played, we all thought that we were missing something... there really was no surprise, laughter or enjoyment produced from the \\"crazy\\" questions presented in the game. (nothing to really consider \\"loaded!\\" more like mundane) Perhaps the adult version was more of what i was looking for to spark a night of interesting conversation but since this was so lukewarm, i doubt the adult version is any more risky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this game and thought it would great but have to agree with the other reviews - the questions fall into the who cares at allI looked through most of the cards and there were a few interesting questions - very fewDon't waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"My friends and I play these type of board games all the time, and this one is the best by far.

This is a really fun game, it can get a tad bit long though, and can be loads of fun if you are playing with fun people who can laugh at themselves. It definately brings up stories that have to be shared on why people wrote down the answers they did. The game isn't so much about winning as the fun you all have getting there. Both this game and \\"true colors\\" are great. Personally i like this a bit more tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night of laughter and TMI!!","review":"We bought this for a get together over dinner with two other young couples like ourselves. We had such a blast playing it and it was the perfect activity for our group. The three wives all knew each other since high school but the husbands only knew each other through occasional get togethers with all three wives. I wondered if it might be too hard to play considering they didn't know each other well but it never became an issue. I highly reccomend this game!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!!","review":"The product came as described. Packaged nicely. It also arrived in prompt time which made me very happy.

I think this is by far the favorite game of all of us now. To guess who would say what you will have a better chance if you know the people you are playing with, but the answers people come up with are hilarious!!! I am buying it for my home so we can all play again, and then maybe I'll venture out to the other versions, but this one was pure fun with no wrong answers! Favorite questions: An inappropriate name for a children's book and What would you farm to make a million dollars. The answers we all came up with made our sides and faces hurt from laughing so much. Anyone over 16 would probably have a good time with this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Perfect for family game night!!

Really the game in concept and organization is fine, but some of the questions are simply boring not \\"loaded\\". For example: \\"What kind of deodorant do you wear?\\" and \\"How many pairs of jeans do you own?\\" would fall into the \`who cares' category for me. We played the other night with friends and finally got so tired of the boring questions we started making up our own. We had a few good laughs out of the games questions, but really had fun with some seriously loaded questions. However, I would like to see a version of this game with truly loaded questions and less questions that I could care less about. I would say this game is great for early teens but lacks the punch for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAMILY FUN","review":"We have played this with 10 year olds up to 60 year olds. The person's whose turn it is has to guess how everyone answers a question such as \\"A common dogs name\\" Of course there is always someone who will throw a stupid answer in so that you don't know who answered it, and we are always sure it is the 10 year old, only to find it was the 60 year old. Then the fun begins. It is one of those games that we play every year on the holidays, or just when a large group gets together. Of course when anyone new comes along, that is always the best. This has always provided lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate games but I love this","review":"This is my favorite game ever. People who say this game is boring are missing the point. Yeah, admittedly, we frequently allow people to skip certain questions (often the ones that involve plain numbers, like how many of something you have). But, really, people, you don't have to even tell the TRUTH. Normally, by the end of the game we're trying to guess whose ridiculous made-up answers is whose. And it's fun! Just don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my best memories","review":"This game is amazingly funny. One of my most hilarious memories is playing this game with a group of friends over the holidays last year.

It helps to have a family full of funny and articulate people, but even our 12 year old grandson fit this category. The questions just seem to lend themselves to outrageous, personal answers, and a certain amount of strategy can be used, such as answering a question in the way another player would probably answer it. It's probably not a good idea to play with people who don't know each other fairly well, and perhaps might be offended by certain answers. But play en famille and be prepared to wipe tears of laughter from your faces!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even for non-gamesters!","review":"I love this game and was able to talk some non-gamesters into playing it.

Heartily recommended for would-be writers and journalists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read","review":"I found this to be a very difficult read for someone, like myself, who never read anything by Collette and did not really know anything about her. We chose it for our book club and most of us felt the same way. The beginning was very difficult to get through while both trying to get used to Thurman's writing style and trying to keep up with all of the people she introduces. There was no real depth behind anyone's introduction. I didn't find myself caring about what happened to anyone. Collette was not a nice person, a horrible mother and yet I felt that Thurman was trying to show her in an abused wife role which didn't really fit. I couldn't really figure her out or where she was coming from. I know this is a biography and that Thurman is just telling the facts, but I found it very challenging to read and try to make sense of all of those pieces of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Engaging","review":"On the strength of reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post, my book club selected this book as a must read. To a woman, we found this book difficult to plow through. Thurman is enamored of subordinate clauses, tangential references and elliptical thoughts. If she were a journalist, her editor would tell her that she buried her lead at every possible opportunity. The book club came away not giving a hoot about Collette, who her mother was or who either of them slept with. Bottom line: if you are a huge fan of Collette, this might be an interesting book. For the rest of us, it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing seems tired","review":"In the first half the writing is abysmal, but it gets much better in the second half (despite the repetitions). In the second half Thurman glides into the smoother tone used by Francis and Gontier (another biography of Colette), whom she quotes along with myriad other authors whose ideas she uses. There is little fresh or original in this book (unless you count Thurman's opinions, which I find jarring and not always based on sound evidence). As you can tell, I wish I'd got this book at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what!","review":"I didn't find the book very interesting although it could have been.

I have never been so unenchante"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the educated reader","review":"Colette is not an easy person to like, and this biography is dense and thick with information and literary interpretation, meaning that it's not an \\"easy\\" or quick book to read. That said it is an accomplished, thoughtful book. Judith Thruman is an excellent writer and I personally was engrossed -- I really couldn't put this book down. But it is not for everyone. It is for those interested in Colette or at least in her milieu. Thurman gives a vivid sense of the time Colette lived in, and a persuasive look at her motivations, personality, and contradictions. She shows those of us who love Colette's writing that it is possible to enjoy a writer's books without necessarily admiring that person's life and deeds. It is a facinating dicotomy: how can a person, Colette, or anyone else, be so senstitive in her writing life, yet so insensitive to those who actually surrounded her? It is a question to which there is no answer, yet one which Thurman beautifully illustrates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very engaging book","review":"On the strength of reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post, my book club selected this book as a must read.

I looked at buying a repalcement grill, but they are all sheetmetal and seem so cheaply made. Purchasing new burners was the next best thing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the price. Like everything else in life, I wished it cost a little less. It is still cheaper than buying a new grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"They are a very good quality, better than what were on the original grill.These items were a great replacement for our grill and are highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caulked full of the occult....","review":"Even though the book is categorized as gothic genre, in reality it is a work of fiction which totally revolves around witchcraft -- imitative magic with waxen images, pentagrams, Sator formulas, covens, black mass, clairvoyants, animal sacrifices, incantations, possessed animals (attendant demons).

Yeah, those rocket ships and \\"Strato-Sleds\\" look pretty comical shooting out sparks and sounding like over strained electric orange squeezers. But those who remember seeing Flash Gordon in the movie theaters will tell you, these serials had kids sitting on the edge of their chairs and bursting to see what was \\"to be continued\\" next week. I first saw my first Flash Gordon serial on T.V. in the early 1950's and I'll tell you, I found it exiting then. Now we can laugh about much of the bad acting and the \\"odd\\" mistakes now and then, but this is real film history folks.

The DVD set is a distinct improvement over an earlier VHS version. In that one, the background music for the second serial sometimes was so loud that it competed with the dialogue, And evidently the VHS tapes could not hold every detail of all 15 chapters. So they truncated at least the introductions.Now everything is completely restored on DVD, and the sound balance is just fine.

It's not big enough for a Comb or full trimming shears though. You'll need the full size comb for that.I keep my trimmer blades, manicure tools, and once and a while I'll dip the blade of my straight edge razor in it.

The clips break when bent too much. I was able to hang my lights only after I replaced their pole with a professional painter's pole that can be extended without bending or collasping.

I was mesmerized by the authenticity of the setting, dialogue and harshness of the characters.A deeply moving film experience. Not altogether a pleasant one, but that's a testimony to the quality of the performances. As others have said, this is a story about confusion and yearning for love and acceptance. It has little to do with lesbianism and sex. Boys Don't cry is a powerful and disturbing film, one of the best of 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brutal, Heartwrenching Film","review":"This movie is easily the most brutal and disturbing movie that I've ever seen. A movie about one person's quest to manifest there real self not just what people see. The performances in this are amazing Hilary Swank WAS a boy not just a girl trying to play a boy. Chloe Sevigny was wonderful as a girl trying to escape her \\"white trash\\" roots and make a better life for herself. Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III who play John and Tom play the roles of two guys unwilling to \\"think outside the box\\" with a cruel edge. Every other actor who is a part of this profoundly tragical movie acts with a sense of vulnerability(Candace) or the seeming inability to eascape their \\"trailer-park\\" lives(Lana's mom). This movie is not for those who like bright and sunny movies ,but for those who want to see the unfettered and unsettling reality that is life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls Will Cry","review":"I saw this movie, enjoyed all of the scenes in which she was Brandon Teena undercover But when she was discovered, i started to cry my eyes out.

Hilary Swank pulls off her best male impression but her accent and mannerisms just fall flat. I could barely see the movie, and what I mean by that is the picture quality is very dark. It was like the film was shot in complete darkness, bad lighting and cinematography. There is no happy ending and you just feel no lesson is learned, Boys Don't Cry tries to make a point but fails to deliver a hopeful message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your facts straight","review":"I would just like to point out that Brandon Teena was not a butch lesbian, as some people have stated in their reviews. Brandon Teena was a F2M transgendered person who should be referred to as a he, not a she, and most definately not as a butch lesbian. If anyone was confused by his identity in the movie, I suggest you read up on transgender identities and issues before you post an ignorant review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Violent","review":"When this movie first starts, it doesn't seem like it is going to be too bad; but as it progresses, it becomes worse and worse.

But all in all the movie was pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandon's Legacy","review":"This film focuses on the true life of Brandon/Teena Brandon, a hermaphrodite who was brutally murdered in the early morning hours of December 31, 1993. Ater learning there was such a person as Brandon Teena, I was truly touched by his life...and at the same time I was filled with anger and sorrow from the horrific ways in which his life was ended-- all Teena Brandon wanted was to be one of the guys. When I was informed that Kimberly Pierce had written and produced a film regarding Brandon Teena, I knew that I had to see it. For 4 months I waited, and finally \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" came to a local theater. I saw the movie, and I must say Hillary Swank was outstanding in her role of portraying Brandon! I was very pleased to see her win the Oscar for best actress-- she deserved it every step of the way. This film is a definite must see!

Incredibly life like in it's depiction of a young lesbian on a quest for love. Trueism also in the way the narrow minded people treated her after they found out that \\"he\\" was a she.

Now I'm out the money I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Don't' miss it","review":"The debut film from Kimberly Peirce is an American tragedy almost too devastating to witness, though impossible to look away from. Hilary Swank delivers one of the year's best performances as Teena Brandon, a woman living life as a boy named Brandon Teena, in backwater early-'90s Nebraska. Teena falls for the naive Lana (Chloe Sevigny), another young woman whose dreamy spell is on a crash course with harsh reality. Director Peirce and co-screenwriter Andy Bienen have fashioned an unforgettable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing performance by Hilary Swank","review":"Hilary Swank is simply astounding in this film. It is easy to see why she won the Oscar for it. Overall, all of the acting is excellent with strong supporting performances all around, especially Chloe Sevigny as the love interest. The film itself is dark and somewhat dreary and thus, it succeeds in getting its point across. I had seen the documentary beforehand and if you have already seen it, you may find some of the film a little boring. Overall, this is a masterpiece of portraying a segment of our society that is truly frigtening. Anyone needing a good definition of \\"white trash\\" need only watch this film. The dvd is very good, great picture quality and features a commentary from director Kimberly Peirce. Several language options are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"does it make me a lesbian if i think hilary swank is hott in this movie ?? but in such a weird way lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"The video was sent immediately and in the new condition I was told.

But as usual, this was just another movie made for a man. The main goal of the producer was to get in as much lesbian sex & female frontal nudity as possible. Was this really necessary? I think we could get the point of the story without all of that nonsense.This review is for those who do not appreciate the exploitation of women.

What were the movie makersthinking when they made this move? Absolutly none of the charactersdeserve simpathy, not even Brandon, I mean Tina. The story is so crazy I can't believe that this is an accurate portrayel of the real Tina. The movie shows her as a very stupid person who brought all of what happens on her self, I mean she stayed in the same town with the people who threatened her life and raped her. No one in the movie is worth watching as a character and the only reason to see it is for Hilary Swank. Her performance is very good and I see why she won an academy award but the rest of the movie is horrible, have no moral, and is downright horrible.

THIS FILM HAS NO MORAL OR REDEMING QUALITY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys Don't Cry","review":"This gritty, compelling film by debut director Kimberly Peirce examines homophobia, sexual identity, and unconventional love in a small, dead-end town. Based on the real-life story of Brandon Teena (born Teena Brandon) who was murdered in 1993, \\"Boys\\" is a first-rate docudrama with a lot on its mind, but Peirce never lets the issues diminish the emotional impact of her story. Swank's unusually brave performance, honored with an Oscar, is gut-wrenching to watch, while arthouse darling Sevigny breaks your heart as Brandon's love interest. Brutal subject matter, but \\"Boys\\" demands to be seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising in its lack of stridency","review":"i was very surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie. i expected a piece of agitprop, but instead saw a balanced view of both the flaws and strengths of brandon teena. hilary swank was wonderful, and she makes as hot a teenage boi as any actress since the golden era of jodie & kristy in the late 70s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched DVD","review":"The DVD was scratched and would not play.

By the end of the dizzying experience that was 'Boys Don't Cry' - I could only wonder how the Academy found any part of it worthy of an Oscar.Though Hillary Swank is convincing as Brandon/Teena, the circustances of the character are all too pathetic to make a true connection.It seems everyone behind this film had an \\"agenda\\" with the American public. \\"Hate is alive and well in America\\"... hmmm, I guess we didn't know that. What is even worse is that it fails to deliver the message by focusing on the jealous rage of Tom over the relationship between Brandon/Teena and Lana.

The raw emotion that drips from her character you could almost grab in your hand. However, if you want entertainment, this movie is not for you.

And here he is, Paul McCartney, in Red Square, near Lenin's Tomb, rocking the same Russians, now older and grayer but now free. High energy throughout. You can tell McCartney knows how important this is to the Russian people. 'Back in the USSR' never sounded better.

Never again will I buy without checking the customer reviews first. Sometimes I put on the DVD and shut off the TV so that I can just listen to the music, but the annoying interviews keep interrupting the show.What a waste.

I was very disappointed by the sound quality. Lots of fading and drop outs. Probably caused in part by all the cutting and editing. I too wish it was just music. Please remaster the sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Impactful","review":"I made this purchase to see a live concert but got much more. The historic content was fascinating, complete with commentaries by Russia's own 60's radicals. They speak of the impact that the music of the Beatles (which had to be listened to \\"underground\\")had on the political atmosphere and eventual decline of communism. It is no wonder that McCartney is seen as a hero there. The concert was excellent and the reaction of the Russian people was very moving. I will watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Concerts & Interviews","review":"The power for good that the Beatles music and message offered to those in the former Soviet Union surprised me. The positive messages and addictive, toe tapping songs that Paul wrote or co-wrote seem as fresh today as when they were so inspiring to those living in a society that banned the Beatles music -- of course making it all the more popular and meaningful to Soviet citizens. It is a sight to behold - Russians mouthing the words to song after song after song, in English!The negative note is seeing Heather Mills in some of the footage - due to the nasty divorce that is currently underway in England; It is a reminder of a sad chapter in both Paul McCartney and Heather Mills lives'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"What else would you expect from Paul. This is a must for anybody who is a McCartney/Beatles fan. If you are not, you will be after watching this. Paul always keeps it fresh by adding songs he's never done on tour before. I've Got a Feeling was a fantastic surprise and the Helter Skelter encore was superb! This is a great show! The two shows ( Moscow & St. Petersberg )are great. After the Moscow show I'm thinking this is great, but I was then blown away by the St. Pete show. Getting Better & She's Leaving Home ( from Sgt. Peppers )Paul added to the shows a couple of years ago are great to see, as the entire concert is. Also included are interviews with the Russian people about the Soviet Beatles ban and the goings on at the time. Even Putin talks about listening to the Beatles when they were banned. I didn't expect all the extras about Russia and the footage of Paul in Moscow and St. Petersberg, which add more to this fabulous DVD. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than music...","review":"This is as much a \\"rockumentary\\" as it is a concert film. Bonus! Little tidbits endear and entertain: such as the fact that when Muscovites learned guitars could be electrified with telephone parts, there was mass vandalism of public phones overnight. Paul can still hit the high notes, and his band is HOT. Check out the backstage a cappella warmup. It will either give you chicken skin, or you don't have a pulse. This is a majick portal back to a mystical era known as The Beatles...a time of great songs about love."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCartney at his BEST","review":"If your foot isn't tappin' throughout this DVD then you must be deaf.

It was great seeing Paul rocking the USSR, especially seeing the Russian Presedent also rocking along in the audience.Sound quality great, my only disapointment was that it was in 4:3 format, c'mon Paul in this day & age it should have released in 16:9 format."},{"rating":"1","title":"who is the idiot behind producing this DVD?","review":"This DVD is simply unwatchable. I can't see why there are so many good reviews. There is not a single scene that stays for more than 3-4 seconds. The scenes keep on switching frantically and in a irritant way! The sound quality is not good; the crowd is too noisy and the volume keeps going up and down. I am dissappointed in this DVD, and I don't recommend it. Oh, I forgot! every few songs, you get some documentary!! This is a DVD that is certainly not enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"UN CONCIERTO ESPECTACULAR","review":"Es un concierto con la calidad excepcional de Paul McCartney. Los temas elegidos, el fervor del p��blico ruso y el nivel musical del DVD hacen que sea obligado para todos los fans de The Beatles y de Paul en particular. Incluso cuando los coros de los m��sicos nos hacen extra?ar con nostalgia los coros de John y George, el resumen general es muy emocionante. Hay un agregado del Bonus de History Channel que es impecable. Sencillamente un DVD recomendable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst concert DVD I own.","review":"I own about 40 various concert DVD's and must say this is about the worst of the lot. The reason - the concert footage is almost unwatchable. I can't for the life of me understand why they felt the need to change camera shots every 1 or 2 seconds (you get 3 seconds if your lucky) but that's they way they put this together. I actually counted the number of changes over the course of 1 minute during the performance of Jet and it was 51. 51 camera changes in 60 seconds of footage - you do the math on that.It's really a shame too because the concerts really seem to be excellent. Paul has a great backing band and the songs sound fresh and filled with energy. In the end it doesn't matter as it's not possible to sit down and enjoy watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - The Worst Concert DVD Ever!","review":"This DVD should be called \\" A LOOK AT A RUSSIAN CONCERT AUDIENCE WITH BACKGROUND MUSIC BY PAUL McCARTNEY\\". It is the poorest edited concert DVD ever, with more shots of the people in Red Square than of the band on stage. The relatively few shots of Macca and the band are too short and are quickly cut to either the over used boom camera, another shot of the audience, or another quick shot of a band member.Originally broadcast on A&E; Networks, this is more of a documantary about east-meets-western culture than it is about the music. I turned it off after three songs. You will, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Haefeli another useless Paul concert !","review":"Why can't Paul just give us a high quality dvd? like the eagles did with the farewell tour dvd... it dosent get any better than that! eagles get a 10 ! for that one. Paul has no money problemsso why can't he make a dvd of that quality? this dvd will give you a J.F.K. memorial headache load up on the aspirin, before watching! nothing but two second cuts all the way through! total waste of time with irritation! last words! Mark Haefeli and Paul? take lessons from the eagles when attempting a serious dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Song List","review":"This is a fantastic DVD, with the exception of all the narration between songs - very annoying on the first viewing. OK, you can just skip the chapters with interviews when viewing again to enjoy music only. And, the music is great - Sgt. Pepper is worth the price of admission alone. I found the music and energy on this DVD much better than the last DVD USA release, and will keep this one close to the player for multiple viewings. Nice 5.1 sound - I thought the 5.1 Dolby was better than the DTS track. My TV up-converts the picture and the visual quality was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH POLITICAL","review":"Well, this dvd seems some kind of propaganda anticomunist. In the sixties all the world was in revolution, USA, USSR, FRANCE, etc. The concerts are edited and not complete, I have the bootlegs and are much better. For the extras I have to say that we are older now and each one have his own opinion about the cold war. We do not need a story of the Soviets, we know that. The only reality is that the USA and UK governements in the seventies denied residence to JOHN LENNON for his politics thoughts. Finally they give the green card and JOHN LENNON retired at home. When he return in 1980 was killed in the USA, by a USA CITIZEN that they said was crazy..., one thing is shure JOHN LENNON WAS NOT KILLED BY THE KGB.It would have been better the two concerts complete without edition, and left out the Breznev... film..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Man of Asia","review":"Stephen Chow is the top comedy act of Hong Kong cinema, and for good reason.

Other than that, the rest play fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still excellent, after all these years...","review":"Great programming doesn't get stale with age, it only gets better. This season is excellent, and in my opinion is much better with Jimmy Smits, than with David Caruso. Shame on you David, you quitter. I'm glad your big Movie Career failed. Your supporting staff did not deserve your arrogance.Jimmy Smits is a wonderful actor, and equally compliments the harshness of Dennis Franz. The storyline is excellent. I miss seeing \\"more\\" of Gail O'Grady in this season, but that's okay.Great writing in this series and particulary in this season.Two thumbs up!!!EDIT: What is the deal, whenever somebody mentions \\"John\\" the PAA, who takes the place of Mrs. Abondonza, the person asks: \\"John Kelly,?\\" the David Caruso character.

My copy, when received, had problems. The first disc had dislocated from its place in the container, and the disc was damaged by the container's hard plastic center spool, making two of the episodes on it unplayable on my Panasonic equipment. This is a first for me, never happened before with any other set ordered from AMAZON. The cost of the set was so low, and since we had already seen the two episodes when first aired, we decided the matter was not worth pursuing.

I didn't think he would be able to work the fishing rod to \\"catch\\" the fish, but he picked it up right away! It took him a while to be able to put the pieces back in the right places, but he still loved just fishing them out and then bringing them to me to put all of the pieces back in. We had to shorten the string on the rod to make it a bit easier, but other than that this puzzle is perfect. My son is now 2 years old and continues to really enjoy this puzzle and plays with it almost every single day. As with all Doug & Melissa toys, it very high quality and well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea, but...","review":"Great idea. Bright colors, good variety of fish. Wood pieces are very sturdy and the \\"fishing pole\\" has survived being stepped on many times, used as a bat, and being thrown on the floor. It's a big hit with all the children for a few minutes, but frustration causes them to lose interest.The biggest frustration with this toy is how difficult it is to \\"catch\\" a fish. The magnets are small and don't attract very well. The \\"string\\" swings wildly with each small movement. Children learned quickly to manually place the magnet \\"hook\\" onto the fish magnet, but that's not the idea of the puzzle.The educational value of this toy would be increased if it identified the fish and perhaps included some details about the individual fish or the aquatic life in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnets don't work","review":"I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old for Christmas.

Then my son, now 18 months, became an addict--\\"star!\\" \\"moon\\"! \\"balloon!\\" (please note he didn't know these words two days ago) He goes for the book several times a day. But now I'm addicted too--the illustrations are magnificent, with wonderful color, detail, and depth that captivates even very young children, not unlike Richard Scarry.

I was told that these shocks carry NO WARRANTY. None, zero, not a 30 day, nothing. I was a bit surprised and disappointed.

I wish Moustapha Akkad knew alittle something about the Halloween movies, and alittle more than the fact that they bring in money. I think Donald Pleasence is rolling over in his grave every time the movie plays. This movie made Michael Myers a ghetto joke. It was horrible.

[The] movie will be awesome simply because Michael is in it and so is Laurie...the only knocks I have on it are Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes?

No suspense whatsoever, and anybody who thinks this movie is any good at all is a complete moron.Besides, you can't just chop off Michael Myers' head in H20 and then make Resurrection and say that Michael pulled the old switcharoo and it was somebody else's head that got cut off.

The movie was way too predictable and I just couldnt take busta seriously"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex's accurate and true review!","review":"When I went to see the movie, Halloween Resurrection, I didn't expect it to be anything more than another ordinary horror flick. Today, most horror films are predictable and always the same. This horror movie was the exact opposite. This movie was totally GREAT! It had tons and tons of jumps and screams, that had perfect timing. There was great suspense, and lots of edge-of-your-seat excitment. The violence wasn't too less or too much. The story line was really great and kept the audience glued to their seat. I definately recommend people to see this movie. People who like great suspense and terror will love this.RATED R FOR STRONG VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, SOME SEXUALITY WITH BRIEF NUDITY, AND BRIEF DRUG USE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better go see it in the theatres if you want it to scare you","review":"The only thing that made this film scary was the loud surrond sound in the theatre. Without telling the whole storyline, I will just say yes, there will be another sequal because he does not get killed. None of the original soundtrack is used in this sequal except for the main theme of course. I was not at all afraid of the shape in this one. I did like how they connected the storyline from H2O to the film, and how they used all the modern technology throught the film like the internet, those little cameras, and a pocket pilot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"I loved the mask and actually thought it was the best one, there were a lot of things done like the original Halloween, the plot was interesting and the music was very good.

I definetly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suspenseful, not inventive","review":"I can only judge this movie based on its own merits, as I haven't seen the others in the series.Very little scared me in this movie. From the first murder to the final \\"surprise\\", there is no inventiveness or suspense. In a horror film, the terror comes not from the violence and gore, but from the unexpectedness of it, and the novelty in how it's done. None of the victims died in novel ways, nor did they escape in novel ways. The appearance of Michael Myers was never a shock, never a surprise, and the end of the film is as predictable as they come.My only kudos go out to Busta Rhymes, who brought a touch of humor and originality and camp, not taking his role TOO seriously, making me laugh and scream in delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention Horror [Fans}: Do Not Waste 6 Bucks To See This!","review":"This movie was so sad, i don't think it even deserves a review... the whole plot of the movie totally [bad]...Spare yourself a few bucks by avoiding to go see this movie.

Anyway I am a fan of the first 2 films but they just kept going and going. H20 was bad enough. I will say this one was a little better but not much. The death scence where old and predictable. The use of shadows and music where lackluster. lets face it michial myers just isnt scarry anymore since the 78 and 81 movies. It just never has gotten its flare back. I had to see it just becuse I knew it would suck plus im a film student and I went to study it. The camera effects on the kids in the house was not a new good idea I thik it disteracs from the film. Hollywood we dont want flashy camera filters on our horror movies. Givn it works for some but not for this move. It should of been shot on gritty film (not quility) With more lighting effects and better background music. Thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weeping, Cinematic Boil on the Bottom of an Already Played-Out Series","review":"Quite possibly the pinnacle of idiotic, unnecessary horror sequels (save, perhaps, JASON X), HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION is pointless in the extreme and only for franchise completists. With a cast led by the foul-mouthed Shark-Shark Binks himself, Busta Rhymes, and a career-defining performance by narcissism-royalty Tyra Banks as some chick who thinks she's Tyra Banks, how could you go wrong? Bring Michael Myers back from the dead with a flimsy insult to audience intelligence; destroy the last thread of the myth within the first 15 minutes, making the ensuing 75 minutes all-the-more inexplicable; and drag the legend into the 21st century with a plot centered around the internet, reality television, and instant messaging. That oughta do it - and they do, with excruciating abandon. The result is a weeping, cinematic boil on the bottom of an already played-out series that John Carpenter wisely washed his hands of a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"well....","review":"This movie was only okay.

Its better then the Rob Zombie remake at least, PLEASE AVOID THAT MOVIE HALLOWEEN FANS! Myers was normal in this movie, the Zombie film made him look like he was on steriods. Probably an ode to the times. I love the Halloween series but I rank this as one of the worst films due to the dumb internet story line.

They could have brought Jamie Strode back if they hadn't killed her which may have saved the series for a nineth which will be coming out soon but it will be a turkey. Seeing new people get killed in the eight part of a series is just plain old. It's not any good. History will have three great slashers. Freddy Michael and Jason but everything comes to an end.

They should've called it \\"HOMECOMING\\" like originally planned and included the 8mm family footage of Michael as a kid., what was Resurrected exactly???? Also, Busta Rhymes totally ruined this movie for me with his stupid one liners and Kung Fu antics.

Blah.But then the rest of the movie is just as bland and boring.I was wishing for each teen in the haunted house to get taken out but sadly a few live. Each teen was dumb as hell and just as tedious. Heck, even the death scenes were lame. How many stabbings and slashings can we get? From the first to the last death scene there was not one original 'death.' No funny or witty killings like in a Jason or Freddy movie. Nothing. Blah.The only thing i really liked about this movie was Busta Rhymes, which is a scary thought. He had a few funny lines with his trademark curse (mofo) and his karate scenes were funny, though im not sure if they were intended to be comedic...Stay away from this movie as it is definitely NOT a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SLAP TO THE FACE/ NO STARS!","review":"halloween 8: I recieved this so called film as a gift,That is the only reason I still have a copy.This thing is awful,they show promise with part 7 then kick you in the groin when busta rhymes?!? shows up.WHY IN THE NAME OF ALL THINGS HOLY DID THEY KILL LAURIE STRODE IN SUCH A STUPID WAY?

It's insulting to think they could kill off Jamie Lee Curtis the way they did - she sets up an elaborate trap for Michael and catches him and then just stands there a foot away from his arms as if he's paralyzed or something - you'd think that she would have learned something through all these years of being chased by a psychotic serial killer. STUPID! The rest of the movie is a complete joke. The acting sucks, which is easy to get past sometimes but in this film you don't give a crap about anyone. The characters are stupid. Stupid stupid stupid! By the end of the movie if you're not cheering whenever Michael kills someone there's something wrong with you. I was especially disappointed when they brought Freddy (Busta) back - he is so annoying. They should have left him dead. The movie would have been scores better if Michael had succeeded in killing EVERYONE in the house.

Well I've got to say I saw the movie today and it was terrible. Probably the worst in the series. Michael Myers has become Jason and is no longer scary just a killing machine that cannot be stopped. Except for when a rapper is in the movie.... But this is besides the point.... Any real Halloween fan will be drastially disappointed.For the record I thought H20 was brilliant in the aspect that it dicarded Halloween 3-6 and tried to end the series the way it should have been ended. That movie was made for the fans. This new one is made strictly for the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"plain awful","review":"Worst movie ever. No wonder why they didn't make a sequel to this one. No the remake versions are not sequels. This movie was so bad, Jamie Lee Curtis wanted her character killed when she saw the script. She was only in the first few minutes of the film.

Just pretend it dosen't exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"The whole movie was very predictable and just a typical teeny bopper date movie.

The only reason I gave this movie 1 star was because of the first 15 min. Thats how the movie should have been!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie if it's the Last One","review":"Halloween Resurrection was a great movie under one condition, that it will be the last of the series. Since there has been speculation about Jamie Lee Curtis being killed I guess it's no mystery anymore, which is the first reason this better be the last Halloween movie. They better not make another one if Jamie Lee Curtis can't be in it, because that would be wrong, she is the main character and it wouldn't be right without her in it. Another reason is that he should've died by now, I know that in every horror movie the killer never dies, but he should've died in this one only because director's are running out of interesting ways to kill their bad guys. So I really liked this movie, but if they plan on Halloween 9 I could change my mind very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Electrifying!!","review":"I am a huge Halloween fan and saw this movie on opening day. I just have to say that it was amazing!! The first Halloween will always be the best but this one rivals it. The opening scene is awesome and Michael Myers shows up right off the bat. There are maybe 10 minutes of the movie that doesn't have Mikey in it. He is all over the rest of it. There is a high death count and I thought the acting was grand. All characters are played very well (even Busta Rhymes). I am definitely going to see it at least twice. I advise you do the same.

Halloween is a movie to go and enjoy yourself at and get a good scare. The Halloween movies are not made to win Acadamy Awards or they would put more time into them.

However, one teenager after another seems to fall under the large blade of Michael Myers, but will the secret of Michael Myers be revealed?

Halloween 2 was a good sequel, and I don't even remember parts 3,4,5,and 6. However, Halloween H2O is much more suspenseful and entertaining film than Halloween Resurrection. Even Michael Myers doesn't seem to care about the element of surprising his victims in this new installment. He doesn't even stay hidden for very long, before he kills again, and again, and again! Halloween H20 was the perfect ending for this series. My wife and I were staring at each other at the end of Halloween Resurrection in disbelief that we actually sat through the whole movie.

If her brother can't die why should she? I also like the way that they take you back to the place to where the first murder was. I think that this movie is funny and scary at the same time. There were people in the theatre laughing and some screaming so if your looking for a good movie I would suggest seeing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after previous entry in series","review":"The premise seems promising at first. A group of college students is selected to act out an internet play at the home of killer Michael Myers...This Michael Myers is the deadly character who haunted previous HALLOWEEN movies and is presumed dead by the beginning of this one. The premise is not bad. And there comes a time in the movie when, hardly surprisingly, the notorius villian turns out to be alive after all. When the students discover that Myers is still alive and not only kicking but still wreaking deadly terror in the house where he grew up, things pick up a little. From there through the decently entertaining climax, the movie has the makings of a not-so-bad thriller. But the problem is in the middle, between the set-up and the climax. There it wallows in typical teen-movie cliches -- virile wisecracking males, and females who resist them in equally cliched wisecracking manner...the only memorable thing about the move is was pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the WORST in the series","review":"I love Halloween movies, I love Jamie Lee, and I love reality TV. Yet I hate this movie, and the whole theater I was in booed! Jamie wanted out, and her character gets \\"killed\\" in a really lame, disrespectful way. Busta Rhymes wanted to be the \\"hero,\\" and he is. He is also just terrible, even by the standards of this genre. Rick Rosenthal directed Halloween 2, which also blew, and shows that he still has no sense of suspense whatsoever, and is incapable of creating scares. His idea of horror is just to occasionally show some gore, that's it. This movie has a good concept, but couldn't be worse. Watch 1 again, watch 4 (it's real good!) watch 6. Those are the three good ones. H20 is ok. Part 3 is ok. Part 5 is bad, part 2 is bad, but they are all A+ in comparison to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT???","review":"OK not counting the fact that this is a sequal runned by no name actors and rap artists and just a suck cast, this moive SUCKED! And the reasons above only are a fraction of how many there are. They kill Laurie...hello...can the writers put two and two together and not get 5? Without Laurie, you have no HALLOWEEN anymore. Jammie Lee made this series and without her-good luck. Whats with casting Busta? Yea he can rap and stuff but he can't act at ALL!! I would compare his acting to Shaq's in KAZAAM. Come on! And what's with the stupid story line? Was'nt it made clear that when Michael Kills Laurie he would go after the rest of the famile i.e. Lauries son who we meet in H20. And who would be stupid enough to stay a night in the house after all the stories that HE CANT DIE!!!! I have no clue what writers and producers where thinking but if this is the end of the great series....what a sad way to go out...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Halloween Resurrection? I think the title should of been Halloween desecration. The movie sinks to new lows as it travels further down the toilet after its predacessor Halloween H2O. The movie seems to be over influenced by todays genre of teen movies as it involves such teen idols as Busta (something). This is one of the movies most fatal mistakes, along with heavy script flaws, since the movie is geared more towards the famous rapper than Micheal Myers. My reccomendation for those who have seem the beginning phases of the series is to avoid this movie at any cost. For those who are new to the series, buy Halloween the first story, or if you want a fast thriller movie for the night buy this movie. Although I highly dislike this movie, newcomers who care for a one nighter will probably get there thrill because the movie would not make too much sense anyhow to those who had not seen the previous movies in the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR meaning Jamie Lee ---","review":"Imagine 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' having s-e-x with theginsu-knife infomercial ... this would be their love child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Idiotic Halloween ever.","review":"This has to be the dumbest Halloween movie out there.

The first 10 minutes is kinda cool and 2. Laurie Strode and Michael Myers (It is a Halloween movie after all).The plot didn't even make sense, Michael Myers whole deal was he wanted to kill off every person in his bloodline. Halloween:Resurrection (which isn't even accurate, who's being resurrected??!!) wasn't even about killing off his extended family. Instead he's hiding in a house and picking off college students (whose screams aren't even worthy of horror movie status).Bottom Line - Watch Halloween 1,2,4,5,6 and 7, but stay away from this one ! It'll almost make you lose respect for the whole series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween 8","review":"Do not bother buying this DVD, unless you just want to own all the Halloween movies.

I was even ashamed of Jamie Lee Curtis's small cameo role. Bottom line this movie should be selling for $ brand new. The so called delted scenes are not complete either.

Sure, it's not going to win an oscar but it is a fun movie. Rick Rosenthal did a much better job this time around than he did on Halloween II. First, they went back to a mask that resembled the first one. Second, they added Michael's breathing underneath the mask, like the first one. Kudos. This time, Rosenthal went for a little more suspense instead of all the gore that Halloween II was known for. And hats off to Brad Loree. He had Michael's walk down ( I know it doesn't seem like his walk would be tough, but after Nick Castle nobody seemed to be able to do it. Subtle, yet you know there is a difference)My only complaint is that a few of the deleted scenes should have been left in. I love the car alarm being activated by Michael--Classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace To Halloween Fans","review":"This movie was horrible.

Pretty much the only thing that I don't like about it is that it doesn't really follow the halloweeen story very well. I mean the first ten minutes are good but after that it gets a little annoying. In the rest of the movie it's about these teenagers who win a contest to spend one night in Michael myers' old house, but everything goes wrong when he shows up and starts killing everyone.

But when she dies early it was agood movie after she dies. But when Busta Rhymes was inthe movie I wanted to see him go face to face with Michael. sothat was a good part in the movie also the movie wasstill scary as always so that was good. Also when they try to do a project in Michael Myers houses. I thought they bwere all going to die because they did not know Michael was still aliveand they didn't know he lives there still. There are parts in the movie that can make you jump. So I give Michael Myers Resurrection four stars out of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Halloween H20","review":"Why was Halloween H20 the best sequel besides Halloween 2?Simple because Lori Strode was the main character.

She would be good if she were not only in the first 10 minutes. The first 10 minutes are great but after that it shifts to this live webcast of a bunch of unknowners who you can care less about and it is obvious that Sara will be taking over Laurie Strode's place.

Notice when Jamie Lee hits him with the ambulance he is tripped out and pulling at the mask? Then, he reaches out for help at the end before she slices and dices his head off?

Halloween 2 was a let down, Halloween 3 was an abomination, Halloween 5 was a crime against nature, and Halloween 6 (The Curse of Michael Meyers) was perhaps the worst movie ever made. Then Halloween H20 came out and surprised everybody. It was good! Could this be a trend to revive the dying franchise?

The house, the small portion of the street that is actually visible on film and the \\"outdoors\\" were all created on a studio filming lot. This, I feel, granted the movie a terribly fake aura.The idea for the movie is an attempt to stretch the dark origins of Michael Myers into the modern, technological day. It's a bit too much of a stretch, to be honest. It comes off as cheesy. The acting is not that bad, but the plot and the way it is played out are just short of pathetic. The movie is not scary, suspenseful or even that interesting.If you've got 90 minutes to kill, maybe it's worth a viewing, but you will be disappointed on a number of levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Halloween ever!","review":"Enough is enough already ,geez...how many times is Michael gonna come back ?I have to admit that the idea was good but overall the movie really blew due to the casting of Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks.I mean are all the friggin rap stars and models gonna be in movies now,pathetic if you ask me.If this is the future of horror movies,then count me out.I miss the good ole 80's slashers,those people could actually act and the murders were more creative"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good box office bad movie","review":"There have been so many websites that have given this a terrible review am i going to be any different in one word no!The beginning of the movie is classic halloween and then is on a downward spiral and never looks back.This series desperately lacks the presence of Donald Pleasence god bless his soul or anyone nearthat caliber filling his shoes but busta rhymes you might better have marilyn manson in this schlok of a next installment.At times a complete ripoff of blair witch .There are a few chep scares but if the series continues it's current path i wish john carpenter still had the rights so he coud have killed michael off at the end of the classic HALLOWEEN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I was stabbed in the back","review":"Warning Spoilers!

The other ones are good too. But I felt that Halloween 20 was great. I love the ending, cause she finally wins. She choppes his head off. But when I saw this film I was so upset. To top it all off, Laurie meets up with her brother again. It turns out that it was the ambulance driver she killed, not her brother as we are lead to believe. So he has come back, and he wins. He ends up throwing her off the roof. Evil wins. I don't know about you all, but I had become quite attached to Laurie, with all the crap she has been through. It just upset me to see it all end like that for her. I saw this movie in the theater, and was so excited to see it, but then I saw it. In my opinion, this should not even be a movie. The series should have ended at H20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do-All Outdoors .9mm-30.06 Auto Reset Target","review":"This target is made of metal strong enough to handle 9mm ammo. It is clearly durable. However, to be used at a minimum of 30 feet, the target is so small that it is difficult to hit dead-on to make it function as advertised. I found myself aiming slightly above the soil level in order to contact the target. Because it is so small, this target makes for a very difficult and unrealistic shoot. Also the DVD that came with the box is more of an advertisement for Do-All, and not the assembly directions, and does not run completely through. I feel this target was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"Item was shipped and delivered quickly.

I bought mine initially for around $22. I was APPALLED to see asking prices of over $100 on this site. Are the ones on Amazon gold-plated? Sheesh!

The company from Texas that also makes calculators has designed theirs to be much more user friendly. I recommended this HP calculator for serious college students and professionals who have some programming experience.

The 48G is the latest in a line of calculators that's been around for years and years, which is how long it takes to get a good software base established. The competing calculators have no such user community.

It also is a little hard to snap the top in place until you get used to its placement. Top of carafe is hard to remove and a bit sharp. These are very minor complaints.

For years, martial-arts aficionados have debated the merits of Lee's ambitious project, which died with him in 1973. Based on Lee's notes, historian John Little has painstakingly assembled the existing 32 minutes in the context that Lee intended. The surviving remnants from \\"Game of Death\\" display Lee's maturity as a filmmaker and martial artist who was striving for more realism and less fantasy in Hong Kong action cinema.

There are many hours of incredible live shows, covers, early songs, and strays from Townes' career, and someone really ought to put them together into a box that showcases the guy's talent as a performer. The studio albums show off his songs well enough but they lack nearly all the flavor of his live shows, being far slicker and more produced than anything you would have heard from the man at the Old Quarter or the Cactus Cafe.

Although she figured out how to complete them after a couple of weeks, she still finds amusement in dumping out the pieces and replacing them, now at 17 months. It is great stimulation for mathematical part of her brain and puzzles are now her favorite toys. The realistic pictures of the farm animals are educational and the pieces are odd shaped and challenging. I would suggest lowering the recommended age because I saw how quickly my 14-month-old enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toddlers","review":"We gave this as gifts to my son's little friends this year for Christmas (all about 16-20 months old) and they love it.

BIG mistake. What we received was a very small, and extremely overpriced turkey stuffed with little pieces of what may have been duck and/or chicken... and a lot of nasty-tasting stuffing. The proportions were NOTHING like what is pictured.Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (frozen, stuffed) and the time it is traditionally served (Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner) you don't find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven... and by then you are stuck with it, because most of the stores are already closed.Despite the small amount of meat, it easily fed seven people, with ample left-overs... mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates, let alone went back for seconds.On a positive note, our dog loved the stuff and happily ate what everyone scooped into her bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tur-duc-ken ever","review":"Last year I had another Tur-duc-ken and it was great.

Its main drawbacks are its length and occasional streched out sections. However, overall I found it to be intriguing and worth coming back to reread later on.

It also fills in a little of the gap between the Zion Covenant and Zion Chronicles series concerning a few key characters in one or both of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extremely fine book!","review":"I read this book some time ago, but still remember it well.

The sequel also needs to cover the rest of the war. This way the reader will be prepared to jump into the Covenants and will not have to do a lot of filling in. For example, how did David fall in love with Annie in the Twilight and then fall in love with Ellie in the Zion Covenants?"},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing collage of history","review":"This book goes back and forth between several characters and sub plots so much that it is hard to follow the central theme, if indeed there is one. Parts of the narratives are long and boring and then without warning a different scene and character takes over for a short glimpse of the twilight of courage and jumbles any chance at sorting out the emotion or thought that proceeded it. I would rather read a book that follows one theme or story until it is finished and then begins another one. I love reading WW2 books, but this is the most confusing and boring one I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"diappointed","review":"I was expecting the author to go into more detail on the characters.

I knew Shelley Long wasn't a very good actress but I hoped the rest could pull this movie through.The basic idea for the movie is pretty cool: Santa is captured by a little girl (Judy Emerson played by Sierra Abel who is just a dreadful actress) and hauled off to jail by the local Keystone cops. OK, OK, it's a little hokey I know but I thought it had potential.The dialogue was just awful. Everyone, including the good actors spoke in monotone and appeared to be reading their lines off cue cards. The camerawork was average with several occasions of un-centered characters and shifting too soon. Scenes in the beginning of the movie were shifting faster than a NFL quarterback running from Ray Lewis.Other than these complaints the movie was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little clipper","review":"This little clipper is awesome!

Furthermore, when we take it out and press \\"On,\\" it doesn't turn on.

My wife recently discovered it and I got tired of retrieving it, so I got her this one. Its got the same big display as my old one and even bigger keys. Great. But it has one new feature which is a definite downgrade - it's missing two feet. My old one has four rubber feet and it stays on the desk where you plant it. This one has two feet on the bottom edge and the thing skates around all over the place when you punch the keys - especially when you stroke them as rapidly as she does. It's a very good and dependable instrument and when I find a couple of rubber feet to stick on it, it'll be just a little bit less \\"improved\\" and as good as my old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"keys are on the other side?","review":"Very attractive calculator, but note that it's discontinued.

I chose the TI1795SV because the large display and large buttons. The children and teachers did not need a complex calculator but more than just plus and minus; so this one fit the bill just right. Also, because this community is poor and has limited access to technology the solar cells of the calculator will keep it up and running even if the battery were to lose power. It was a little bulky to carry 20 of these to Peru but well worth the looks on their faces when I donated them.

For action fans, see it when it hits the bargain bin; For everyone else...get someone else to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an accurate portrayal of forest firefighting","review":"This may be above average as an action film. However, as a portrayal of forest fires and firefighting it is horrendously bad and full of technical inaccuracies. This becomes apparent during the first few minutes of the film as we see smokejumpers freefalling (they don't), and it doesn't get any better from there folks; the computer generated fire blowup at the end that burns a zillion acres at once is just as absurd. This film is also full of ridiculous stunts that would be impossible in real life, like the one-handed chainsaw throw, the head being pushed through the metal boat at the end, and that motorcycle jump through the roof of the burning building. They really should have spent some time on technical accuracy and then it might have been a halfway decent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another typical action movie","review":"Okay, this movie wasn't great, but it's exactly like all those action movies with Jean Claude or Segal, very implausible and very corny. The fire and action scenes alone are worth the rental and seeing a new face is refreshing. Howie Long has the same acting abilities as most of the action heroes, but unfortunately his name doesn't hold the same clout as Jean Claude or Segal.

However, with his buff bod, icy blue eyes and a hint of malevolent humor, he acquits himself quite nicely in this blazing adventure. He plays the news fire chief of the Smoke Jumpers when buddy Scott Glenn is injured in a frightening opening rescue scene. The pyrotechnics in this movie are awesome and heat up the screen (ha ha). Suzy Amis is fun as the ornithologist who just happens to walk into the thick of things; William Forsythe is painfully effective as the cold-hearted killer who offs his prison escapee buddies so he can get all of his 37,000,000 dollars!

Given that mine is in total darkness much of the time (e.g., overnight at least), the battery life of the solar version seems to be totally astounding (e.g., five years or so) for a machine which is never turned off.

The description text says that the wide-mouth jar sealer is included in the kit, but it isn't. It isn't even labeled as one of the itmes that should be included if you look at the acutal product packaging. I contacted Amazon about the error and they promptly sent the wide-mouth jar sealer.

There is nothing to retain the bag end in the vacuum channel so it's very difficult to achieve a vacuum and seal. Any moisture in the item to be sealed completley defeats the bag weld. If an item is completely dry or frozen solid the sealer works to some extent as long as the bag is considerably longer than the item to be sealed. Considering the cost of the bags and accessories, it's much cheaper to buy things in smaller quantities and use them in a reasonable amount of time. The unit I bought through Amazon and Cooking.Com was missing the accessory hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marinade? No Way!","review":"I have now managed to break two of these machines. They advertise the ability to marinade. If any liquid get[s drawn]up, which is totally unavoidable when trying to marinade, it stops sealing.... Don't buy this thing. My husband is at this very minute trying to rig a manual seal for it. Wish him luck.PS don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes meal planning so convenient!","review":"I have had this item for about 2 years. Food keeps sooooo much better in the freezer. I like to cook large batches like cabbage rolls or Skyline style chili and freeze individual portions. I also freeze that one leftover serving of mashed potatoes or spaghetti to have with the above items. No more freezer burned taste! I do have to freeze solid before sealing, because the vacuum is so strong it squashes food! My only problem is htat I cannot get the jar-sealer attachment to work, so I'm looking for advice on that! We all feel that we would not want to be without this! I do feel that it is expensive which makes it a luxury item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen item","review":"I reserved my last star because there have been a couple of items that were not completely vacuum tight. When sealing ground beef or something like brats (the thing that didn't seal tight) it is best to push it flat and get the major air bubbles out. Other than that very minor detail this is a fabulous kitchen appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"1050 vs. other models","review":"I just bought the 1050 model. The 300 model does not offer the hole for using the jar sealer(s). The 550 model does, but the 1050 model improves on the 550 by offering automatic operation (you press once and release as opposed to having to hold it down). Not having used one of these before, I appreciate not having to figure out how long or how hard I should press. (Each model upgrade also comes with slightly better accessories.)I rated it 4 stars for ease of operation and for exactly matching what I saw on the infomercials (including the noise). I'm reserving the last star until I see if it actually makes the food last as long as they say."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I live without this thing?","review":"I have this item sitting on top of my Ronco Rotisserie (also from Amazon) and it is used every single day. It is a lifesaver when it comes to buying in bulk and it has paid for itself in potato chips that would normally have gone stale. I always wash out the bags and reuse them to save on buying new ones.My only gripe is that it dies a couple weeks before the warranty ran out. It would not seal anything. I sent it in and it was returned within a couple of weeks completely fixed-no charge except postage one way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best of Argentinien folklore","review":"This is a beautiful CD of Argentinien folklore. I just discovered his CD's in Argentina and I can't stop listening. Facundo Saravia is a great singer, similar to his father (one of the Chalchaleros) but with a more contemporary tone, given by the music and letters of his songs. A good sample of zambas and chacareras with the warm touch of his original Salta."},{"rating":"2","title":"McGuire course honestly changed my life","review":"As a stutterer the McGuire course honestly changed my life. I've done things in the past year that I never thought I would be able to do. The book outlines the technique used to combat the core physical cause of stuttering and goes deeper into the emotional / and psychological aspects of stuttering, like overcoming anxiety and improving self-image. If you're a stutterer who is interested in the McGuire technique this book is a great resource, but in order to get the full experience, go to a course. The fee for the first course is rather sizeable and can be paid in installments, but you can go back to as many courses as you wish for only $90. It is worth it if you are a life-long stutterer. Don't take my word for it; do your own research. This book is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Version Review","review":"I've started reading the kindle version of \\"Beyond Stammering\\" as a refresher. I hope to attend another McGuire course before entering into an upcoming major transition in my life, so this book is getting me pretty excited!I'm just impressed with the layout of this kindle book. For such a niche publication, the creators of this edition have gone all out to make it readable, navigable and accessible. I especially love the function that allows you to click on an image and magnify it.

I read it again and liked it much better, probably because I knew what to expect from the co-authors. And I give Lerner far more credit than before in presenting the Jewish grievances against blacks; West's arguments continue to sound weak.Now, almost 20 years later, there are no black-Jewish relations except on the very outer fringes of the Left. And the reason is simple: We never had and don't have anything in common. In fact, we are on opposite ends of the socioeconomic poles from blacks. Our natural allies are Asians, white ethnics and Christians.

For instance, Jean Plaidy refers to Kings Louis XIV, Louis XV and Henri IV as Louis Quatorze, Louis Quinze and Henri Quatre. I made me wince every time I saw this. In the same way, Louis the Well-Beloved is Louis LE Bien-Aim��, not Louis Bien-Am��, and Louis XV's sisters were called Mesdames, not \\"les Mesdames\\" which makes no sense in French.

His fire and passion in the song was magnificent so naturally I have wanted to hear other cd's (after I bought the Secret Garden, of course). This one was very good. Soothing, and with his highy recognizable tenor falsetto voice. I can't quite give it five stars because it is, as I said, very mellow, but if you want a mellow cd- this is it!

Since they didn't have a large in this item I found the Snoozer Cozy Cave which also comes in large and xlarge. Night and day in quality and durability. The top flap covers more and it has a plastic insert across it that keeps the flap in place. This one can be washed in the wash machine unlike the Petmate.

You should be able to cut off the bag at the seal point, reinsert a food, and reseal the bag. I can't do this because too much of the bag is wasted after cutting off the first seal.I have dealt with customer service a few times and they have been very accommodating, and have fully satisfied my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great every time.","review":"I actually use these with a Rival Seal-a-meal vacumn sealer. They work great every time. They vacumn and seal easily. I've even re-used bags three and four times. I hate to use more plastic, but love the results. I try to salve my conscience by making sure I recycle all the bags when they're no longer usable. I've tried using cheaper bags from Wal-Mart, and had nothing but trouble. The Rival seal-a-meal bags actually work fine too, they're just harder to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I've been using the FoodSaver Vacuum Sealer for years. They've actually re-designed their product, bags included and it works even better. I prefer the pre-made bags and this order completed my inventory . . . always like to have a box or two on hand. I shop at Costco and the only bags they have are the ones in a roll that you have to seal both ends yourself. So I did a google search online and found these, bought 'em and it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size","review":"I've been using the FoodSaver for two years now. I use it quite a bit for packing meat, separating larger quantities of food into smaller packs, and keeping nuts fresh, among many other things.When I first got it, I used the included roll to make my own bags, but the hassle of that wore thin very quickly. I bought my first box of the quart size bags and never looked back.The quart size is the only size I ever buy -- it is perfect for almost everything. Not too small, not too big, just like that story with the bears and the porridge.I still haven't used up that original roll. I doubt I ever will given how well these bags are working for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give it zero stars if possible","review":"I have no problems with the Foodsaver rolls ... those seem to work flawlessly. These pre-made bags, however, have been next to worthless. Perhaps I just received a bad batch but only about one out of every 5 bag will even begin to evacuate much less hold a seal. Those that do evacuate typical lose their seals after a while. I'm sticking with the rolls from now on.One positive is that I can use the box these came in to store bags I've made from the rolls for later reuse. Other than that, these bags have been frustrating in the extreme!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best food vacuum syster ever","review":"I purchased a compact Tilia unit on clearance at a de[artment store...a steal at the price since I paid almost $200 for my first unit. I had it for years, but I finally wore it out. I have searched the web for prices on the bags and Amazon had the best price..with the free shipping it is a non brainer. I have had two other brands of sealers and they were terrible. Nowhere near the suction power of the tilia. These bags are great..they seal well, and last for a long time. If you are not storing raw meat in them...you can wash them out and use them again and again. I particulary like it for cheese. You take what you need and then reseal the bag. Thumbs up for this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...ButI Know What I Like!","review":"I like pictures of naked women, but I like real people, w/o thousands of dollars of surgery, airbrushing, dumb poses, etc. So I found this doc about Spencer Tunick's project to be just right. And as another reviewer said, the people posing, whether singly or by the thousands, all seemed to have had a real 'moment' at the shoots, which seemed to be 'happenings' too. They always cheer happily afterwards, proud to have dared to be free, however briefly. And I so liked the sequence w/ the Russian Museum Director who had her doubts, but was willing to do it 'for art'. I applaude her, and the artist, and all his models.

It is quite over-the-top sweet, so some readers may not care for it. Our son absolutely ADORES this book, and that is the important part!Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the music is way too loud (why do toy manufacturers always seem to think all babies are hard of hearing??). It would be great if the manufacturer could tone it down a bit, or even add a volume control. It is almost impossible to read over the music playing. Also, the tune does not repeat, so as you make your way through the book the music stops playing. Our son insists on having the music play, so at that point we have to close the book and flip it back open to get it playing again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but heads up non-believers!","review":"We love this book. The pictures are great and the rhyming is fun. The only thing I wish I could change is the last line, \\"but most of all what you are is God's greatest gift of love\\". Works great if you are a religious family, but of course there's a large population out there that isn't and they might not realize this book ends with that line since the book appears to be secular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely adorable!","review":"Bought this book today and it's already become my 7 month old daughter's favorite! She loves the illustrations, the SUPER FUN WORDS, and of course the music and lights!The music is a little loud, however, it turns off after one round of the music so it's not bad at all.It's one of the most enjoyable books we have! I will have no issues reading this book to her over and over again!!!Definitely a must-have for any book collection - it's quite unique!*** Update ***Shortly after I wrote this review, my daughter managed to get her little fingers stuck in the heart cut-out between some pages and had to have my help to free them. She cried for quite a while and wouldn't touch the book for months. She's 27 months old now and has no problem reading it or getting little fingers stuck.

In this transcription from piano to orchestra, these melodies come alive. I love the music, and have owed the CD since it was first released.

This film was so obviously done by men who really wish they could get into women's heads, but just can't. The most glaring example was the relationship between the women. I'm a lesbian and during the love scenes I just couldn't figure out what they were supposed to be doing. That might be because no one involved in making the film, including the actresses, had a single clue of what women do in bed. Not that it had to be explicit, that would just be gross, but the implication of what they were doing made no sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Spielberg is so lucky!","review":"Oh my gosh.

I would completely recommend it to anyone (woman) who wants to plop herself down either by herself of with friends and be completely spellbound by the writing and dialogue, to the acting, to the situations that most of us have been though at least once. To those who liked High Art, Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her, and Playing By Heart, this is a good choice. RENT IT, LOVE IT, BUY IT. It's got every genre imaginable, suspense, romance...and the whole thing is riddled with humor.

However, I do disagree with other reviewers comments regarding Elle MacPherson. \\"Lauren\\" is the type of person that can't be comfortable in her own let alone someone who has the ability to follow her bliss. I think Elle played the charachter beautifully - I totally felt her fear and anxiety. Even though she was attracted to Kasey, acting on it went against everything her parents and society taught her. The fact that she would have the affair in the first place is pretty incredible. By the way, who knew Kate could be so hot?Three sisters was just hilarious.

Here are the steps to take, month by month, to achieve the garden you dream about when you read all the plant catalogues. Macunovich is a friendly voice at your back, pushing you to do those boring chores now rather than later (you'll appreciate it) and reassuring you when things don't quite go as you planned (it happens to the best).

From early spring cleanup, to plant division, to weeding, plant choice and more, this is an excellent book for those who have a perennial garden, or those who are considering one.

The images are sharp and I am surprised at how bright the images are considering the price and size of the lenses. Some bird watching sites would have you believe that you have to spend an arm and a leg on a pair of binoculars in order to bird watch properly, that is not the case.

This was a stage success for Helen Hayes, and probably Pickford copies her fairly well, but it's an ordinary Suth'n melodrama, produced at a typically glacial 1929 pace, and playing a bad girl of good family isn't what Pickford specialized in-- or ought to be remembered for.

That doesn't mean she was exempted from mistakes, though. This movie is awful all the way through. It's boring, paceless an has the stiffest acting imaginable. Mary was especially nervous in her performance and I don't think that's because it was her first talking film. The problem is that she's playing completely against type. The sweet, lovable, smart and spunky little girl persona that she had perfected is gone and in it's place is the consummate man - controlling flapper. Sorry Mary, it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this had Mary Pickford in it!","review":"If you want to know why Mary Pickford was one of the best actresses of all time...don't judge her work on this movie.

But then in a way I'm not because I found the best one right off the bat. I did have a 22S before my 32SII, and was very happy with it, but when it came time to replace it with this one I soon found that I had made an excellent choice. And now when I'm looking for a new one (just to see what's on the market, mind you) I see that HP still hasn't topped this calculator, judging from the reviews on the new ones. I'll never sell this baby; it'll stay right by my monitor at work, ready to quickly and effortlessly run numbers for me. I particularly like the keys, which are solid and have a good feel to them. This is a quality calculator."},{"rating":"2","title":"a model of product design","review":"I have used the 32SII for a few years now. I agree with the other reviewers about RPN.This calculator is not only the finest calculator ever, from the standpoint of power and value, but I think it ranks near the top of the finest product designs ever, for any product. There is nothing about it that can be improved. The form factor is just right. All functions are where they belong. Every key clicks the same, and clicks right. Batteries last forever. This product should be in a museum of outstanding product design.Having said that, I will editorialize a bit. I am severely disappointed that HP discontinued this product. I think it speaks volumes that the new HP cannot recognize its own product excellence, and apparently fails to value the things that brought it customer loyalty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best calculator HP ever made","review":"Functional, well-designed and well-documented, with a great keyboard and exactly the functions one needs on a basic scientific calculator, the HP32SII is the best calculator HP ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old calculator.","review":"Well, I got a HP-33S wich is HP-32SII sucessor for just U$49,99.

Things I don't like in 33S include the very limited complex algebra which comes from 32SII! There are no matrix algebra as well! I know some people love this calculator, like 15C, but there are better new ones. One I don't say the same is the also old 42S. There are people buing it for $299.

It has all kinds of functions (including complex number analysis, integration and fractions calcalutions) and allows you to enter programs. The only drawback that I could think of is that the memory size is too small. AFter entering a moderate size program, there would be no room to enter more programs. Also, as you know too well, the HP-calculator's RPN entering logics may scare you.

Why do I give this book a 5 stare rating ? First of all: The fact that Carey actually created more space in my mind was both surprising and enlightening: The way he describes peoples thoughts, feelings and actions comes very close to the way I think about them. Only, I would never have the skill to put these thoughts in words as precisely as Carey does. They always just lingered in the back of my mind. Reading them, was simply illuminating, like little explosions inside of your head. Secondly, the story itself was great. The madly religious Oscar, unable to accept and communicate his feelings, tumbles into a project he actually resents of and in the end, all of this leads him to his greatest fear. This, combined with the constantly searching wild Lucinda, produces a colorfull story, that's bursting with emotions.

Because of them, the plot isn't so corny and repetetive.The action takes place in rural Australia and our heros are in their 60's - the latter should be a clear message to those, who look for fresh bodies and some bare skin action.I am pretty sure that for some this film isn't so amusing, but I enjoyed it very much. The way it presents intolerance against homosexuality, typical for small comunities and older generations is true to form, thus funny at some moments, sad at other.In general it's a well made movie, with good acting and direction.

It works great. It's small, and out of the way. It handles the 12 volts from the truck just fine. Of course, mercury being a liquid, is subject to the effects of vibration, inertia and orientation. So if used on a vehicle, acceleration, braking, cornering, bumps (especcially bumps) and slanted terrain may cause the switch to activate or deactivate or change switch threshold. Of course this all depends on what you are using it for, where you place it and how close to the threshhold angle you set it at. This is true of any mercury switch.As for mounting (inside), I planned on using epoxy to hold it in place, but honestly, I don't see a need.

While he is passionate and emotional, he also brings intelligence and precision to the musical table. He has made his mark as a musician's musician, picking only those works to record which he feels are of the utmost importance to the repertoire. I love the fact that Goode is able to give us something this vital and heartfelt and yet never lose his head with raw emotion that is unshaped. This is my most treasured collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES!!!","review":"I really wanted to just give this one-star, but what the heck, it's Christmas! I just finished listening (again) to Gieseking's magical early Beethoven sonatas (please see my review). This is the antithesis. The reason I'm going to cut Goode some slack (an apt term given his lackluster to the extreme playing) is that the recorded sound - maybe it's the piano itself - is so abysmal, and therefore the performance, maybe, isn't totally at fault. Who knows? Now to be fair, in this entire set there are some good renditions, and some excellent individual movements. But to get to them requires slogging through some of the most uninspired Beethoven playing ever set to vinyl-er metal.

But if he is \\"correct\\" in how he plays Beethoven -- especially the middle sonatas -- then Richter, Horowitz, Schnabel, Serkin, Ashkenazy, and even Brendel are wrong.

There is little spaciousness to the recording quality, and no atmosphere.Beethoven can be SO exciting -- but you'd never know it from these recordings.Pedestrian is the right word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"I tried to like this set- I really did. This was my first set of Beethoven's complete sonata's - it got great reviews and I was excited to get it but try as I might I had trouble enjoying it. Where was the passion, the dynamism, the creativity I associated with Beethoven? It was work getting through it - the music seemed dull, lacking in profundity and spontaneity. There was a kind of elegaic beauty to it to be sure but Goode seemed to me to be connecting with this music as from a great distance, as if it was a story he was telling about long, long ago.Then I picked up the Gulda set and there it was; the power, the dyanmism, the felicity, poetry and spontaneity of Beethoven. I tried Goode again, I thought maybe I had missed something but no, while it was pretty and elegant, the magic of Beethoven was gone again. For me this was homogenized Beethoven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile...","review":"...truly vile.I've had this set for over five years.

Having forked out for it, after reading some 'reviews' (ha ha) from supposedly authoratative sources, I tried so hard to like it...but I just can't. There's just nothing here except the notes. The recorded sound is suffocatingly close, the piano tones hard and ungiving. Was the set recorded in a telephone booth by any chance?I guess the best performances are the ones of the late sonatas. The wonderful op.90 sonata in E minor is ok as is the tremendous 'Hammerklavier', op.106, even if the opening movement is under-powered.

Really? What of Francis Bacon, to whom Hobbes once acted as amanuensis? Poor Bacon does get a brief, grudging mention later on. The description in the blurb of Hobbes as \\"the first great English political philosopher\\" is probably more accurate. Certainly he is important, in a broad Western context. He was central to the transition from medieval to modern thought, and was a strong influence on Rousseau and others. Tuck is an expert guide (despite his inexplicable slighting of Bacon) and his style is very readable. This introduction covers Hobbes's life, works and intellectual legacy.

It discusses Wang Shuo's novella ANIMAL VICIOUS and Jian Wen's film adaption at the same time. Of course, it is OK. However, the writer seems to be so confused herself that she keeps turning to the film version when she is supposed to discuss the original novella. It is OK too. But in the bibliography of the book, there is only the entry for the novella, but none for the movie. In other words, the author seems to imply (and it seems that she believes so) that the film and the novella are the same text. The conflation of the film and the novella is a symptom of the scholar's absent-mindedness. It is not professional.

Capital and Interest is a detailed study, so reading it is a lengthy process. However, there are no short routes to learning about competition theories of interest.This book is itself an important part of history. Here we can read one of the earliest and most effective critiques of Marxian economics. Unfortunately, this book is a \`historical' representation of professional opinion.

The great cast could not help the film which was quite flat in comparison to films like Pride and Prejudice. I love period films and am always looking for new period films to watch. This one was a great disappointment. I would have liked to have been warned about the nude scenes which were quite explicit. This is not what one expects from a traditional period film. The acting was not that great.

Everbody KNOWS that Parisian waiters can be rude. Just be rude back!I can't help feeling that Alexander F. Lobrano (Heidi Ellison in the first edition) have just dug around to exaggerate the things they don't like, and played down (or even omitted) the good things. For example, in a section marked 'Secret Gardens', how can Parc Andre Citroen be considered secret and Jardins Albert Kahn completely missed? It makes a mockery of claiming to be a true guide.

This is made for English learners","review":"I purchased this book since I have a fairly decent comprehension of basic Japanese but needed to expand my vocabulary.If you are learning Japanese you need to know that the book is designed for English learners. This means that the Japanese word is given in Kanji without the furigana readings. Basically, you are expected to be able to read Japanese.This book is, however, a great learning tool, in spite of this. The pictures are clear, and the phrases/words are very relevant and split up into sections. For example:Under \\"job safety\\" there are things like ear muffs, hard hats, etc.Under \\"plants\\" there are things like magnolia, birchwood, etc.overall, this book is great for the learner of Japanese so long as you have a kanji dictionary handy and have a decent grasp of basic written Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ESL learner who are native Japanese speakers","review":"I really like this book.

He is doing over 60 hours of ESL in that time and needs to maximize results, so this OPD version is great!

Check this one out for a great collection of short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes it makes me wonder...","review":"The concept of this book really interests me. Contemporary authors share their favorite stories with us, as if they were taking a frind by the hand and saying, \\"You've GOT to read this!\\"Each author introduces that book and explains why he or she enjoys the story so much. Some of the explanations are really excellnt, suchas the introduction to Jamaica Kincaid's \\"Girl.\\" Others, however, leave the reader ill-prepared for what he or she is about to read. The introduction to \\"The Star Cafe\\" left me quite shocked and slightly annoyed when I actually read the story. On the whole, however, it is definitely a worthwhile book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't really have to read this.","review":"A collection of short stories that have been selected and are introduced by different writers. It contains a wide range of authors and very diverse stories, varying from what I would regard as quite charming to obscure.

This trait helps a young girl deal with her feelings of guilt about her grandfather's alzheimer's disease. As children often do, she thinks he doesn't want to remember her because of something terrible she did or said. There is a powerful message for parents to realize the possibility of this reaction in children. Talking about it helps.The child's tendency to live in the present and her grandfather's life without memories from the past, ends the book with a hopeful note as the two relate to each other on a new level.An added benefit is that the book has English and Spanish on each page. It also has a glossary to help readers of both languages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewel of wisdom.","review":"Like Sainte-Exupery's \\"Little Prince\\" or Coelho's \\"Alchemist\\", this book is filled to the brim with hidden truths and insight into the human soul: How the innocence of children allows them to see what others cannot.. how fear and superstition can make monsters of us all... and the triumph of spirit over ignorance.This is a must-read for any student of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fable in excellent form","review":"Like any fable, _The Woman Who Lives In the Earth_ uses symbolism and fantasy to express reality, pitting evil and good in a package that wraps up neatly at the end. Swain Wolfe uses the genre expertly, showing not only the dichotomy of black and white, but a few shades of grey as well. The story is simply and gracefully told, with a few turns of language that sent me back to reread just for the pleasure of experiencing them again. Wolfe's background in cultural anthropology shows in the details, and his understanding of human nature--adult, child, familial--in every line. As a study of fear, prejudice, and influence, _The Woman Who Lives in The Earth_ is an excellent example of the literary fable. Recommended, highly, especially if you are a fan of Richard Bach, Walter Wangerin, or Richard Adams."},{"rating":"2","title":"short, enjoyable and refreshing","review":"A very fun short read that to me was constantly in the feel of a Hayao Miyazaki film or a light hearted mixture of The Road and Siddhartha. All 171 pages are uplifting and enjoyable but on at a few times can almost seem too juvenile for the concept that it's wishing to convey.The story revolves around a young girl who is put under blame for a town's drought stricken landscape. The child finds herself able to transform her spirit into animals and plants and can even heal hurt beings. The terrified townsfolk see her as a threat that must be killed in order to end the drought and a note on human fear and misunderstanding takes place as well as finding your place in the natural world. It's a lot deeper and better than that it's just hard to describe.There are several great quotes throughout the book that I wrote down to remember laterand several of the characters are refreshingly original.The overall pace and style is very catchy and it's very hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very eye-opening!!","review":"This book really makes you take a look at how you are contributing to the problems in your relationship, I found myself saying \\"wow, i do that\\"....A LOT. For me, and i would guess most people when they are having relationship problems get to a point where they think they have done everything they can to fix it....when really we do just the opposite.

Some chapters are heavy with data, others are more reflective in nature. Rather than teaching how to counsel, the book's intent is to equip those who counsel with information to better enable them to deal with religious issues in the counseling context. Worthington et al tackle such issues as religious values in secular theories of psychology, boundary areas of religious clients' values, and the use of forgiveness in the clinical setting. Particularly noteworthy is the final chapter, \\"Psychology and the Christian Faith: 20th and 21st Century,\\" which grapples with material and philosophical trends and how those factors play out in terms of the world view of those we counsel."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what u pay for","review":"i made a real mistake and took about 5 shoots after the first 1 because i wanted to post picture of what a mid power air rifle at over 20 did to the little target. i can tell u that this trap will not hold up to its own rated cal to use to give an example a beeman p17 pistol shoots a .177 pellet at 400fps give or take even these left a dent that removed paint on the outside of the housing any way only reason i give it 2 stars is because it looks nice and if you use it at over 30 yard with very low power rifle IT MIGHT STAND UP TO IT. for me it was no good the smallest thing i have is my p17 which is a target pistol since im not a pro marksman i don't think i can use a 10 yard gun at 30 with any accuracy everything else i have will probably damage this thing to much with one tin of pellet to use it again just spend a little more money and get something more solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Do not waste your time this is a cheap flimsy item Use an old box your better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend an extra 5 to 10 bucks to get a better one.","review":"Do not get this trap it's really not even that good.

Lots of shouting and racing around and I am sorry that I watched the early acting of John Thaw. I so enjoyed Morse and it is obvious how much his acting skills improved. Really disappointed with \\"The Sweeney\\" and would not recommend it as it is too dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too out of date for me","review":"I have to agree with the other viewer who found this too 70's to be of much interest now.

Didn't you notice the way Luc looked at John while he was supposedly screwing Torrie? And the scene in the swimming pool, kissing the tears. Come on, DeCocteau is obviously heading for the gay audience; even though there are not homosexual scenes, the inferences are there.And the long drawn out rape scene is so stupid, the music is something out of the eighties and nineties, and there is not one genuine thrill in the whole movie.And the ending....these kids have no remorse over the people that have died due to their own selfish motives.Yuck, what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo - hiss","review":"Not much more to say about this movie than has already been said in other reviews.

As it turns out, the rolls (at $18.69 for 44 bags' worth - assuming a foot per use) are slightly more expensive than the bags (at $18 for 48), so you might as well get the bags. As for being able to use more or less as needed, I've found that I can re-seal or re-use the bags, thus leaving me an assortment of available sizes when I've used their previous contents. It is occasionally useful to have larger sizes, so I would recommend purchasing the bags in the quart size & the rolls in the larger 11\\" x 18' to give a wide range of useful applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - Questionable Quality","review":"Two minor specs that these suppliers \\"forgot\\" to list: (1.)

The older I get, and the more Prince continues to put out nominal work, the more I realize and appreciate the musical talents of Wendy and Lisa. They are highly gifted musicians/arrangers, and though we may never know how much they wrote or didn't write (thanks to Prince's legal contracts) for the Revolution we can still get a taste of it here. Giving a nod to the Beethoven symphony of the same name, Eroica demonstrates all the things that made prince music so cool for me up until 1988. So do yourself a favor and buy this album today.

When I heard that it was being made into a film, I was rather surprised but very curious to see how it would work. Unfortunately, the results are just fair. The cast (some of them surprising choices) acquit themselves quite well here and I have no quibbles with that. However some of the other choices are more unfortunate: the move to NY from SF, the Disneyfied core issues of Jess and Gabriel's relationship, and the extremely visible Toni Collette. Her performance (as is usual) is excellent, but her physical presence is too much there from the beginning and distracts from the mystery at the core of the story.

The movie is really about 2 things. The title character's being fooled by a woman (and it takes him years to figure it out) and his breakup with his boyfriend. There is no substance beyond that. There are no thrills. It is self-indulgent and tedious. It is an insult to the Hitchcock's memory to classify this film as similar to anything he ever did. His worst film (and he made some stinkers) is ten times better than this clinker. The only reason I kept watching was in the fond hope that somehow there would be a surprise or a revelation that wasn't self-evident to anyone with even a few functioning brain cells.Please, Mr. Williams, stick to comedy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy Time","review":"An unsatisfying film version of Armistad Maupin's equally unsatisfying roman a clef, THE NIGHT LISTENER is carefully made, but doesn't add up to much. Like fellow comic Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams in dramatic roles manages to damp down the brilliance of his gift without coming up with a satisfactory replacement for that rapid-fire wit. He works hard here, but it's a safe bet many other actors would have been more successful in this role. On the other hand, the always-impressive Toni Collette adds another indelible portrait to her gallery of screen women; eerie and frightening, she's like some creature hauled, gasping and blinking, from a subterranean lake. An excellent supporting cast and handsome cinematography can't help much, either. This material's simply too inconclusive for its own good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I mostly liked this one...it kept me guessing until the end","review":"It was a bit confusing though, more of a mystery than a thriller (be sure to watch the deleted scene in the bonus section of the dvd - it clears a few things up.). Toni Collette's performance was incredible - I was both intrigued and terrified of her. I was also terrified of her house and the water tower. Seeing Robin Williams in a non-comic role is always a bit disquieting...such as his role inOne Hour Photo (Widescreen Edition). Sandra Oh seemed underused, but I liked the few lines she did have, such as the Southern drawl impersonation. Also, the sad, haunting music fit very well throughout the movie.Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy is quite an intriguing disorder - but that is all I will say about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast","review":"Robin Williams is horribly miscast in this film, and there are a number of actors who could have done the role and the film a lot of good. All of his strengths are under wraps, his weaknesses as an actor (he's just grim in serious drama, which is boring) up front. The big subtext in the story is not dealt with in either his performance or the film (is his fascination with a young teenager sexual?), leaving you with the impression it is (you get the feeling the producers felt no one would associate Williams with pedophilia so they just ignored it). This has to be the last thing they intended. There will hopefully be a drama that uses Williams in a way that releases his comic energies some day. The rest of the cast - particularly Toni Collette - is wonderful but mostly underused. This is a prime example of A List miscasting, almost up there with Whoopi Goldberg in \\"Fatal Beauty\\". It could have been interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertising for this movie is nothing more than bait and switch..","review":"The movies trailers make this look like a good movie, full of suspense and thrills. NOT! The only good thing about this movie are the actors, love Robin, love Sandra and the others but the bad thing is the script they gave them.

THE NIGHT LISTENER is a psychological thriller based on the international bestselling novel by Armistead Maupin. The story revolves around a celebrated writer and popular late-night radio show host, Gabriel Noone (Robin Williams), who develops an intense phone relationship with a young listener named Pete (Rory Culkin) and his adopted mother (Toni Collette) just as his own domestic life is undergoing drastic changes. When troubling questions arise regarding the boy's identity, it causes Gabriel's ordered existence to spin wildly out of control as he sets out on a harrowing journey to find the truth.This was an interesting movie. Almost like a heart warming film at first, only to become a much darker film. I wish the film went at a faster pace. But I am a fan of Maupin (the writer) from his Tales of the City.

When Gabriel arrives in Wisconsin he discovers Donna gave him a false address. Most people would have returned to the Big Apple right there, but Gabriel goes to extraordinary lengths to confirm Pete's exsistance.There is not enough at stake here for the search to seem plausaible, and you wonder why a sophisticated New York writer would waste his time on such an obvious hoax.

Later he sets off to find him and his female caretaker after convincing himself the boy really doesn't exist. This movie is supposed to be based on truth, but I couldn't believe any stable adult would do what he did. The film focused too much on the main character being homosexual. The phone friendship between the boy child and the adult male seemed inappropriate from the onset. Their conversations included cursing and light sexual content. There were a few creepy moments, but certainly not enough to call this a thriller. It ended rather abruptly and loosely.

Unlike the band's last two records, it didn't spawn any Top Ten hits, and it didn't even crack the Top 20. However disappointing the sales were, the loss is ultimately the public's, for this is an overall solid release. There's the catchy, if simplistic, \\"War Song\\" (George hated this song in particular), the smoothed-out ballad \\"Mistake No. 3\\" (which, coincidentally, was the group's third flop single), and \\"The War Song,\\" which is classic Culture Club with its melange of pop and lightweight reggae. I'm guessing that this record underperformed because it was released too soon after the huge success of 1983's \\"Colour by Numbers.\\" But, still, it's a good release that's worthy of a second chance--even if Boy George himself doesn't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic and Fun Mix of Songs","review":"This CD is a must-have for any true Boy George/Culture Club fan. Although this album was not commercially successful, it's a solid release with a true sound of the 80's. What I find most amazing about this release is George's vocals; powerful and at their most soulful. I really enjoy each track on this collection, but my favorites are \\"the Dive\\" and \\"Crime Time\\". As with most of George's lyrics, there are underlying messages in each song, with the exception of \\"The War Song\\" with it's in-your-face, blunt statement that \\"War is Stupid and People are Stupid\\", which offended the overly sensitive when released in 1984.Overall, this is a great effort by CC that most people overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waking Up With The House On Fire","review":"This record sounded somewhat rushed when it was first released in 1984, but time and change have been kind to this music and it actually has an emotional maturity and relaxed vibe to it now that I couldn't appreciate years ago. \\"Mannequin\\" is still a great tune and \\"The War Song\\" sounds more socially relevant TODAY than ever before, but the lovely ballad \\"Mistake No. 3\\" is still the best song here (I remember my Mom letting me stay up past midnight to catch the world premiere of the clip for it on \\"Friday Night Videos\\" when I was 14!) and it takes on a new poignance now as a man who's made his fair share of mistakes. Boy George and Co. were one of the most popular bands in history at the time of this LP's release and apparently also on the verge of imploding as a musical unit, but for the time this LP satisfied the hunger of their rabid fans and gave them a few more chart hits.

Mine does not have any of the issues the previous reviewer identified. I have a Nano 2G - the case fits it snugly and locks around it. There are a few odd design choices to be aware of, however. First, as previously noted, the Ipod hangs right-side up (in other words, looking down at it hanging around your neck, it is up-side down, and therefore slightly less convenient to fiddle with). There is a rigid belt \\"loop\\" on the back, not a clip, so if you want to put the case on your belt, you'll have to actually thread your belt through it. Finally, the lanyard snaps together behind your neck like a necklace. The connection is snug, but it seems kind of pointless. Nevertheless, this is a great product for $4 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does as promised...","review":"This little gem of a case does fit the new Nano nicely. The lanyard is handy and the clip on the back unobtrusive and works as long as what you're clipping to isn't too wide. My only concern is the side latches seem a little loose to me, so I wonder how well they will hold and how long it will take till my Nano falls out if I use the lanyard. I might use a small bit of tape or other adhesive on the sides for more security. It might have been nice to have the lanyard connection from the bottom so when you were wearing it you could just tilt it up rather than having to twist it around to read the screen.

It's a compliation of previous released material, but it's been remastered and it's an official release. The album consists of 4 masterpieces from Glass's early years. It's fabulous stuff. Another reviewer said it really grows on you, and it does. It's beautiful, hypnotic, and magnficent. And most of it is played by Glass himself on organ. I have an attraction to piano and organ music for some reason, and I just revel in this kind of stuff. I have around 20 Glass CD's (no albums), and I love almost everyone of them.

There is a lot more to the South which merits praise and appreciation, but the dark side is displayed here.The main character, Earl Swagger, is a pathetic hero struggling to figure himself out before his inner gremlins get the best of him.Gun people appreciate the detail in the shoot outs, but the best stuff is the psychological profile he introduces to the reader with efficient detail and appeal.A good yarn spinner... I need more sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth in Fiction","review":"\\"Hot Springs\\" is loosely based on a real series of events and the novel is populated with a mix of real, real-but-disguised, and fictional people. The crackdown on gambling and other crimes in Hot Springs the late 40's really did happen and has left echoes that resonate to this day. While the violence in the book goes beyond what really happened the \\"sense of place\\" and point-in-time is well executed. For a person born in Hot Springs like myself it all felt eerily real. But I also would give it a broad recommendation to all readers attracted to the \\"semi-true crime\\" genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"This is my first Stephen Hunter book.

So why change a winning \\"team\\"?This time it's Earl Swagger and the story is based in 1946. Funny as it seems this time it's Earl who (also) has to deal with his father's fate - but this is not the main subject of the book.Luckily Hunter did not copy the plot of his earlier books but created a completely different kind of mood and storyline. \\"Hot Springs\\" is not as complex as \\"Point of Impact\\" or \\"Time to Hunt\\" but straightforward, fast paced action with surprising twists and angles. This book sure is well worth reading.Anybody who is not acquainted to Stephen Hunter books so far should read this one (and \\"Pale Horse Coming\\") before he starts reading the other Swagger books since this book is a prequel to the life of Bob Lee Swagger and explains why he became the man he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUNTER HAS ME!!!!!","review":"The last Hunter book I started I quit after about 100 pages, that was Time to Hunt. I was soooooooo bad. Then I get Hot Springs and it is very gooooood. I wish he would be all good or all bad, but I gues that is asking to much. I hate paying for some of them and then finding out I don't like them. Hot Springs is about Earl Swagger and his crew trying to clean up Hot Springs, Ark. The book has a lot of action and is very fast moving. Swagger is so very tough. He shows it in the houses they crash into and at the very end. He can handle all kinds of weapons and is very good at leading men. If you like a book with a lot of feeling about the life and times of the main character you will like this book. Hope the next one I buy is this good. I guess Hunter has me because I have to buy the book to see if it is good, if it is or not he still comes out ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Action, quite entertaining.","review":"Hunter goes further back in time for a prequal to the Swagger series, and he does a pretty good job. This book is full of all the violence, action and suspense of the previous books. Much of the suspense (like the truth about earl's father) is anti climactic because it has no bearing on the future books in the series.I won't say Hunter did a great job of portraying 1940's hot springs, but for me it is interesting to read about a town in Arkansas that sounds just like the Las Vegas of today. I thought the inclusion of real-life characters added to the story as well.If you are a Hunter fan, definitely read this. Other wise, try point of impact or Black light first. I think they are better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by the Positive Reviews","review":"While Hot Springs isn't an awful book, it is a book with atrocious dialog, a predictable plot, and only a handful of interesting characters. In over 500 pages, I didn't find a surprise or a moment that captured my attention. Earl's nobility irritated, the stereotypical mobsters and molls were mere window-dressing, and the backwoods hicks were ridiculous caricatures.I will try others by the author as my wife swears that this is the worst of his books, and I generally trust her taste. For me, though, this was a disappointment. I can forgive a story that lacks originality if the writing is compelling; this isn't that book. Before I give Mr. Hunter another go, though, I'm going to retreat to my world of Paul Theroux, Sean Stewart, and Victor Davis Hanson."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much plot or characters","review":"Although I enjoyed the \\"Bob the Nailers\\" books, this story of Bob's dad Earl was fairly flat and did not develope other characters well.

Instead he should start a new character or maybe have Bob's daughter go to Dessert Storm if he has to keep it in the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have been a good comic book","review":"Let's be honest: S. Hunter may be a proficient professional writer with a commercial following, but this book is... The mob characters are all paper-thin cliche figures.

Several days after viewing the DVD, the assasination of SS Chief of Security Reinhard Heydrich was shown on our local PBS station.

This meeting, held over dinner and drinks, discussed possibilities of a fantastic world, free of the jewish influence on the economy and society. The SS leaders, among others in German officer did their best to figure out the most efficient way to end the hardships of Europe and America by getting straight to the problem, and not worrying about what is politically correct. They tried many options, such as sterilization, exportation, etc. However, they came to realize that the best answer to the jewish question would be evacuation. The rest is history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction But Fun","review":"HBO has been putting out some very good movies over the past few years. Conspiracy is a brilliant film with some great performances. This is a good rental. If you are really into fictional films with a little fact then this movie is for you. If you really want to know what happened at Wansee then buy a book. Only a few books have been written on this subject, but they are much better at conveying the truth. However, this is still a good movie. The special features on the DVD are not very special (only a couple short featurettes).

Who really cares if it's not historically factual? This movie is truly fantastic above everything else, and the dialogue in this film is spectacular.

If I recall correctly, not only was the dialogue fashioned as accurately as possible, the movie was timed to reflect the actual duration of the conference. And I believe this was somewhat shorter than was depicted in Conspiracy. The producers of Conspiracy, of course, because there are always financial considerations involved, had to make the movie more appealing to a wider audience, and so had to jazz things up to a certain extent. Regardless of the compromises made, the movie still is a chilling account of the planning behind the Final Solution, and is very much worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nazi mind","review":"This movie give some insight into the darkness that was the Nazi's solution to the \\"Jewish Problem\\"It's interesting to see that \\"Kenneth Branagh\\" has the same demeanor in this movie as he does in Harry Potter.

The discussion associated with the destruction of the Jewish population early in WWII and who is to be eliminated is shocking. The cold almost anticeptic way of planning the demise of a part of society shows how far from humanity the German view of the world was. Based upon discovered notes, the reality of the discussion can hardly be disputed.

The one problem is that you cannot use your own bags, so you have to keep re-ordering your vacuum sealer bags from Tilia. These bags are quite expensive, (and are patented by Tilia Foodsaver), and this vacuum sealer only works with them due to diamond shaped plastic featured on one side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eneryone would buy one,if.","review":"I would love to purchase this item,along with countless other people.It is just beyond the budgets of the very same people that it could help.A reminder to Tilia....The more people that can afford this product,the more would purchase.Sacrafice a litle profit and it will come back 10 fold in long term sales and profit.

The service dealer said that this is a normal problem for the Professional II. We paid $289.93 for the unit.That aside, the unit worked well to seal Alaskan wild game and fish.

I sent it back to the factory asking for a refund and they refused and sent me a refurbished one in return - they will not refund your money on the poor quality items they sell. Just be careful and do not let this happen to you - Tilia looks much better on TV than it performs in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recurrent Problem","review":"I'm amazed so many people find no problem with this product -- for me it has been nothing but trouble. When it works, it works well; unfortunately, it mostly doesn't work. The common failing is that after producing a vacuum, the heat sealer fails to activate. I have sent the product back on two occasions because of this and received back a repaired product on the first occasion and what I presume was a new replacement the second time. On each occasion the device worked for a period of time and then re-developed the same problem. I think I'll try an alternative brand this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Tilia and the Foodsaver Professional II","review":"I recently purchased the Tilia Foodsaver Professional II, and when it arrived I discovered that this model won't work properly above 5500 feet without a factory adjustment by Tilia. When I called Tilia they informed me that I would need to pay to ship the foodsaver to their factory, and I should expect that the adjustment would take six to eight weeks. This is extremely poor customer service following the purchase of high priced electronics. If you ever need repairs on a Foodsaver you will be without your unit for nearly two months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great at home","review":"I bought these for home DJing.

The previous album had about 3 very solid singles, and maybe 3 others that were worth listening to regularly... (IMHO) This one is more balanced all the way through.

There are many references to \\"ration points\\" and then-current entertainers.

Everything else from the movie was good, although I think that since it is later since the first and second films, it lacked a lot of impact.

And what a cast: Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton are all superlative.

It's way less gruesome with less disturbing violence than Casino and many modern MA films are much more violent.The power plays, honour and business scheming between the Mafia families give the framework of the film with personal trial and tribulations providing more depth for the character development that echo throughout the genera ever since and make The Godfather repeatedly watchable.I wanted a copy for a present and after spending months looking for a copy in the retail shops without success, I found this widescreen version at a great price on Amazon within seconds and, I ended up keeping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The single best movie of the '70s!","review":"There were too many to choose from.

When I saw these being referred to, I did know they were from the Godfather, but now, seeing the source material makes me appreciate them all the more, and I can see why this movie was such a hit back in the day.Marlon Brando made an excellent Vito Corleone, and the character is also respectable because he does not merely go on bloody rampages, he is calm and logical, willing to discuss things first and solve a problem peacefully before he has to resort to violence.

The picture is grainy, the colors faded, it's just too painful to watch. One of the great American films has been given abysmal treatment in a blu-ray version. It is no better than the DVD version. The same opinion holds true for Godfather II. I didn't bother with Godfather III which I consider a poor film to begin with. Compare this film with the 1966 film The Professionals, with Lee Marvin.

Now this movie is over 30 years old, and is 10 times better than any movie of this day, Hollywood has gotten bad, this movie is older than I am, but does not show it's age.The acting is brilliant from Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall, the rest are great too.The story is excellent, you'd have to watch it to understand it.If you check this out, and like it, check out The Godfather Part 2, forget Part 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was some what disapointed....","review":"...with the movie.

It's definitely a classic movie. I'm not a big fan of the film b/c it's kinda depressing, but the movie is without a doubt a legend. It's got great acting, drama, action, and suspense. There is also definitely lots of violence too. The movie is mostly slow moving with some heated exchanges; so there is a good mix of action and downtime. I think it's a film that most will enjoy. There may be some of you that find the length and subject matter a bit depressing.

Far from the falsely annointed greatness of some other mob pics I won't mention, The Godfather deserves it's praise.

The story is told in non-linear fashion, drifting from past moment to past moment, framed by the present at Isobel's death bed, while maintaining the central story of Isobel and Katherine's friendship. The attitudes and conflicts of the period are present in the characters actions and dialogue, whithout ever being forced or heavy handed--in that way, Stonich put us in the period with authentic characters.

If you have seen the movie Altered States, that is a float tank. It is an isolation tank where you float in a body temperature saline solution to remove as much stimulation as possible. This book details the research done (up to about 1983) on float tanks, and its health benefits. The book is essentially a commercial for float tanks. The primary benefit is related to the fact that float tanks make it much easier to reach states of consciousness normally reserved for experienced meditators - lower stress, more creativity, general well-being, pain reduction, improved learning (this one I am sceptical, because there is a large body of evidence that recall is tied to the state of consciousness you are in, so learning in the theta brainwave state doesn't translate to the beta state effectively), recreational hallucinations, peak mystical experiences, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food Saver 550 is a great product","review":"Ok, I read both the positive and negative reviews for the food saver and decided to get one.

Used it right out of the box without reading the directions. Very functional, even sealed one of those bags of loose lettuce without difficulty. If you dont use the Foodsaver bags, air is still removed, just not very efficiently, and the pump will often just continue to run without starting the seal process. You can correct this just by pulling the bag out of the vac chamber, then the machine will go ahead and seal the bag. If you try to seal an item that has some liquid component (we did lasagna the other day), some of the juices will get sucked into the machine...but dont worry, they collect in the chamber and are easily cleaned out.

This, along with the other outtakes: The Admirable Life of St. Joseph; the Life of our Blessed Lady and The Divine Mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary, are so wonderful to have, especially with the high cost of the complete set. Also, there are very special blessings from the Holy See on those that read these books.

If only I had listened to this CD! This performance puts the music in the context of Russian folksongs (which Stravinsky used extensively, although he refused to admit it), and the singers sing the music in a full-throated, \\"folky\\" way miles removed from the classical style usually found in performances of this work. The mix is more like a pop song than a classical record, making the voices even more immediate and intense. Only two complaints: the dynamic range of the recording is small, and there is no Russian text in the notes, so it's hard to follow while you listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An authentic Les Noces","review":"For those not familiar with the work, it is subtitled \\"Scenes of Pagan Russia\\" and is Stravinsky's portrait of several tableaus from a traditional Russian pagan wedding. I found this recordng years ago after performing the work with a mid-sized university choir. While our performance was correct, this one captures the \\"pagan\\" sound which, in retrospect, seems every bit as important as the notes and rhythms. Here we find an energetic, gutsy vocal sound which now seems inseperable from the musical structure. While originally orchestrated for four pianos and percussion, this recording is sequenced using computers, and it seems to work reasonably well (i.e. it doesn't come off sounding mechanical, but the tone is not that of real instruments). There is plenty else on this recording that is not Stravinsky but is equally exciting, all on the theme of Russian wedding music. This is the best recording of Les Noces that I have come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful peformance of Les Noces","review":"One of the most powerful versions of this piece I know.

With two SanDisk 64MB cards in the camera we have enough memory to hold the images of a Portrait session before transferring them into Photoshop for processing. At 8.65 Megabytes per image, two 64s don't provide very much space so we take a laptop with us in the field for transfer.

It is the best PSP game I have, and I have at least 10, and have played many more. The controls are AWESOME, the storyline and characters are CLASSIC, and overall it feels like you're playing a classic Western film as Clint Eastwood or John Wayne. The details get pretty gorey, though, with brain splatter, blood squirting, and dismemberment, so it's not for the faint of heart. The one thing that could be better is the length of the game. It's definately not short, but if you added several more hours worth of story and a dozen more bounty missions or so, then it would be PERFECT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better on the PS Vita!","review":"Ok so i bought this for my PS Vita(Transferred from my PS3 because it's not on the Vitas PSN) and the controls are excellent with the second analog stick.

And that's saying something, because I usually hate to let a book go unread, no matter how bad. Overlooking all the typos and grammatical errors, the writing style was very elementary, with choppy dialog, no flow or sense of character. I agree with one reviewer in that all the other reviews that give Brejla more than one star seem to be family members. No way would someone not related to this guy give more than one star.

Its embarrassing from the Godfather of punk. Get Bowie out of your life IGGY! For Iggy at his best, try \\"Raw Power\\" Beat Em Up\\", \\"Fun House\\" or \\"Skull Ring\\".

Iggy of course created a revolutionary sound with the Stooges before flaming out in a vortex of drugs and madness. LUST FOR LIFE is volume two of the resurrection of iggy Pop under the tutalege of David Bowie and shows Iggy regaining his old strength.LUST FOR LIFE is packed with great songs from the barreling title track (I crack up every time I hear it on a cruise commercial, do they know what they are selling?) to the heroic melodrama of FALL IN LOVE WITH ME. Stellar tracks include SUCCESS (Iggy and company joking about the trappings of stardom), THE PASSENGER (maybe even better than the title track) and NEIGHBORHOOD THREAT. The music is closer in spirit to 70's Rolling Stones or Bowie's ALADIN SANE than the proto-punk of the Stooges.In my opinion this release is the highlight of Iggy's now long solo career. Though he would have a number of othe good songs over the years, he would never release an album as consistant as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun. Crazy. Perfect. Iggy","review":"Iggy Pop's Lust for Life came to my attention obviously with the title track. What a way to start an album. So far all the contact i've made with Iggy's music is through The Stooges who are excellent as well. Listening to this 70's classic has inspired me to hear more and more from good Iggy. I recommend this item to any person who enjoys a complete, different, irreverent, frantic album. Rock on, Iggy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine album indeed!","review":"After The Stooges albums and The Idiot, Iggy Pop sounds strangely commercialized on his classic Lust for Life album. David Bowie helped out by co-writing almost all of the songs. David also played piano and helped out with the recording and production of the album. It is indeed one of the most essential Iggy Pop albums, yet not his best. This album is filled with songs that are either rock oriented and ones that are more poppy. \\"The Passenger\\" is one of my favorite Iggy Pop songs. \\"Some Weird Sin\\" and \\"Neighborhood Threat\\" are two fine rock songs on here. Lust for Life is a monumental album and it's a great place to start if you're new to Iggy Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmingly simple and rustic.","review":"I originally bought this book for my Son back in 1997, and read it to him every night before he went to sleep.

There is a reason these selections were B-sides or rare. The song selections are poor and his covers of 70s classics, such as \\"He's My Brother,\\" are uninspiring and shrill; many songs find Williams singing at the top of his vocal range.

Joe tries to clear his name and follows the trail to a Mexican hideaway and a confrontation with Tim's gang of bad guys beautifully played by Jack Elam, Neville Brand and Lee Van Cleef.

Now it is totally useless.

This documentary answers the question and shows what happened when Air America was first set up -- lots of hope, lots of talent ... but not lots of lefty money, and so the whole gig almost went belly-up just a few days after it went on air. This is a very interesting documentary film, and it is enriched, of course, by the delightful antics of Jeanne Garofolo and Al Franken. Loved this documentary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And these people want to run the country?","review":"This is an extremely entertaining film documenting the inept and corrupt \\"minds\\" behind Err America.

I will miss listening to franken and his ilk go through their histrionics though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Documentary","review":"This HBO documentary about the early days of Air America Radio is a pretty amazing piece of work. It's a real edge of your seat film with plenty of twists and turns to keep your attention. It's a total roller coaster ride with internal meltdowns, allegations of fraud, very funny political on-air stuff and loads of drama. Even if you're not a fan of Al Franken, Randi Rhodes and Janeane Garofalo (which I am) you'll find this behind the scenes documentary really compelling. The stuff with Randi Rhodes in particular is awesome -- she's a total revelation in this film.

I know that probably seems like the most retarded statement ever written, but Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave make this movie magical. They are two very gifted actors, probably the understatement of the century, that have the ability to enthrall their audiences.

For me it was reminiscent of Nino Rota's work, very stirring and emotive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair & Balanced Look At Churchill","review":"How many movies do you see about Winston Churchill? Not enough, that's for sure, at least here in the U.S.Albert Finney plays the great British prime minister during the period before World War II and before he was in politics. Churchill was trying to warn his countrymen in the British Parliament of the dangers of Nazi Germany and most people weren't listening. (How ironic, with today's situation involving Islamic terrorists!)A big part of this film also details the romance between Churchill and his wife \\"Clementine\\" (Vanessa Redgrave). It's not some syrupy piece. It shows Churchill's warts, too, meaning his ego and temper.It's nicely filmed, a nice period piece and with just a handful of swear words. I was shocked, though, to hear one f-word, even if it was quoted from poetry. It seemed out of place in this TV film.This is a bit slow but a pleasant film I enjoyed and recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances","review":"I enjoyed The Gathering Storm for it's depiction of Winston Churchill the man. You're shown the leader in all his arrogance and vulnerableness. To see him in the comforts of his scenic countryside home with his loyal wife and household staff gives proof to the saying that behind every great man is a strong woman. This is as much Clementine Churchill's story as it is Winston's, though her role is downplayed. He being a renaissance man was a perfect match to her stoic stand-by-your man mentality. Without Clemmie I shudder to think that Winston Churchill could ever have found the courage to stand by his principals and lead England in it's darkest hour. Excellent movie! It could have been longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence in every way.","review":"From the acting to the costuming, to the script and editing, this is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"One positve came from this...","review":"I notice most people thought Holly Hunter was great in this film but she just annoyed me!

I didn't really care for any of it except one part and that was the cameo by Gavin Rossdale (Bush-lead singer) and that was it. That is the only reason I am keeping this DVD is because Bush was and still one of my favorite bands of all time! Watch if you want but warning it is not the best movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good, Girly Movie","review":"This is a perfect type of movie for days where you don't feel like getting off the couch or out of bed. It's a chick flick - but not the romantic kind. It's a feel good movie that I think women will enjoy and maybe even shed a tear at the end.It seemed at first as though the \\"moral of the story\\" was to say that snooping through other people's belongings is wrong and you'll get burned but that wasn't the story at all. In fact, it was completely the opposite.

With the coxing of her peers she decides to check into his past relationships and starts to nose around in his palm pilot for insight to his past relationships.

To 'top' it all off, not once did Holly wear a blouse or a tank that didn't bear her belly.

Along life's journey, Brittany's character travels with the perfect plan in mind, hoping to make her life-long dreams come to fruition. Through a tremendous amount of self-made troubles, tears, betrayal, secrets, love and hate, comes panic-stricken ordeals and, still, without giving up hope, her life pans out, and delivers.

And then when it seems like this movie is going to end the way all mediocre movies end, like they're unfinished, you get surprise after surprise. Everything's going to be okay.

Everything worked out, just not the way she had wanted them to work out. Stacey holt (Brittney Murphey) realized a life lesson that is shown completley in the movie and I completely diagree with others who said negative things about the movie, because it was a life lesson movie that told you that everything was gonna be ok, even when it diudn't seem like it.

Everything is bad about Little Black Book. I rented it at Blockbuster for my teenage daughter and even she hated it. I must admit that I did not/could not watch all of it but I did catch the incredibly heavy-handed finale.The script is beyond terrible: one painful cliche after another and Brittany Murphy is simply a no-talent.

The most powerfull film I have ever seen period. The influence of the pro-Israel lobby in this country is so pervasive that we are unable to have an open debate without having the debate seemered by equating any opposition to Israel human rights violations to 'anti-semitism'. The resulting unquestioning military support for Israel makes the US just as liable for Mr. Miller's death as the mercenary who pulled the trigger. It is easy for us to pretend that this is not happening, so god bless Mr. Miller for giving up his life to bring us all a glimpse of this story and hopefully we will all wake up and begin to look honestly at Israel's policies before we allow our immoral allengence to further deteriate US integrity and security."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to Read Aloud","review":"I read this book to my 7 year old twin girls, and the three of us loved it.

Other compositions demand to be heard, and so we have Gorecki's first and second string quartets. I hear them as profound explorations of the human interior and of external forces that consistently oppose it. This is particularly true in String Quartet 2, which begins with a pensive largo, passes through an ominous - if not terrifying - march and ends with ecstatic perseverance.The Kronos Quartet plays beautifully here, and with assurance, conviction and understanding.This is one of the most important end-of-the-century quartet recordings that I know of. One afternoon I listened to both quartets after Beethoven's String Quartet No. 13 and Bartok's String Quartet No. 3. It was a moving experience, and I can't help but think that I emerged from it a slightly better man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two winners","review":"First of all, I have been loving G��recki's music for many years. I was surprised and pleased when his Third Symphony became so popular.The two quartets are typical of G��recki's music, and occupy the more modern and stringent end of his output.The most telling characteristic of this composer's music has to do with flow. G��recki chooses not to let his music flow in certain ways where other composers do flow. In this, he is like Bruckner. Each musical idea is stated fully, with whatever flow it contains. But then there is a full stop, typically with silence.Next, another idea is presented. Or, the same musical material begins again.In the quartets, this aspect of G��rcki's music is less obvious than it is in the Third Symphony, for exampleHenryk Gorecki: Symphony No. 3, Opus 36. The actual musical material makes great use of repetition, and the effect is stirring.Kronos have featured Gorecki's music for a long time. They must love it, for they play it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Clear, loud tone with long sustain.

The only problem is that most people own TI calculators, so the teachers would explain how to do things (and texts would tell how to perform functions) using TI-84, and I had to figure it out on my own (or by using the jumbo instruction manual that came with it).

The main characters seemed unfocused and poorly drawn, having been overtaken by unnecessary secondary characters. The prose was rambling, with the author taking much too long to get into the meat of the story. A shame, with several shining torches like Diane Duane's \\"The Wounded Sky\\" having been published around the same time, that this snoozer should slip by the editors. It's should never have made it beyond self-published fanfic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Perhaps the best ST novel I've read!","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. It was a rather longer book than is typical, but since I was hooked on the story it was a bonus point. The author manages to create a believable feline race that is completely cat-like without seeming absurd. There was mystery, character development, action, and humor. I get very annoyed with authors who stray from the character traits that Gene Roddenberry created. I am pleased to report that all my beloved TOS characters behaved exactly like themselves. I rarely give five stars, but this one is worthy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Star Trek book.","review":"Society is cruel. There are people who just look at you and move away.

Their relatives are now dying and it will take all the effort the Enterprise has to save them. Uhura is the heroine in this novel.

I really enjoyed this book, Uhura is such a wonderful and strong character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Sue syndrome","review":"This could have been a very good Star Trek novel. The plot is engaging and the alien culture-building is excellent. Unfortunately its one flaw is a fatal one. The very annoying Dr Wilson ruins every scene she's in, and in the fashion of a Mary Sue she's in almost every scene. Cut out the author's pet character and give her part of the story to the others--especially Uhura, who is reduced to a supporting cast role in what is supposedly her story--and this would have been one of the best of the TOS novels, but as it is it is nigh unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Sue ruins it","review":"I always like a good \\"find the cure\\" thriller, and for the most part this book is not too bad. But unfortunately it is weighted down with the very definition of a Mary Sue character, the new doctor. She overpowers the rest of the book with her obnoxiousness and renders it very difficult to read, for me at least.The \\"cats are so wonderful\\" stuff is also fairly grating; I think this book was written purely for self-gratification, and as such is sort of immune to criticism, but unless you find characters who are Just the Best! And Everyone Likes Them So Much! interesting, and are a cat person, I suggest finding another Star Trek book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizingly Slow","review":"Very, very slow plot. Pages and pages of mindless interaction with talking cats. And this is a old Trek novel, so the print is 2/3's the size of the modern print...making it even longer.After suffering through the entire book, the ending is, well, eh.Pick up 'Doctors Orders' for a more interesting 'native population interaction' novel.

First they have to find the planet that may have the cure through ancient songs and legends. Then they make First Contact with the inhabitants and must get to know them and earn their trust. Finally they undertake a ritual Walk through deep forest to get the information they need. The writing in general is great and the descriptions are excellent. The core of the book is the character interaction and dialogue. That is fantastic, with great wit and humour and insight, by the characters and the author. This book reaches the level of what I consider to be the funniest scene in all of Trek, TV, movies and books, and it achieves it by wit - that and a wonderful mental image. The closest modern equivalent in style would probably be DeCandido's Diplomatic Implausibility. If you enjoyed that you may want to consider this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality - not 'getting' whatever flavor difference...","review":"I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.

Tony Leung is fine; Maggie Cheung is terrific, handling all this upset with dignity and grace.This took place in '62, so maybe traditions were different then; the claustrophobic setting added angst.

I didn't understand what they were talking about until my mother explained it to me. Overall, this movie was long, boring, and repetitive and I've never been a fan of symbolism in movies.

I don't know what some of the people are whining about...because you obviously don't go to see this movie and expect action. I think the pace of this movie suits the ambience of the film perfectly.

Mutual commiseration developes into a guarded love veiled in trepidation. Not since L'Avventura have I seen a movie so beautifully shot, and Maggie Cheung gives a performance that rivals Maria Falconetti's in the Passion of Joan of Arc.In the packaging there is a comment from the director that they did have troubles with the censors.

Wong Kar Wai is a love/hate director at times. Had he not had Tony & Maggie's charismatic talent..it might have failed in many ways. But he knows his stars and how to push them. The last scene w/ the ruins,the monk observing Tony whispering the secret, is still worth repeated viewings!

I loved the story of the 2 main characters and wanted to see their relationship develop (by either moving forward or even backward). Instead (about half way through the film), it was as if the director had run out of ideas. The plot/film just ran out of steam. The music cues (once beautiful) now became unintentioinally funny.

For unaccompanied choir, it is an atmospheric, intense and utterly compelling piece. The work begins in layered thirds until the dynamic climax is sung in ten parts: emotionally compelling, and highly addictive.The other pieces have less intensity, but their greater simplicity is expressive and measured, and richly melodic.The recording is warm, but a little cloudy, so only 4 stars. Well recommended.(Penguin Guide ***) If you are unfamiliar with the 3rd Symphony, an outstanding bargain is G��recki - Symphony No 3; Olden Style Pieces on Naxos."},{"rating":"2","title":"wide ranging voices, very attractive choral music","review":"For those who like wide-ranging choral music, this recording is awesome! Play through the CD and you will hear a progression of different voices and emotions. From the beginning of the disc, you have extremely low voices which build to a wonderful choral song over 20 minutes later. The simple line: \\"Lord our God, have mercy on us.\\" repeated over and over, makes the first track almost mesmirizing. From there, there are eight other tracks ranging in many different vocal styles, all in wonderful choral voices. This CD is well produced and recorded. I highly recommend it to anyone serious about choral music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The principle of fair use defined and explained","review":"Copyright For Teachers And Librarians by Rebecca Butler (Associate Professor in the Educational Technology, Research, and Assessment Department in the College of Education at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois) is a no-nonsense guide to copyright law.

This movie is annoying as it spends so much time setting up the scare that when the actual terror part of the movie starts you are so frustrated that you no longer care what happens. A good story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning is over-long even though it does have some spooky ghost stories. The middle with the amateur ghostbusters exploring the haunted house is at best preposterous. The ending is rushed and offers few answers. I suppose the intent was for the viewer to supply his own answers to what went on, but this viewer was left extremely unsatisfied"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Doesn't Get Any Worse","review":"Imagine the worst porn movie you've ever seen - the acting and plot in this film is ten times worse. And like a bad porn movie, you'll be embarrassed if you watch this film with anyone but yourself.Not even a fifth of good whiskey will make this film entertaining - you'll just sit there with the dry heaves, praying you can throw up, go to bed, and forget about it.

It has great scares and would be perfect for a little girls sleepover at Halloween Time. I am a sucker for this type of flick! Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the bottom line ...","review":"Based on an intriguing premise, the filmmakers hired four bad actors to spend the night in a haunted house, which in actuality is a very nice home somebody obviously left for the weekend so the film could be fabricated. A legitimate ghost hunter was brought in to make things even more authentic.But, alas, nothing does happen in the house, so a bunch of dumb, cheap and non-scary sight gags (no pun intended) had to be created to fill in the gaps. The result is a cross between \\"The Real World\\" (with participants only half as intelligent -- now that's saying something) and a day in the worst amusement park haunted house ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little documentary","review":"I have no idea if this was actually a real documentary or if it was staged, but either way I found it frightening. It's a good little ghost story. The only thing that made me want to cringe is that annoying psychic Madison!! Oh god! Every time she would talk I would just cringe. What a dramatic young lady.

(Lest we upset any sensitive spirits?) Still, the \\"reality\\" in this film makes for great fright and fun. Overall, MUCH more satisfying than the Blair Witch Project, and following in the vein of favorite \\"Survivor,\\" \\"Road Rules,\\" and \\"Real World\\" reality shows, this one outdoes them all ... Special kudos to Paul Palmer and Madison Charap whose vulnerability as \\"participants\\" adds to the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM","review":"... so my review is a wee bit more objective than some of the phony \\"4-star\\" ratings you'll see here.If you have relatives or friends under the age of 14, give them a video camera and turn them loose in a dark house after instructing them to \\"make a scary movie.\\" I guarantee you, they will make a more frightening film than this 77-minute wad of bad-intentions-gone-worse piece of drek. It's hard to determine what's worse in this movie-- the acting or the production values.No one enjoys a good horror film more than I, and no one enjoys a BAD horror film more than I, but the \\"St. Francisville Experiment\\" is neither. It's a shameless, moronic \\"Blair Witch\\" ripoff that will make you wonder just how embarrassed you can be simply by watching TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"This movie is so pointless.

I still have to give this movie the highest rating, though. Hey, i'm a Troma fan! Whatcha expect. Anyway, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh. I also recommend this to anyone that scares easily (VERY easily.) I recommend this to skeptics as well as the gullible. It's pretty entertaining. And, isn't that what a movie is supposed to do?

Don't get me wrong, I loved \\"Blair Witch.\\" However, both movies are perfect examples of what could have been perfect executions of an ingenius idea.\\"St. Francisville\\" had all the potential of being the scariest movie ever. However, much of that potential was lost due largely to its female lead. It must be a rule that every recent horror movie has to have that annoying young psychic know-it-all egg to spoil near the beginning of the film and then stink up the rest of the picture.The movie was genuinely terrifying for a total of 40 seconds out of 76 minutes. Worth seeing once for the \\"mirror\\" scene (thus the two out of five rating).I hope someone gets this idea right someday. It's a crying shame..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story Telling","review":"This film is like The Blair Witch Project. In the same sense you know it acting it's still a good ghost story.

It's obvious after the second \\"scare\\" that this is nothing more than a pathetic \\"Blair Witch\\" rip off. But I can see the film's problem.

And that's exactly what is left, nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Attempt at a Blair Witch Clone","review":"I really looked forward to this movie as a resident of Louisiana who is intrigued by the haunted history of this area. However this movie is not historically accurate nor is it entertaining.

What a farce. Somebody please explain to me why the subject of this film never made the headlines, the news, or even one of those paranormal shows on TV. Further, if it is real, why did it go straight to the shelves of Blockbuster rather than to the big screen? And hmmmm...coincidence that it was made right after the Blair Witch buzz?It is so obvious from the start that this so-called documentary is really just a ....film laced with horrible acting and directing. I love how those cameras the actors are carrying always seem to fall in the perfect position when they are dropped - filming that bug in ths sandwhich, filming that kid getting dragged away, filming their own faces perfectly in the center of the screen.This is a horrible movie. I'd rather wash my car then rent it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery....","review":"This is a must have for fans of the Blair Witch. Bearing in mind that it is a blatant ripoff merely substituting a haunted house for the haunted woods, but it is an entertaining movie that does have creepy moments.First of all the legend itself is really eerie, and I think I have heard of Madame Levay (sp?). The idea of the torture chamber, and the shackles and all that hidden room jazz just combines to spell fREAKY!!Watch closely or you will miss the best parts of the film.I really liked the humour in this movie as well, I found myself laughing and laughing at the wisecracks of the guys.And if the characters are farmiliar: the dumb blonde, the flaky psychic, the macho guys, then remember that we are not talking about an Oscar flick here, its a straight to video meant merely to entertain.The house itself is satisfyingly creepy, the chandeliers, furniture, doctor's bag discovered in the basement, hidden chambers etc.A fun movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept and Back Story, Bad writing and Execution","review":"This movie took a real screwed up story and had a decent concept for it, but they butchered it by not providing a good outlet for it. For example, they took a real true story about a woman who tortured her slaves and attempted to make a documentary/ghost story out of it, but they failed because they had it take place in a house where she \\"may\\" have hid for awhile. They should have had this take place in her actual house (or a house that was supposed to be it) and scared the crap out of the kids and viewers, there were tons of ghostly things that could have happened to them with the idea of Madame's slaves in mind.The characters were all likable other then the Psychic who just annoyed the crap out of me and made me want to shut it off.For a much more in depth review for this stinky movie, please check out my horror movie/book review blog Shivers of Horror.

I think I made it half way through the film hoping it would eventually improve; it didn't, so I took a prozac & went to bed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Joke of a Movie--Save Your Money","review":"This whole movie was staged. There was absolutely nothing scary about it. One example, the history student (a girl) is eating a sandwich and it has a cockroach on it. She is being filmed showing the cockroach while holding the sandwich, but no one says a word about it to her. She finally takes a bite or two and pretends she has taken the roach into her mouth....but you never actually she it as she pretends to take it out and toss it across the room. Then, of course screams her lungs out. The whole movie is like this. The fireplace seen is even funnier with her.ADVICE: Don't waste your money or time with this movie, it isn't worth either."},{"rating":"1","title":"77 minutes I'll never get back","review":"To call this one of the worst movies I've ever seen is an insult to the worst movies I've ever seen. With a \\"plot\\" obviously lifted from a certain witch project you'd think at least you'd be mildly scared. WRONG. Not only does this \\"real\\" documentary contain every horror house cliche known to man it presents them without one bit of style or suspense. Bad acting, obviously scripted and contrived situations, plot inconsitencies large enough to drive 1,000 trucks through and the cleanest abandoned haunted house you or I will ever come across do not make for a good movie. I'll play by the rules and not give any spoilers-but any child can see that props were obvious plants. Even if you hated \\"Blair Witch\\" seeing it again is better than seeing this once. Not scary. Not funny. Not worth a look. Oh, BTW, I believe in ghosts and haunted houses-only not ineptly portrayed shams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convincing or even interesting","review":"Unlike The Blair Witch Project, where I debated for several days whether or not it was real, this movie left me zero doubt that it was fake. Very early in the show, a chandelier falls to the ground after some hapless thrill seeker dares to flip its light switch to the ON position. Gimme a break. The rest of the film was just more cheap scare tactics and unbelievable stuff that left no doubt that this movie was just that - a movie. And not a very good one at that. The Blair Witch Project was plausible, which is what made it so scary. This movie is just dumb. I gave it two stars for the scary effects. That's about all it had going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Obviously this is a Movie and not \\"REAL\\", but I can't believe anyone would find this scary or even interesting.I rented this knowing that it had some bad reviews, but curious anyway.After watching this movie I can honestly say that I was angry. Not because the movie tries to gimmick itself as real, not because the actors and dialogue are lame, not even because the movie is just bad, but because it was such a lackluster production that was probably whipped together in month to ride on the Blair Witch Project coat tails.It is a blatant rip-off that does not even try to impress the viewer. That is the most unforgivable thing about this movie.Finally, yes I agree...with a previous review...May I never hear \\"surround yourself with white light\\" again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"st francesville experience","review":"i needless to say was very disappointed with this film. the acting was less then interesting and the plot was terrible. in my opinion it is a bad take-off of the blair witch project. if you are a chronic insomniac i would recommend renting and watching this film over taking a sleeping pill. you will be asleep in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily the worst movie I've ever seen","review":"Let me begin by saying that the first two reviews are most likely either from the producers or the actors in the film, as no one can possibly take this \\"film\\" seriously. The story isn't real, the scenes are obviously faked, and the acting is terrible. The entire \\"History\\" scene isn't even about the house being stayed in! The phony psychic is the worst, you'll want a ghost to strangle her after the first five minutes. Reminds me of a junior college video production class project. I'm surprised Troy Taylor put his name on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"movie\\" ever made.","review":"This is possibly the worst \\"movie\\" ever made. 4 terrible actors stuck in a house that actually is haunted(but not by the ghosts the movie presents), takes away a horribly agonizing 76 minutes of your life. Did you know that this movie was supposed to release in theaters, but was so bad that it was going straight to video, but it was even worse then that, now they won't sell it on VHS, they're only renting it to recoupe their loses! Save your money and go rent 1980's Changeling starring George C. Scott. At least you won't feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Low-Budget Cheese isn't so bad","review":"For such a low-budget, cheesey movie, St. Francisville Experiment actually packs a few thrills. It's slow going at the beginning, and it's a real toss-up as to who is the most annoying character (although Madison really tries hard to earn that title). But if you can sit through it without falling asleep, you will be rewarded with a few honst to goodness scares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal archetypes resurrected in timeless fashion","review":"The unmatched exuberance of youth and self portrait of the suffering artist is captured in this light-hearted romp through the inner visions of modern day survivalists facing the perils of a wilderness which cannot be understood or overestimated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Upshaw Recording","review":"Almost as good as Upshaw live, as I saw last week in Pittsburgh.

Bristol hipster Gerard Langley speaks (almost sings) his way through eleven of the twelve tracks (guitarist Rodney Allen sings on \\"Careful Boy\\"), ranging from upbeat (\\"Jacket Hangs\\") to wistfully pensive (\\"Picture Framed\\") to downright ominous (\\"Cat-Scan Hist'ry\\"). The highlight of the album is easily the single, \\"...And Stones,\\" a song guaranteed to put a smile on your face. The 'Planes had never recorded a song as good as this one, and they've never recorded one since. The whole album is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding performance","review":"This is the Royal Philharmonic Collection budget CD, but there's nothing cheap about the performance and the recording quality. In fact, the digital recording is amazingly realistic and wide in dynamic range. Royal PO's performance is outstanding in many ways. Menuhin has deep understanding of Elgar's music and its innermost yearning. Every movement displays his genuine affinity with the inspiration and characterisation of the music. Tempi are perfectly judged throughout, the famous 9th variation Nimrod, for example, is neither too fast nor too slow, achieving maximum grandeur and dramatic effect without losing forward momentum. The fast variations are bursting with energy and verve, the slow variations are played with amazing subtlely and heart warming intimacy. The additional organ in the last variation amplifies the scale of the monumental finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulpy goodness","review":"Pulp fiction before there was such a thing. This book strangely is some what \\"prophetic\\" in its writing in that it creates a convincing allegory of the nuclear age and its natural consequences.

It is difficult to compare and describe: mellow trance, mystic, house samples, suggestive and sexy velvet voices, inspirating, brilliant guitar arrangements melted with the rich texture of synthesizers...Today we would call this music as \\"naked music\\", \\"chill out\\"... but I insist that really even today sounds fresh and new!I put five stars with no doubt !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They Changed the Product","review":"We loved Zatarains pre-mixed jambalaya with sausage that you just warmed up and it was ready to eat.

I'm a huge fan of \\"The Lion and the Cobra\\", and the excellent \\"Faith and Courage\\" as well, but neither can touch this. In some way, every song is at least as good as her biggest hit \\"Nothing Compares to You\\". This still gets played by me 13 years later, and is enjoyed as much as ever.

Her mind is sad yet aware.Each song on I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (such an uncommercial album title would only work out for Sin��ad) has its own soul, its own story, its own sadness. Beautifully sung by the Irishwoman, and in a way that no cover version will be able to keep up with the depth that she has put into it all.A unique album that is very hard not to be touched by.

The chick from The Cranberries did the yodeling thing WAY better. Give me \\"Dreams\\" over \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" any day.

I read Visser's book because it was, as far as I know, the first of its kind. The book is structured around a chapter for each ingredient in a common dinner, a technique that was highly original in its day. The content is very detailed, sometimes too much so for my taste. For instance, the early chapter on corn contains much information that has been restated over the years to the point where it has become common knowledge. As a result, her treatment of corn's history feels like overkill. But it was a fairly \\"new\\" subject for general readers in its day. If you are interested in the history of humankind's interactions with foods that are common to America's dining table today, then Much Depends On Dinner is an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary, memorable and highly enjoyable read","review":"With this book Margaret Visser single-handedly launched the rash of single-subject books that have proliferated over the past two decades. And this one remains the best of them. She has a light touch, a sharp eye and a brilliant capacity for communicating the minutiae of her extensive research. She devotes a chapter to the history of each ingredient in a simple, everyday meal (sweetcorn, salt, butter, chicken, rice, lettuce, olive oil and icecream) and she takes the reader on a fantastic journey through history, mythology and contemporary culture. Everyone interested in food should have a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating culinary lore!","review":"If you enjoy learning the trivia about the basics of your daily existence this book will amaze you! Who ever dreamed that corn was so omnipresent in our lives? That white food was associated with mildness and innocence and is considered appropriate for children and sick folks? That vegetables and salads were considered female foods, unnecessary luxuries for men, right up until the 20th century? You'll be quoting tidbits from this book over dinner for months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great overlooked talent !!","review":"This is a very solid cd and I just love it!!! If you are debating to get this cd or not just buy it. Songs like \\"You're not the Lovn' Kind\\" and \\"Caution to the wind\\" are two of my favorites. \\"Excited\\" is great as well. \\"Stranded\\" is another great song. This is one of those rare cd's that have great song after great song. If you're like me and have bought a cd because of one song and the rest of the cd sucked you won't be saying that about this. Just listen to the samples if they have it and you will be hooked.

I was at a book signing given by the author where she said that the book was 98% true and only the names were changed to protect the guilty. Knowing that this book wasn't just a purely fictionalized account of life as a celebrity personal assistant, I was up till 2 a.m. on a work night reading it! I couldn't stop laughing and sighing for poor Corki. Corki Brown's (aka Howard's) wild experiences working for Hollywood's elite and her comic delivery of the goods were as refreshing as a southern California ocean breeze. I particularly loved the description of the wedding Corki Brown had to arrange in Greece. I felt like I was there. I'm hoping they will make a movie of this book. The wedding scene in Greece where all Hell breaks loose would be brilliant on screen. I'd also love to see another book about how Heather got into the personal assitant business to begin with. I enjoyed Chore Whore much more than the Nanny Diaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"It was amazing to realize that people really do do this for a living!

You have to be a very long distance away for this to be used safely (manufacturer reccomends 100+ yards) so no pistol training here. I did try it at about 10 yards just to see, and after the first shot I was hit in the face with hot lead that came from the box. Upon closer inspection the .22 almost penetrated the steel back of the box. Again, might work well for long distance rifle practice, but don't plan to use a pistol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a trap","review":"The only reason I didn't send it back was it is heavy to ship back.

The pieces did not fit tight at all, I was glad I had a welder to fill in the 1/8 inch gaps in the metal. I repainted it and now sits on my bench were I shoot at it all the time.

I started buying the Corolle Poupettes for my daughter when she was around 2. She 4 1/2 now and she still loves them and plays with them all the time. She probably has 7 or 8 of the older versions of these dolls, and I'm so happy to see Corolle brought them back after being discontinued. The dolls are just the right size for a toddler to carry around. The head and limbs are of soft, vanilla-scented vinyl and the body is cloth. They are also very easy to dress and undress. Their hair doesn't get as messy and ratty as most dolls' do, and it is easy to brush it and keep it looking neat. I was never a \\"doll-person\\" as a child and didn't really enjoy them, but I have to say I love these particular dolls, they really are exceptional!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a first choice","review":"The constant ingredient in most recipes in this cookbook is maple syrup. While using maple syrup in recipes is not unusual for vegan baking, needing it for most of these recipes tends to get outrageously expensive. It's not my first choice when reaching for a vegan dessert cookbook. There are NO pictures in this cookbook.I prefer Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"I was so excited to buy this book since I've been vegan for over 10 years and I have a HUGE sweet tooth. Unfortunately, it was horribly disappointing. I have only found one recipe out of the many I've tried that was actually edible (and even that recipe had to be modified in several ways before it tasted ok). The book is riddled with typos, missing ingredients/information, etc. In many cases, the ingredients are not listed in the order used, which I find very irritating. More importantly, almost all the recipes I tried were awful. I tried to make the fudge recipe for Christmas, and it was indescribably terrible. It almost broke my blender, was a disgusting pale color, tasted horrible, and had a bizarre consistency. I had to throw the whole thing out. I honestly don't even understand how such awful recipes could have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful. As a long term vegan and baker, I threw this book out","review":"I ordered this book as soon as it came out (years ago). I was so hopeful... It's awful. I couldn't believe how awful. I've been a vegan for 10 years and an avid dessert maker. I know good vegan desserts, and these are NOT good vegan desserts. I tried a good 10 or so before giving up entirely. I honestly don't know when I've felt so betrayed by a cookbook. I recycled it (instead of donating it) because I didn't want to poison other people's impressions of what vegan baked goods should be. Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing & disappointing cookbook","review":"I received this book as a gift, but would never buy it for myself or anyone.Either no one bothered to test the recipes, or someone forgot to proofread the book before it went to press. I tried the Little Oaties cookies recipe; it lists 8 ingredients, but only tells you what to do with 5 of them in the instructions. I've ended up inventing my own recipe over time (not the author's intention, I imagine!). Other recipes are similarly confusing. We had to make three versions of the Banana Bread recipe before it actually worked.My other criticism is that different variations of recipes are listed as separate recipes (e.g., Citrus Orange Cake & Toasted Coconut Pecan Cake). When you only have to substitute one or two ingredients, I think it's a variation and can be listed as a note in the same recipe. In another cookbook, these recipes wouldn't add up to 140."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful, awful","review":"i will definitely be selling this at my next yard sale.this book gives veganism a bad name. i'm actually afraid to sell it at the yard sale, because i'm afraid i'll just be furthering the belief that vegan food is disgusting and bland. not to mention, the textures of these recipes are all wrong.i am afraid to try any other recipes, because i don't want to waste any more good ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Healthy","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and was excited when it finally came in the mail.

As a macrobiotic baker, it is possible to make desserts that are both healthy, delicious, and whole grain to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am an avid baker and vegetarian. I have recently begun experimenting with vegan desserts. I tried several of the brownie recipes and a cookie recipe in this book. They were all awful (poor in both taste and texture) and had to be thrown away. It is unfortunate to have to give this book a bad review, but I would hate for other people to waste their money as I did.I would recommend the book \\"The Artful Vegan\\". There are excellent dessert recipes in the back (using mostly unprocessed ingredients). The German Chocolate Cake recipe in there is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peanut butter cookies","review":"Let me warn you that the recipe for peanut butter cookies in this book is BAD. I made these and they came out really dry and tasteless. If you want a truly delicious recipe for vegan peanut butter cookies, as well as other treats, then buy Dreena Burton's book Vive le Vegan. Now that's a good cookie!! As a vegan I refuse to compromise taste and texture when it comes to baking, and I won't recommend a book just because it's vegan. It's really important that veganism not have a reputation for bad cooking. It IS possible to make truly delicious vegan treats, so if you aren't finding the right recipes, keep looking, and don't compromise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to rave about","review":"I bought this book because of the great reviews on this site but have been a bit disappointed. The cakes that I have made have been much too dense, almost wet and the chocolate chip cookies were gross. The cream cheese icing is way too soft even after refrigerating it for 2 days. The only good thing I have made from this book has been the cheesecake (yummy!) and the chocolate frosting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I've tried a handful of recipes from this book; all were gross. I am unwilling to waste time and ingredients trying any more. I have had much better success with vegan desserts from Peter Berley, Myra Kornfeld, and Isa Chandra Moskowitz. I cannot recommend this book. In fact, I recycled the book because I thought it unkind to pass it on to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of ingredients","review":"I bought this book because I have had my eye on it for a long time now. Looking through the recipes and reading their titles made my mouth water, but when I went out and spent $30 on ingredients and made 4 of the recipes (all in one night I might add), I was GREATLY disappointed.The \\"Chocolate Covered Gold\\" cake was disgusting. After baking it 10 minutes more than time I was told to (I think it was 35 minutes), I took it out and did the age-old toothpick test. It came out clean. I iced it up and later cut into it to serve my family for my father's birthday, and the inside was like raw batter.Same goes for the \\"Chocolate Rasberry Boston Cream Pie.\\" It was a huge disappointment. The flavor was horrible and the texture was soggy and gross.I hate to not use a cook book but I do not want to waste any more time, energy, or money on ingredients just to end up throwing more away.I will be selling this book very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed Vegan","review":"I would like to warn health minded vegans that the recipes in this book are full of white flour, white sugars, and highly processed ingredients. If, like me, you avoid these ingredients, this is not a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Tantilizing Treats!","review":"I LOVE this book. I'm not a vegan, however I suffer from dairy allergies, therefore I was looking for some good alternative desserts. I found them! The cheesecakes are wonderful, I've made a couple of them and the friends I served them to couldn't believe it was dairy-free (which means cholesterol free!) The crusts are a little different, but you can find vegan grahm crackers and use a soy butter, or even oil to make a somewhat 'normal' cheesecake crust. I also made a wheat free chocolate cake, which was also very good. If you are not used to different grains, though, they will taste a bit gritty to you, but they are still quite delicious. SO, to say the least, I HIGHLY recomend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly amazing!","review":"As I looked through the recipes in this new cookbook, I was absolutely amazed at how delicious they all appear to be. The doughnut and candy sections are especially great. And as the title proclaims, all of the recipes are 100% vegan - animal-free and cruelty-free. The author even provides an excellent section at the beginning of the book, discussing the many reasons why we want to veganize our desserts and other food, giving quite compelling reasons based on health alone. That is exceptional for a dessert book, at least the ones I've seen so far. Overall, this is an excellent cookbook for all of us vegans who have been \\"deprived\\" of our sweet treats for far too long, and I highly recommend it to anybody, vegan or wannabe. I would give it ten stars if they were available. Now, we vegans can have our cake (and other desserts) - and eat it too! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Better Out There","review":"I'll admit that I only tried 3 recipes from the book - the chocolate chip cookies, pound cake and basic brownies.

But in this case, I feel I must save others from wasting their money.I made two recipes from this cookbook: the Berry Brownies and the Lemon Times Two Cake. They were both so horrible that I couldn't bring myself to try any others. Taste, texture, cooking directions, it was all wrong. I had one bite of each and threw them in the bin. What went wrong? It's hard to tell if the recipes are supposed to taste like this (hard to imagine), or something went wrong at the printers, or nobody actually tested these recipes?

Made a few of them, but they just didn't taste the way I thought they should - undercooked even after baking for much longer than the recipe directed, too heavy, too reliant on maple syrup, too much customization and experimentation required to make them work out right (or at all).It's too bad, because all the recipes look like they should be delicious...I really, really wanted this to be a good cookbook, but I gave the book away because I knew I just wouldn't use it after my failed attempts at some of the recipies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I received this book as a gift. I jumped into trying some of the great-sounding recipes. Each one I tried more clearly showed the sad truth that this book is full of false promises.

However, we hardly know about INTERACTIONS between these historical processes.This book picks up pioneering sexologists, early cinemas, and African-American writers such as Pauline Hopkins, James Weldon Johnson, and Jean Toomer. It is not a comprehensive inquiry of race and sex in Twentieth-Century America, but makes great contributions to initiating studies on the interactive history of race and sexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sheets for the price!","review":"These are the softest, fluffiest sheets in my house.

But, at the end of the day, the truth ALWAYS comes out. Pierre Plantard, the self-styled \\"Grand Master\\" of the imaginary \\"Priory of Scion\\" who is at the very heart of this story, turns out to have been nothing more than a bitter old anti-Semite and an admitted fraud. If Baigent, Lincoln & Leigh could not deduce this (considering all of the investigatory gymnastics they claim to have undertaken) then their breath-taking credulity staggers comprehension. If they were parties to Plantard's fraud... well, YOU figure it out.Since the foundation is faulty, the entire superstructure of books, videos and wild speculation spawned by this fiction must also fall to earth.

It involves psychological changes, encountering reality from different perspectives, and cutting through the subjective structures that make up our reality in order to design a new worldview that allows you to make the changes you desire. Unfortunately, like almost all books on wicca, this book ignores this integral first step, and concentrates solely on rituals which are relatively worthless without this self-initiation.I'd suggest checking out some useful works on Chaos Magick, such as those by Phil Hine and Peter Carroll, before starting any of this work... without a proper understanding of the Great Work, your efforts will be useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very discouraging book!TWO THUMBS DOWN!!","review":"This book like all of Scott Cunningham's other book was very discouraging and very restricted on magick.He has put such great limitations on spells and magick such as saying that love spells are manipulative and that they never work and that you should never put a spell on a specific person no matter what.His books make magick sound useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Scott Cunningham was a great author and I love his books.

Carlos Castaneda and Don Juan beg to differ. While Mr. Mares does make some good points in the book - which is why I give it 2 stars instead of one - it reeks of the social conditioning that Carlos Castaneda, Don Juan, Taisha Abelar, and Florinda Donner-Grau denounced in their teachings. It also speaks volumes that Mr. Mares wrote this book instead of his nagual woman, Marianne. Evidently she cannot create.

If she doesn't believe females are innately creative and create a myriad things in many different ways this is the book for her. If she believes that women cannot lead and indeed should not lead because by virtue of being female these are qualities denied her , then this is the book for her. if she believes that a man is in the best position to tell her how to be female since , naturally she would not have access to that information herself then this book is an indispensible companion .

Far lesser groups or individuals stay around far to long and still manage to gain some fame or notoriety. Thier music can be compared to other groups around the same era, Naked Eyes, When In Rome, and Orchestral Manoeuvers In The Dark(OMD) - other excellent groups long gone.

I find the simulated 5.1 surround sound so lacking that I feel the comparison is misleading. The base does provide a place to charge the provided reusable batteries, however, I often need to replace them in the middle of whatever I am watching. I would rather have a charging base that assures a full charge every time I use them. If I had the purchase to do again, I would not buy these headphones.

The transmitter is easy to set up. Switching from analog to digital sound has to be done maually. An inconvenience from your easy chair. It should have either automatic switching or a remote. The signal is infared so any obstruction will wipe out the signal. Just be aware that wandering pets can wipe out your signal, so transmitter location is critical. The unit comes with a digital coaxial cable and would be better served it it came with an optical digital cable. The onboard battery charger will only charge Pioneer brand rechargeable batteries.

Both sides are now epoxied after breaking. Last night when I removed them the whole assembly where the head band enters the frame broke so now it's more epoxy.So for durability two stars is pushing the limit.

Equivalent or better to Bose QC3 and Sennheiser RS 170 / RS180. Loved the Dolby decoding.

That means even if somebody walks between you and the transmitter or you wave your hand, lean on the couch or turn your head, the sound drops out completely. Not acceptable in my situation since my AV gear is placed on the side and not in front of the seating/viewing area - so only one of the two IR recievers is recieving the signal.

They are lightweight and comfortable when wearing. Their performance is superb and easy to operate. This is my first set of headphones and I did quite a bit of research to find something that was wireless, lightweight, offered surround sound capabilities, and good battery life. These phones offer all these features and the price was reasonable for the quality. My only concern is that I cannot (or don't know how) hook these into my receiver so that I can take advantage of both the TV and DVD player. Currently, I have them connected into the Comcast cable box and can only use them when watching television, but I cannot figure out how to connect them to listen to movies too through the DVD player. Regardless, great value and a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Have this connected to my xbox 360 via the digital toslink and the digital coax to my directv. Both sound great. Volume is adjustable and strong. No static at all. I use the energizer lithium batteries and they last twice as long as the rechargeable batteries that are included, plus lithium batteries weight twice as less but you toss them when they die as they are not rechargeables. Overall great wireless headphones with good sound. I understand you can use a additional same headphone with the same base fyi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, but physically flawed","review":"I've had these headphones for about a year. They are comfortable, and the sound quality is great. However, today, the headphones broke. It seems the swivel mechanism is a very tiny and thin plastic piece. If this piece were made of metal, it would be OK, but the plastic can't hold up. I'm not rough with these, but I didn't handle them as if they were made of thin glass either. It is physically a poor design, in my opinion as an engineer.This is too bad. The speakers and audio system are great, but the physical package is not up to the task. They need a re-design, badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design, Poor customer service","review":"While in the warranty the head set broke just above the yoke holding the right can. I drove 100 miles to a authorized customer service site and was told to call California. California said to send the head set in after I described the problem. The head set was returned in the same broken condition with no explanation. I called Customer service in California again and was told the warranty didn't cover breakage. I explained there had been no abuse but they didn't care and would only offer to sell a new head set for almost the price of the complete new unit. I used tie wraps to put the thing together. Yesterday the other side broke in the same place. It appears to be a severe design flaw. It also would be nice to have a stand to store the headset when not in use that would keep the batteries recharged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Both my wife and I are hard of hearing but we love the surround sound. Problem is even with my Bose system and speakers we cant hear the words most of the time. These are amazing and you get the full effect of surround in a wireless and comfortable headset. I can wear these for the entire 2 hour movie easliy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No support for AAC audio format","review":"I have these headphones for over 4 years now, they are great and never had issues with them.Recently, I purchased Western Digital WDTV Live and connected it to the headphone's base unit via optical.I have lots of Blu-Ray movies in a 3TB WD drive connected to the WDTV unit for waching on my TV.I found out that movies wiht AAC format audio won't come through the headphones but all other audio formats play fine.I was searching this forum to see if anyone else has encoutered this issue with these headphones.I may have to look for another set that supports AAC format.Other than that, these are good headphones, they would have been even better if they included a small remote to control the power and the settings on the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!!!!","review":"I love these !

The bass was great. The response and sound was great. But the surround was just a echo made to sound like you were in a bubble. NO front and rear sounds, just pretend.Returned, wouldn't keep them, would never buy or recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV headphones","review":"These are my 5th headphones for the tv, and certainly the best, though not perfect.The previous headphones (900 mhz, 2.4, Sony infrared) each had irritating noise. The noise on the Sony Infrared came from my Panasonic flatscreen tv.These Panasonic headphones are very expensive, but mostly serve their purpose. My wife goes to sleep later than I do and I dont want to hear the tv sound when I sleep. The sound quality is excellent and there is no noise. However, occasionally the sounds fades away without apparent reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batteries Proprietary?","review":"Replacement batteries are always out of stock at Pioneer. They are, as another reported, $50 EACH. The proprietary batteries can be found via TigerDirect and one other source, and run about $65 EACH including shipping. A follow up commentator states that any can be used, but the manual clearly warns to only use Pioneer.Note that Pioneer is selling these headphones direct at a new MSRP that is somewhat lower than Amazon at this date.The Dolby Digital and Prologic sound on these is excellent. The Sony and Sennheiser are unacceptably noisy.[revised]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!: Right earpiece very fragile and breaks easily.","review":"I have had 4 sets of these headphones and in all cases, even with careful delicate handling, the right earpiece brakes in the swivel. There is only a small very fragile plastic piece that holds them together. No home remedy, such as super glue, does not work on this. I keep getting these replaced either with Sony warranty or Amazon with out any discussion, but it is a pain to have to go thru the repair and replacement process every 2-4 months. The sound and performance of these headphones is excellent. Why Pioneer can engineer such great sound and fail to take care of what has to be an original design flaw that has had to be a considerable problem for buyers....I wish I knew. However, I will give credit where credit due...the warranty service and buyer return policies for WalMart as well as Sony are easy to deal with and you get very little discussion about getting a new replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited range","review":"The sound from the headphones is great. However, the range is very limited. I put my hand up and it immediately blocked the signal from the receiver to the headphones and the sound would cut out. I had no idea that the headphones had such a short range. I thought that it would have the same capabilities of a cordless phone not realizing that technology isn't as advanced as I imagined. I would not recommend this product especially for the price you pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bass Response of a $9 headphones","review":"Tried it on 2 DVD Players and a Mac-Pro with Digital Out and the response is pathetic. One wonders what sort of movies on 5.1 were tested in the designing of this headphones. The quality of the output is analogous to turning a contemporary 5.1 movie and making it sound like a scratchy old Maria Callas Vinyl. From Lang's Metropolis to Lord of the Rings uniformly sound lifeless with these headphones.Since it was a birthday gift, it was opened well after 30 days of purchase - the disappointment is costly. Perhaps it will be used for some old film noire from Criterion, late at night when I do expect the entire film industry to refrain from low bass frequencies in those productions... hopefully too tired to then wonder why I am not using those plain old $9 headphones that's lying under some nails, bolts and junk in the garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pioneer SE-Dir800c","review":"This item was purchased as a Christmas gift and, unfortunately, the Headphones did not work. This item is still currently at a designated Pioneer repair facility (under warranty).

I was like wow. This man and his band are great. Great vocals, and great percusssion, and just super. So imagine my disappointment with this album, which completely lacks the qualities which drew me to the N'dour sound. My chief complaint is that the tracks are highly synthesized, lacking naturalness. He has orchestral segments (again synthesized) that are in disharmony with the Senegalese sound. The music is almost always on high volume and often at high speed. And I'm sorry to say there are moments when N'dours voice grates. What this guy needs to do is capture that Carnegie performance on disc. If you're in search of a more natural Sengalese sound with smooth vocals, try Cheik Lo's \\"Ne La Thiass\\" (produced by N'dour). I rate \\"Ne La Thiass\\" 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe for a kitten","review":"I ordered this, and the 25 inch burrow bed at the same time, thinking the 25\\" would hold my older cat, and this would work for my younger, smaller cat. No such luck. The bed barely makes 17\\", and is so over stuffed and stiff, I can't imagin any cat would find it comfortable.Not only would my younger cat not even attempt to get in it, she couldn't fit. She barely weighs 9 lbs, and a very lean kitty she is, but also a very long one as it turns out. She couldn't turn around, nor sprawl out as she likes to do on my bed. If you consider your cat even remotely 'average' sized, do yourself a favor and spring for the 25\\" bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dog Loves It!","review":"I bought this bed for my 5lb chihuahua. She is always getting under our covers. She loves this bed. In fact, we have to move it sometimes just so she will get off the bed and play. Cons: It does collect hair and it sinks in after she has laid on it for a day. Pros: It is super easy to clean. I just toss it in the wash and it looks new, puffy and all. Over all, I really think it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"Poofy\\"","review":"This purchase was a big disappointment. The bed I received was overstuffed, making it impossible for a pet to lie on it -- the stuffing rolls them off the bed. This makes it totally unusable for my 5# chihuahua much less the larger cats.The photo shows a much less stuffed model. When I get the time, I'll rip open a seam and pull half the stuffing out and re-sew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a cave","review":"The 'roof' part of this bed is really flimsy. It will not stay up, so my dog just lies on top of it like any bed. Maybe cats will burrow into it, but the photos make it look like it's a bit more cave-like than it is. Construction otherwise is okay, but if you really want something your pet can crawl into, rather than on top of, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not the right size","review":"Bed isnt as big as it said it was, defiantely a smaller bed and if you have an small cat or dog 8 inches or longer then its definately not the bed for you, because it will be to small to fit them into it. I would suggest buying a different bed or a larger size even if you think you have a really small dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuffed too much","review":"There was so much stuffing in this bed that it was more like a round ball. I tried to \\"flatten\\" it by putting a 5-pound bag of flour in it, but that didn't work. There was no way a small dog would have been able to get into the bed and stay there very easily. I finally removed the pillow, removed the stitching to open it up and took half the stuffing out -- resewed and put back in. That was much better and my little puppy was able to get in the bed. I saved the extra stuffing to make a second pillow, either as a replacement or as a second bed if I get additional material to cover it.Don't know if mine was faulty and just overstuffed, but certainly wasn't very practical as it was received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy Bed for Puppy or Cat","review":"I purchased two of these.

The concept is great, but the sizes seem to run small, and it seemed a little poorly made. Not bad, but not great either. Thankfully amazon let me return this without making me pay for the shipping - and gave me a full refund. We were able to get a round bed with suede on the outside and same fleecy wool type stuff on the inside at Meijer for almost half the price. The bottom bedding comes out so we just tuck one end of a nice fleece blanket underneath it, put it back in and it works realitively the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor!","review":"Awkward construction - the pillow portion is really thick, and then it's very small in diameter, so its tippy.

Though not at the same level of excellence as his more recent work, this series opener presents us with a fascinating protagonist wrestling with serious moral decisions.The first in the Tim Rackley series, Kill Clause explores vigilantism, the law, justice and morality within the tight, tense constraints of the genre, all while its protagonist is learning to grieve for his murdered child. Top off a page-turning story with truly amazing writing and emotions so true you feel Hurwitz must have gone through something similar, and you have the makings of a terrific book."},{"rating":"1","title":"And???","review":"I could not get into this book.

Politically, I agree with the author's observations about the current abuses and manipulations of our legal system, but for Heaven's sake, come at it with some finesse next time. Also, to really send the novel into the silly, the author needs to shore up some of his research. Case in point, a Glock pistol is not \\"mostly plastic\\" and will most definitely not make it through a metal detector save the barrel. In fact, the entire slide/receiver is metal, which accounts for close to a pound of the gun's weight, and will go off like a fire alarm (with or without the barrel)in any metal detector in the world. All in all, an amateur at work. -Mykal Banta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"Got through about 150 pages, but the story was just a bit too far fetched for my tastes.

After looking in the range from $70 tp $200+ I found this little gem. It brews each cup in less then a minute. A full pot brews in about 7 minutes. Great tasting HOT coffee. The filter basket removes for dumping and washing. You can also purchase little purhana water filters to take out any added chlorine. It is a great coffee maker and one I can feel safe drinking from!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love the removable parts","review":"Wonderful coffee pot I love the removable parts, the bucket lifts out for easy no mess water filling.

I definately think its the best coffee maker I've ever had, love the auto timer too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've used it for four years and love it!","review":"I have used this coffee maker for 4 years now. The most desirable features are the removable water resevoir and the removable filter basket. It does an excellent job brewing and make a pretty decent cup of coffee at a fairly hot temperature.The only negative I have experienced is the amount of steam that pours out of it at the end of the brewing cycle. The steam condenses and ends up at base of the coffee maker, including under the coffee maker.Overall, I really like the removable water reservoir and the price I paid. So, the minor nuisance of the water to clean up after brewing is bearable. The cost versus performance of the appliance makes it a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Effort","review":"I suppose one needs to be cautious of items listed without dimensions or page counts listed. My first suprise was the small size of this very thin book. Nice color printing made me hopeful, but it cannot save a collection of dull, trite photographs.A handfull of images of true \\"Rough Gods\\" are joined by poor images of flowers, buildings and dead diva's tombstones, none of which make for very good photographs.Rather than a collection of \\"Rough Gods\\", this book is a jumble of amature photographs by someone with the connections to be published, but not the talent. Note that the poor images not featuring men are never mentioned in the reviews of this volume, and there are plenty of those in here. There really is no theam to this collection.Pull is a wonderful thing. I have seen references to this volume twice in national publications,and trust me, it is not worth the hype.Buy it and keep it because it is a signed first edition, but do not expect much from the photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everlasting Love","review":"This is a great CD.

Well, enough of the negative.On to the positive, it's a great CD. Great catchy tunes. I heard some of these songs from a German internet radio station (Munich's hardest hits) for the first time, then had to order the CD. I am happy I did. Loving melodic rock as much as I do, and loving the chorus's the way I do, I was astonished by the LACK of chorus on the slow song (I forget the name). This song was made for chorus's.

The second unit I received I have had no motor trouble; however it started out breaking approx 90% of the clays thrown. Once this issue was resolved a bearing screw bent and was replaced. The bearing screw bent because the bearing didn't ride correct on the mating surface. Once this was corrected the micro switch at the front of the machine broke and needs to be replaced. I have only gone through three boxes of clays total. I have only used the thrower for less the one hour of operating time on the machine.

If not for a slow start, which made me wonder if I should give it up, this would have earned a 5 from me. Duncan weaves the story of life's lessons and the need for ties between mothers, daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters. By the end of the story, I loved each of these women, who started out like a portrait of dysfunction. It also displays the strength of women who can forgive the men in their lives, and shows why this is oftentimes the best path to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"I thought this book was thoroughly enjoyable. Being a born and bred Yankee, the Southern charm was apparent as the other reviewers noted, however I believed the themes of family, maternal love, inter-generational relationships were globally appealing. Many women everywhere are in a situation like Ruth Ann struggling with priorities and problems of aging parents and rebellious children and personal dilemmas. The positive message that comes from this book (mostly through Marvelle's wisdom) remind us of the long term perspective that we often can't see through the day-to-day crisises of carpools, report cards, layoffs, illness we face each day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for grammar mavens.","review":"I'm afraid I didn't finish this novel because it was very gratingly written in dialect. The whole thing, without pause. Even descriptions, even people's thoughts. If cutesy dialect-writing gets on your nerves, don't order this.I couldn't bear the precious writing style long enough to finish it. Somehow, as a bluecollar Southerner, I felt condescended to with all those \\"she done\\"s. You know, even the crackeriest cracker isn't quite that bad, particularly people the age of the mother & daughter characters, who have actually attended high school (I could understand it more for the grandmother character, but ALL THREE CHARACTERS HAVE THE SAME VOICE with the SAME grammar quirks). I worked in a food stamp office in South Carolina for nine years and I never met anyone quite that unintelligible. We're not that quaint, honey; sometimes our verbs even agree. Honestly! Give this a miss unless you enjoyed Uncle Remus."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the women I know","review":"An excellent tale of exactly what families deal with every day... I felt as though I was following the characters around and only beginning to unwind their lives as the story occured.

As a stereo downmix, the levels are too low, which compromises the ability to play it back without getting too high a noise floor. Further, the package says it was recorded and mixed in 24/48 resolution. Why then is the DVD Audio MLP presented at 24/44.1? The explanation could be that it is a simple typo, but perhaps Naxos is not using the original high resolution audio here. Maybe it was sample-rate converted.

Basically the storyline goes like this: After a long time, the Saint of Gambling (aka Chow Yuen Fat) has been the #1 gambler but now the people want a new gambling hero and so there will be a huge competition in Macao. So a gambler (I honestly don't remeber his name) goes back to his hometown in search of people with magical powers that will win the competition. Well anyways he finds a fat kid (can't remeber the name again, person on cover) that can make things huge by touching it. And so they're off. The dialogue is more funny in Chinese but oh well. It's a funny satire of of serious gambling videos. The ending is probably the funniest in the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharp beyond description.","review":"I'm not sure why, exactly, but the humor that everyone finds to be so uproarious in the book was more subtle and subdued to me (I silently laughed more than I cracked up out loud). Primarily, this is an extremely powerful thing, should completely grip anybody who reads it, and the amazing thing is that it speaks the language of its characters, it's subjects. It shows both that simple language is the best, and that sometimes that same language is not necessarily simple minded. Exposes the true beauty and character of so many things people are ignorant to-this book should be read by anybody associated in any way with education, student or faculty.In a league with satire giants like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Catch 22.

This book is as good today as it was years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reversals And Retrievals","review":"Noise, chatter, broken down classrooms, and a thousand interruptions comprise this abstract, or fragmented, portrayal of an inner city High School's English class. Sylvia Barret, a first year teacher, has been given the task of teaching English to students who are as demanding in their needs as a nestful of chicks. The results are as mixed as the students, but somehow, an intangible thing occurs: learning happens.At first, this book appears dated, but the heart of the story remains intact an condition seems to resist education--if one believes the strict administrators and the burnt-out teachers. But the mystery of an optimistic teacher teaching pessimistic students reverses; smart teachers are the ones who are willing to learn from their students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunately Still Relevant..","review":"I'm not dissing this book;it's just that it's too bad that 30+ years later we still have many of the same problems in our public school systems. This book is both funny and rather scary,especially the eye-opening statistics(sic) the author sprinkles throughout the book.

I got them for free for signing up for a credit card. Therefore, I was surprised to see the model retailed as a midrange player instead of at the low end. Both units worked flawlessly at first. However, despite the retail price, they both eventually started skipping/rattling, which only got worse over time, and eventually they refused to play altogether.Of course it is possible that these two were not representative of the population of all JD-VD135s ever produced, but nevertheless I'm now hesitant to purchase another JWIN.

If you install it under your sink it will surely leak and ruin the cabinets. The management of Sun Water Systems will then only tell you that it is your fault, you have bad water, or some other ridiculous comment. In reality the plastic filter housing is cheap, the threads break, the O-ring is insufficient in size to seal the unit, and the actual water quality is questionable, as evidenced by the solid scale that builds up around the faucet and the water test that produced the same results from unfiltered city water as the filtered water from the under sink unit. Bad choice for us. We invested in a RO unit with a local service team, higher specs and a proven track record of reliability. We now have to replace our sink cabinet from the damage..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems","review":"Filters are much more difficult to install than I think they should be, unit consistently breaks or has a problem every few months. The white plastic filter housing has broken twice (see photo) and I've had to replace the faucet/dispenser at least once because it constantly dripped or even poured. I am now on hold to get another part since I am a \\"Water 4 Life\\" subscriber for about $100 year - which includes two filter changes and warranty. Eventually I will probably spend the time and money to get a better unit.UPDATE 2008-11-29: After the water filter housing broke a third time, I requested that they send me another one for free which they did (no shipping charge) (I am a Water4Life customer). They seem to have redesigned this part so hopefully it will not break again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - short filter life","review":"Don't waste your money on this unit! Filters last for only 3 months (not the specified 6 months) before the water flow slows to a trickle. Aquasana blamed sediment in New York City water, but installing their pre-filter did not improve performance, and I have to change the prefilter every 2 weeks.After a few months, the plastic housing blew apart. While Aquasana did replace it free, I had to spend time installing the new unit.The faucet they supply is cheaply made. It's supposed to have a continuous flow when the handle is in the up position, but it no longer stays in that position. We have to use a rubber band to hold the faucet open for continuous flow.The covers to the filter chambers tighten up between filter changings, so I have to use a socket wrench to loosen them to change the filter.All-in-all, this filter has been an infuriating disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad leaks over 3 years","review":"After three years, we have had it with Sun Water Systems (the maker of Aquasana). The problems are the same as those of numerous reviewers: The housing has broken and leaked six times in three years. The O rings don't fit properly. The plastic seems mis-molded. The faucet leaks.For a while Sun Water Systems kept sending us free housings to replace the cracked ones. Then they said they had a new design to fix the problem; but the problem persists. Our water pressure is fine and we installed it carefully. Yet the housing keeps cracking--causing major leaks under the sink--and now Sun wants to charge us for replacing their poor engineering.We'll switch to something better, even if it costs more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined Kitchen Cabinets","review":"I owned this product for 4 years. After the third cracked housing (the crack was in the threads of the outlet filter housing; water pressure was not a factor, we decreased the water flow to the filter) and kitchen flooding, I emailed the company. All I received was a sarcastic reply \\"sorry you had soo many problems.\\" Now I have to replace or try to refinish my custom-made cabinets. Currently I'm looking for a new filter system.

I installed (under counter) myselfand had no trouble. Connections are very simple (too simple?) you just push hoses into recepticals. You cannot connect to your ice maker for filtered water to refrig. Our water out here in the country has a mineral taste, somewhat salty. We had a RO system that just broke down (4 years old it took all mineral taste out of water. I am trying this system to retain some minerals in the water, however it does not improve the taste of our water much. Maybe 40% better. So just know that compared to RO your water will taste much more like straight tap water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed after 2 years of use","review":"I did some research before chosing this unit - although it is hard to find reputable and unbiased info on the web the Aquasana system seemed to have a good reputation. I would agree with other reviewers that the system seems flimsy; although I haven't had any parts break, I had trouble getting replacement cartridges to fit without leaking. I also have had problems with the dispenser dribbling and running on for a while after use.My biggest issue is perhaps not the fault of the unit, but the water tastes weird if it sits around in a glass for a couple of hours after being dispensed. Not sure if this is due to my water supply or to the water filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Materials","review":"I had to post this because of the problems I've had with the quality of the product. I've had problems with the threads on the housing caps breaking and the housings themselves breaking. I've gone through several of each in a couple of years time even with being careful about water pressure and tightening of the threads. The people I've talked to at the company have been ok to deal with but this is just annoying. My shower filter from them just broke as well. I've ordered a system from someone else that uses stronger 10 inch filter housings and standard 10 inch filters which are cheaper in the long run as you're not locked into a proprietary system.

If you get it to work the water tastes great but it is poorly designed and will break sooner than later. Their customer service is about selling more product and not helpful at all. I am stuck with new filters and a housing that gushes water from the bottom making it totally useless. Aquasana recommended new filters for the fix when they obviously knew it was a housing problem.

We were annoyed because we didn't just have to buy a new filter, we had to replace the whole unit except for the plastic housing, and we had to pay for it. 6 months later the replacement cracked.

They really didn't save any money.All in all, I commend Texas Instruments for continuing to make an all-solar calculator as opposed to those so-called \\"two-way power\\" and \\"battery back-up\\" \\"solar\\" calculators, which in my view only serve to keep button battery companies rich. As an electrical engineer, I can say that no scientific calculator ever really needs to be designed for battery use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"The calculator I received wasn't the machine the company listed in the photo. I'm extremely disappointed with this sale, this is one of the pitfalls with Internet sales!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Calculator","review":"I love this calculator. I switched from the TI-30. Very easy to use. Buttons were pretty much in the same spot. I only have two complaints:Solar power - if the lighting is inadequate it can take ~10 seconds just for it to turn on. I literally have to hold it facing directly at the light source. In a classroom or well lit room, no problem. Never had any problems with the TI-30.Memory - Storing and Recalling is the same. The only problem I have is the ON button. On the TI-30, you can press CLR or ON and your memory will not be deleted. Sometimes I use the \\"ON\\" button to clear out any calculations. My memory is still there. On the TI-36x, if you hit the ON button, it clears all your memory. Sometimes I forget (used to clearing with the ON button) and I end up deleting the numbers I stored.Minor complaint: I miss the sliding case of the TI-30. I don't even bother snapping the case on the back when I'm using this calculator.Overall great calculator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough for the PE Exam","review":"As one of the \\"official seven\\" calculators now allowed on the PE exam, this inexpensive calculator was all I needed (civil exam, anyway). As a former die-hard HP fan, it took some retraining to \\"un-RPN\\" my fingers, but lots of practice problems using the calculator that I would be using on the test and I was OK. The display is clear and readable, the solar panel powers the calculator with just the light from a computer monitor. Bottom line: a good calculator and a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"solar power alone doesn't cut it","review":"Bought this calc because usually TI makes a good product. Had to return it because the solar power just doesn't cut it - unless you are in a VERY well-lit room, forget it... my chemistry class has decent lighting, and it still barely works there... save some frustration and get a dual power - you don't want to be taking a test and have this thing fade out on you. Still like TI calculators all around, just avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"correction of other review","review":"Please note the letters are not inteded for alphanumeric functions.

Not an optimal ingredient, as we are learning. The other ingredients are eh, so so. They taste fine, a bit sweet, but edible. There are 3 grams of protein in each bar, 140 calories, and each bar weighs 1.2 ounces. That is about 4 bites worth for most adults, probably average for these kinds of \\"grocery store\\" bars.

I had high hopes for this bar, given the promise of fruit and nuts, which is reinforced by the packaging that prominently features pictures of raisins, almonds, peanuts and cranberries. Opening the package is the first of the disappointments. The primary ingredient is oats, followed closely by corn syrup. Tiny specks of cranberry, raisin and almond, with a few peanut chunks. The flavor is very sweet with a bitter aftertaste. This is not a product I would recommend or choose to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of fruits or nuts","review":"Too sweet to my taste, the picture shows a lot more fruits and nuts that the bar actually has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great price, great taste","review":"I don't know why other people were complaining about it being too hard.

My only problems is that it gets a bit sticky on my hands, but besides that, best granola bars ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"This bar is better than I thought it would be. When I saw that they put cranberries in it, I thought the cranberry taste would be a little bit too much. However, they put the right amount in it to make it perfect. This has everything you may expect in a trail bar. I can eat this as a breakfast snack or at any other meal time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bars!","review":"Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars are a fruit & nut lover's delight! I especially like the dates and almonds. Yummy! And, the bar is only 140 calories to boot! The peanuts and cranberrys seem to be lightly included, but the amount of sweetness is just right! Only 1g of fiber, so it definitely is not a good source for that. If you want a crewy, delicious bar which can serve as an in-between meal treat and love dates and almonds, you will love these bars, too. Nature Valley states these bars are 100% natural. I know only that they taste great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big improvement for Nature Valley","review":"I was not a big fan of Nature Valley's healthy granola type bars, but this new bar is very different from their other products.

I think this product and I think it is a great buy for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet and chewy, but largely empty carbohydrates","review":"The good news is that these bars taste good and have a pleasing texture. They don't have a lot of calories -- just 140 per bar -- but the bar is on the small side.I doubt I would order these again, despite them being enjoyable to eat. The problem is that there just isn't much nutrition in these bars beyond the carbohydrates (sugars). Only 3 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber per bar. As long as you understand that you're going to be eating something that derives over 70% of its calories from carbs, you might enjoy this snack. I would recommend a more protein dense bar, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bars recently changed and are much worse!!","review":"Shame on Nature Valley for trying to pull the wool over our eyes! If you were a fan of these bars when they first came out, then be warned. The recipe has changed and the bars are much different and NOT for the better. Not only are they much smaller, they also contain far fewer nuts/fruit and the bar itself now has an airier consistency like the Rice Krispie's treat.How do I know all this? I bought these bars on a regular basis from Costco and still had some leftover bars from the first batch and I was able to compare them side by side. These were always my favorite hiking snack and now they aren't much better than every other bar out there. I think Nature Valley will quickly regret its decision once they realize that their are a lot of unhappy customers. I'd gladly pay a little extra if it meant keeping the bars the way they were.If you don't believe me then by all means buy them and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's trail mix in bar form really, and Nature Valley has that right","review":"Nature Valley has a pretty wide variety of granola bars to offer, but I've never had a chewy bar of their's until I had this Trail Mix kind. Mixed (although mostly positive) results ensued...Fruit, good. Nuts, good. Chewy, not that great. The consistency is quite sticky, and frankly a bit tough on your teeth. You shouldn't have to channel the force of a shark's bite to enjoy a granola bar.Consistency aside, the flavor is great. It has raisin and cranberry fruitiness to pair with almond and peanut nuttiness. And of course there are oats and rice. The fruit flavors aren't overly sweet and it's not like you're eating a handful of nuts either. It's trail mix in bar form really, and Nature Valley has that right. And with 25 grams of carbohydrates and 14 grams of sugar per bar, these would be good for outdoor activities demanding energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly false advertising","review":"I had my hopes for this bar. The box reads \\"Fruit & Nut - Almond, Raisin, Peanut, and Cranberry\\", but after taking my first bite, I was surprised by the actual ingredients. The first two ingredients in the nutritional information are Oats and High Maltose Corn Syrup. This is not a fruit and nut bar. It is a grain bar with some fruit and nuts sprinkled in. There are far better products, including ones with almonds and fruits as the main ingredients, and with honey sticking the ingredients together instead of a boat load of corn syrup. I am completely dissatisfied and amazon doesn't offer returns on this product so save yourself some money and buy a better bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Big and Fading Quality","review":"I had a wonderful size small of this slide years ago until it shattered from a fall on a ceramic floor.

While this was a good read, I had the feeling that he had a deadline to reach and pushed too fast.Still, a bad Barry book is still much better than a good anybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-live your elementary school American History education!","review":"Re-live it, and this time around, have a heck of a lot more laughs! Barry delivers a biting satire of your American History book, complete with hysterically funny comprehension questions and diorama project assignments at the end of each chapter. I will never think of the Hawley-Smoot tariff the same again.The better you know your American history, the funnier this book is. It brought back lots of memories of class for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great twist on the facts and faces of American History","review":"Dave Barry Slept Here is the most hillarious interpretation of American History I have ever read. The simple way he distorts facts, and comically labels major figures from the past like King George III are great. Probably one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. For anyone who knows a lot about American History, this is the difinitive book to read. I do think that if you do not know that much about American History, you will still find the book amusing, but not nearly as humorous as I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling in the isles","review":"This is the most hilarious book I've ever read, and any one who has ever laughed should own it. But even if you don't buy this book, you should stop by...where you can read his weekly column."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy buttons, mediocre screen","review":"I have always loved TI calculators, but the buttons on this calculator are too hard to press. Sometimes it feels like you pressed the number, but it does not register on the screen. It does not happen too often, but it is often enough that you have to constantly look at the screen while you are entering numbers just to make sure they registered.The screen is also a little washed out. After cursing my new TI-30X IIS a number of times, I bought aCasio FX-300MS Plus 229-Function Scientific Calculator, and what a difference! The buttons always register, and the screen has great contrast. Unfortunately, my days of trusting TI calculators are over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger than I like.","review":"What the title say, it's a mini version of a TI-83/84, just a bit smaller. I prefer a smaller one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn it with fire....","review":"set it alight and let it fly. Oh scratch that reverse the car over it, I'm allergic to burning polymers. I'll keep it brief. I hate this calculator. It fails to follow order of operations. Hate this calculator. I am ordering a different one today. I will not go grovel to professor again about my work showing one thing but the calculator did what it wanted.Burn baby burn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I initially bought this calculator because it was a suggestion for my program and many other kids owned it. Since the day I got it I couldn't wait to smash it to pieces once I got something better. If you type at even an average rate the thing will not register your input. This forced me to type with one hand to avoid this problem, which really slowed down my pace. Because of this I failed many questions that I would otherwise of gotten right. I also detest how \\"ans\\" and other commands are under second function when other useless commands are in easy to access spots. Overall, this calculator is a piece of junk, there are many other calculators for cheaper prices which actually do what they're supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage-very slow in accepting keystrokes","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.I am not a very fast typer but this calculator is too slow and does not accept the keystrokes if not enough time is given in-between the key strokes.Hence I almost always mess up the calculation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done.","review":"Needed this for my pre calc class since we are not allowed to use our graphing calculators. It does what it says, no complaints except that the buttons a a little wobbly and don't register easily at times. So be careful during exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the reviews! Buy the newer model!","review":"This calculator is okay.The Good: The key layout is familiar, it has high functionality, it is rugged and long lasting.The REALLY Bad: Precision is key on a calculator, one wrong stroke can make the difference between shooting the moon and crashing a satellite, so to speak. If you type too quickly on this calculator it will skip entries and only log the ones it catches. This problem is compounded by the fact the characters on the screen are very large, so the screen can only hold so much of a operation on the screen at a time. This makes it time consuming to check for errors.The Ugly: I hate plugging other products in reviews, but the other 2 star ratings are right. If you want the familiar layout, the functionality, the rugged construction, and precise key entry, get a newer model of the TI-30 series. This calculator is fine for homework and leisure calculations, but in a time crunched test it will end up becoming a test of your patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"TI calculator","review":"this is a good product especially if you know how to use a calculator. It will get you through your 5th-8th grade math courses and some high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible button design","review":"Only bought this because my university requires this type of calculator. The buttons are extremely hard to use. You have to press very hard to make sure the number/operator is selected."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this calculator replace a TI-30x I had broken","review":"I thought this would be exactly the same as the TI 30X I was replacing. It is not. This thing is a piece of junk. I guess Texas Inst. decided to cut cost and quality.You have to press the buttons two or three times for every keystroke and ensure that the calculator detected your input. This HUGE bug makes the calculator completely worthless. I've had free calculators that work better than this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is fun!!!!","review":"I like this calculator a lot. I had an old TI 30 (1992) and it just died regardless of new batteries. This calculator has nice features and it works great. The only thing I have not figured out yet is how to calculate mean, mode, and std. dev. on it. Othere than that, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific Calculator","review":"Just a regular scientific calculator, I personally prefer Texas Instrument products over the other calculator brands as I find them easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the buttons on this calculator!","review":"I had to get this calculator for a professional engineers' exam (it was one of 4 approved calculators to take into the test). I've been using it to study and HATE how difficult the buttons are to press. I'm quite speedy on my Texas Instruments TI-82 but this one is painfully rigid. I originally thought it was a good idea to go with an approved calculator that resembled by TI-82 to most so I wouldn't have to relearn where all the functions are. Now, I'm second-guessing that decision and hope I'm not too fast on it during the exam so that I don't come up with wrong answers. My fingers are crossed but I really do not like this calculator so far... if you have a choice, go with another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"keys not responsive","review":"When I try to type quickly on this calculator, I often find there are missed keys(not wrong keys, but skipped). It gets pretty annoying if you use it regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to double check your inputs. I hate this calculator, too!","review":"This calculator bounces every time I press a button. I always have to check what I entered and even double check the problem. It takes almost twice the time to solve problems than using a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"this calculator is horrible. it takes a second for the keys to register, which really slowed me down, this can also cause mistakes, which healthee said, so if you don't go slow, you'll mess up. Also, it takes a lot longer than a better calculator to perform an operation. It doesn't have as many functions as a calculator for $2.50 more (link at end). The ONLY good thing about this is that it's light, but thats because it doesn't have all the good in it. BuyTI-30XS Multiview Calculatorinstead, its a much better calculator. DO NOT BUY ThIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing commas as separators","review":"I have the TI 30X-IIS, a nice dual power, 2 line calculator. It has one feature missing, the fraction bar key, that another TI has. Other than that, pretty much the perfect machine for me... except it does not use a comma in numbers to separate the thousands place: it displays ten-thousand as 10000 instead of my preference 10,000I know, most people probably do not care, I must have some kind of dyslexia because when I see 4589339 I have no idea what that is, as compared to 4,589,339 which I instantly recognized as 4 million, 5 hundred thousand,etc.I'm looking around for another calc, one that has a 2 line display, that works with fractions and decimal conversions, the basic stuff, AND displays numbers with the lil' comma.
