Just when I think I know their music well, they continue to evolve and grow to levels that totally amaze me. Aaron Lewis' voice is without a doubt one of the best in rock music ever. His talents as a singer and song writer are totally mesmerizing and combined with the instrumentals, the sound is both haunting and intensely beautiful. Anyone thinking of purchasing this album should do so. Their music will be around forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind covered TOOL!","review":"This is a special message for Staind, not its fans. Dear Staind, I alwayse thought you were a average modern day band. Singing about sad stuff, and crying. But once I heard you covered TOOL, I threw my stereo across the room in rage. The fact that you took a very good Prog metal song and turned it into a slow, depressing song disgusts me. I think I speak for all the metal heads out there when I say Leave our Music alone. Just because you wish you could make music like that doenst mean you should cover it! If this message makes you teary eyed, go home and cry to your mommy then. If you cant play like the big boys then dont play at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"This CD is perfect for any Staind fan as well as anyone that just likes great music.

I just like the music and that is what we listen to it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick up if you are new, add if you are an old timer!!!","review":"This greatest hits really does do a good job on covering the span of Staind's career, getting some of the radio single hits, and utilizing most of the CD (16 tracks, mine has 18 with 2 bonus tracks from a chain store). This has all the hits like mudshovel, home, epiphany, outside, ect...but adds bonuses like Comfortably Numb (pink floyd cover, Sober (tool cover), schizophrenic conversations, and Nutshell (Alice in Chains cover). I can't give it five stars because it doesn't have songs like JUST GO on it, or a few of the others. Worth picking up, especially for a new fan.

Intead of focusing on explaining rake and how to select frames or actually chopping a bike, the book is filled with links and names of places to purchase parts ( I have the Internet for that). IMO, the book should be called how to sell a chopper! It's all advertisment. The history of choppers is more about explaining who sells what and of course including a link to their web site.

The section on his love/obsession for Ngbali alternatly leaves you wishing he would succeed,scream exploitation and wondering if he really thought he wasn't being used.

It doesn't have much else though. It's one of those movies where there is at least one scene in which everything can be solved if everyone didn't keep their mouth shut. The script isn't the biggest problem though because there are some great gags (how Pesci can't get any sleep for example) and some good scenes (like when Pesci holds up 2 fingures 50 ft away from a witness with eyeglasses) but these scenes belong to Pesci and not to the writers.

Joe Pesci turns his hand (and turns it well) to a comedic role, with just enough anger still in his little body for you to half-think he'll chop someone up and place them in the trunk of his car. Tomei's acting was solid if perhaps not Oscar quality and the supporting cast was well chosen.And so yeah ok you could pour a bucket of grits through the plot (for example, if Vinny knows Lisa can provide the correct answer vis-a-vis the car tires, Vinny must have known the answer anyway).

It includes one of Pesci's best roles--and certainly his best comedy--also oscar winning work by Marisa Tomei and career topping performances by late character actors Fred Gwynne and Lane Smith. It's a near perfect script with seamless flow from one classic comedy set piece to another: I wouldn't cut out any scene or a single line of dialogue--it's all wonderfully done.

Unlike some comedies, this one doesn't resort to crude jokes or behavior for laughs - which is very refreshing to me. It's rated \\"R\\" for language, and there's no nudity or suggestive scenes. Joe Pesci plays a real likeable character who grew on me throughout the movie. In fact, I found all of the characters to be likeable.The blu-ray version is really good quality, IMO.

The author does not address, however, how much fun it is to live with HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, Alcoholism, or any other complications that arise from living such an irresponsible lifestyle.Folks, be yourselves.

Lacan and Freud would be surprised to see how their works were so consitently revisited"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Ibiza is worth the purchase","review":"If your a big fan of club music then this is a DVD worth purchasing. The DVD shows almost like a travel Documentary in that it takes you on a tour all over the island. Different clubs have been assigned different songs so each song is a preview of a club on the island. The highlight might have to be sunset at Cafe del Mar which really hits the mark.If you're planning on traveling to Ibiza or are interested in the Island and love house, trance and techno, pick this DVD up... It is great to throw in and just relax to. Also, there isn't too much nudity, but some people's clubing outfits are, how shall I put it, somewhat revealing :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.

I wish my mother had bought it for me when I was much younger, since I had many misconceptions about what a period was! A very subtle yet readable book, without \\"gross\\" pictures (has simple sketches instead). I also like that it doesn't talk down to young girls as if they're \\"just kids\\"; has a very respectful, reassuring tone that delivers what you need to know about your period when you're in middle school or junior high.

The arrangements are lean and powerful, and Paul Kossoff's sparse, muscular riffs leave plenty of room for drummer Simon Kirke's thumping backbeat to breathe.A great, six-minute rendition of the classic \\"All Right Now\\" opens the set, but almost every song is a highlight, actually, from the slow, bluesy ballad \\"Be My Friend\\" to the superb, swaggering blues-rock of \\"Ride On A Pony\\" and \\"Mr Big\\".Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled with this case","review":"I bought this case so that it would protect my new ipod classic, and for the belt clip.The case itself is OK, however the \\"cushioning\\" inside is about the thickness of a piece of paper, so I don't really see how it cushions. IMHO, the case will protect the ipod from minor scratches and dents (not on the video screen though) but not more than that.The belt clip is a swivel clip so the ipod moves around like crazy. The clip itself is also very weak and will slip off of what it is clipped to. It actually slipped off and dropped in the first 15 minutes I used it. All I did was sit down, and boom, the ipod dropped and hit the floor. My old belt clip that I used with my Mini, never did this. Once it was clipped, it was clipped, and it never fell off or moved around, even when running.Very disappointing.

Well, in a small living room with a TV, you have to look at your furniture's function! I am sure she has a lot of natural talent and her rooms probably look nice--but that doesn't translate to paper here.

Also, most of the groupings did not seem to allow for comfortable passageways for people to get from one end of the room to the other--the rooms were overcrowded with furniture.I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it.

Only one idea seemed fresh to me, and that was of patterning lighting sources in a room in a triangle format. All other pages were good ideas, but same, same, same as what everyone else is doing.

The dustjacket review compares Shahar to Proust. There is truth in this, in that Shahar weaves a narrative from remembrances and images, and then reweaves them from other angles. Myself, I'm more of a Musil or Oz or Rilke person. I like introspection. I want to know what characters are thinking, and what deep thoughts the author has on the world and our experience of it.

Perhaps they build to a symphony, but I was left wanting more, not satisfied with recollections, even if Proustian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny little book after all these years","review":"Odd that it is out of print and selling for silly prices used.

Another movie you wouldn't want to watch too frequently, due to its gruesome honesty and the fact that the images are burned into your brain.Excellent soundtrack from David Bowie, including live concert footage.

Except for a couple of mildly interesting but inconsequential points, the presenter (Pearl Jr.) offers nothing but baseless innuendoes, tabloid gossip, and huge leaps of logic to make her case that Michael Jackson is still alive. Here's an example: MJ said he would end up like Elvis, so that obviously means he faked his death. That's actually one of Pearl Jr.'s better arguments. The woman actually cites the Weekly World News as one of her sources - that tells you everything you need to know about her journalistic credentials and integrity. I could see somebody uploading something like this to YouTube, but selling this tripe as a bona fide documentary is just plain wrong.

They are clearly members of Pear Jr.'s production team or perhaps pathetically Pearl Jr. herself. This is horrible horrible documentary. My first year project at film school was edited better than this. It is tough to say but I don't think I have seen worse student films than that. Pearl jr. is clearly an idiot. All these 5 star reviews found Pearls arguments compelling but fail to mention even one convincing argument, probably because there are none to be found. At best this documentary proves that Michael Jackson was not planning on dying. What a shock! Reminds me of everyone else in this flippin world. I remember when my grandmother told me she wanted to come visit me next summer, but then she died. Or did she? This \\"Doc\\" also proves that a Michael Jackson fan will do anything to make a fool of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm","review":"There are some interesting points in this movie, but they are over shadowed by the distracting narration and morbid music. Oh, and the complete lack of factual basis.A few good parts that make you go \\"Hmm...\\". Maybe there was something wierd going on with his death, or the body. But, mostly it's alot of stretching and quotes taken out of context. Worth watching, if only to confirm the fact that Michael Jackson is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"So helpful!","review":"This movie was very helpful in explaining the evidence to support michael being alive. I have been researching this for over two years and it's difficult to explain sometimes to someone who is not familiar with the facts surrounding the hoax evidence. Pearl Jr. does an amazing job presenting the most crucial evidence in a comprehensive, chronological way. My roommate has been asking questions and she looks at me like what I've just said goes way over her head sometimes. This documentary explains it beautifully. I want to thank Pearl for her hard work and dedication in presenting this evidence so clearly. If you are a believer, or even if you aren't, this movie lays out the evidence in such a way that it is easily understandable. I feel that it's a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Looking Forward To That Day","review":"I Just Watched My New Dvd... Alive! Is Michael Jackson Really Dead? I Love it!

At the beginning, I was certain I knew the truth. But the host's tactic of asking questions about innocuous things and then quickly moving on to ask questions about other subjects begins to weigh on the viewer. By the end, the sheer number of questions was overwhelming, even though each individual question would have had a good, logical explanation had the host bothered to look up the answers. Why was one of Jackson's sisters wearing white? Why were his brothers smiling in one undated picture? Why did Jackson talk about getting away from the press? Why did Joe Jackson talk about himself in a Larry King interview? And why is there an undated publicity still of Michael looking through the lens of a camera? It all adds up to one thing ... murder!Also, Michael Jackson has been living with me for the last couple weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Lonely Planet for travelling in the US","review":"I took several Lonely Planet guide books with me on a 6-week drive across the US, and I'm very glad I did. The *regional* volumes (Lonely Planet Southwest, Lonely Planet Deep South, and Lonely Planet California & Nevada in particular) pointed me to some interesting little spots that I never would have found on my own or with a more traditional guidebook -- small-town festivals, outstanding small museums, breathtaking spots in national parks that the tour buses don't visit, fun alterative driving routes through the mountains.I also brought along this book, thinking it would be useful for the areas not covered in my other books. It wasn't. The entries for each city are so short that all it really offers is a brief history, the major tourist attractions and a couple of (often outdated) hotel/restaurant recommendatations.I highly recommend the regional Lonely Planet guidebooks for US travel, but don't bother buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"New edition is better","review":"I just wanted to point out that most of these poor reviews are based on the first edition.

However, I will not rate it high. Its \\"updated information\\" is more or less superficial. Except for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, there is no grounded addition or remarkable improvement over the last edition. I was disappointed to observe that most other updatable facts and figures remained unchanged. Anyone who already has the previous edition shouldn't consider buying this one.

I love the work and own recordings by Slatkin, Boult, and Mackerras. As a performance the Davis certainly impresses, but the recording quality of my copy does not reflect the praise showered by other reviewers of this CD. In the first movement the left channel has an intermittent rasp in the strings that sounds like some sort of acoustical problem with the recording venue. The Adagio is marred by audible conversations, I assume from the audience, and the finale is punctuated by what sound like noisemakers from the hall. I'd buy a studio recording by this ensemble, but I cannot recommend the recording I received. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reads from a supburb author","review":"My aunt was a volunteer at a public library in New Smyrna Beach Florida several years ago, and she told me about the Lillian Jackson Braun book series \\"The Cat Who.....\\".

You will find yourself reaching for the next book in the series as soon as you finish the last one. I recommend that you try to read them in order.

The Cat Who Sang For the Birds was the first new book in the series to come out after I had begun reading the series. Therefore, it was all rather fresh to me, and I found both the book and the style quite interesting. I think part of what makes this series so great is that it's not so much murder mystery as a nice, well-connected tale. The Pennant Race (spelling bee) is a nice extra, and so are some of Qwill's pursuits. On further reading of the book, after reading some of the others, I find that it could be more interesting and exciting. The humor however is there, and so are the cats! Let the cats live on forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"This is a wonderful read! Anyone who like cats will really enjoy Lilian's books. I have read this book and \\"The Cat Who Tailed a Thief\\" and I've enjoyed them both. I can't wait to obtain ALL Lilian Jackson Braun's books about these wonderful cats!The main reasons I like these books are 1) I like adventures and mysteries concerning animals and 2) The way she makes KoKo so mystical and wise makes me realize I'm not the only person who believes cats DO have some kind of unworldly knowledge. Thank you Lilian Jackson Braun!I just wish I didn't have to wait for her books to get on the clearance rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Introduction to \\"The Cat Who\\" Books","review":"This is my first \\"Cat Who\\" book, and I must say I was disappointed. There didn't seem to be much of a plot and there was no really no character build-up. There was no remorse over the 'Butterfly Girl' because we never really got to know her and the rogue boyfriend didn't seem to fit with any of the rest of the book. The cats were mentioned very little and the 'psychic' powers of Koko - while interesting - were more than implausible with the 'WEST' deductions.All-in-All it was an \\"I must finish this book because I paid for it.\\" experience. Based on the comments of other reviewers - this was not Braun's best - So I may still give one of the earlier books a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Sang For The Birds has hit a wrong note.","review":"This current book of MS Braun's is different from her past works. This endeavor has a different feel to it. There is a dark and brooding mood. Gone are the older characters that imparted the charming small town feeling. The bantering between Polly and Quill is missing, as are the cats. Though they do make an appreance, most of the cat in The CAT Who.. is absent. Gone also, is the humor. If you had to skip one book in the series, this would be the one. It does not continue the story line in the old familary way.

It is difficult to tell the backdrop from the foreground of the story, the backdrop of Moose county occupies much more time than the foreground, though it is interwoven. Qwill seems to follow the mystery much more than participate in it and the background characters have much more appeal than those intimately involved with the mystery, the primary of which we only meet briefly or know of through the accounts of others. This makes it difficult to really care about their fate, and thus the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Return Of The Jedi Picture Plaque Framed","review":"Very nice quality picture and frame.

For ESPN to make money off this low quality DVD says a lot about what they think of consumers. At least I got it at a low price from Target on-line. Now they have taken it down from their website. They were probably embarresed to have their name associated with something that looks like it was copied from a VHS tape to DVD. Yes the quality is that bad.

I'm not expecting Blu-Ray true high-def obviously, but they could have at least down-sampled the HD broadcast to anamorphic widescreen and with a better compression algorithm. It looks like an amateur YouTube production made with Windows Movie Maker. Oh, and you CAN play the entire game, it's just not obvious how: when you get to the menu screen, instead of selecting a quarter, press the \\"menu\\" button on your remote instead. I had to decompile the UOPS script to discover that, since I could see Title 1 on the disc but couldn't figure out how to play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Do Not Buy.","review":"The quality of this DVD is truly awful. It is grainy and the colors are washed out. ESPN must have hired a crew of blindfolded monkeys to produce this one. The other BCS game DVDs I own look very good and professionally produced. Looks like someone videotaped the game off a standard definition broadcast, and burned it with a bad quality DVD burner. I did not even get though a whole quarter, so I can't comment on being unable to watch the whole game. Like the review before mine, I thankfully have a DVR copy that I will burn myself.

The down side is that sometimes it turns my pda on in the middle of the night, i don't know why, maybe I have something set wrong, but it's not that big of a deal.

Aside from the setting, I didn't think much of the characters or the whole fantasy/fairy tale angle. It came off more pretentious than whimsical and more forced than honestly weird or controversial. But, again, I didn't hate it. I just keep thinking of Joi Brozek's Sleeveless and how much more honest and compelling a hip young adult work of alternative reality than this could ever be.

What's left, once the sound and fury of her peculiar way of telling a story ends, is...not much. Not much in the way of character, not much in the way of characters acting believably, not much in the way of characters having voices...not much in general. Readers seeking a novel of style in the same fairy tale mold are urged to consider William Goldman's THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Believe me, I am in favor of edgy material: I loved TRAINSPOTTING and SMACK. But this? I shrug my shoulders and say, who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Batty for Weetzie Bat","review":"A quick, breezy read that made me feel like I'd just entered a parallel universe of kookiness, creativity, love and independence. The novella reads like a dream and I was instantly sucked into the glamour, fantasy, and surreal exploits of these loveable characters. There are heavy moments and serious issues tackled from death to abandonment and single parenting, but Block tackles it all with such love and optimism. Optimism can sometimes feel saccharine and forced, but she handles it so perfectly. I want to live in the world she has created!Weetzie Bat is definitely not for everyone, but an ideal read for dreamy romantic teens with a penchant for vintage threads, palm trees, apple pie and surfing. I could read this book again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"weetzie bat is sweet and salty; the best of both worlds.","review":"weetzie bat makes your spine tingle and your body shiver indelight. it's willy wonka and pixie dust. this book isangel food cake, glitter, and kindergarten paste. it is thesmell of clean sheets and the feel of sleeping in on springmornings; of wearing flannel, and of freshly baked buscuitsand hot tea. its the word \\"lovely\\" come alive andswallowing you whole. this book is a giant lollipop ofrainbow imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing look at the psyche of a party girl in L.A.","review":"This was certainly an interesting approach. Fun to read, but the frankness ofsome of the content may shock some. I do recommend it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm not \\"sophisticated\\" enough","review":"The reviewers can rave about Block's magical prose all they like, but I just didn't like the book. Maybe I'm just too long past my teens, but I found no warmth in the relationships here. It all seems to be trying too hard. Providing fiction for different readers shouldn't mean we have to pander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over-rated.","review":"Supposedly this book is transcendant, according to the quote from the New York Times on the back. I do agree that it's original, which is about the only good thing I can say about it.I think it's trying to be all stylistic and symbolic and thereby meaningful, but it just ends up as far too stupid and simplistic. I wasn't moved; I was annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is absolutely ridiculous.","review":"This is the most unrealistic young adult novel I have ever read. As a future English teacher, there is NO WAY I would ever recommend it to students. The characters are reckless and ridiculously naive, and Block does not present any realistic consequences for their bizarre actions. If any \\"family\\" can actually relate to this novel I feel very sorry for them, as Weetzie and her pals live in an insane world."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER","review":"This is truly the best book ever, all of the characters are amazing, and their passion for life is infectious. Very meaningful, and sad, and happy all at the same time. If you haven't read this, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books ever!","review":"Francesca Lia Block's Weetzie Bat will always be one of my favorite books. Technically it is in the YA genre, but it's a great read for any age. Block combines magical surrealism with dynamic characters in an urban, Los Angeles setting to create a timeless modern fairy tale. There is a reason why people still turn to this book 20 years after its original publication. Francesca Lia Block knows how to articulate human emotions in a way that very few writers can accomplish so elegantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic","review":"I remember getting into Francesca Lia Block's books when I was younger and my opinion has not changed since: She knows how to write. She knows how to describe things poetically and vividly. Her books, including this one, are always so lyrical in descriptions. I would say to the person who said this book is for anyone who knows they are different and thinks that it is absolutely okay, I agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy it..","review":"After seeing how many people liked this book on Amazon, I went to the library to check it out. From the beginning I thought it was weird, and it didn't get any better. I may have enjoyed this as an 8 year old, but this book was way too unrealistic for me. Any book where there's a genie in a bottle isn't something I want to read. I found this book a waste of time, annoying, and I didn't learn anything from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Unremarkable","review":"I'd heard lots of things about this book, that it was controversial, that it was great and a must read. So I decided to finally check it out. I read it in one sitting, but that wasn't because I was really interested in it. The writing style was very simple and done in a weird-to-be-weird way.The character of Weetzie Bat herself was likeable enough, but I just was left unimpressed by the story and the writing style. I won't be reading any more books in the series and I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone else either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash.","review":"The author tries (but fails) to make up for the absolute nonsense that occurs in this book with verbose descriptions and imagery. There's no fluidity between events; everything happens \\"just because the author says so\\". There's no reason behind anything that happens in this book. In an attempt to make it seem like it actually has a message, one of the homosexual characters gets AIDS but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was horrendous","review":"The only reason I finished the book was because I had to do it for a Y.A. literature class. There was no substance to the book. The characters were shallow, unreal, immoral, and ridiculous (from their names to their actions). The writing in this book was so superficial, I couldn't even try to get to know them well enough so that I could love them or hate them. I was absolutely indifferent to them, except for the fact that what was being described was so immoral. I wouldn't want any teen to use these characters as a role model. If I could ban this book, I probably would."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BOOK!","review":"I am 13 years old and i am in a mother-daughter book group.

Utley is an accomplished and prolific writer of the US Western experience. This may be his best work. He brings the Sioux holy man to life as a complete person that the readers can meet and understand. The fact that Utley has a thorough command of the historical events that surround Sitting Bull makes this complete work of history and biography.

Poor, difficult to read mapping (like white roads on very light gray background), plenty of empty space, no small roads, no coordinates grid, no relief shading or coloring, only limited amount of interesting places marked on the maps etc. I bought it in hopes I could use it for Africa overland travels, but it is way too limited. Very nice concept but poor implementation. If you only want to drive through \\"highways\\" and are on budget then this atlas may be somewhat useful, but probably Michelin Africa regional maps 741, 745 and 746 at 1:4.000.000 scale are better investment. It contains some maps of national parks and town that may be useful. Southern part of this atlas is advertised as 1:1.000.000 scale, however that does not mean it has more details!

Horrible so far. The time travel was completely laughable. The main character has rebound sex with a handsome Cornish lord in a castle. From the beginning they are completely horny for each other. Not the type of romantic English story I was hoping for. Very disappointing. I am only 1/3 of the way through this nightmare and find myself constantly nodding off and rolling my eyes at this horrible story.

It's a shame but Manowar's pursuit of the loudest metal on Earth has backfired on this live album. The music is so loud (which we all like as Manowar fans) that it completely drowns out the vocals... Maybe it was a error in the recording or something like that but nevertheless I didn't care for the album. I enjoy lyrics and vocals the most when I am listening to music.

The reading section on the actual test has tone and inference questions, whereas these practice tests only ask specific passage questions. The actual DAT has a lot of rate, chance, and algebra questions, whereas these practice tests do not. The actual pat section is harder than the software pat section. The actual exam is sort of formatted badly. It takes up the whole computer screen and the words are big, so it takes more time to read.

As far as I have compared the two versions, I have not encountered any differences in the text between them. So, what the consultant contributed? Are these 'big names' added because the publisher thought Japanese-written French cheese book would not look attractive? I want to hear from the publisher on this. Anyway, this is a great book for cheese lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"French Cheese Book","review":"We read this book in our friends' apartment in Paris.

Reading this reference was enjoyable, and the glossary was the biggest help when reading the Anne Perry novels. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful little book","review":"This is simply one of the most compelling books I've ever read on social history. There are so many things/events/people that I've encountered in Dickens, Hardy, etc. that have now become clear. I can't wait to rush out and purchase my own epergne. A few of the definitions could have used illustrations (probably all of the different types of carriages) and the two maps provided, being close to unreadable, are completely useless, but that's just nit-picking. If you're an American reader of Regency and Victorian novels, you need this book. (I'm not sure how much British readers know about the history of their customs, but it's certainly a worthwhile read for those who don't feel they know enough.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a complete sourcebook but entertaining!","review":"A highly readable if incomplete account of life in 19th century Britain. A word of warning this book should not be taken as a detailed study of the time. Someone seriously researching the subject should probably look elsewhere. That said it offers a fascinating glimpse into various aspects of Regency/Victorian life answering many of the questions any contemporary fan of Dickens, Austen, Gaskell, or Eliot, might have. From the social difference in status conscious 19th century Britain between a vicar and a rector. How someone could actually be found libel for breaking off an engagement. Boarding school politics and even about British holidays and currency. Well worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!","review":"Although this book may be accurate about the time of Charles Dickens, it has many many inaccuracies about Jane Austen's time. Do not take Daniel Poole's word on anything Regency, but double-check.A note to \\"Krista\\" who says that _Pride and Prejudice_ is one of her favorite Victorian novels -- That is ridiculous. Jane Austen died in 1817, 2 years before Victoria was even born and 20 years before she became queen. Jane Austen is a Regency novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential book for anyone who read Victorian novels","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who has read a book by Austin, Dickens or anyone who lived in the 19th century. I always wondered what the rules were regarding balls, country parties and the like. The rules of the various card games and the names of the various maladies and foods have always mystified me and this book helped enormously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use with caution","review":"Not bad, but use with caution. As so many other readers have pointed out, there are a number of careless errors in this book. The distinction between the Regency Period and the Victorian era does get muddled. Considering the broad timespan and variety of topics covered, it's still worth reading, but there are other volumes that you should consult to verify or disprove the many statements. (DICKENS OF LONDON and the DICKENS INDEX would be a good start if you can find them) The section on currency and it's meaning was interesting, but in no way should it be a guide in comparison to modern money. THAT would be a book in it'self. The dictionary in the back also comes in handy, especially when searching for occupations. Now, I will admit my knowledge of Jane Austen is somewhat limited, and I hesitate to recommend any sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Maybe the information might be interesting to some people, but the information wasn't anything you can't find in other better written books."},{"rating":"2","title":"sensational throwback pop rock","review":"I love The Best of Tracey Ullman CD. It's packed with pop masterpieces that bring to mind Blondie meets The Supremes. Ullman combines the edge of 80s British music with the Phil Spector wall of sound vibe and creates a unique style of her own. Many of her cover tunes surpass the original versions. I bought this CD only knowing her hit \\"They Don't Know\\" but every track on here is excellent.

The combination of the sketches of the Indian people with their regalia, villages, and way of life, and the live shots of the country scenes of nature combine into a full picture of how the Indian people lived and thrived during that time. This film starts out with the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492. The narrators inform the viewer of how the Indians lived harmoniously with other. Their kindnesses were taken as weaknesses as Columbus and deSoto tried to systematically destroy them for their jewels, gold, and pearls. This is an excellent historical video and I recommend it to everyone.A good book to read after viewing this historical video is \\"A Trilogy of Poetry, Prose and Thoughts for the Mind, Body and Soul.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Otto is AWESOME!","review":"Finally!

This was a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gray's Anatomy for the Searcher After Symbols","review":"Most books on symbols confine themselves to higher level abstractions such as \\"the lion\\" or \\"mercury\\" or the letters of the alphabet. Liungman's achievement is to create a comprehensive taxonomy for symbols that uses the most basic shapes as building blocks to create ascending chains of meaning. As such, it is an original work of scholarship rather than a gazetteer of common symbols. \\"The Dictionary of Symbols\\" is a gold mine of information for readers interested in graphic design or the \\"semiotics,\\" if I may be allowed to use the term, behind supposedly abstract shapes and designs. Did you ever wonder about the significance of the Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen logos or the three diamonds of the Mitsubishi symbol? Would world history have been different if the Nazi swastika had pointed the other way? These and many other questions of similar nature are knowledgeably and enjoyably explored in this very impressive book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dictionary of Symbols' reach is well beyond its grasp.","review":"While the selection and classification structure of the symbols in the dictionary has much to offer, the actual _descriptions_ of the symbols leave plenty to be desired. The authour seems to come from an astrological background, and the gaps in his knowledge (particularly with respect to electronic, hobo, and non-Christian religious symbols) are evident throughout; especially when seen side-by-side with the verbose coverage of astrological and Judeo-Christian symbols.While the classification scheme is amazing, and very well thought out, the actual content is rather below what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date","review":"This book has its strengths, but it is hopelessly out of date. It is much better to opt for Liungman's 2004 edition, Symbols -- Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms (ISBN 9197270504). It covers a lot more signs, even modern ones such as the At sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big taxanomy, little history","review":"Having already used dozens of books on (visual) symbols, symbolism, and related subjects for my research, I didn't find very much in the way of ancient history of symbols in this book. It is a great taxonomy of signs, ideograms, and some symbols, all presented in the same style, and has some value as a dictionary. The cross references are very useful. Not very useful for researching symbols or emblems from the more esoteric arena. The visual overview chart is a good idea for finding a symbol by its looks, although I found the groupings confusing to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dictionary of Symbols by Carl Liungman","review":"Wonderful dictionary, very clear and clean illustrations.

Let's face it - the one motif he keeps using, albeit good, can only go so far. If inspiration does not strike, do NOT push it! The one same old idea he keeps churning is simply stale and painless. He should just accept the fact that he is dry and stop pretending any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush & mesmerizing","review":"A perfect melding of music with film, Philip Glass' quietly sweeping score enhances & enriches the visuals without ever having to hammer us over the head with emotional cues -- it lets us feel, rather than telling us what to feel. For a style so firmly associated with the present, this music is right at home in the 1890s -- elegant, ornate, utterly Romantic. It's one of those scores that can easily stand on its own as a work of art, and would be evocative even to someone who hadn't seen the film. Its dreamlike quality simply carries the listener away -- most definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"classic Philip Glass","review":"The soundtrack is classic Philip Glass...boring.

The film is dubbed in English so the spoken words do not always match the mouths of the actors however it is not distracting to most people I've met or to me, and I have watched the movie 77 times and am still planning to watch it more. For me this film goes right up there with legends like John Wayne films and Double Dragons. I would strongly recommend watching it!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Another Wolfe oddity. An ordinary man discovers that there arepassageways to other places and worlds. He becomes obsessed with asuperior specimen of woman, a goddess. Unlike Garth, for example, whohas a similar relationship, but is basically a superhero.There is a question though of whether this is all real, orsomething that is just in his head. So one of those stories where thesanity of the protagonist is in quesiton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - my opinion differs","review":"Sorry my opinion differs greatly.I cannot believe I see all those 5 stars! 5 stars to me is for Austen's Pride and Prejudice or Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. 4 Stars would be for Stephen King's Carrie or Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy. I cannot see how this book is deserving of anything more than a two tops!I did completely fall for the character and his love for all different people he encountered, not just Lara. Even with that being said I think he really needed to pull open that hidden compartment of the desk and find a spine! Not Tina!!! How wishy-washy can one man be when it comes to matters of the heart yet be so fearless when saving another man's life?Although I felt completely robbed at the ending and wished for the couple weekends back that it took me to read this book, I would not buy a sequel if there were one.I wouldn't classify this book as Science Fiction Fantasy at all - I would call it delusional at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONCE AGAIN A GREAT NOVEL BY WOLFE","review":"I disagree that this book is narrow in scope. This thing is a romantic epic that traverses worlds and gives a new look at godhood and its impact upon the average man. I wouldn't say that is narrow. Finely written and full of wonderous ideas. Wolfe delivers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author created her own history.","review":"Words such as \\"new history\\", \\"pre-history\\", \\"fact\\", and \\"research\\" just don't mix. The author created her own reality of what she wished history was like. As example: if Eisler would have shed her own biases and researched the initial \\"AIDS\\" work, she would have learned why the CDC changed the name of this very controlable disease. Instead she is blinded by political correctness and revisionism. Behaviour has consequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was able to use this item for my home projects.

It is a great CD, no matter your age, appreciate the roots of American Music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is good for half the title","review":"I would like to start out by saying I loved this book at first. The first few chapters are well done; the concepts at the beginning are well explained and detailed. However, as one progresses into more complex ideas you would expect longer, more detailed explanations to compensate; but that's not the case here. Complex ideas are sometimes given ONE paragraph. A short explanation is good enough for what an 'int' is, but not for complex algorithms or how to analyze them. As I progress, the book becomes an index of concepts I need to look up online or in other books, rather than a source of information.Far too brief without being concise in many areas. More (and varied) examples, with diagrams/flow-charts/pictures, and connections to other concepts would have made this book much more palatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Tales of the Deep","review":"Blind Man's Bluff is an interesting compilation of stories about the US submarine service during the cold war era. The book is very well written and captures, I assume, much of the untold story of the silent service.I was intrigued by the parallels and consistencies between Blind Man's Bluff and books such as Spy Sub and Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea. Blind Man's Bluff also serves to better define some of the Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler \\"fictional\\" works.A true work of heroism."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last - the truth","review":"This book had me riveted. My father was on the boat in this book, and I can remember - in detail - the top secret stories he told me as a child. This book has real accounts, and actual data - that has been kept inside many submariners for years. The truth is finally known. For all submariners, and those who helped my father and his shipmates return to me and my family at MINS, and also the authors - who took the time and courage to finally bring the importance of these missions to light - I thank you, from the bottom of my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced stories that keep you reading!","review":"This book is tremendous!

The detail and the information is great and the stories shed as much light as they do questions. I know I will be going back and talking to my father, who served on the USS Jack (605), to hear what he has to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKED THIS BOOK...","review":"As a former submariner, navy diver and recon photographer, I enjoyed this book and found it to be fairly factual. However, the authors weren't able to get most submariners, deep sea \\"saturation\\" divers and espionage \\"spooks\\" to open up, and so there are few firsthand stories told by those individuals. If you liked this book, you'll love RED NOVEMBER: Inside the Secret U.S. - Soviet Submarine War, which goes much deeper through personal accounts told by operatives and reveals details about the most dangerous, daring and decorated missions of the Cold War."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Job by the authors","review":"As a former submariner (two fast attacks and one fleet ballistic missile submarine all of whom are named in the book) I have signed debriefing statements on the operations I was assigned to and therefore will not discuss them. Like other submariners, I have read the book, and will make sure my wife and children get a copy to help explain why I am so quiet about the things I did in the Navy, and why I don't even talk about them today. I also highly appreciate the authors reverence and understanding of the men who served on these boats. The truth is still out there. Many people do not know how much the sbmarine service gave to the people of this country. At least future generations can judge for themselves with a published book of this calibre"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very engaging read","review":"The book is well done. It tells a story pieced together by people involved in submarine service, but not given to talking about it. It shows a lot of what our submarines do is not just tracking enemies or being \\"on station\\" in case trouble breaks out. Much of what they do is good old fashioned espionage. I suppose I expected more episodes to be related in the book. A handful of important events are detailed. One of the more fascinating is planting eavesdropping pods over Soviet communications cables on the ocean bottom. The book instills in the reader a sense of loss and tragedy over people like John Walker, Aldrich Ames, and others who betrayed our nation's secrets and cost the lives of dedicated people in the service of our government for only a few thousand dollars. The last sections of the book give a lot of information about specific boats, crews, and voyages that will be lost on the average reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than a TDU weight","review":"I like the effort put forth by the authors given source material constraints, but anyone who served knows that only the 'surface' was scratched. \\"Bluff\\" is a good overview with enough details about specific espionage operations to keep the reader interested. There simply isn't enough room in a single book to cover all of the engineering, communications, navigation, weapons systems, sonar, radar, analysis, etc. for those wishing for more nuts and bolts.But far more important than the technology were the skill and dedication of the crews, and this book does not give enough depth or credit to the enlisted men that stood the watches and maintained the gear that supported stick rider and spook operations. Sometimes their only reward was periscope liberty and a lawyer with divorce papers waiting at the pier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, enthralling, and sobering","review":"I highly recommend the book--It is a (roughly) chronological history of submarine espionage, at least on the American side. It starts with the first troubled mission shortly after World War II and runs past the end of the Cold War.The stories are gripping, and would often be worth reading as fiction. It is amazing that they are fact. Some of the tales told are questionably related to the topic, such as the hunt for the US submarine Scorpion after it was lost, but even those are so interesting I will forgive the author for putting them in.If the topic interests you at all, I predict you will enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good research ruined by dreadful writing.","review":"A very promising book goes south quickly with its overly dramatic, breathless reporting. I felt as if I was reading the National Enquirer. The subject matter almost overcomes the writing, but because it's so bad the whole book loses credibility. I would almost say the writers didn't have the confidence in their material to let it stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing, or at least about very little.","review":"Perhaps I am jaded by 26 years as an intelligence professional but this book seems to be one good magazine article's worth of material stretched into a book. The author's describe several items of some passing value but mainly what they do is rehash a litany of information readily available in open source material. This is simply one of those books that promises much and delivers very little. I would suggest that the interested reader can find out more by using a good search engine and investing an hour or so at the computer. I must report, having been on the inside, that if the complete story could be told, it would be much more interesting and provacative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - not as advertised","review":"I carefully read all the Amazon reviews of this book before finally breaking down and buying it. I guess I don't regret reading it, but it's going into the trade-in stack and not on a bookshelf. Just as many of the reviewers here have stated, the book is short on \\"espionage\\" but long on breathless recounting of accidents and incidents. The authors' non-historical background is clearly on display. In their defense, I'm sure they made every effort to check all the stories, and much of the information is still tightly held. This book should be written again in twenty years. Finally, the self-congratulatory afterword could have been left off. I'm sure this book has provided a catharsis for many submarine sailors, but there are hundreds of thousands of us who also served (essentially thanklessly) in the cold war who will never have books written about us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and poorly written","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this book. For all its hype as an insider's view into submarine spying, this reads like a grade school book report off secondary sources. Full of conjecture and anectdotal evidence, this book presents opinion as fact and does a poor job of presenting detail. The authors cover up their lack of facts with flowery embellishments and love to name drop. The Wikipedia article on the Scorpion is a more informative and interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cure For Insomnia","review":"Being an old sailor I was anxious to listen to this book. Though the stories were good I could have cared less about some of the miscellaneous stuff. The various stories will have you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps the abridged version would have been better. I listened to this book on tape and at times they just went on and on for what seemed like hours about nothing.If I were the authors of this book, I would put out another book containing only the stories of the actual missions of the various submarines and the crews experience.Though I liked the stories, I did not care for this book and would not recommend it to others unless they are absolutely fascinated with Naval History.Folks, don't waste your time or your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"More politics than sea stories.","review":"I was expecting spine-tingling sea stories.

No references, no footnotes. How is a reader to know if the book is based on fact rather than fiction. Where any of the crewmen on these subs interviewed? The way the book reads it was like the author was standing on the con as the events played out. How was the information gathered? The Navy had and always will be very secretive about what went on below the surface. If anyone knows of a more factual book about the cable tapping please let me know. What these crews did, given the state of the technology back then is beyond comprehension. My hat is tipped to all who have served and who are now serving under the deep blue ocean. Just my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was a disappointment","review":"When I compared it to the book entitled Submarines in the Time-Life series of books on ships, I found Blind Man's Bluff to be not even in the same league. Blind Man's Bluff has some interesting vignettes, but it is poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand up","review":"Ten years after publication, this book doesn't stand up to other books on the topic. It's poorly researched, cleaves to the government line, and relies too heavily on the work of other journalists. After the first 100 pages, I skimmed the rest of the chapters. Mutual respect for the dead moves the book. Yet answers are incomplete. The living deserve the respect of the governments that still hold so many of the secrets behind the events described in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for anyone interested in submarines","review":"I submit this review simply to register 5 stars for this book. I defer to Wayne Smith's review (below) as a better review than I could write. I would simply add that the true stories cover the span from the late 40s to the days of Perestroika (late Reagan years), with notes that go beyond. Hence, we witness character-based submarine espionage transition from \\"primitive\\" diesel subs to the very best nukes we've got. That historical progression adds a very meaningful element to the book. I'm glad these guys spoke up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"This book is the story of American submarine espionage during the Cold War, a very classified subject in government archives. Starting in the 1940s, the book carries on into the development of submarine technology for the purpose of Cold War espionage programs, all the way into the end of the Cold War. I myself found that one of my own family members took part in the cable tapping of a Soviet Naval base and I never even knew it until I read the book! Read it, and maybe you'll find one of your own relatives was involved in the ultra secret and somteimes tragic story of American submarine espionage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me up late","review":"A book for everyone who likes suspense, intrigue, and adventure.

You'll be amazed each time when you suddenly remember \\"this really happened!\\" This book only increased my interest in submarine warfare and opened up a whole new world about underwater espionage. Most people think of submarines as attack vessels that fire their torpedoes and disappear. \\"Blind Mans Bluff\\" will put a face to the battles and educate the reader on the intelligence aspects of submariners: they did a LOT more than sink ships and slide around under the water.

I applaud the authors (despite a little downplaying of the true nature of the HORSE COW Bar in Vallejo, California) for their tenacity in digging out the truth, their wisdom in choosing to leave out some interesting stories they doubtless heard, and their honesty in portraying the whispered role of the \\"silent service\\".

NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THAT WATCH SECTION WAS CARRIED TOPSIDE. WE did our job, restored the ships power and propulsion and were given the \\"treat\\" of breathing fresh air for what I consider a \\"controlled recovery\\" from a serious incedent.

The last half of the book was like swimming with concrete overshoes.Journalists love to interject themselves and opinions into the events of the past as if the writer really has some value besides the telling of a story. People who actually made history and had to actually make decisions are routinely second guessed (usually after they died and are unable to defend themselves). The opinions by the authors are often insulting and self-serving.

While horrible and unfortunate, it has little effect on national security concerns. I felt that the title of the book is a little misleading as I expecting just espionage achievements of the USN.The espionage that is revealed in the book, you could describe in a few paragraphs. Most of it has been disclosed in other articles/books. I agree with the other reviewer, the PBS TV program was the right format for the information provided (one hour is sufficient). I guess much of this topic is still classified (as some of the other reviewers seem to know)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven!","review":"My favorite novels have involved the Cold War and Submarines. Mark Joseph's To Kill the Potemkin is by far my favorite. But Hendrick, Clancy, and Taylor are close seconds and I have read them all. With this in mind, I was very excited to read this book.However, I found the book incredibly uneven. Some chapters were great. Especially the chapter about the USS Scorpion, while other chapters were incredibly boring.So in short, this book is a mixed bag. The subject is very interesting. The information, especially the recently declassified stuff, is also mind blowing at times. But as a whole, the book is pretty boring in certain parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for new submariners","review":"It seems to me that the government should have told us about these exploits long before the authors penetrated the classified documents of the U.S. Navy.

The hour-long PBS special on submarines does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting details - Lackluster writing!","review":"I found much of the historical detail interesting, albeit at the price of wading through some pretty mediocre writing. Much of the impact of the book derives from its many revelations of, what the authors identify as, classified information. The authors note: \\"Most of the submariners and intelligence officials who have helped us with this book have done so only under the condition of anonymity and took great risks in speaking to us.\\" This statement is either an exaggeration or an admission that the authors enticed current and former members of the military to violate their oaths, breach security and break the law. Frankly, the \\"read\\" was not worth participating in this exercise - however vicariously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intrigue and conspiracy satisfy even diehard Grassy Knollers","review":"Lots of behind-the-scenes insight and under-the-table discussions. No wonder the US Navy did not want this book published. Still, there's a lot of fluff here, truly ancient history and a grand portrayal of some old codgers who seem to want their story told(Dr. John Craven for example). Between the fluffs are some nuggets, some which might even be true. Looks more like the authors got some cooperative sources with highly classified information and tried to make a book out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they publish the rough draft?","review":"America's undersea involvement in the Cold War was an astounding story of ingenuity, persistence and courage. Learning this from Blind Man's Bluff required a tolerance for poor writing that I found difficult to muster.If not for the importance and intrigue of the subject matter, this book would hold no appeal. The sentence structure is often awkward and ambiguous. In a book that dabbles with technical information, this is unacceptable. Some of the factual errors are simple enough to betray a lack of basic understanding of the subject.Technical confusion is not the only problem. Subjects change mid-sentence. Adjectives are irrelevant. Punctuation is misleading. Even minimal editing would have improved the book immensely.I can't imagine why the authors spent years researching this book and then put no effort into relating the story clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Story Poorly Written","review":"The poor writing style of the book detracts immensely from the amazing stories the authors are trying to tell. It seems as if they are trying to over-sell the 'land portion' and personal conflicts and this hyperbole blocks easy transitioning to the fascinating tales of risk, failure and danger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Might be interesting, but for me it was a waste of time and money. While this book does contain a little interesting information, most of the things it talks about could have easily been gleened from the news at the time they took place.

This book was recommended by a guy who used to keep track of Russian subs off of the California coast. I was delighted by the stories as soon as I started the book, and could not put it down. I enjoyed the 'thinking out of the box' ideas that were put into play, and the harrowing execution of them in the field. Since im no buff of Cold War details, I assume the stories were accurate. I very much enjoyed the book either way, and have recommended it to several others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading, whether or not you were there.","review":"The reviews of this book are also worth reading (some of them really cracked me up). They run the whole spectrum from drooling civies (who wouldn't know the TDU from a TLD) to the monkey-mates (like me) whose fondest memories of the northern climes were the lack of drills, cool sleeping conditions and lots of movies. I spent 3+ years on a SSN during the 70s. I am amazed at what the authors were able to print (I don't think they are in prison or have been audited yet), but I wouldn't take a chance confirming anything they wrote. The book isn't perfect, but it brought back a lot of things I tried to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear & convincing","review":"As others note here, this is a well-written and exhaustively researched account of the role of submarines in undercover operations during the Cold War. It contributes major understanding about that era. Inevitably, it asks whether the risks and expense were worth it; but it offers no answer. Here's one: Spying provided incontrovertable information to each side about the other's intentions, thus reducing threat of nuclear war. The effort was worth it, not for what it achieved,but for what it prevented. Everyone involved in these operations (even traitorous spies) helped prevent nuclear war. To those who did so from courage, their nation owes gratitude as surely as to those faced the perils of a shooting war."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...show must go on...\\"","review":"\\"...the proud American sailors who ... keep the peace throughout the world...\\" Yeah...

Information about Cold War submarine incidents was \\"compartmentalized\\" -- only those immediately involved in a particular situation were allowed to know what happened. As a result, it's unlikely many former submariners are in a position to verify more than about 10% of the book from their own experience. Most of us weren't told what went on with the other boats. That's true in my case.Having said all that, what I did already know of in this book from my own Navy tour is accurately depicted in this book and the other stuff seems very credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Engrossing from the start, Blind Man's Bluff offers compelling stories and a totaly unexpected look at the art and science of espionage and life below sea level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veteran with extensive anti-submarine background","review":"I was intimately involved in collecting and processing the acoustic intelligence from submarines, surface ships and landbased sensors.

Its hard to believe what can happen without the genereal public having any knowledge (and all of it under water!) The stories are all during the cold war up to the early 1990's. If you are into post war WWII espionage & like submarines, you should enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Someone Tells It Like It Is!","review":"I served in the US Submarine \\"silent service\\" for several years in the late 60's. This is a no holds barred book. It tells all the secrets about submarines. Where they were, what they did and how they got away with it by exploring many now \\"unclassified\\" information.Read about the \\"cat and mouse\\" games that the US and Soviets played. You'll learn about how the United States used submarines to \\"tap into\\" the secret communications and how we almost got caught. You'll even see pictures of the place that the sub sailors hung out (the Horse & Cow bar) when off duty near San Francisco. There's some very interesting photographs as well.Highly recommended from a former \\"pig boat\\" sailor. You won't regret this one. Make sure you have enough free time when you start this book. You won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real-life Tom Clancy like thriller!","review":"Don't read this book before bedtime. You won't want to put it down! It's an excellent thriller that often reads like a plot from a James Bond movie only everything in this book really happened! Blind Man's Bluff is a a throughly detailed page turner that takes the reader behind the scenes of some of the most secret and hair-raising sub missions of the cold war. If you thought most American subs merely trolled the Atlantic searching for Soviet subs, you'll be throughly surprised at the risks taken by U.S. subs to gain some of the most extensive intelligence of the past fifty-years. Read it, and you'll gain a new respect for the dedication and sheer bravey of those who serve in the silent service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Research","review":"As an individual named in Blind Man's Bluff as a contributor to the book titlle from a line in songs I wrote about the U.S. Submarine Service, who lived the experience of sixteen missions (1967-78), and who is still bound by security constraints, I will say I am totally impressed with the information these authors were able to glean through the Freedom of Information Act and through the interview process. As I was equally impressed with the technical information presented in Clancy's Hunt for Red October. One positive result of Blind Man's Bluff could be to show the American people they always got their money's worth from the Submarine Service. God bless all U.S. submariners for their personal sacrifices and contributions to national security, past, present, and future. It is an honor to have served with you. Respectfully, Tommy Cox"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the kids!","review":"Simply stated, this book belongs in the \\"Juniors\\" section of your public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting stories but not a real study of the subject.","review":"Where's the beef? Kept waiting for them to tell me about the overall program, its facets, and results. Just a compilation of disaster stories. Pick a couple of chapters, read them, and then move onto _Stalingrad_ by Antony Beever for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is all unofficial","review":"I am a US Navy submariner and am reading this book for my own enjoyment, but the general public should know that everything in this book is unofficial. The US Navy does not discuss or support the discussion or speculation of the operations our ships perform. Please do not accept anything truth because it may not be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent and deadly vessels of the oceans","review":"I got this book on the advice of a friend. I spent some time on one of the old diesel boats in the late 60's, the USS Tang .... SS 563. Submarine service was strictly voluntary and I got a pitch for sub school when I was in Great Lakes going to Propulshion Engineering School. My big deal was sub school gave me a few more months of shore duty and most of us were young and dumb. I ended up on a Ballistic Missile Sub the SSBN 642. In all the time I spent on submarines only oner person asked to be removed from submarine duty. There is a special bond amongst those of us who had the opportunity to serve on these marvels of technology. This book gave me a refresher course from another point of view and I enjoyed the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the movie?","review":"This is quite an amazing story. Surprising it hasn't already been made into a movie, but in this day and age, this is probably a good thing. Thanks for putting it all down on paper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs deep","review":"This book, along with a clutch of mass-market WW II paperbacks, has sat in a corner for 8 years or so. I picked it up last Saturday and read it in a day. A real page turner with dense factual content and hair-raising stories. In the tradition of the best non-fiction, the truth here is stranger and more compelling than fiction. Hats off to the submariners -- I hope they're still out there, quietly ruining bad guys' days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with three authors but no editor","review":"After reading the book itself, it was gratifying to read comments by actual submariners and find that the writing really WAS on target. Not having any experience with subs I had to depend on my knowledge of peripheral details to decide whether I could rely on all the information I couldn't verify.For example, I found the reference to \\"180 degrees north longitude\\" pretty disturbing. And someone who states that 13 feet of water has the same \\"molecular weight\\" as a foot of lead...well, I know what they're driving at, but it left me wondering how much of what I couldn't verify was worth believing. And so forth.Other commenters have mentioned the somewhat unfocused, here-and-there nature of the writing. I still want to read about and more deeply appreciate what submariners have done on my behalf, but from other authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the real life Hunt For Red October","review":"This book was an intense page-turner, every chapter detailed the dangerous and often surprising measures the US Navy took to spy on the Soviet Union. The early attempts with diesel subs soon exposed their limitations but with Admiral Rickover's wonder sub Nautilus would emerge the perfect espionage platform. Follow the true-life adventures of the USS Halibut as it searches for Soviet sub wreckage, the deadly cat and mouse game that occurred between US and Soviet subs that often led to dangerous collisions and the deadly secret that may have killed the crew of the USS Scorpion. Packed with numerous interviews and testimonies from both US and former Soviet naval crewman, the novel truly opens up the world of submarine warfare and the measures taken win the undersea Cold War. A great novel for anyone who is a fan of Tom Clancy style adventures; this is the real life Hunt For Red October. Be sure you watch the excellent History Channel program based on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good not great","review":"Interesting storyline but predictable sequence of events. Not the best Diana Palmer book I have read, but I will still continue to read what she publishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the classroom","review":"This book is for anything but the classroom. The material is too complex for new students. I used it in three sessions. I could not get over the stress of teaching it. My students found that AE is too hard. It seems that the writers ignored that people have short memories. They expected the readers to keep up with a long project, the subject of the book. I found that the Meyer books had a better approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was completely disappointed with this book. It works with tutorials of simple PSD shape files. I am a newbie at After Effects but I heard so much but how it interacts 100% with Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop that I expected more of that in that book. There is no reference on how to mask Alpha Channels of PSD files or even in depth interaction with Photoshop. I know that this is a begginers book but at least by the end we could have something more advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Seems this book \\"Classroom in a book\\" have very strange structure.Every part of book depends from other and if you didn't made previous (just couldn't or found not enough information to do it) - you can't normally make the rest of exercises.That is also not very nice in this book - that very much the same information how to open file, for example. And it's a bit irritating.And such useless information takes a good part of a book. Sometimes not enough screenshots to show important moments, but there are other screenshots, that are unimportant.This book is ok. Would give it 2,5 stars if it would be possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor cover of dvd","review":"You know this dvd is going to be poor when the examples on the cover include a very unarched foot performing a tendu and a bad example of a releve in 1st position (completely turned in!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoloutely beautiful","review":"This is a gorgeous doll, just as pretty as the Odette doll. The only complaint I have is that her hair is impossible to keep neat, but the color is so pretty it doesn't matter. I think this doll is just as pretty as some of the collector's dolls I own. Her accessories are nice, and her dress is nicely made."},{"rating":"2","title":"SERIOUSLY, THIS IS GOOD STUFF","review":"I loved Lord's other books (A Night to Remember, Incredible Victory, Day of Infamy) and I bought this out of curiosity. Could he write about a period of history in which nothing seemed to happen (given the blanks I was drawing in my memory from high school history)? The answer is: absolutely!Actually, you get 15 good short books which should replace any US history textbook on the era. Lord is a fantastic writer of history just because he finds so many witnesses and ties their accounts together in a narrative that puts you in the midst of the action. Presidential assassinations, brushfire wars, real expeditions to unvisited parts of the planet, financial crises, the lifestyles of the rich and famous, the inventors -- the good old days weren't as simple as we think they were!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Software old fashioned","review":"The people who had send me this gave great service, but to comment on the product; the pictures and box looks pretty, but the software is very old fashioned.

Keep in mind that if you have Vista, you will need to move the fonts out of the C program folder in order to install them. Once i solved that, for some reason, other things started to work for me (really not sure why). I still get some error messages, but I am able to read art from the other CDs. Once it started working I found that this is a very valuable program. I really only bought it for the fonts. There is a ton of clip art in here too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quick Reference","review":"The beauty of this book is that it is concise. If you want information regarding musical rock you get a succinct overview. I liked how the book covers the diverse music of the 80's. It is a handy reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"You really can not go wrong","review":"You really can't go wrong with this Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul. It's pretty standard stuff if you know about your favorite groups. But if you want to know something about a rock group or person whom you know very little about this is a nice book to have. I always seem to be thumbing through it. Words are a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trail of Dead","review":"One may ask how it is possible to live up to the astonishment that was ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead's previous album, \\"Source Tags & Codes\\". I'm sure the band themselves were thinking that, as \\"Worlds Apart\\" can't compete ST&C.; Regardless, Trail of Dead has managed to create yet another very enjoyable record.So take it like this: when compared to \\"Source Tags,\\" this album is mediocre at best. Taken without comparison to \\"Source Tags,\\" this album is very, very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really mediocre","review":"This isn't a horrible album. In fact, it's probably better than 95 percent of new albums released. What is dissappointing is how bad it is for a Trail of Dead album. You can pick of any of their other recording, anyone of them, and you'll have a much better sound. This one is overproduced and underwhelming. Before it was like they couldn't contain their energy and outrage. Now it's like they have to muster it up from a youth and talent long forgotten.There are a couple of good songs. But the album as a whole kinda sucks. It's like someone took Trail of Dead songs and then handed them over to Quincy Jones, Brian Eno and Phil Spector for re-working. The result is confusing and unfocused. Like it could have been something great, but some huge accident happened in the recording studio day after day."},{"rating":"2","title":"What they're missing ...","review":"I understand and even sort of agree with many of the above reviewers who complain that the album is more refined, more polished, more controlled, more mature. Sure, and so was Sgt. Pepper's, Wish You Were Here, OK Computer, Amused to Death and just about every other truly great, great album. This, hands down, is the best new album i've purchased since i bought Radiohead's OK Computer. Hands down. I think a lot of fans were expecting the moments of brilliance in certain songs that ToD displayed before. This is a complete album, not just a collection of songs. Nearly perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are terrible","review":"I guess anyone else who's heard of these guys love them, according to previous reviews.

The songs are all pretty good just not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"totd","review":"i cant' say enough about this band and this album. not enough people know about these guys and they are truly an amazing band. get this album, put on your headphones and get rocked"},{"rating":"2","title":"FEELING UNINSPIRED.............","review":"Ive allways appreciated Robert Smith from afar never actually commiting myself to one particular album or another.The Cure just were not my speed.However the more I heard from this cd the more I wanted it so I finally broke down and bought my first Cure cd.I have nothing to comapre it too being that im not a full time fan but in this age of mediocrity it is refreshing to hear something this comfortable and natural sounding.Well done Mr.Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This band has always done interesting work. Their last album Source Tags and Codes was a masterpiece. They lost a member and there are a lot of expectations on this new album. \\"Will You Smile Again For Me\\" is a hard rocking tune much like their previous album. \\"Worlds Apart\\" and \\"Summer 91\\" recall the dreams of childhood. They reveal and introduce a glam rock fascination, and specifically a 1970s David Bowie influence, in some songs. The yearning and hope in songs like \\"And The Rest Will Follow\\" is an improvement. Songs like \\"Russia My Homeland\\" has some classical music touches. \\"All White\\" sounds like a track off of Ziggy Stardust. Trail of the Dead has always been fans of the classic rock tradition and musicianship. The album ends with the jazzy song \\"City of Refuge.\\" This album has the hits, the flourishes, and the delivery. You couldn't ask for more. We are not lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afraid of change you are","review":"I think the reason a lot of people were let down by \\"Worlds Apart\\" is that they were expecting \\"Source Tags & Codes\\". Truly the mark of a great band is their ability to let style evolve without loseing the original appeal that made them popular. After all, If you're just going to make the same album over and over, What's the point? Where's the risk? I for one love were Trail of Dead's music is going and am looking forward to future releases from them. So F**k what ya heard about \\"Worlds Apart\\" and give it a chance you wanker."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the action and the drawings?","review":"I am a huge fan of Spider-Man of all the series. I wanted to read this book 'cause it looked cool. I was very disapointed. The drawings were horrible. They all looked like a 14 drew them. Second all there basically was, was talk. No action except at the very beginning and end. If you don't read this book you are not missing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Should Be Treated Separately, but You MUST READ IT!","review":"The Ultimate Six is somewhat of a sideplot, even though it is a hugely epic story. As one reviewer stated before, it doesn't follow the traditional ultimate spider-man storytelling that we're all accustomed to, but it still held me by the eyes and wouldn't let me go till I finished.Whew I had to take a step back after reading this. We've got the Avengers and the Ultimate Six....or Five...you'll see. It's kind of like a huge chocolate cake. You don't wanna be given it all the time, but that rare time when you receive it, you wanna eat the WHOLE thing. My only concern with the book was the drawings of Peter. I saw one drawing where he literally looked cross-eyed. Hopefully I'll get my illustrator back in the next book.I hope you're prepared to set aside some time in your busy life.

You pick your battles, right?Although she is a HUGE Converse fan, these were a little too HOT! The leather doesn't really breathe so these tend to get stuffy really quickly. Since she has only worn them in warm weather, we're anticipating these will be nice and cozy in cooler weather.The leather is really soft and supple. My daughter says that the shoes conform to her feet so the stuffiness if offset by the fact that the fit feels like they are custom made for her. My daughter has said that these feel more comfortable than her canvas Converse.The price has also dropped quite a bit which puts them into a more affordable ball park as far as Converse goes. My daughter always gets a ton of compliments whenever she wears these - she's loves them and that makes them well worth it to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I remember when Converse meant quality but not anymore.

My only complaints involve long-term wear. It doesn't take long for metal to wear off the eyelets and discolor the laces. After a couple months, the rubber in front on the sides of the shoes will split where you bend your feet.Overall, they aren't the most durable shoes in spite of the leather, but that doesn't matter 'cause they look so awesome... yeah, I actually said awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately disappointed","review":"I am in the process of returning the shoes because two weeks after wearing them, the rubber \\"bumpers\\" started to pull away from the base of the shoe and then completely split."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, medium delivery","review":"Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top BlackPrice and quality are perfect, but the delivery time was much too long (almost a week instead of the 2-3 working days as advertised)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know I'm About To Commit Gaming Suicide, But...","review":"Who wants a calendar of animated girls on their wall all year long?

So, can't read the time, can't see how much time you entered...just have to count the beeps as you push each button to know what you are entering. Granted, it lasted another 7 years, but we were not happy with the early display dying. Smoked and flashed electricity inside as it died an ugly death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived defective","review":"Unit arrived with undamaged packaging, yet had a defective display. Those things happen in manufacturing, but the poor review is a result of the response. Sharp said call the dealer, the dealer said call Sharp. Finally dealer agreed to file claim... Eight days later, it has not been picked up.Appropriate response would be \\"I'm sorry that happened, here is a return label. Your replacement will be sent as soon as the carrier confirms they have picked up this one\\".In an effort to speed things up, we called the local Sharp authorized repair depot and their advise was to let this one get picked up and buy a Whirlpool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful Watercolor Characters amongst","review":"Creative poetic counting book with a cute story behind it.

It'll play for anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours and then all of a sudden crash for no reason. I have a pretty good computer that meets all of the requirements it says on the box but they're obviously wrong about them. The graphics are great, the game is fun, and the animals are pretty cute and all but the darn game just won't play right. Unless you have a really great running up to date super computer I wouldn't recommend buying this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, with a dash of frustration","review":"For people that are looking for a game which will take longer than an hour or so to beat and love animals, this is your game.The tutorial levels can be quite tedious until you get a handle on the camera controls and terrain editor. However, they are good preparation for the levels ahead, and I would suggest completing them to optimize your zoo in the free play mode.I found that when you become very adept at creating a happy environment for the animals they are VERY quick to procreate, and before you know it you have a small exhibit with a large quantity of animals.When using the terrain editor to create hills/mountains or valleys/bodies of water, it is difficult to tell how much you are affecting the selected land.Once you become confident in your skills, you can really have fun with it without frustration. All-in-all, a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid THIS GAME !!!","review":"Again as the other consumers have said... DO NOT BUY this game.

My son bought this for $20 at our school book fair, and has never been able to play it, due to the unusual graphics requirements. To purchase a compatible graphics card is basically ridiculous, as they seem to cost far more than the game itself. Now we're stuck with a brand new game that is essentially worthless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparison to Roller Coaster/Zoo tycoon games","review":"If you have played the Roller Coaster and Zoo typcoon games I feel you will be quite disappointed with Zoo Empire by Enlight.

The layout is (for lack of a better word) strange!!Well, maybe the youngsters will have an easier time of it, but I doubt it. Its simply a frustration to play..Personally disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Zoo Empire is a fabulous game! Actually, it has the potential to be the best zoo game ever! There are glitches with the animal feeding and drinking, but they are fixed by installing the patch. Now, my zookeepers seem to be feeding the animals slightly better. Although the tutorials do a good job of getting you up and running, the manual is a must-read, or else you'll miss out one some of the more complex features of the game. I just never read the manuals, just jump into a free game and figure it all out, so many of my problems were due to not reading the manual! Great, colorfull graphics, cool animations, and a great way to learn more about animals!Hopefully the guys responsible for zoo empire will come out with version 2 of the game, and fixing the minor glitches in the game. I'll be looking forward to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning do not buy","review":"Bought this game 2 months ago. when I installed it, my computer crashed.

I was hoping for a clear, riveting summary of the environmental and health problems created because of the food industry in this country. I wanted an exposition of the inhumane techniques used to raise animals, the government policies and subsidies that contribute to the system, and the alternatives. The filmmaker touched on these points, but I didn't feel they were clearly made (read Michael Pollen's The Omnivore's Dilemma instead). Many of the people interviewed in the film are inarticulate and hence boring to listen to, and the pacing is very slow.

Really a bunch of do-gooder libby libs that see no value in more efficient food production that allows us to eat a wider variety of foods more cheaply.

A nonsubjective viewer is suggested","review":"This film was a disappiontment for one basic reason it was short on detailed facts and long on dramatics. I was constantly waiting for details that would never come. This film tries to persuade the audience with emotion instead of facts and statistics. I appreciate the need for natural food and hope that some day all that want it can get it. However the current methods feed millions/billions that would not be fed otherwise and this film does not address this issue. Sometimes people forget there is 7 billion of us that need to eat every day.

It really is shocking what we are being fed, and I don't mean that just in a literal sense!For those considering buying or watching the DVD. The documentary moves at a good pace. It doesn't deliberately seek to shock you with graphic scenes, or express a bias that we should all become vegetarians. What it does do is take the veil off the packaging to reveal many ugly and hidden truths. The good thing here is that KNOWLEDGE IS POWER and our power is visible with each food item we choose to purchase.Many thanks to the brave makers of this film. Polyface Farm--you rock![...]. Worth taking a look there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Shocking","review":"Food Inc. is extremely informative and a bit shocking. I wasn't expecting to see some of the things that were in this movie. I like that the documentary isn't trying to make the viewer a vegetarian or paranoid. It really made me think of my food in a different way. I will try to buy organic and fresh produce when I can. Food Inc. covers a wide range of food from meat and poultry to produce and soy beans. I have to admit watching the pig portion of the movie did bring some tears to my eyes. I am glad this movie was made so that more people like myself can be better informed about the food we eat. I highly recommend watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes some powerful points...","review":"I've read many of the reviews. It may be true that Food, Inc is a bit one-sided, but some of the points it raises are to be considered seriously. One point that was raised is the fact that $1 menu places are more affordable than healthier food in a store; a direct contributor to the growing epidemic of childhood obesity. A lot of the argument may remain dormant unless parents can get their kids away from the video games and insist they get some exercise. Lots of other points are raised, and should be considered. I'm glad I saw this worthy (though unpleasant) film; it's a wake-up call, long overdue, and makes a lot of valid points that we cannot deny need attention.

I take the time now to actually look at some of my favorite foods and have made some changes. Most of these changes were simple enough to make and actually taste better then some of the other stuff I got.

If truth were to be told about the chemicals being put into our processed foods; acutally all foods, even those grown on corporate farms, since chemicals are used in animal food and on foods grown in the fields...it is safe to say we would be hard pressed as to what to eat at all.

I am buying grass fed beef now and have yet to have any reaction, which tells me its not beef but maybe the hormones or antibiotics or the ammonia they wash the beef in or maybe the dye they use to make it look red.

The same beef processor depicted at this moment in the film had to recall thousands of tons of beef product a week or so after I watched to movie due to exactly the sort of e-coli problems the film was showing viewers they were bound to have.Finally, there is a farmer from Virginia in this film who ought to be made head of US Department of Agriculture.

When contacted by phone and told that we would like to show this film to some club members, (around 20), in the rear room of a nearby coffee shop our Agriculture Club was told that it would cost us $150 and require purchase of the film directly from their company.

I can see him pointing his nose up in the sky and saying, \\"Nope, I won't eat it, it has to be labeled 100% organic.Hmmm, to be shamed by the elite because of where you get your food, or even which food to eat is almost like a nightmarish sci-fi movie. Pollan sure goes out of his way shame the lower-class laborers by telling them they are not eating the right foods.

I am sure some aspects of their information are correct, but the greatest liars take truths and expound with false accusations on partial truths. That's what I felt this movie did.

The scenes from the \\"pink slime\\" factory are memorable to show what poisons some people will still claim to be food. At the time I still ate hamburgers and wondered why sometimes they tasted like ammonia. They were! Joke on me. I thought they were all beef as advertized. HA-HA, silly me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"Awesome documentary. The info and delivery are top knotch. I wish this video were required veiwing for all americans. Very professionally done as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but hard to \\"stomach\\"","review":"It is a true insight to what is going on in our food business. And it shows you terrible things. I think this is a really hard film to watch. And even harder to eat after you watch it. We need to know these things. I have been a vegetarian for most of my life for ethical reasons and I did not know most of this awVoice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Setful stuff.

I thought that it might be gory and I wouldn't be able to watch it. The gory parts of the documentary were very few and were necessary and done in such a way that you learned from it. This DVD has changed the way my entire family eats, grocery shops and since I purchased this DVD I have encouraged everyone I know to buy it. I tell anyone who will listen what I have learned from this DVD. There is nothing like it (in my opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"This documentary showed a lot of what is wrong with the industry, a lot which I already knew, but some stuff I didn't. Granted I have taken more time than most people to find that stuff out. A lot of my friends who watched it were dismayed by what was going on. Everyone should watch this, the food industry has long gotten away with what they've been doing and it's time people found out about it. Granted most people don't have the willpower to tell them no and will continue on with their lives never giving this another thought, but maybe some people can do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Should See This","review":"I think the information presented in this documentary should be common knowledge for all Americans. Its really important to understand where our food comes from. This is not an animal rights slaughter film, its about the commercialization and processing of the food in this country. Its eye opening and I think everyone should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see!","review":"FOOD, INC. is very EYE OPENING! Meat just doesn't taste the same now. My husband refused to watch it (because he loves steak) but I put it on while he was in the room... he couldn't quit watching either. After reading Mad Cowboy and now watching this, the menu in our house has definitely changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth is Out at Last","review":"This movie gives a comprehensive understanding of the BIG AGRI BUSINESS machine and how it ruins our human qualities and the sacredness of life. Food, health, honesty, animals and people manipulated for the sake of money. It is cruelty to animals and ultimately cruelty to humanity. Hope is there though in the farmers and people who refuse to operate under this AGRI DICTATORSHIP. You must see this and share it with everyone.

Opened my eyes about what food to buy and where to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye opener","review":"Im so happy I purchased this DVD it has shed so much light on whats going on in the meat industry. All the deception that we are not even aware of. How our meat and chicken is being mass produced for the sake of making more money and how our health is not even an issue to these big corporations. If you want to know whats really going on in the meat industry get this DVD after seeing this you will never eat meat the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must see!","review":"This movie is so thought provoking that I've decided to send copies to everyone I know. It is really eye-opening to discover where our food is coming from and why this nation's continues to pack on the pounds.Many parts made me angry; others made me sad. Overall, it's definitely changed how I view food -- what I eat and chose to buy. This documentary should be shown in schools, at town hall meetings and on regular television.I, for one, will be contacting my Congress people to demand some changes because if things continue down the same path, America is in big trouble!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth hearts!","review":"Bought it before Oprah show and since Oprah did a show about it I think there is no need to speak more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Film for Everyone to See","review":"Film clearly illustrates disturbing trends in the food industry. We see how an industry dominated by a few players may be offering less healthy food, poor living environments for animals, and unsanitary practices. The most disturbing segment involves how Monsanto can mistreat farmers because of their size. The film presents some alternatives that may redirect our shopping for food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your eyes","review":"It is our responsibility as a consumer to understand and change our food system.

Especially, if you like to eat what is good for you and have some empathy for animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crosses genres between documentary and horror","review":"Watching this was more traumatizing than the most horrendous horror movies I've seen. It calls for major introspection. The current food production system is based upon utter cruelty to animals, exploitation of unskilled workers, and it keeps the lower-income masses ill and obese. It's all founded upon corruption.There must be spiritual and moral ramifications from eating food from this system. I also wonder what it does to our bodies. A week before watching this, I read a news article that American kids are reaching puberty now at hitherto unknown ages: down to age 8. Could it be from all the hormone-laced meats?Many cannot afford the alternatives, but for those who can, buying fresh, cruelty-free, free-range, grass-fed meats and organic fruits/veggies is the way to beat the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to grow my own food","review":"This film shows what happens in the food industry, especially with the meat products. There were parts of the film difficult to watch because of the manner in which the animals are kept. And it makes it very worrisome when I purchase a pound of ground meat at the grocery. It has given me insight into which producers are more humane and may provide a safer product. I, personally don't eat meat but my family does. Fortunately, I have the income to make a choice to buy a better product but a lot of consumers do not have that choice. Just shows that corporations, whether the food industry, energy industry, financial industry, or pharmaceutical industry control many of our choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food, Inc.

Not overly graphic yet still gives an honest look into where our food comes from. Great movie for someone who is just getting interested in food truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really interesting","review":"A nice little peek behind into how our food is made. Really enjoyed it. (Now I need to think about how to interpret/isolate/adjust for the slant. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not surprised...","review":"Listen I have been to one too many crowded farms. This movie reinforced my suspiscions about mass production. Of course I love my soda and dollar menu meals, but really I have always needed a little push to break my bad habits. This movie has done it. After our fridge and freezer emptys out we are buying from the farmers market only. Our future plans involve adding a greenhouse, composter, chickens, and goats to our property. Convience has spoiled us all. No wonder it's so difficult to lose weight with the crap we are buying and consuming. I highly recommended this eye opening film to every person who shops at a supermarket instead of the farmers market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for an excellent film","review":"I have read all the 1-star reviews and know some aspects of the story can be controversial. However the film tries to make its point clear in hope to raise awareness of current problems in our food industry and in my opinion it does this job perfectly. We should appreciate the film's effort in changing the way we think of food as a consumer, and because of this film I would like to take part and change the world with every bit--consume more certified organics and eat lots of veggies and minimal (eventually zero) meat. Thank you for an excellent film and for changing the world for better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done!","review":"Very educational and well put together documentary. Really touches basics on how and why our food industry does what it does and how they become the winners; while us, wanting to eat 'real, organic, natural from nature' foods are the losers who have to continue to fight against a main-stream money making industry where profit is the highest gain, not our health. Watched it on Net-Flix a few times. I always buy organic and raw and support our smaller growers because of the added health benefits and hopes they will be able to compete more effectively with the top conglomerates who rule in food manufacturing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major eye opener!","review":"I recommend this documentary to anyone living in The U.S.A. who eats meat and non-organic fruits & vegetables. They reveal many flaws with the FDA and how major food corporations are getting away with bullying the smaller competition. The meat industry alone is turning into a monopoly. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking!","review":"Well done. Organic is an overused marketing term. REAL FOOD would be a better descriptor. In truth, real food is expensive and it is hard to find. This movie expertly illustrates WHY that is...and it is scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains a lot about how I've been feeling","review":"I echo the sentiments of most of the other reviewers.This film was INTENSE.I have felt like crap from the age 25 onward and now I understand why.I will never eat meat again.

I will buy local every chance I get.Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening Experience - Don't miss this for you and your family","review":"This film has truly changed the way I select my groceries and what I choose to feed my family.

I had to read nearly 24 books to get to the information in this film and the film is easier to watch than reading all those books! This is a message that will assist individuals in making important decisions about their nutrition and the foods that they purchase. It is about how to rebuild our own communities and our own health one bite at a time. It is about assisting our neighbors who are less fortunate right now and strengthening them for healthier lives too. I see that Oprah talked about this film on her show and interviewed Michael Pollan about his new book. I want to share this with everyone I know...I have shared it with nearly 50 friends so far and I see one online DVD service is offering it free for viewing.This is vital information for us all - very positive and honest look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary But Great Info","review":"Food Inc. takes a look at how the business of food is actually taking a turn for the worse. Instead of bringing up the quality of the food we eat, companies are focusing on profits at all cost. This doc shows how companies exploit the working force (illegals) as well as fight for the right not to tell you what is in the food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food Inc","review":"This DVD is basically a documentary about how meat is processed in this country and it was very informative. I purchased it after hearing about it on the Oprah Winfrey show. After watching it 3 times, I became a vegetarian at the age of 56 years old. It changed my life and made me realize that a lot of the sickness and disease we suffer from today is a direct result of what we eat. I am healthier and in better physical condition than when I was a carnivore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bursting With The Usual Liberal Prejudices","review":"The movie presents as bad things: the USA, oil, the military, carbon, meat, coal, cars, corporations, profits, banks...

Watch this movie to see how really stupid the extreme left gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"Interesting info but delivered in a boring format.

BUY LOCAL, organic, and only from farms with free range chickens, pigs, and grass fed cows. It's worth the extra money. If you care about your family's health -- vote with your store selections. The more people demand good, heathly food, the more it will become available."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opener","review":"I liked this dvd because it didn't gross me out about food, instead I found it helpful and educational so now I can make better food choices for my family.

Government regulations in the name of safety mean small farms and small processing plants cannot afford the mandated equipment. Big companies can lobby government to get rules written and subsidies for their products. Stop subsidizing corn production and stop diverting corn to make ethanol.If corporate managers and directors at competing companies are not accountable when they have to keep their customers from migrating to non-industrial farming, what makes the film makers or their on-screen speakers think that the USDA can do a better job if there were just more laws?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely one-sided","review":"Food, Inc. gets two starts because it was an entertaining yarn. However, it presents a small fraction the information needed to give the viewer a complete picture of an enormous industry. It doesn't even make any apologies for it. Worse yet, what is presented as fact is most often opinion.I don't know when it became commonplace for documentaries to be so one-sided, but the trend has ruined the genre for me. I assume it started with Michael Moore, but who really cares. Not a single time in this show did the director have anyone present a dissenting opinion.Unless you are just looking for some material to support your opinion that the food industry is the embodiment of evil (with the exception of small organic farmers who are akin to saints), I would pass on this if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fond of the Amazon video experience","review":"I would much rather watch my videos on whatever media I have invested my money in to purchase instead of being locked down to my desktop. This is the only movie purchase I will ever make through Amazon's video system. I own a Mac and was not allowed the priviledge of actually downloading the video to my iPad. \\"Food\\" was ok. It would have been awesome on my own terms, but on Amazon's terms it was merely ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very easy to talk smack if you have the money..","review":"I understand that if you have money to eat all organic food you should do it; it's our responsability to try to eat healthy and big companies to tell us what are we eating.In the other hand, if we stop the former way of producing food, and we do it how we used to do it in 1950's we can only feed 1/3 of the human population, i can't see 4 billion people dying..try to change the way YOU eat don't bother other people, because if you don't know what is hunger, disease or starvation keep you opinions to yourself...Norman Borlaug thank you so much for saving a billion lives (yes! a BILLION! A WHOLE BILLION!), while the producers of this mockumentary saved....how many?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie... everyone should see it!","review":"This movie is very informative; you will definitely be much more informed after watching this movie!

The film is well-made and persuasive (which is why I give it four stars), although a bit one-sided (which is why I didn't give it five stars). It was very informative, though, and by the end, I was all ready to jump on their bandwagon. But, I like to research the opposing views before making my decisions, so I went to the one-star reviews - and they actually make some good points. While I agree with much of this film's arguments, I think it serves best as a starting point for discussion. So I recommend the film - I think it's right for people to learn more about where their food comes from - but I caution against accepting everything the filmmakers say without looking at opposing views first.

Its intent is to shock you into eating organic and purchasing from local markets only. Of course buying local is better for you. Of course not ingesting pesticides is healthier. There are no REAL steps for solving the problem, nothing that you could grab onto and move forward. Just the impending doom to the planet because you happen to need to eat.

I have changed the way I now purchase food for me and my family- and I have to tell you- I'm feeling a whole lot better <health wise> just from the little changes that I've made. So why the 1 star rating- this documentary is brought to you by the same people who brought you \\"an Inconvenient Truth\\" (which were not so truthful).. so until all the accusations are vetted out on Food Inc.. I will reserve that 5th star until the truth is documented.

Farmers can't even be farmers anymore. They are so regulated by big corporations. The widespread uses of antibiotics sure explains the current rise in infections that cannot be cured with ordinary antibiotics. I have watched the movie 3 times now, and am still learning more each time. If anyone wants to learn more about our food sources, and what goes on behind the scenes...this movie is a must.

Like some of the other reviewers have stated, the production value on this series is a bit lacking, but the sheer wealth of footage and detailed information MORE than compensates for this. Out of all the series covering the Eastern Front during WW2, this has by far the best battle footage. You will see plenty of stuff that you probably won't see in any other series, which by itself makes it worth the purchase. The time spent covering detailed tactics, weapons, commanders, etc. may bore the casual viewer, but the hardcore buff will be delighted. HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usa v.s Germany World War II","review":"The Animals was an exciting story.The setting of the story in Germany in 1944.The main characters in the book were Clay, Danison,and Dulon.My favorite character was Clay becouse he was very smart.My favorite part of the book was when Clay crashed into a German Army base.I would recommend this book to friends my age who like stories about war because it is very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Everything I asked for .

This book will open your eyes to just how vulnerable a caring loving family was to cold cruel criminals that preyed on them as they sought to complete their family circle through adoption facilitators. The calculated lies and deception this average American family were dealt and the strength and faith that carried them through their ordeal makes a story that reads like no other story you've ever read about adoption. Why they chose adoption facilitation over the internet and what they now know as the warning signs is a part of the story. Told by a mother who's heart and spirit was near breaking through this virtual and in reality journey, she could easily be your neighbor next door or just down the street. Justice of a kind does prevail and healing, hope and love ultimately overcome the nightmare of the cruelest con.

Computers have advanced so much in the past 10 years, the computer parts of the book should be obsolete. Therefore, I think the author was thinking slightly ahead of his time.The Academy is where super genius kids are sent to go to school. They can get away from other kids that pick on them at the regular schools.However, there are experiments being done on the teenagers. One teen decides to go ahead and allow the head of The Academy use his brain to attach it to a computer. Another child's brain is taken against her will.

I will never, never buy a Samsung again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagued by sound problems","review":"The picture on this TV is great; it rivals many of the Sony TVs. However, this TV is plagued by constant sound problems. After 2 weeks of light usage, the left speaker went out. It only comes back on if you raise the volume past 25 and it stays on for a while. Then it thens back off. This problem isn't isolated to this model either. If you read the reviews on Amazon for the TX-R2036 model, that 20\\" Samsung is also plagued by the same speaker problems. As of right now, for that model, more than 5 users have posted the exact same speaker problems.In addition, the output of the TV has a constant hum. It is very noticeable when you have headphones or when you have the output plugged into a subwoofer. The hum causes the subwoofer to constantly grumble, making it impossible to watch TV.I strongly recommend staying alway from these Samsung CRT TVs until they get it together with the speaker issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This is the 3rd TV of this model I've had. I have returned the previous 2 to the point of purchase for an exchange due to what seems to be an all too common right speaker malfunction. It also randomly shuts off. The first was dead right out of the box, the second speaker died less than 30 days after purchase, this third one lasted 10 months. Samsung has refused to repair this tv. There are 2 months of warranty left BUT labor is not covered except for the first 3 months. This is the final straw for me. I will never even consider a product made by Samsung. I will also check other brands to make sure they are not re-branded Sansung units. I would encourage others to be wary of the shabby workmanship and customer service that this company offers. This is completely unacceptable in this day in age.

I'm now currently going round and round with the customer service department. They want to charge me more than the tv's worth just to fix it. Not only that, but I've never dealt with a more obstinate customer service department that tries really hard to make the consumer feel like they're making their problems up, rather than fixing them.DO NOT BUY THIS TV!

Some suggestions were a blown fuse in the oven. Pursuing this route, I then discovered the oven panels cannot be removed with common tools because they use some unconventional screws in a few places. They use Phillips head screws for all but a few screws. So the oven is off to junk pick-up after only 13 months.

So after 14 months of use I was just getting used to the \\"new\\" machine, and now I don't have to worry about it because it died. Now I did not expect it to last as long as my original model, but 14 months?? Very disappointed. Also, I don't know what to buy now.

Honestly, it got old after the first two chapters. Also, the writer completely forgot Charles IS Lilandra's acknowledged consort, according to the comics. An annoying error to be sure.She wastes the other characters as well. Beast is only here for snappy one liners. Gambit (without Rogue - BORING!) has powers utterly unlike his in the comics.

I would think twice before you order this product. My husband took the microwave apart and found that the turn table motor was stripped. I was able to find the part online so we will have to repair this ourselves at a cost of $61.00. I understand any product can turn out to be a lemon but having a one year warranty is no good unless you live in the are of a repair shop so beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Microwave Oven","review":"I love the Sharp Microwave/Convection Oven. I had a previous Sharp Carousel II Microwave Convection Oven that finally broke after 20 years of service. I loved it and wanted to get a duplicate. The control panel was covered with glass and even after using every day for 20 years the writing on the controls was clearly legible and not worn off as happens when the typeface is merely Printed On.After reviewing all the Sharp Microwave/Convection Ovens I found that only the Stainless Steel Model duplicated what I knew and loved. The Stainless Model is the only model with a glass covered control panel.The Sharp Features are superior. The REHEAT function is automatic and works perfectly. The DEFROST feature defrosts without cooking the food. I use the convection oven feature during the holidays to cook/reheat casseroles, dressing, sweet potatoes, etc. adding another oven to my kitchen when I have 30 people to eat and need more oven capability.This oven is great and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Oven/Micro - Very Poor Reliability","review":"This is a great oven/microwave combination but the reliability is terrible.

Now the turntable stopped again and it doesn't work. With no warranty I've had it with this thing. After reading lots of reviews it seems impossible to find a convection microwave that works without repairs and that lasts for years.

After about five years, the door open sensor broke. We might have had it repaired then, but bought a new one instead as there were holes developing in the back. Last week, the new one died - the carousel slipped, causing an arc against the back panel which developed into holes, and the microwave died. Although we did not see this happen with the first one, that is probably what happened with it as well.We've read about both of these problems in the negative reviews on this site, which complain about poor reliability and shoddy design and manufacture. Although we did love this model when it worked, losing two of them has forced us to move to Panasonic, even though the trim kit and cabinet installation poses some expense and inconvenience tantamount to switching cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never buy a Sharp microwave again","review":"After owning a Sharp microwave for 12 years, we naturally decided to buy the latest Sharp model.The turntable on this model began to hesitate after a month.

I love the convection/microwave combo. I have had two other brands that quit after two years each. The third time I paid more and got a Sharp because it had such great reviews. Don't believe them.From the start, the microwave function was slow, weak but I could live with that. This unit will NOT cook microwave popcorn correctly. It takes so long, some popped corn is burnt before all of it is popped. Again, I could live with that because I don't care much for the microwave type anyway.THE CONVECTION FUNCTION:But the convention. That has to work, that's what I paid extra for instead of straight microwave oven.After less than seven months, this Sharp model's convection no longer works. It preheats but when you place the food in and program to bake, it no longer bakes. It just turns but you can see the heating element never comes back on.I am disgusted. Sharp should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Sharp","review":"From day 1 this unit couldn't manage to melt shortening.

Poor customer service response. 60 miles total shuttling for repair work? Not a chance, it's going back to the dark hole it crawled out of.

I wish I had kept the first one, because I could have replaced the newer broken door with the old door! It also began to loose its heating power. These ovens cook very well when new. The interior size is great and you can cook just about anything in them. They really bake well. The problem with this oven is that it is made with cheap plastic parts that wear out quickly. I just purchased a panasonic stanless steel microwave/convection oven with the same dimensions. It has excellent reviews. Hopefully it will be made better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Unless you Have To","review":"I had to buy this model to fit in the space after the other Sharp microvave died after 10 years. The first problem was that the door wouldn't pop open when the button was pushed. Had to take time to locate a Sharp Service Center, leave it for a week. Now the door opens, but slowly. It also has a metallic sound when it opens and closes. Seems more cheaply made than the one I replaced.

Just one night of wearing and my chest looked completely smooth. I didn't experience any redness after wearing it all night, other than maybe the first minute after I pulled it off.

To make it stay in place at night, grab a t-shirt or rolled up towel, wear some kind of a tank top or tighter fitting top to bed to help keep it in place and put the rolled up towel or tshirt between your breasts after you put the pad on and it helps keep the pad in place all night so you don't have to worry about it! I have used rubbing alcohol to clean mine. I spray it on a let it sit for a while and then I rinse off in really hot water and that seems to help keep the stickiness way longer. Plus I don't use a lotion or anything at night. I put that on in the morning so that it doesn't make the stickiness go away. I make sure to wash my chest before and put it on after it's dry. And that seems to help it stick really well..

I was very impressed, you need to be consistant with this product because the results fade after a day. When used for an hour the results do not last long at all so I suggest you sleep with this on. If you are in a hurry and need a quick fix for an event or special night then put it on for an hour and it will do the trick for the evening. What a great product and a good alternative to plastic surgery, not to mention Way more affordable! I now use this product along with an anti wrinkle chest cream and it's working great. Always make sure your chest is clean with no creams or lotions on it before applying, put the chest cream on After you peel off the pad. I hope this review helps :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!

Yeah, it's temporary I'm sure, but when you use it every night, you renew the effect.I'm 49 and was starting to feel like my chest is what gave my age away first. I started wearing higher tops and no necklaces to draw your attention to it. After the first night wearing this pad, I could see the difference. I wake up in the morning to smooth skin. Some nights I put up higher, closer to my neck, other nights in the middle of my chest. I'm wearing whatever top I like and necklaces again. I could not be happier with the results.I'm not sure how long it will last, and even if it lasts 60 days, I do think it's still over priced. I've washed it once so far and the stickiness got better, so I'm hopeful I can go the full 60 days with it.

So I bought one without expecting anything, but after ONE night, my pretty deep lines were GONE. I couldn't believe it! It is very comfortable to wear and it is barely noticeable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars though is because it can make you look a little red/rashy when you take it off (I sleep with it so maybe I am leaving on to long?). The red disappears after about an hour though. Still, if you have sensitive skin, start slow.

It was too the point where I'd only wear higher neck shirts or like huge necklaces so that no one would notice my chest wrinkles. These things are a miracle--I've worn it ever night for the last 4 nights and no more deep wrinkles! Of course, it hasn't helped w/ the wrinkles I've developed over time---I'll work on that with pricey creams and maybe laser treatments after this baby is born.

Yeah the sticky doesn't last as long as I would like, especially since I pay almost $30 for it (that's why the 4 instead of 5 stars), but it's definitely worth it because my chest looks so much better than before. It lasts me about a month and a half. Part of the reason I think it lasts so long for me is that I do sleep mostly on my back (when I'm falling asleep or if I have trouble sleeping, I spend a lot of time on my side though). Perhaps the more one sleeps on their side, the more quickly it loses its stick because more stress is placed on it...of course, I'm just guessing at this point.

The dialog drops out (dead silence) in several places while the actor's lips are still moving. I could have overlooked the horrible production quality if the story and acting had been good. The movie abruptly ends with no resolution whatsoever.

This has to be the worst movie I have ever saw in my life. I don't think it gets any worse than this movie. The quality was bad, it looked lke a home video, and the acting was terrble.

The pros are: its easy to change designes, lightweight, strong blade, and full color(only in full dark). Cons: blade doesn't go in all the way, takes 2 C cells, light can break, red filter is stronger than the rest.the kit comes with 3 color filters: blue, red, green. the red is stronger than the rest,and the green filter turns yellow with the light behind it. if you want a green blade, use blue and green. it also comes with 3 sound crystals, 2 blade emiters, about 10 handle attachments, the adapter, the red blade for the darth maul version. over all, this is a preety good toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to go Hasbro","review":"Toy makers are becoming increasingly lazy....and everyone loves it.

I told them what my problem was with this toy. They responded with in minutes. They said that they were very sorry about the problem and that they would refund me and replace the parts that were missing. I was pleased to hear that and that they didn't give me a hard time about it! My son loves the toy. He's 12. He knows so much about light sabers and he collects them.

He has been a Star Wars fan since he could talk and begged for this exact set for his birthday. He was so excited when he unwrapped it, but I was a little afraid that it would just be another over-hyped cheap toy. I was wrong. He has made so many different lightsabers that he never gets bored. He loves that he can change colors and sounds and spends hours building new combinations. I recommend this for any true Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sith Or Jedi?

These things are all there; HOWEVER, Cobra has not published a software update since August of 2006. Consequently, all of the directions are getting less and less accurate as time passes. I live in a city with lots of new highways, and you can't get around here at all with this GPS because it doesn't recognize any of the new roads. To choose now, I would choose a unit that updates automatically rather than waiting for the manufacturer to show some concern for the accuracy of its products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cobra GPS","review":"So far I find the Cobra unit is very accurate and has all the features I need. I like the large screen and voice directions. The only problem is I can't get an additional windshield holding mount. So I have to move the holder from vehicle to vehicle. Cobra does not offer additional mounts for the 4000 unit. Overall for the price it is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable, Entertaining Scholarship","review":"The year is 1300, and the village of Montaillou in the south of France is full of heretics. One brave man, Jacques Fournier, Bishop of Pamiers, embarks on a brave Inquisition to get rid of them. For years, he interviews everyone in the village and keeps meticulous notes. The everyday gossip, scandal and concerns of the common medieval man are documented here in a detail unsurpassed in any other primary source. In this book, French Historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie studies these documents and presents an incredible portrait of everyday life: 'love and marriage, gestures and emotions, conversations and gossip, clans and factions, crime and violence, concepts of time and space, attitudes to the past, animals, magic and folklore, death and beliefs about the other world.' An astounding book sitting on the border between history and anthropology. And as expected, the French have been fall-down funny for centuries. [HistoryHouse.com]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Translation of a Flawed Book","review":"LeRoy Ladurie's original study (in French) based on inquisitorial records, while marred by numerous mistranslations, misunderstandings and misuse of the sources, nevertheless, had a somewhat magisterial quality about it. It is charming and well-written. In the hands of an expert, aware of its limitations, Montaillou has some value; to the layperson: beware. The translation, moreover, is truly bizzare. Part I is translated fully; Part II severly abridged. There was no rhyme or reason for this. It is far better to read the French original. If you're a novice or don't read French, avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent historical document","review":"I was looking for a good review of the inquisition and life at that time.

He helps you begin the process yourself, seeing that the need for change that we see in the world today begins with personal change in each of us. He points out that we often stay an arms-length away from really making our personal contribution, looking outside ourselves or waiting for someone else to deliver, before we move into action. Meanwhile, we continue to blame, complain, hide behind our fears or those thrust upon us. He gives a compelling call to action for each of us to answer the call of what he terms our \\"ultimate responsibility\\". Inspiring new vision. Great stories.

I actually have a hard time finding certain passages because of the unnatural way that the \\"study centers\\" are inserted into the middle of the text. I do not find the margin helps to be very helpful at all. The dictionary in the back is too short to be of much use. I'd rather have a concordance than the multiple blank pages for notes in the back. And as trivial as it may sound, the cover design is just plain ugly.Ultimately, I find the features of this study Bible to rarely add to my study of the Scriptures.

Not being familiar with this author I had no expectations. So much has changed for the majority of women since this book was originally written. It may be good for those of an older generation who have not let themselves broaden their view of female sexuality/fantasy & etc. Perhaps at another time the book was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and repetitive stories","review":"The book is made up of mini stories and i found that the overall context was repetitive and lost my interest almost immediately.

Most of the lesbian stories involved women being turned on by dogs or donkeys. I was pretty disappointed.

There was no sensuality here. Perhaps it's because most of the text was written by amateurs but good LORD. If I were writing something that I thought would end up in a book, I'd take more care to make it interesting.There's a distinct lack of imagination AND character in our society. This book makes that painfully obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"bury it","review":"The title of this book should be changed to \\"My Secret Sewer.\\" A garden?

While there's some good stuff here, some of it is disgusting beyond belief, and no, I'm not talking about the lesbian scenarios. I'm not advocating champagne and roses, and I have nothing against red-blooded, no holds barred, even explicit sex. But some of this stuff is simply sleazy, degrading and masochistic. Bestiality? Incest? Well, as I've heard it put, erotic is when you use a feather and kinky is when you use the whole chicken. Yeah, I know some of you will say I'm a prude. Well, shoot me.

This is written by a woman to satisfy the lecherous needs of sex-starved pansy type men, who just get excited by reading such material.

This just gave him more information to keep lie going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly over-simplified","review":"As other folks have said, this may be a good starting point for some GIs and families. It provides a very basic introduction to and overview of possible symptoms and behaviors.There was, and may still be a glut of these around locations where GIs return from overseas, and scattered through administrators' offices. Sad, as the book is the behavioral health equivalent of an episode of Oprah, long on generalizations and fairly obvious statements and conclusions, low on critical thought and substance.For veterans who have been deployed in locations without the amenities and security of LSA Anaconda, the introduction, with its attempt at establishing credibility via shared experience, may be insulting -combat veterans are often prickly about those who claim to share risks and hardships. Additionally, single GIs, the ones who cannot start or maintain a relationship, will likely find little help, this is a text aimed more at married folks and families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Classic","review":"Pippi Longstocking is a children's classic. Kids can exercise their imagination, while following the exploits of Pippi who gets to do all the things kids think they would try if they were allowed to live unsupervised. At the same time, its all done with a wonderful innocence. One gets the impression that Tommy and Annika have the best of both worlds; they get to experience exciting adventures through their friendship with Pippi, but at the end of the day they get to go home to the security of responsible and loving parents.This English translation is especially nice, because it uses the original Swedish illustrations. So many of the English translations have been re-illustrated by different artists, and lost some of their charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best illustrations ever for Pippi","review":"It is needles to review this great book, it is still the best classic book for children. It is sad that this old edition is the only one with great illustrations and enough in number. All of the later editions have very few illustrations and their style is kind of whimsical, definitely not for little children, in fact my children exclaim: \\"What an ugly picture\\" every time they turn the pages. I would love to see it published again in the same style with no any changes in the text or illustrations. I am sure many parents would love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple + Powerful = Elegance!","review":"One of the awesome books I have ever come across. I am a visual person and understand things better when depicted graphically. I purchased this book after hearing raving review from a friend of mine. Sure, in a matter of hours, I felt like I had hands-on experience on the 3D modeling software - SketchUp. I highly recommend this book to anyone on the go and don't have time to pour over \\"text\\" based books or boring lengthy software manuals. Simplicity and powerful elegance are the design parameters behind this meticulously made book! Kudos to the author of this book and I expect more interesting releases on construction modeling from this great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunbeam Heated Mattress Pad","review":"We've had the Sunbeam Heated mattress pad for 2 years and it's absolutley wonderful! It puts out just the right amount of heat and with the 10 different levels of warmth even the coldest Wisconsin nights are made comfortable. Probably the nicest feature is it has two heat zones so if your sharing the bed you can each have your own level of warmth.The wirless remotes are great but if they batteries get low they don't work as well.

I noticed water pooling up again this evening and found a pinhole sized hole in the spout!Every time I turn the water on, some comes out of the aerator and into the sink (good) and some drips down the spout and onto the top of the sink and counter.Stainless steel isn't supposed to do this.I expected more, especially after ponying up a couple of hundred dollars for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong part included","review":"The box came with the wrong faucet bracket.

I don't overwhemingly enjoy this album, but respect it nonetheless. I'd advise some of the other reviewers below to do a little more homework and understand what the Ex has meant to socio-political music over the last 20 years...not to mention their contribution in merging punk/jazz and improvisational styles and some of the most amazing polyrhythmic drumming and rhythms I have ever heard and/or seen.Sad that this site only offers a few Ex recordings, when I myself have around 20. Please, to those who appreciate real music with a human message and performers who actually \\"practice what they preach\\", seek out the Ex and all of their side projects (Kletka Red, etc.).

Secondly, Tortoise live is a show you shouldn't miss. Thirdly, the beginning moments of this CD (except for the annoying guitar noise) sounded pretty decent. Imagine your surprise and horror when you skip ahead to track 2 and hear somebody singing off-key. Tortoise deserves better than to collaborate with a group that does nothing more than make noise and put in under a facade of 'avant-garde'. The Ex is not even in the same league musically. Save your money and buy 'Beacons of Ancestorship', or any other Tortoise CD, for that matter. If you've already made the mistake of buying this CD, all hope is not lost. You can use this CD as a coaster, or to make lemonade with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad idea","review":"A heavily indulgent partnership is barely formed with this unneeded Fishtank session.

These aren't even 'poor vocals' that have character to them which grows on a listener, they're just plain annoying. If your a listener that wants enjoyable sound, stay away from this album.

Or perhaps the sound of ten thousand cats being chopped to bits in a combine.. or any number of otherwise god-awful noises.

I honestly feel pain and sorrow for the poor CDs that get this garbage encoded on their surface. I feel for the machines that have to press the albums. I feel sorry for anyone and anything that ever comes into contact with this \\"album\\". It's just so completely awful that language barely scratches the surface in describing just how mind-bendingly audaciously egregiously offensive this album is to existance itself. Don't buy it if you value your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a wonderful CD, especially for anyone who is totally foreign to Nusrat's music. The first six tracks are qawwali (the Sufi music that Nusrat was known for making famous outside of the subcontinent)in the more traditional form, while the last two tracks are charming pop songs with Qawwali vocals on top. The CD contains tracks from over a half dozen of Nusrat's various other CD's, many of which are hard to find today. All the tracks are refreshing and very easy to get into. My favorite is 'Buha Aes Wele Kine Kharkaya' - track 6 - have a listen if you're in doubt of the other tracks - i can guarantee you'll love it! This CD is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRULY INSPIRATIONAL AND IMPORTANT WORK","review":"Should be read by everyone who is in debt or plans to be in the future (which is probably everyone over 18). This book is amazing in it's simple, thoughtful approach to debt management both financially and emotionally. Mr. Mundis gives a heartfelt, rational, very sympathetic yet never condescending narrative to those of us who have been debtors over the years and have the bills and debts to prove it. Wish I read this when I was 18. Would have saved me a bundle. But it's never too late to start. A $7 book (less through Amazon, of course) that could save you literally thousands. Really. A book to be read over and over again. It's been around 10 years so you know people must still be needing it. A truly special, important book. Thank you, Mr. Mundis for an eye-opening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"There is not a good example of a debt reduction plan in this book. By following the suggestions here, it would take my family 10+ years to get out of debt. I am using Mary Hunt's guide and will be completely debt-free in less than 3 years. Also, with a degree in English, I found this book aggravating to read. What's with all the subtitles? And random curse words? (No point is made by using them!) I am certain that Debtors Anonymous has helped many people get out of debt, but I was not impressed by the principles described in this book.

(\\"Stop charging\\", and \\"leave the credit cards at home\\" are very basic recommendations)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensible, useful, simple, and valuable","review":"Mundis's book is a straightforward and sensible way to look at your financial life and make it more responsive to your choices.

If you're ready to \\"surrender\\" to the fact that you have a problem and want help, the narrator provides it in a way that is non-judgemental and without condemnation. I was genuinely touched by the sincerity, clarity and compassion of the narrative. I was emotionally moved by the fact that the guidance I really needed had arrived. On the other hand, the author, at times, is hilarious as he takes you down a very entertaining and extremely helpful path toward solvency. Thanks to this tape, I'm on my way out, and done with debt for good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for people in serious debt with no knowledge of finances","review":"For my situation, this book was too rudimentary. I was looking for something that would give me startegies on how to payoff debt quicker. This book is not really about ways to payoff debt. It is more about learning how to spend less and seemed to be more of an advertisement for Debtors Anonymous. Things like \\"Try to go one day without using your credit card\\"... not for me. If you're in really bad shape and spend and spend without any way to stop then seek professional help, don't rely on this book.

After I followed the spending plan record ( Wow, do you honestly want to know what you are spending, this will open your eyes) and wrote all my debts down in black and white, I feel that I can tackle all my money issues in a clear and concise manner.After following this plan, I am now ready to move on to retirement planning, college savings, etc. If you are trying to get through today so you can get to tomorrow, this financial guide is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of it's kind","review":"This is the best guide to managing money and debt I've read.A few days after reading the book, I have a whole new grasp of how to get out of debt and stay out.

What shocked me was how well the writer understood my thinking and behavior - I thought he must be a mindreader! He knew all too well every rationalization and strategy we had used over the years to keep from facing our debt.Mr. Mundis has a simple and successful solution to debt: stop debting, one day at a time. If you think this is impossible, he will show you how. We are now debt-free, yet I reread this book occasionally for inspiration and to stay on the right path. If you are in debt - get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Debt Bible!","review":"I bought this book at least 10 years ago, when I was a single mom and deeply in debt. It completely changed the way I thought about debt and financial freedom. I titled it my Debt Bible because 10 years later, I still refer to it when I need a reminder or some inspiration. It's not about deprivation, it's about living a good life without having to go into debt. This book is awesome.

With this plan I will be out of debt-house and all--by 2005. It helps to see the light at the end of the tunnel! It is hard to believe that it works but it does. I was skepitcal like everyone is. But with the program and some hard work and determination it can be done. I have a support person that I write to weekly to keep my spirits up when things get rough. Definetly worth it!

The juxtaposition of theme, mood, bad music, and, low- budget production values make it laughable. The only good thing about this film is ESSY PERSSON in those outragous costumes!

It guides you through his working process, thoughts on art and life, as well as providing glimpses of his home, studio, darkroom, travels, family, etc. As a documentary, it's not really a work of art in itself, but more like hanging out with a really cool photographer, and learning all these great things along the way.

I had no idea that I was missing out on such good quality.Well, sometimes you win for losing. Instead of getting beaten up old paperbacks with boring cover art, I get perfectly formatted kindle editions with the sexier covers for $0.99 apiece!\\"Dead Game\\" was excellent, as were the first two novels in the series.

The first part focuses on the tools to be used, the second part on the building.If you want an introductionary guide to robotics this book doesn't do for you. If, otherwise, you want to buy a set of instructions to build a simple, non programmable robot just for the sake of it, this is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Book for Beginners","review":"This is an excellent book for beginners in the field of electronics and Robotics. It shows you how to start working with electronics with lots of photographs which clearly illustrate what needs to be done, for example how to use a multimeter and the helping hands and tools required.It also introduces one to mechanical calculations that may be required at a practical level.

There were problems from the start with the transmitter being too close to the spokes and hitting spokes after potholes. I was constantly adjusting the distance of the transmitter. Finally on a steep bumpy downhill the transmitter battery cover went flying off never to be found. Being a hard head I bought another one and affixed it to the fork using the second installation option. It lasted for 15 minutes of riding before that one went flying off never to be seen again. Maybe Sigma can find a better way to install the transmitter. I have had many cycle computers over the years and have never had the transmitter or part of it go flying off the bike.

The trim pieces surrounding the oven restrict the full-opening of the over-door to about 60-degrees, which presents conflicts when loading items. Our oven is chest-high, and the inability to fully open the oven-door makes what should be a simple task a bit of a struggle; you need one hand free to \\"hold the door open\\".

Looks like people are dropping these during the install, then returning and the factory/warehouse people aren't even refurbishing them.

Amazon took it back but will not even try to replace it again. Now I found that they charged me an extra $25 even though my invoice says $431.95. I'm very disappointed in Amazon.com at this point. Why are they still selling this online, but refuse to ship me another? Interesting.... I'm going with the Dacor over the range from a local dealer.

It cooks everything from meatloaf to pound cake evenly and locking in juices. I bought this because my other Sharp over the range microwave gave up after eleven years of constant use. I was used to the Sharp features which made it the logical choice. At the same time, I wanted to replace my conventional oven (also 11 yrs. old) because it never baked evenly.

The caution to not overcook was too late; it already bordered on mush. The vegetables had lost their colors and texture. I didn't know an unground garbonza could be mushy, but they were. It was difficult to imagine why a no-meat soup was SO greasy, and even more difficult to understand why veggie-bean soup needed any kind of vinegar, and this stuff was loaded with the Balsamic variety. I managed to eat 3 spoonfuls before tossing the rest. I will never again subject myself to Amy's GROTESQUE SOUP.

The biggest thing I didn't like was how greasy it is; it has way too much oil for someone who is used to a low-fat diet. Also, the amount of onion in the vegetable broth seems like an over-compensation for the lack of meat stock; it's overpowering. To make matters worse, the other ingredients came off as soggy (and I did not overcook). However, if you like oily broth and a lot of onion, you might like this soup. But I will not be purchasing it again; fortunately for me I only bought a single can at the health-food store rather than buying in bulk online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oily with a terrible aftertaste","review":"When I opened the can, the reddish-orange oil slick underneath the lid made me suspect that this wasn't going to be a good experience. I decided to give it a chance anyway and ended up regretting my decision. The soup wasn't too bad when I was eating it, aside from the mushy texture, but it left a terrible aftertaste that's still lingering five hours later, and I feel sick from all the grease. I've had other Amy's soups that were good (split pea, chunky vegetable), but you couldn't pay me to eat this one again.

Unlike efforts by other bands that have rearranged after a hiatus, \\"Different Eyes\\" shows that if a group's core focus is on producing great music, everything will fall into place. The sound is not so much a departure from their past work as it is a refocus on the band's musical purpose. And, as that founding members Adler, Flanders, and Belica remain the heart of the band, any OP fan--or anyone looking for a spiritual, distinguished experience--will love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Fahl-less","review":"Mary Fahl is THE sound of the October Project (as is Donald Fagan the Steely Dan sound, Adam Duritz the Counting Crows sound, etc.), and, without her, they are, alas, just another band.

With so many books out these days on Islam and its history, readers can afford to skip this one. The best part of this work is the illustrations. The photos in the inset are among the most beautiful I have seen in a while and keep the book from being a total washout.The authors set out to counter negative views of Islam and encourage religious tolerance in the West.

Jack doesn't do much \\"fixing\\" in this book - only one brief episode - which is unfortunate, since those subplots are always entertaining.Bottom Line: this novel doesn't stand very well by itself, and doesn't advance the overall \\"Jack vs The Otherness\\" theme of the entire series.

The emperor was in his 50's and the actress in her 30's and their romance lasted for the rest of their lives.Author Haslip does an excellent job of describing the times in Vienna during the later half of the 19th century.

This game was awful, the controls, story, mission, everything. The only neat thing is changing back and forth from a vehicle to a giant robot, and that isn't enough to carry a game.

Your not allowed to shoot people only buildings and vehicles. Hardly any people talk through the game. The cutscenes are short and boring so you won't miss anything if you skip the scenes.

A few more months now, it sticks just like my stainless steel pan.I was wondering what kind of cooking for those reviewers giving this a 4-5 stars, if they were genuine users.

All my meals, without exception, come out a mess because no matter how much oil I put, they stick and I have to scrape them out.The skillet is extremely heavy, you'll need to work out to be able to carry it and to put your food in plates (it almost fell on my foot once, and would have totally crushed my bones).Finally, after following all the instructions in the manual, rust started to show within few weeks. Ugly brown rust that gets on your finger when you swipe it on the skilletSo much work, so much time, and so much money spent on something I hate because I believed all the rave reviews here.

Folks squeamish about using oil probably won't care for this pan.It heats beautifully. Make sure to follow the instructions about not using high heat - as well as the other instructions.It is a pan with heft. Check the weight. Not for the weak wristed.The one thing, IMHO, that would be nice if it weren't so is the all-metal handles. They do get warm and may require a mitt.

In both cases, there are smoke marks in the same spot, on the inside right near a metal panel.I am of the opinion that this unit is not safe and seems to have a design or manufacturing defect. Also, the second unit we bought was noisier and seemed to have some sort of mechanical problem, based on the noise it made when in use.

These symphonies were recorded over different sessions in '72 and '73, but the transfers are warm, vital, and really generously show the depth of this great orchestra. A friend turned me on to Krips' work just recently, and I must say that this set must share some space on the shelf with some of the greatest recorded Mozart symphonies I have heard. A treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Mozart Cycle - 4 1/2 stars","review":"Josef Krips proves himself to be a fine Mozartian in this excellent cycle recorded in 1972-73 with the Concertgebouw. IMHO these recordings are as good as Bohm's more famous recordingsMozart: Symphonien Nos. 35-41and not that far behind those of Walter's mono recordings from the early 1950's and any of those by Szell. There is no romantic interpretation to be found here, just straight-up classic period Mozart. In fact, Krips' pace is quite similar to that of Walter, which is more relaxed than Szell (perhaps the greatest Mozart conductor to date), but still enjoyable. The playing of the wonderful Concertgebouw is also ideal (especially the strings) for Mozart. No matter how many other Mozart symphonies you own, your collection is somewhat lacking without this set. Those purchasing their first Mozart symphonies won't be disappointed with this set, but may be more comfortable with Szell or Bohm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone batteries","review":"I ordered two batteries for my and my wife's Nokia cell phones.

The music holds up, if you were into country music(not for me, I am afraid). Then there was the humor. What appeared to be funny, at the time, doesn't work now, years later, without the flow of the program with those country songs and pretty women. The Canadian comedian from the CBC did a pretty funny bit of the country news, and who could forget Mr. Samples and his phone number BR 549.

Although it has some interesting discussion of distributed algorithms its big let-down is the abysmal Java code that it contains. I cannot believe for one moment that any of this compiles, let alone works - it all generally looks like pseduo-code written for the purposes of illustration rather being of any practical value.Likewise I didn't find the material particularly helpfully structured or consistent in its level of detail.

There have been many other books on concurrent and distributed computing on Java before and after this book came out, so I suggest the reader buy this book for the theory, and use a more practical book for application. (Beginners in Java programming should also avoid looking at the code, as they will only pick up poor coding habits that will get them into trouble in a professional work environment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best practical book for distributed systems (that I could find)","review":"I got this book because I have been a fan of Garg's Elements of Distributed Computing ever since I first read it.

I just didn't get it. And based on the number of negatives this movie has received, it looks like I am not alone here. My advice is avoid this one.

But to sit through 2 hours of annoying people with a happy ending...who cares? I'm not sure if the girl's character was a case of bad casting or bad direction.The story with the mother was also frustrating, since we couldn't tell what was happening. Was she having memory flashbacks or psychic visions? Did she know the people who owned the houses or were they random? Was Saul cheating on her or was this related to her parents death?

I was rather annoyed with the hero in this one, as I recall, because he was acting like such a jerk with no good reason (well he had one that was rather good for the times but still seems rather weak considering Regina's family already had scandal aplenty.) However, it was a good opportunity to show their strong family bonds and endear the characters to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"This is a wonderful Mallory novel, of course, the Mallory family has it's way of working their way into one's heart, but reading Say you love me and Tender rebel first, and knowing Reggie was the \\"baby\\", i found this book to be wonderful. reggie and nicholas have this wonderful chemistry, and the uncles are hilarious. GREATLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"Before I say all the reasons I don't like this book, I'd like to point out that I'm sure its elements are appealing to some readers. We all like different things; I didn't like this one. I did finish it, but only because I have this thing about always finishing whatever I read. Lindsey relies on dialogue and action for this novel. Did I say action? Dear god, what with the beatings and kidnappings and running around, you get the sense that she's covering the complete lack of character development. The hero and heroine had all the usual qualities that romance heroes and heroines do, but they were just incredibly flat and cliched, as if their qualities had been randomly selected from a romance chart or phrase book and then inserted. I cared nothing for either of them, and found the hero to be weak and uninspiring. It was never clear why the characters liked each other; Lindsey never got into their heads. A weak attempt at the romantic historical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is the first of the Malory novels. I had read all the others but I could never find this one until now. I am sorry I waited so long. It was a very enjoyable story and I finally know the story of Nick and Regina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Delightful!","review":"This is the kind of book you pick up to read and get so lost in the story, that you forget your own personal life, time and place exist. Suddenly as you sadly finish the last line of the book, you realize you must return to reality and wonder what happened to several hours that have magically vanished out of your life while engrossed in this utterly delightful novel. Each character is well drawn and likeable and the story is gripping. This must be one of her most succesful heroines. Let's hope she continues to write more and more novels about the engaging Malorys in the years ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I have read 2 books of JL and that was the reason why I bought more books of her, she is a very talented author and has mastered her craft. But this book is quite disappointing. I don't agree with women being so martyr and Regina has been a martyr bride up to the end. How I wished she at least made Nicholas suffered more for what he did to her and not been so forgiving as if he's the only man on earth! But ofcourse, a couple united by God, should not be separated by any man or any circumstance for that matter. Still it's not a thrilling love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one JL !","review":"As I've come to expect JL's Malory novels I can't put down. I love the way Nick and Reggie argue up till the end and how she was determained to have him. And how James and Tony are always picking on him. It made me laugh so many times.

Nick is so sexy & charming. You are swept up in the story so fast you're half way through (like most JL books) before you even know it. The scenes are right before your eyes. Vivid. Wonderful characters, and yummy love scenes. Just so much feel good fun stuff. A keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"I thought this book was just awful. A most ridiculous plot and very unsatisfying. I'm just as willing as the next person to suspend disbelief, but this book required too much. The hero and heroine have the most ridiculous interaction and a year of anger and bitterness with each other that miraculously \\"poof\\" everything becomes instantaneously happy at the end. No building of trust, no getting to know each other and become friends, almost no romance at all. I'll be skipping Lindsey's books in the future because this one just made me mad. There are many better historical romance writers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but the audio cassette is disappointing!","review":"This is the first in the Malory series and I'm reviewing the audio cassette, the story itself s very good but the audio cassette version is very disappointing and boring because the American reader did not use English accents and she didn't even bother to use different voice sounds for each character! Love Only Once is about a young lady named Regina Ashton who by mistaken identity is abducted by Nicholas Eden who mistook her for his mistress and winds up tarnishing Regina's reputation which infuriates Reggie's very protective uncles the wealthy and powerful Malory brothers who later appear in their own stories in this series. I rate this 2 stars beause of the reader's lack of English accents and not making her voice sound different for all the different characters! The audio cassette is abridged and I really hope they rerecord it unabridged and with the proper accents and interesting changes of voice sounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beginning of a series","review":"I liked this book. Regina (I really don't like the nickname Reggie ;)) was great, spunky, full of life, a real joy to watch. Nicholas was a rake of first rate - handsome, with a devil-may-care attitude and guarding a nasty secret. The story was also quite intriguing ***spoiler warning***, although I would like the heroes to have some more alone time. It would also be nice if everything wasn't centered on passion - when she let him back in her bed, everything was fine? Ah well.Anyway, this is another of those 'Big Misunderstanding' stories, but it is executed very well and has plenty of intriguing supporting characters. I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, but Nicholas irritated me","review":"I liked the story, JL is a good writer. This is the frist book I have read from this author. I really did like the story except that Nicholas was a jerk and didn't deserve Regina.

I have read other books by this author and they have been passable, but this particular book was awful. The story is that a girl desperately wants a husband, so she has her uncles force a man (who doesn't want her) into marriage. After he reluctantly marries her, he dumps her off with his step mother and leaves the country. When the girl's uncles drag him back to England, he finds her pregnant, but accuses her of infidelity and denies that the child could be his. How could anyone find this romantic? In the last 5 or 10 pages of the book the guy admits that he simply wished to protect the girl from being his wife because he is a bastard, and then she easily forgives him for all of his sins. Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEVILISHLY EXCITING!!! I'VE READ THE WHOLE MALORY SERIES!","review":"I rather enjoyed the love affair between Reggie and Nicholas, she can manipulate anyone with her witty charm.

Most modern day antisemitism is caused by former communist propanganda and 1968 like students revolutionary grabage, an ideology that mostly tried to \\"exterminate\\" the Jewish FAITH and deny a state to the Jews, the state of Israel, but did NOT try to kill Jews physically.Also WHO IS MICHAEL MILKEN ??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time and Money","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. For one thing, it is very boring and poorly written. As far as the content is concerned, Goldhagen claims to be presenting new information, but he just regurgitates established facts and then twists them around to make them fit his interpretation, instead of making his interpretation fit the facts. I was also surprised to see that he used very few primary sources, which is a big no no when writing a scholarly work. In fact, scholars regard this book as so bad that a couple of them have gotten together and written a book about it. It is called _Goldhagen's Thesis_. Goldhagen has very little respect now in the historical community. There are plenty of well-written and informative books on the subject of the German people during the Nazi era (oral histories abound). Please read one of these credible books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguments against Goldhagen's \\"theory\\" lack common sense","review":"Not having the luxury of checking all of the historical record specific to, say, the police batallions, I must note that even if the entire book is inaccurate, wouldn't the mere scope of the holocaust REQUIRE the complicity of tens of thousands of ordinary Germans? Strong consideration should be given to the reliance any operation of this magnitude would have on human \\"initiative\\" and volunteerism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time - Disgraceful","review":"As an avid reader of WW2 history I found this book to be biased, flawed and almost unreadable. I am no racist or Holocaust denier, and what the Nazis did to the Jews, Slavs and other minority groups was absolutely terrible. However, if one wishes to read well researched historical facts about the people who were responsible then don't bother with \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\". If the publisher had any sense of reality or fact they would have laughed Goldhagen out of their office. I could go on, but it really isn't worth my time - don't waste yours on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prolix","review":"I rarely review anything on Amazon, but I was so taken aback by this \\"landmark\\" book that I felt something had to be said.I take issue not necessarily with the core thesis of the book, but the style in which it is written. Rarely, if ever, have I encountered a \\"major work\\" that is so overtly pedantic and densely unreadable as this. Apparently it had its genesis as an academic thesis and, dear god, does it show. I knew I was in trouble when the introduction - usually just a brief note about the book by the author or a third party - was some 25 pages long.The book could have made all of the same key points and arguments with far greater incisiveness and clarity in a volume half this size. And I say this about the absurdly drawn-out, repetitive language and style as someone who regards William Shirer's massive \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" (1,000+ pages) as one of the great non-fiction books of all-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable, Illogical","review":"Extremely turgid prose. Virtually unreadable. The logical leaps he makes would flunk a freshman logic course. The kind of book pseudo intellectuals will cite as authoritative when it's really just incomprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good Info, Poorly Written","review":"This book has some good info on the police battalions, the work camps, and the death marches, but I have several problems with this book. First Goldhagen is a horrible writer. His style is boring and he seems to toss in big words just to prove he knows them. Second, although this book is supposed to be a new view on the Holocaust and ordinary Germans it really isn't. Most of the information in the book that is supposedly new can be found in many other books. Third, the main point of the book is spelled out in the first couple of pages, but Goldhagen keeps repeating it over and over and over again throughout the book. It really becomes annoying. Finally, all of these things combined makes this a pretty forgettable book. All in all the book has some decent moments, but is poorly written, parts are boring, and the information that is supposed to be new really isn't. There are much better books about ordinary Germans and the Holocaust out there than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Subject, but Poorly Presented","review":"I truly expected a lot of this book before purchasing it, but was disappointed with the book from both (1) a literary standoing and (2) a factual and reasoning standpoint. On the literary side, this book will put you to sleep since reading Goldhagen is like reading a very long and boring college psychology paper: it is not reader-friendly although there are certain portions that I admired that I thought stood out quite well. - As for Goldhagen's analysis of the feelings of the \\"ordinary\\" Germans, his analysis is weak and spotty because his hypothesis is weak or poorly stated or poorly chosen and his arguments appear \\"forced\\" to agree with this limited hypothesis. - I feel the subject is very important, but that the author disapointed me since he could have done a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about racists by a racist","review":"I was hoping the book would dig into man's seemly inate ability to put others down. Wether it be German/Jew, Serbs/Muslims, Hutu/Tutsi or even Protestant/Catholic in Ireland many people can be drawn into hate. I believe the reasons the Holocaust came to be is it was the first time in modern history that a powerful and racist government came to world power for a long period of time. Yet even though the author said there were some examples of germans who tried to feed the Jews on the death marches and that many of the central Europeans who provided much of the labor to run the camps were very cruel. His basic premis is that Germans are a racist people who fostered their racist ideas for more than 100 years. I agree that the Holocaust was not hidden from the Germans and only a few knew about but I find it hard to believe there is something genetic or cultural about Germany that caused the Holocaust. By the way I am not German."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Shmonzes","review":"I have a PhD in history and know how personalagendas can distort scholarship. In the 1930s,Dr. Goebbels used widespread Jewish support for the Communist movement to construct a Jewish collective guilt for the Stalinist massacres--ludicrously blaming even anti-communist Jews, orthe vast unpolitical majority. Now Dr. Goldhagen uses the same techniques of tendencious and selective picking of sources to give a scholarly sheen to racist prejudice against Germans. That is why scholars, e.g. Norman Finkelstein and Alfred de Zayas, have condemned the book (just look at the damning reviews in Harvard's H-Net, written by people who actually know the subject). But since Amazon Books thought it ethical to sell this racist diatribe, what is next? Scholarship from the KKK, or from the Black Goldhagen, Leonard Jeffries, who indicted \\"ordinary Whites\\" as murderous \\"ice-people\\", without, though, getting so much media applause?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Browning's Ordinary Men","review":"I will not explain the uselessness of this author's work, as it has been done numerous times before, but in short, Goldhagen has admited that he started his research from his viewpoint rather than arrive at his conclusion from the basis of his research. He claims that his book is the only explanation for the events that took place. His manipulation of the facts, which aren't obvious to the happless reader, could only prove that he is biased or has an agenda. His standards for judgement condratict his practices and the lack of inclusion of existing contrary evidence makes this book seem more than negligent. I would recommend anyone who has read Goldhagen's tirade to also read Christopher Browning's Ordinary Men. He studied the same group, \\"Police Batallion 101\\" and has provide many (but not claming to be exclusive) explanations. Goldhagen fails on every account as a scholar with this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Goldhagen really try find out how it happend?","review":"Sadly enough he missed that chance. Even though he delivers a lot of shocking and without doubt true information, anyone familiar with German history will find his stereotype perspective really annoying. It even seems that he does not try to explore the whole thing, but has a preset opinion which he wants to proof by leaving out all facts which would not support his idea that all Germans were just evil by nature. If you want a realistic look at the Holocaust, read Michael Burleigh's \\"The Third Reich - A New History\\". After that you will see that Goldhagen's book is nothing but a collection of horrible facts which fail to explain anything because they are not discussed academically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on flawed assumptions","review":"This book must be one of the most flawed works I have ever read. It starts with the populist title \\"Hitlers willing executioners\\". This very first statement is already based on flawed and dangerous assumptions. Firstly, there were 70 million Germans living in Germany in the 30s and 40s. How many of these were war criminals (in Goldhagen's words \\"executioners\\")? A few thousand certainly, but 70 millions? It is not only a nonsense statement, to equal an entire national group or culture with executioners is just as racist as it can get. If you want to have a decent read about the Holocaust and \\"the\\" Germans I definitely recommend you to stay away from this exemplary piece of propaganda. It makes me sad to see this book since it is exactly this type of despicable racism reducing an entire people to \\"evil beings\\" which lead to the suffering Jews had to endure in their history. When will we ever stop being racist and start judging people on an individual basis?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pontificating, biased account","review":"Unlike Goldhagen, I will be succinct. This work is a very boring read as the author writes in an academia style and not in simple prose. Additionally he reverts to the same idea over and over again - all Germans in the war were bigots and happily took part in the Holocaust. One of the most biased and unenlightening books I have read on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent explaination of reality of german participation","review":"This book represents a comprehensive and well argued explaination of the role of German citizens in the Holocaust. Goldhagen tells a compelling story of how Germans from all parts of society participated in many facets of the Holocaust. His work is well documented and holds up very well under critical review.I wish he had editted his book more tightly - I found it wordy and dense - it could have 30% shorter without lose of any content or impact.A truly great book that should be on the \\"must read\\" list for every high school student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-German Diatribe","review":"This is one of the poorest books I have read in a long time, both in terms of content and style. Although the book is supposed to be an objective evaluation, it contains virtually nothing objective about ordinary Germans. Goldenhagen lays out an unconvincing premise of a particularly virulent form of anti-Semitism in Germany. He the uses a series of anecdotes as \\"proof\\" of his points. \\"Academic\\" writing often is stylistically wanting, and this book is no exception. Goldenhagen repeats the same points over and over again, as it repetition makes them true. This book contributes little or nothing to the understanding of the Holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful","review":"The main premis of this book has been completely discredited by any number of authorities on all sides. It is therefore nothing more than hate literature and should be treated as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the Klee book, published in 1988?","review":"This book is claimed to be groundbreaking research, but what about the German book about the same subject that was published in 1988? \\"Sch?ne Zeiten\\": Judenmord aus der Sicht der T?ter und Gaffer\\" in English \\"'The Good Old Times': The Murder of the Jews as Seen by the Perpetrators and Onlookers\\" by Klee, Dressen and Riess. Seems that the ground was broken almost 10 years before this book was published. But the Klee book adds no commentary; it simply presents the documents and lets them speak for themselves. That seems more important to me than drawing conclusions. Well, if I understand Goldhagen's method correctly, drawing documents from a conclusion already drawn. Just a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing has been learned from the Holocaust.","review":"It is wrong to condemn people based on membership in an ethnic group. The idea of guilt by ethnicity, which led to the Holocaust, is aggresively propogated in this book. The irony is astonishing.A better subtitle would have been \\"Ordinary People and the Holocaust\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Gone Awry","review":"Yet another book about an overworked topic, this time arriving at the hate-filled conclusion of every German being guilty of the Holocaust. This book is not written by a historian. It is a biased attempt to revive past prejudices against the German people. Most people already know the author has an agenda, and only the press praises the book. The people, after having paid the exorbitant price and read the book, are too intelligent to believe the fairytale-like conclusions drawn by the author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything wrong with academic writing","review":"My comments deal only with Goldhagen's skills as a writer, which are conspicuously absent. His book cries out for a good editor, who would have toned down the academic puffery, pretentious jargon in place of resonant language. He takes a topic of exceptional importance and kills it for readers outside the academy (and, contrary to what many may think, even those in the academy prefer lucid, compelling, non-redundant prose).Perhaps the person who told Goldhagen to publish his dissertation should have mentioned that rewriting would be involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad History","review":"I took an MA degree in modern European history at a little midwest University 40 years ago. I have not worked in the field since, but maintained a hobbyist's interest. I read this book when it first came out and I thought it was interesting. But the scholarly journals have just torn it apart with an avalance of revealed distortions by Goldhagen. What surely must pound in the final coffin nail and bury this book is now out in the July issue of NEW LEFT REVIEW in an article by Norman Finkelstein. Finkelstein leaves you wondering if anything beyond the copyright date in HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONERS can be believed. Also, ORDINARY MEN by Browning, referred to frequently in the review above, was based largely on THE RISE OF POLITICAL ANTI-SEMITISM IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA by Peter Pulzer"},{"rating":"1","title":"One simple question...","review":"I am wondering how seriously we should take a book in which the author quotes himself, and even worse, his senior thesis? Goldhagen isn't even a historian, which is plain to anyone who has any training in the field. Yet he is teaching at Harvard as I write this review. Does anyone doubt the politics behind this decision? He obviously hasn't proven any scholarly merit for such a posting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not convince","review":"First of all I got the impression that Goldhagen had made his conclusion before he ever started researching this book. Then he tells us that anti-semitism is the reason for the holocaust... (?) ...was there ever any doubt?!. Although he makes good the point that ordinary Germans participated willingly in the Holocaust, his blanket condemnation of Germans falls way short for the resons that other reviewers have pointed out. For all the hoopla the book has caused, it ends up unconvincing. Unfortunately for humanity, cruelty and barbarism are not an exclusive trait of Germans."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ax to Grind - Unreadable & Jargonistic","review":"I originally bought this book with the naive understanding that I would come to greater understanding of this enormous human tragedy. Instead I found myself plodding through (as I read it) Mr. Goldhagen's personal quest to demonize an entire people as intrinsically evil with a predispositon to perpretrate this crime. Mr. Goldhagens language was also a barrier, as he seems to have taken great pains to incorporate jargonisitc language at every possible juncture - Being a Harvard student I guess this isn't surprising - He must have scored 800 on his SAT Verbal and wants everyone to know it. Hardly a must read on the Holocaust - Its nothing more than personal venom with a catchy title masquerading in highly \\"academic\\" language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putative","review":"This was a student thesis that achieved media stardom. The main point - German knowledge/particpation in the \`final solution' was far more widespread was valid. But hardly surprising (given the number of victims).The work does little or nothing to analyze how \`normal' people did the most vile things essential in the program. For that, read Browning's \`Ordinary Men;' Sereny \`Into That Darkness;' Rhodes \`Masters of Death.' For the events themselves, there are far better sources (Babi Yar, Hilberg, etc).Though respecting the author's premise, the work is shoddy, poorly written, and shallow. The subject deserves much more effort. \`Putative' is used so many times in the text it must have been the author's favorite thesaurus discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Thesis but UnReadable Book","review":"The main point in Hitler's Willing Executioners is a good one. Personally, I tend to believe, I can see why others don't but the bottom line is that it is a thesis that though simple is a strong possibility. The idea that the German people themselves were anti-semtic and the role this played in the Holocaust and the ability for Hitler to do what he did is something I agree with. However, this book is unreadable. The vocabulary, the word choices...its impossible to read. I suggest reading Explaing Hitler and the Chapter on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Jewish youth.","review":"It cant be forgoten, what Goldhagen has done is to remind the world that anti-semitism is a desease, as is any form of racism.

Germans generally argued they had been unwilling participants or unknowing bystanders in the execution of the Holocaust.The author contends that anti-Semitism was rampant in Germany and that Hitler merely tapped into enormously popular public sentiment. The argument is historically justifiable and makes perfect sense. Hitler's extreme anti-Semitism did not appear out of thin air. Anti-Semitism had been fostered in German society for centuries.Understandably, it's much more comfortable for Germans to view themselves as unwilling conscripts than eager accomplices of the Nazis but Goldhagen offers a large amount of examples to prove otherwise.After you read the book you'll wonder what all the fuss was about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"His \\"causal\\" argument is nonsense","review":"I read this book most of the way through, was troubled by the author's approach but was getting some useful tid bits here and there. About page 419 in the paper back though, I ran into his explication of his causal reasoning, (a subject of study I am intimately and professionally familiar with) and it was complete jibberish, its as if a comedian were pretending to speak chinese by reciting a bunch of menu items from the corner noodle shop. Given this level lazy ignorance, I simply let the book drop, most of his previous, already less than convincing, arguments were cast in a much harsher light. This is too bad, some of the info seemed genuinely useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those who think \\"it can't happen here\\"","review":"This book addresses the sociological and psychological phenomena in which \\"ordinary\\" citizens act pathological, and goes far to illuminate the hidden truths of human society.While focusing on the Nazi era, this book does an outstanding job of elucidating the underlying pathology of humans in groups.This book is well worth the time and money invested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely well written racist propoganda","review":"If this were written for any other culture people would be more up in arms. But since we are so open to painting all Germans as evil inhuman creatures, than books like this exist with very little to no opposition. To say that every German (think of that,not some, not many, EVERY GERMAN) was a willing participant to the Holocaust is an ignorant statement. It's as bad as stating that every Jew is responsible for the death of Jesus of Nazareth. It's thinking like this that has to stop. Racism with a doctorate, is still racism.

Apparently as the number of available spots in camps rose so did persecution. The Jews were the main victims. The system itself grew to enormous proportions. It must have employed many thousands of ordinary Germans. There is in Germany, as in most of Europe, a history of anti-Semitism. Are those thousands of ordinary anti-Semites somehow comparable to the war criminals executed after the Nuermberg trial? And if they are - if say the entire nation of Germany was infected with a \\"virulent anti-Semitism\\" - what does it mean now? Have they been cured? Was it only in Germany? If what Goldhagen has written is true, then certainly Judaism is doomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This book was horrible! I have never read anything so wrong in !my life!

They are not the monsters described in this hateful book. Sadly, the author is part of an industry that seeks to cash in on guilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at the sources","review":"This book is a true historians nightmare. Goldhagen is a political scientist, not a historian and this is quite evident. His sources are twisted to fit his point. Now I might be called an anti-semetic for this point of view, but, Goldhagen's book plays on the psychological need for a compact answer to the world's complex problems. There are many reasons for the Holocaust, and I believe that just blaming the German people as a whole is wrong. If you want to argue with my point of view, I just have to say one thing. Read all of his sources, and then ask yourself if what he did was justified to the books he referenced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formidable research. Deeply flawed conclusions.","review":"I genuinely wanted to like this book. However, the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by Goldhagen's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the Holocaust. It doesn't read like a history book and I wasn't surprised to learn (afterword) that the author is not a historian.That said, there is value in reading it. The book is rich in facts and detail, the result of some indepth research.However, the way the author uses (and abuses) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration. The book is filled with 'Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove Goldhagen's hypothesis.Millions of non-Jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work, but it still can be worth a read. But, only if you are not put off by reptitive, awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author's emotionally driven interpretations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"Please note: I am compulsive about reading every word in every book I own. However, I could not finish this book for two reasons:1. The author is difficult to read and he appears to be more interested in impressing his doctorial professors than in clarifying an important subject. Frequently he constructs sentences with 75 to 100 words, sentences that take up an entire page on Kindle. He confused verbosity with intelligence.2. But more importantly, he never explained or even properly explored why the Germans were willing executions of the Jews. Why was the attitude towards Jews so different in Denmark, France and England? Or why were the Poles so willing partners in murdering Jews?If you want details of German brutality disguised in pedantic language, read this book. If you want to understand why average Germans were willing killers... look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC!!","review":"I read many books on World War 2 and the Holocaust in three different languages.

Millions of German soldiers disappeared in concentration camps in Siberia.I you want a better more objective account on what went on, I recommend the author Janusz Piekalkiewicz."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea for an awful book.","review":"The role of \\"ordinary Germans\\" in the Holocaust is not as original a topic as Goldhagen would have readers believe, but it's certainly rich and interesting material. Goldhagen's bloated and obtuse prose is inexcusable, however. With careful editing, this could have been an interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Prove his Case","review":"This book should not be on any Holocaust scholar's list of books to read. He goes too far in claiming that the Holocaust occurred because all Germans are evil and were eager to kill people. While he uses information which disproves his case, he fails to account for why it disproves his case; in other words, he uses the information anyway, even extremely out of context. If you want a better work on perpetrator behavior, check out Christopher Browning. Leave this one off the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst scholarly books ever written","review":"I don't even have to give you my opinion. Goldhagen shows what a biased, vengeful and spiteful person he is with his flawed research and undocumented claims. This book is the reason why you should start checking the footnotes if you didn't before. You cannot take people's research for granted. Example: p. 166 footnote #13. Read that one in the back. He didn't have time to actually calculate how many people were actually perpetrators, he simply believes the number was gigantic! He says that word for word! HA! There are DOZENS of \\"facts\\" like this. Other whoppers: p. 339. Goldhagen here actually creates his own German fantasy about how Germans made love next to concentration camps and how disgusting that is, yet it is completely without proof and later turns out to be his own fictional description that he hopes will convince you of how terrible Germans are. I am not even German and I was offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"tough read","review":"This is a really difficult read, not because of the material itself, but because of the way in which it is written.

Despite the media hype, there's not much new here. In addition, the use of certain mandatory dissertation terms (e.g., \\"cognitive modeling\\" is repeated throughout r/n \\"thinking about...\\") is tedious and ad nauseum at best, and unnecesary at worst. All in all an important book, poorly written. Also, where are the Gypsies (just given 2 lines by the author), who were as, or more poorly, treated than the Jews?

There is no understanding here - just blame. Mr. Goldhagen doesn't even explore the repressive political situation most Germans found themselves in at the time, or their lack of access to information. Ordinary Germans were supposed to know what was going on, and risk everything for a group that despised them and undermined their culture at every opportunity...he expects a bit much from others, doesn't he? Writing a book about Israel's brutal occupation TODAY and ethnic cleansing ON-GOING, would be more to the point if this writer wanted to fight injustice and inhumanity. But he will never write such a book. Like many of his ilk, he is obsessed and vengeful and can't see beyond himself. Unfortunately, he has been rewarded with an academic degree, giving him more power to inflict his self-important obsession upon others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldhagen = Goebbels","review":"Daniel Goldhagen's book has already been exposed as being a collection of misquotes of historical data and outright fabrication.

And absolute power over others is absolute fun! Ask any schoolyard bully.

Unfortunately the reader spends a lot of time wading through 600 pages only to discover what is already known about human nature, i.e. given the circumstances and appropriate provocation, almost anyone could \\"go off\\" on a fellow, on a group, on a race; there's something mysteriously murderous about human beings that defies ultimate explanation, let alone attribution to one particular nation--in Goldhagen's case: the Germans.

Certainly, this proposition seems to be gaining acceleration.

It is essentially a regurgitation of dry facts and numbers that read like a bad doctoral thesis - which I suspect it is. It is almost unbearable to read in its verbosity and banality.

I've had my n-gage for about 2 years now, and thought it was time to get a replacement battery. The vendor sent the battery in a timely fashion, and I have no complaint about them. However, the battery only has a standby time of less than 2 days. When I recharged my old battery that came with the N-Gage (BL-6C), it had a much longer standby time. The BL-6C is rated at 1070 mAH. I guess a difference of 250 mAH between the BL-5C and the 6C really makes a huge difference. I still use both batteries, and alternate after about a week or 2, so the other battery has a chance to discharge. In retrospect, I think the older battery is performing much better now that it has a chance to discharge from time to time. Check the model of the battery that came with the original phone, and go for the same model. If it were between the 5C and the 6C, I highly recommend the 6C. Don't get the BL-5C.

The only reason why it is not a five is because of the egomaniacs of the Juliana theory are on the album as well as Onelinedrawing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Ordinary monster in the city tale.

This is a rather rough live recording from the mid 1960's, that captures Carthy and Swarbrick playing passionately and off the cuff. The traditional songs presented here have all the rollick and fire of the Clancy Brothers. There are a few melancholy slow ballads here (the fantastic \\"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\\"), and there are several fabulous saucy and suggestive little ditties (the wonderfully lewd \\"Bonnie Black Hare\\") as well as some absolutely firey instrumentals. There is a certain enrgy to this recording that only a live show can generate. It's powerful, informal and a rollicking good time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor craftsmanship","review":"The first time I looked at the necklace I liked it, put it back in the pouch to wear for a special occasion.

I grew up in San Francisco in the mid-60's, and I enjoyed Russ Hodges' radio play-by-play for years. Yet I never recall him speaking on the airwaves in the same verbage as in this book.It's loaded with the most archaic baseball phrases - many that I suspect were out-of-fashion even when the book was written. Slabster/chucker (pitcher), willow (bat), stickman (batter), outer garden (outfield) and other oddities are used throughout.Alliteration also abounds in the very scattershot prose. Most \\"stories\\" are just a paragraph in length, maybe two.

It's the story of a big sister who welcomes a baby brother (the \\"winter baby\\"). Most of the books that I looked at on this subject have a very negative angle, but just a brief portion of this story focuses on the challenges and frustrations of becoming a big sister. It shows the great anticipation of the baby through the changing seasons and also accurately depicts life with a new baby today - changing diapers, sitting in a vibrating seat and breastfeeding. In the end, Sophie is the one who teaches her little brother to smile and they become great friends. This is now one of my daughter's favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful , loving tale for a big brother or sister....","review":"This is a wonderfully sweet book. It shows how a family prepares for the arrival of a new baby, and does an excellent job showing the passage of time, through beautiful illustrations of the seasons. It also addresses the frustrations and anger a young child feels when the new baby gets all of mom and dad's attention. The dialogue is simple and sweet - my almost 3-year-old really liked it and \\"got\\" it. I love that it depicts the mother nursing the young infant in a natural way. This is a GREAT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"As a mom of a girl about Sophie's age, I have a hard time reading this book without getting teary. It is so well-written and sweet. I love how the story covers the length of the pregnancy...from the Spring in which the parents tell Sophie that a baby is coming, until the following Spring..the end of the \\"fourth trimester.\\" I also love how it shows the variety of realistic emotions that the older child would feel. The illustrations are wonderful too. My daughter asks me to read this to her, and then we talk about how she will relate to Sophie when her baby sister comes in a few months. I highly, highly recommend this book. I have read a lot of books on this subject, and this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book","review":"This is a fabulous book, and is good for girls and boys.

Viewing it as an outsider. Compared to Europe, the city was unscathed by war damage. Her impressions are touching, and perhaps by not having grown up there, these are more revealing.Those of you who have visited contemporary Sydney, or indeed Australia, will see a vast contrast. The Sydney of the 40s was a social monobloc, of overwhelmingly British and Irish ethnicity. With perhaps the odd Aborigine or Asian thrown in. The transplanting of British customs onto the region can sometimes seem so incongruous. Like the prevalence of the oh so British names of suburbs.Brodsky's experiences were of a city just on the verge of massive postwar influxes. From eastern and southern Europe, and then eventually from east and south Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast quality honest","review":"This is the strongest thickest most durable ball I could find.

However, this is one of the nicer ones. It is one of the best lounge albums I've heard, right up there with Gotan projects \\"La revancha del tango\\"The reason why, in my humple opinion, this is not a five star record can be explained from the above \\"Every day\\" is in general a lounge/jazz album with hip hop/drum'n'bass influences and to be honest that doesn't really boil my blood. It is perfect if you want to light some candles and get into some comfy mood or even just lie down on the couch with a cup of tea, but it doesn't strike me much deeper than that (with one exeption though - see below).

The sound and the arrangements suit Rosanne Cash perfectly.On this album, Rosanne has written every song as she did on her previous album \\"Interiors\\".

This was given to me by a friend, and after flipping through it and reading several portions, the only conclusion I can come to is that the author is sorely lacking in both experience and intelligence. For an example, her young children were continually eating her lipstick (yes, eating it). Her solution was to buy cheaper lipstick so that it would not be such a loss. Hello? She encourages wives to kowtow to all of their husband's desires and requests, no matter how ridiculous (such as putting the toilet paper the correct way and chopping an onion properly).

Other than that its recommended great and ideal for building your vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mishmosh of Junk!","review":"As much as I loved Terror Twilight, this solo outing by Mr. Malkmus is truly hideous. I didn't realize how important the band Pavement, as a unit would be until I bought this in good faith. I can overlook that he can't sing, but the songs, good god! The cuts lurch uncertainly from quasi-reggae to synth pop, and everything in between. Truly terrible, and I hope to see greater things from Malkmus with a re-formed Pavement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Crackin' good album mate... Malkmus seems a little free of his Pavement obligations, and constructs some good, fun songs to purify himself. His elegy of Church on White to his good friend and his snarky send up of Jen and the Ess-Dog both work just as well, hand in hand on this album. I love the Hook, but mostly, my heart lies with \\"Troubbble\\", this is the album that N'Sync hopes to write after that blond one gets back from his aborted Russian space trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wink and a shurg","review":"T.T.-era Pavement didn't even sound like Westings-era Pavement, so what's the big deal about sounding like Pavement. The songs make me smile, make me wish I had a lyric sheet so i could pick out all the in jokes, and make me want to hit play again. Who says every album has to have some big meassage or break some new ground. It's a solid record from a more-than-solid songwriter. If Malkmus was to break out into You're killing me, or she Believes, it would seem quite odd. And he shouldn't have to. He can do whatever he wants to. And I'll buy his records."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUBBBLE","review":"Lets just make this really simple. There are two SM camps, those who like the more structured stuff, starting mostly with Brighten The Corners, and ending with his solo career. The others prefer the jangly loose structures of the early albums, Enchanted and Crooked Rain. So, if Terror Twilight was your favorite Pavement album, you'll be happy to know that this first solo album is very much in that vein. If you thought Terror Twilight was boring, you'll think this is boring as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Pavement, but worthy","review":"I just recently picked up Malkmus's first solo, and knew it wasn't going to be like Pavement. Going into it with that perspective, I'm happy with the purchase. He seems to have moved in the same direction of \\"Terror Twilight\\", albeit this release is a bit more poppy.It's a good first effort, and now I'm on to his second release, which I hear tops this one in many ways.Just one gripe... WTF is up with the cover? lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally great","review":"This is a great, great album.Q:A: Yes, it sounds like Pavement, perhaps less experimental, and perhaps less of the highs and lows that wacky experimentalism can bring.

Those who appreciated pavement's latest efforts shall no doubt be satisfied with this album for it sees Malkmus remniscing that territory. Some of it falls shot of originality but songs like the beautiful \\"church on white\\", the bluesy \\"hook\\" or the catchy \\"jennifer\\" are consistent with a singer who started in a lo-fi experimental band and wants to make a career out of himself refining the best of his work. A fine album indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good album","review":"I was a big Pavement fan up until Crooked Rain then really lost interest in their output. This is a really interesting listen. I usually skip the first 3 tunes cause they sound like filler to met but the rest of the album is fantastic. It is different from Pavement but obviously one can draw similarities."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not kidding this is bad","review":"I loved pavement's slanted, and crooked rain, and wowie zowie, and the westing collection. I would give all those 4 and 5 stars. This sounds worse than the last 2 pavement albums, which I gave 3 stars. This just sounds like he dosen't care any more. Maybe he's drinking. The music is same sounding, and the singing is bland ranting. If he's jaded, and does not care enough, then he should stop putting out \\"product\\" The last thing with him on it that I ever buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Continues the plunge Pavement began with BTC","review":"If you like the direction Pavement went with BTC and TT then you'll like this album. In my opinion Pave created one of the greatest albums ever recorded with WZ then crashed. SM's solo effort wallows in the wreakage. The album is boring musically and the lyrics are just dumb. Don't believe all the critical praise heaped on this record. It is not innovative, clever or interesting. It is bland crap bordering on pretentious garbage. I gave it one star because Amazon won't let me give it zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pounding the Pavement...gently","review":"Pavement the rock band seems to be gone now. If you miss them as much as I do, try this record out. Malkmus' solo debut doesn't have the kind of guitar noodling that a Pavement fan might anticipate, but it isn't a surprise. The songs on \\"Terror Twilight\\" were clearly leading up to Malkmus' solo debut. You get the same quirky lyrics that make you smile or furrow your brow or both. His backing band seem like a good fit for what he's trying to achieve. More fun and more ambitious than his previous stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Liberation From Stupid Vanities","review":"Come on in, Pavement fans; the water's fine. The ponderous ballads and spacy noodlings of Pavement's last records have given way to some of the inspired looniness of earlier days. Songs like \\"Troubble\\" and \\"Jo-Jo's Jacket\\" hold up to anything off \\"Slanted and Enchanted.\\" \\"The Hook\\" and \\"Jennifer and the Ess Dog\\" spin out longer, tighter narratives with more focus than Malkmus showed of late with the band. There's some filler on the record, but Malkmus at half-speed is better than most platinum bands at full tilt. Sad as I am to see Pavement go, this feels like a move forward. Don't know if Malkmus'll ever best his old sound--in a blind taste test you'd probably think this was Pavement--but why mess with a glorious thing? It seems like everyone's having more fun now, and so will you. Forget the cult status (so '90s!) and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album has everything going for it that Pavement did, except one: charm. It is a well-crafted and expertly played album, to be sure. But The Jicks just don't have the same ragged charm that Pavement did. In this new context lines that might have sounded quirky/charming with Pavement sound quirky/condescending. A subtle, but important distinction that makes this a far less enjoyable listening experience than even the least of Pavement's offerings. I don't think SM has lost anything personally. The only thing he's lost is the perfect band to back him up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Malkmus","review":"If you like Pavement you will love this solo work. Catchy lyrics and hooks abound. Malkmus gives us a collection of short New Yorker like stories,quirky as you would expect from the leader of Pavement but almost cinematic: a pirate tale, a empire builder in 19th century Raj, a funny piece on Yul Brynner! a romance between a rich pre-law coed and the son of a Coca-Cola middleman! Black Book and Discretion Groove rock. Dead and Church on White show his serious side. Vague Spaces has a fine chorus with the Beatlesque line: I'd love to turn you off! This is a wonderful record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! But why haven't the sequels been published?","review":"This is a great read for fantasy lovers, the only reason I rated it with 4 stars being the sequels haven't been published yet.

In order they follow:The Trench of SkullsThe Great ShiftLegions of the SunThe stories continue, the characters become far more in depth, they age, make mistakes, and contain perfectly crafted imperfections.

To make a point his songs are very repetitive, monotonous, and time consuming. To me listening to his \\"work\\" makes me have to make an effort in listening to his music and it is not as I had expected. I originally found his song \\"extreme ways\\" cool because it related to the movie \\"Jason Bourne: Bourne Ultimatum\\" and it gave a character to the Movie.

If you're a PBS type of person, who prides oneself on learning more than entertainment, this film may be of interest. And... it was of interest to me because of the subject matter and due to my interest in music, especially percussion, I thought this would be an excellent documentary. While the subject of this film may be very worthwhile, the actual film itself... well, basically it'll bore most humans to death. The only thing that'll wake them up is the jam session on top of the roof in NYC.2. Bottomline: If you pride yourself on being a sophisticated intellect--> you may enjoy this film.

The printer does what I want, very good photo quality even on regular paper. It also scans well and was very easy to set up. The printer's card reader acts like a regular card reader and allows you to download to the computer and is not dedicated to the printer. My only complaints are that in order to scan at 1200 dpi you have to use the scanner driver ( none of the software included lets you scan above 600 dpi). The included software has no options for scanning and faxing a document using a modem either; I use winfax so that does not bother me. You cannot have the printer use just the black cartage even in grayscale it uses color ink.For the price though (I paid $104 on Amazon with free shipping) you can't beat the photo quality. If you are looking for a good all in one and don't need a fax machine built in look at this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having no ink makes this a big paperweight","review":"I was happy with this printer/scanner combo until I found out that you can't use the scanner if you run out of ink.

Richard Archer and the rest of the cast may have talent but simply tried too hard for emotional hardness. Almost like the Chinese actor--good plot, too much forced emotion which was obvious and overplayed to the point of cliche, I see talent in some of these actors and hope they improve. Really liked the story line--music didn't match the setting though.

I don't recollect busting out laughing at any point (and I really love Sacha's previous work... so I really wanted to love this). It just was a bunch of tired, predictable jokes. No real twists or turns. The acting was pretty subpar across the board.Anyway, bottom line - its a comedy that couldn't draw a single laugh out of me.

The stereotypes and jokes were much to predictable and more often than not they were taken too far. For the record, most people are not so stupid that you have to shove the same thing in their face twelve times just for them to understand the already moronic excuse for a joke.

He lost the funny on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mister Cohen...your 15 minutes of fame is coming to a quick end","review":"Mister Cohen: The joke is on you. You think you're funny, the rest of us do not. Your stupid stunts to promote this film and your other films are desperate attempts to bring attention to yourself. YOU are simply one of the worst comedians of this century. Maybe of all time. Maybe in this universe. This film couldn't be funny if one snorted laughing gas. It wouldn't be funny if it had a laugh track, or an appearance by a 1950's Jerry Lewis. It simply reeks of crass commercialism and stupid writing. There, is that clear now?

It's about the same style as Sacha Baron Cohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. Cohen plays a silly ruthless dictator named Admiral General Aladeen. He is very anti-semitic and plans on creating nuclear weapons. He hates the very idea of democracy. While on his way to the United Nations, he's betrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him. He's taken in by Zoey, a vegan hippie, and gives him a job at her store. Will Aladeen make it to the U.N. to stop democracy from coming to his country, or will Zoey change his heart?

After a reasonably strong start, this film falls into predictable, mildly humorous moments that added up to my fighting to stay awake and then giving up entirely. SBC you get one more crack at pure fiction, and if it fails again you need to go back to the fool them once worlds of Ali G, Borat, and Bruno that provided me with some of the most entertaining video moments of my life.

Some real truths in the movie about the deceptions in the world that well, almost everyone knows now. Which is good. Some reality about how backwards some remote areas of the world are due to being isolated and in old beliefs, and obviously some things are meant to be overly dramatic and not real, just like our media and world news. But you really want to keep watching, it is funny, strange and, well, just ignore the really off parts, and enjoy this off the cuff view of things going on in the world.

There were about 4 semi funny parts and the rest was.... boring, soooo very boring. I am pretty sure the dialog between Sacha (The Dictator) and Aasif (The banished Dr) were ad libbed, but they all should have been cut, none of them were remotely funny. The \\"comedic hate then love story\\" part was forced, predictable and horrendously acted. I felt this was a complete waste of time and money. Apparently I am among the few looks like others reviewing this loved it.

Sacha Baron Cohen has quite a knack for comedy, and as always, he is sometimes off, and sometimes on in this one. There are some real belly laughs in this one, but in between quite a bit of the humor falls flat. Some of the jokes in this movie were actually quite creative and original, but I just felt that too much of the film was trying too hard to find humor where there was none.

Under normal use I've watched with a flash light to see if I'm picking up anything....... and unless it is laying on the surface of the record it's not coming off. On another turntable I use an old ESL dust arm that is far more successful in aiding in keeping the surface as clean as possible while playing.

We started using the products when my daughter was 10 months old. Now she is 22 months and has over 150 signs. They are not all perfect, but she can communicate with us and always get her point across. In fact she is now signing four and five word sentances such as \\"I want more milk please.\\"Don't let anyone try to tell you that signing delays speach. It definitely does not! My daughter was signing before speaking, but now she uses both. There are many times we wouldn't understand her words, but because she is also signing, we know what she means. This has eliminated a lot of the frustration that is normally caused when a 2 year old can't communicate.The bottom line is that we can highly recommend the entire Signing Time series. We love it and will use it again with our next child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me","review":"I got this scoop, figuring that because it had holes instead of \\"slots\\" that it wouldn't A. take too much clean litter with the clumps, or B. allow small pieces of broken clumps to fall through the holes. Well, it works great for A, but lousy for B. The holes are pretty large, large enough to let pieces of broken clumps pass through, which you then have to go back and pick out with another scoop or your hands (yuck!).The good: It has high sides, so is quite capable of holding large clumps of litter (or multiple clumps). It seems to be of a good sturdy plastic (doesn't feel \\"flimsy\\" when you use it).If you use a litter that clumps rock-solid, this should be a great scoop for you, if not, I wouldn't reccommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"This book was pure perfection, is that the two characters have always loved each other and never stopped.

I'm not sure why, as most of the photography books that I have read weren't very good. Are there any exceptions? Sure--Barnbaum's The Art of Photography and Freeman's The Photographer's Eye, as well as (for basics) Ansel Adams' The Camera and The Print. But this book was nowhere near that level. I thought it would provide me with a much more nuanced understanding of exposure and, critically, how to manually expose images by reading light (and not using A or B modes or a camera's internal light meter). But this book's approach was much more modern, more high-tech, with almost all images captured either in an automatic mode (e.g., A or B) or with aperture or shutter speed adjusted according to the camera's internal light meter before taking a shot. This may be a useful book for a beginner, but IMO it offers very little to anyone else.

All of the photographs in this book look like they were taken by Average Joe with a disposable camera. This book was written backwards. The book does not mention metering technique until chapter 8 (near the end of the book)! They mention handheld meters in chapter 7 but never explain proper use of them. The book never discusses studio lighting techniques or even portable (on camera) flash technique. They never discuss proper use of available light or use of lighting modifiers (reflectors, diffusers, etc . . .). Most of this book rants on and on about arbitrary +/- .25 to .5 exposure adjustments for a million different specific situations (mostly travel photographs) instead of explaining overall technique. Save your time and money. Read another book written by a professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough disappointment","review":"I wouldn't title a book this way if I didn't have the pictures to back it up, and these authors do not.

I will assume that plastic was chosen to ensure the light weight, however, I think aluminum is the way to go and is much more sturdy. For example the RAZR.- battery life is something of a challenge. even the extended battery will only give you about 12-14 hours with moderate use.Other than what I listed above, the phone is great and I am still fairly happy with the phone.TIP - Try to find any defects with your phone within the first 15 days.

I wanted something new, modern and cool. I received it. Unfortunately it comes with another loser from microsoft. With the blackberry, use was intuitive, items well organized and layed out. Sure there were limitations, but you easily adapted. This phone makes everything take 1-2 extra steps, but then, those same steps might not work the next time. I can go feature by feature, but let's just say, you shouldn't have to work to use a phone/pda. If you go with the Q, remember very hot, quite a bit bitchy. Choose your relationship"},{"rating":"1","title":"They said it would do everything--NOT","review":"Just a short note to say that if you use AOL and/or ACT 2006 contact management software, stick with the communication devices you have. Do not buy the Motorola Q. AOL email is not coompatable with the \\"Q\\" and neither is ACT 2006(you can't download any database). This took me hours on the phone(with INDIA!) discussing this with Verizon, AOL and SAGE, the present owner of the ACT software. The problem is being worked on but the only advice I got from any of them was,\\"Just check back on our website occaisionally and we will post when the problem is solved.\\" I think maybe I should change to another phone company--YA THINK! Very frustrating as I spent hours on trying to like this phone. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"I sent for my second replacement. Nearly everyone on the other end says they hear an echo or just terrible sound quality from my end. What a waste of time. Had internet but a waste of time at $40 per month from Verizon. All other features are mostly ok. Won't work on my mac and the one time I tried to download games or do updates on the pc, it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now on my fourth","review":"I've had to replace this phone three times now. Once because the audio jack wasn't letting me listen to the mp3s and movie files I bought the phone to play. Once because it started freezing on startup every time. And once because the phone simply went dead and wouldn't start up or respond in any way, even when plugged in. Each time, Verizon just replaced the entire phone, without even trying to fix it. That's four unique instances of this phone in one year of use. That's the only impression I can take away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Antenna, Dropped Calls, Battery Drained by Searching for Cell Tower","review":"I live in a metropolitan area with adequate cell coverage. My family owns 1 Motorola Q and 2 Motorola Razrs. We have no problems with the cell signal on the Razrs. The Q is frequently dropping calls and searching for a network in the same locations that the Razrs are showing 2 or 3 bars. I have to keep the Q plugged into the AC in order to keep the battery from draining due to the constant searching for a cell tower. I would not recommend the Q unless you live under a cell tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Gave it a try for a month, went back to Treo","review":"This phone looks good on paper, in person, and in my pocket, but it was a huge hassle to use compared to a Treo. First, everything runs sluggishly and it takes a long time to do anything. The Treo has less memory but runs much faster because it is better optimized, and more importantly, has a touch screen. With the touch screen, I can click on links, buttons, etc., even with my finger, which saves a lot of time compared to using the thumbwheel and arrowpad. Finally, the Q's battery life was terrible. I thought I received a defective unit so I had it exchanged...the second unit was just as awful. Finally, the Q's keyboard looks better and is bigger, but is harder to use -- the keys are harder to press and because the system is slow, sometimes keypresses don't register (while Windows Mobile is trying to catch up or something). I wanted to like the Q but came away utterly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice form factor, the rest pretty much sucks","review":"I started out loving this phone, and the form factor & screen are definitely great. However, after using it for 2-3 months, I now *hate* several things about it:1) The keyboard. This is the second Q I've owned, and on both I've had keyboard problems (sticky keys that won't type, phantom keypresses when pressing the 4-way pad). Also, on the personal gripe side, I found the rounded keys less easy to type on than the flat Blackberry keys, but others may disagree on this2) Software. Sometimes the software crashes, like when I'm answering a call. Sometimes the buttons take me to the wrong app (again, this may be keyboard-related). In general apps can be slow to load.3) Battery. When in low-signal areas, the phone tends to run-down really quickly.4) Keyboard. Did I mention the keyboard is really baaaad??"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE","review":"getting this phone was the biggest mistake ever.

It has very stringent requirements, none of which are mentioned on the site when you purchase the unit. I still cannot get it to work. Why Motorola would have hitched their cart to Microsoft's spur is beyond me.

While the functionality is great on this phone, it is laden with glitches and therefore, I cannot recommend this to someone who cannot afford to accidentally miss calls because you were ending another function on the phone. The lag time between doing various tasks on the phone is too long. It takes several seconds after I hang up with someone for me to be able to get to another function. Also, my Q has a tendency to power itself off, then restart occasionally. I have checked into the settings on the phone and checked with my carrier, but no one seems to have an explanation. Finally, pulling information off the SD card is not as straightforward as one might expect from a Windows-based phone. In short, if I had to do it all over again, I would have stuck with the Palm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Murphy in sleeping mood","review":"Perhaps I'm the greatest Mark Murphy fan in Europe.

The picture in all formats is excellent even though I project onto a wall which is covered by a white vinyl wallpaper. The only thing missing is the ability to remotely focus. If you are thinking of buying this projector take a look at the screen size calculator at Optoma.com. I made the mistake of mounting it at the same place as my old Sharp projector and the display would not fit the available space on my wall. I recommend buying the matching Optoma ceiling mount, if you intend to mount it on the ceiling.Stan Lyons"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten translations","review":"It's been said, but bears repeating; the sonnets are amazing. The translation is not.

How is this going to do anything?\\" Not to mention, typically I hate using resistance bands. Furthermore, the abs section was simply breathing!! Still, I tried the exercise disc anyway... and WOW!!! I was surprised. My upper back and shoulders were sore for the whole week, but I felt stronger. I felt an improvement in my posture as well. But my favorite part? The ab routine! It is phenomenal and simple! I saw and felt a difference immediately. The day after I did the video for the first time, three people told me I looked much thinner. That's gotta count for something! Overall, the video is slow, but it is gentle, effective, and in some ways unique. Good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new- old stuff; would not recommend","review":"Go to a couple of good balance yoga classes or buy Mary Bond's New Rules of Posture instead of wasting time and money on this poor old DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"posture, get it straight","review":"It wasn't what I thought it would be.

It's 45 minutes long and has a nice assortment of exercises for the body, including abs, butt, and arms. My dvd came with a band to increase the resistance. I enjoyed the exercises and they were moderate enough that anyone could do them. I would probably do this every other day because it does take time. I felt lighter after doing the video.

There was a comment or 2 by others saying that I seemed taller. I think this does a good job of piecing together information and exercises that target posture improvement. The only reason I have trouble giving it the full 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy on the infomercial feel for my taste. It also may not acknowledge that more could be needed than muscular and posture exercises, but that maybe obvious for those with extreme posture issues.Overall, definitely a good program."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sense of Wonder","review":"What words can be used to describe Rothfield's \\"Italian Dreams\\"? All that can be said of his images is that they like Italy is a dream- as boundless, captivating and distinguished.

Being familiar with monastic life, daily spiritual and work routines, I am amazed how similar the life is among all monastics - no matter what their faiths. I enjoyed the movie greatly, and at the same time said to myself, \\"Nobody is going to line up for this one.\\" But maybe you are a traveler on the narrow path."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"A mesmerizing look at Carthusian life, that takes you into the everyday lives of the monks, without much talk, but the viewer gets a \\"feel\\" for the life, and has a spiritual experience at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Great Silence","review":"Into Great Silence is more an experience than a film. It captures a spirituality that takes your breath away, stills your soul, and leaves you savoring the quiet. The length of the film (2:45) is necessary in order to convey the rythm of monastic life, and it does it successfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Deep Contemplation","review":"A work of stunning beauty, this film follows the slow rhythms of the seasons and the monastic cycle of work and prayer. The first words (monastic prayers) are heard nineteen minutes after the opening credits. There are no explanations, no commentaries, no distractions: every image and every sound was recorded by one man as he lived among the monks.Many years ago I spent a week in silent retreat at a Benedictine monastery; I don't know when I will again be able to spend a week in silence, but for a few hours this film allowed me to recapture some of the feeling from that week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Amazing sums up the scenery, the devotion, the spirit of these monks.

It's like watching a silent movie yet with sounds of nature. It is the mysterious entry of man into God's dwelling place on earth; a monastery. Not for the fast paced, but more of a reflective slide-show. It tends to cause the viewer to search out their own path for serving God. I am a meditative Catholic, therefore I enjoyed the depths of music and spirituality set forth in this documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something...","review":"As a meditation experience, the DVD might be great. The footage is lovely, the colors muted and luminescent, the monks serene and focused. However, I found the individual sequences far too long. Many of the scenes amounted to not much more than prolonged still shots. And I mean prolonged! After I'd watched a candle flame burn for about five minutes nonstop, I wondered if something was wrong with my DVD player.This glimpse of life inside a French monastery was interesting, but not interesting enough to engage my mind and imagination for the 2+ hours it lasted. The sequence of the monks chanting was so boring as to strain credibility. The audio was lovely, but the video consisted entirely of many minutes of filmed sheet music annotated in Latin. It seemed to go on forever.Cut to about one-fourth its present length, the film would have been a great documentary in my opinion. As it was, I couldn't endure the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Unlike most of the viewers, I not only found this film extremely boring, but I often found it choppy and lacking in continuity. Nor did I sense from the facial expressions of the monks any sense of deep happiness--such as interior joy, peace, freedom, strength, or even love of God. They appeared to be performing their activities rather mechanically, robotically instead of with the blissful devotion and appreciation that comes from exclusively and daily serving God with one's whole heart and mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it through the whole thing","review":"I'm sorry. I couldn't make it through the movie. It seemed as though the movements of the monks had no context. The movie shifted from scene to scene. I could see a man reading a book but I needed to know what he was reading to make it meaningful. I practice centering prayer and know that God is in the silence but this movie was not helpful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silence","review":"I lived in a monastery and I have lived the silence. This film is exactly what I lived. It's a great film that shows the daily life of a monk and the spirit of a monastery. I recommend the film for all people, believers or not, because is a great experience and a great movie. You can see the incredible work of the filming team, living with the monks in complete silence, following them with the camera all day and all night. The DVD is amazing because you can see very interesting deleted scenes like one in which they explain how the monks make their liquor and a lot of extras about the history of the order. I give the film a 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Memorable Film of the Year","review":"Not knowing what to expect, I was totally overwhelmed by the beauty, quiet and attentiveness of the many aspects of Carthusian life in this film.

I saw the film twice and enjoyed it even more the second time.

But what isn't often discussed is how poorly laid out they are and even claustrophobic at times. This is why I like the new modern small homes that are built upwards, often on small lots to get the most space for a small space.Yes, the McMansions have loads of wasted space and use way more natural resources. But I would have like to see more examples of homes for 2000 and onward that were slick and clean looking, as well as environmentally friendly.And the price. YIKES.

Children have been evacuated to the countryside for their own safety, more often than not to live for the duration of the war with complete strangers. Young Simon Thorn shows up in the village of Yeasdon, along with the other evacuated children.

Many questions abound and Barnard, with his accustomed patience and logical thinking, sets out to solve this mystery. He does so in a touching, poignant manner, and he brings vividly to life all the aspects of these dark and dangerous days of the blitz. Barnard deserves his well-earned reputation.(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent psychological thriller!","review":"This book is a bit of a departure for Robert Barnard. The story is really quite different. It's a story about a small boy who is evacuated out of London during the blitz. He's a scared little boy with what appears to be a made-up name, but he is taken in by a loving couple who treat him like their own, and who raise him to adulthood. But when Simon is back in London as a man, he feels the need to try to find his original family. He uncovers a thoroughly detestable family that he knows he was part of, but he has to find out where exactly he fit in. He unovers an old murder that he actually had been a witness to as a small boy. The way that Barnard unfolds the plot in this story is wonderful. It's like peeling an onion - after one layer there are many more layers underneath, with more secrets and revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughh....ooooffff!!! ....YUCKITY-YUCK-YUCK!!","review":"Spleggheeetthhh.!!!!!...Yuck....did I say \\"terrible\\" already??

It is chock full of useful writing suggestions that a journaler can turn to for inspiration when writer's block inevitably strikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with lots of ideas for different ways to journal.","review":"This book gave me lots of new ideas for journal writing. The thing that helped me the most was the idea that there are no rules at all for journaling. So, if you've been feeling stuck for some reason or another, be stuck no more! Just have fun and let your creative juices flow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for.","review":"I prefer prompted journals, and this journal mainly gives ideas for how to make a journal and what to use it for. I'm not a creative enough writer to come up with my own prompts so what I look for in a guided journal is one where the author helps you along a little more and gives you ideas for delving into your past, present and future to help heal you and teach you about yourself. This book would be fine for a more independent writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't wait one more second!","review":"I bought this book a year ago and I was a bit scared to go into my inner depths. I've been following a few lessons recently and I am getting very good response from my inner self. This book is easy to read, but please do not get a wrong idea. The exercises are very powerful and have helped me conquer many of my favorite monsters: fear, pain, guilt.

As they say on Broadway, \\"A Tour de Force\\". Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful tool for journal writers.","review":"Since I began writing journals regularly five years ago, I've been on the lookout for books which will inspire me. This is one of my favorites. There is such a variety of exercises that you can find one to fit any style, whether you keep a strict ritual or are interested in trying new styles. I particularly related to the section about using journals as therapeutic tools. I tend to pull out this book whenever I'm looking for inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very simple, straightforward - EASY. Not good.","review":"If you're simply interested in learning to write a journal as something to do (and nothing more), this appears to be an exceptionally 'easy read'. The author provides a variety of suggestions - but if you're looking for \\"deep\\" stuff with insightful thoughts, keep looking! This book is NOT for anyone interested in writing to heal - anyone coping with childhood traumas, health concerns, depression, etc. Examples - one of the last sections is on \\"Adult Children\\". It is 8 pages long. (Anyone who has gone to an \\"Adult Child of Alcoholic/Dysfunctional Families\\" 12 step meeting hears more information read during the first 10 minutes of each meeting! \\"5 stages of Grief - 9 pages. And remember, the book is a small paperback so 9 pages doesn't cover much.

It means the BEST OF..so for you guys crying over re-released, who cares.Disc 1 has some of the best stuff on it. I love Unstable and Real American and a few others.Disc 2 is GREAT!!. It has some of the REAL versions of themes like Rikishi. It also has the great remix for Kurt Angle, which he used once on TV after his little heel turn.Disc 3 of course is the best. Finally I can delete all my edits of these themes. Concidering I had a few already through contacts it's all good.Over all, buy this CD and get the Bonus Billy Kidman theme online."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWE Anthology: Good, But too many re-releases","review":"Anthology is a good purchase, but I't has it' faults. For one, Pretty much the whole second disc are re-releases from Volumes 3-5.I am glad they included Real Mans Man on disc 2 though. On the first disc there are some songs we could do without. Like Dude Love's theme. FOR THE THIRD TIME!. Plus, Some of the Volume two re-releases should have been taken off, to put themes like, Koko B. Ware, Demolition and more. The Third disc is good, but, They should have put more on there. At least 25. If you like Wrestling themes, I suggest you pick it up. Pretty good value.Favorite Songs from \\"The Federation Years\\"1. Los Boricuas2. Real American3. Together4. Power5. It's All About The MoneyFavorite Songs from \\"The Attitude Era\\"1. Deadly Game2.

It is 3 discs with plenty of great music on it, some already released, some never released. My only grief came when playing some tracks on repeat and realizing that all of the 2nd disc(The Attitude Era) is blended together. This means the end of one track is also the beginning of the next. Not a major problem but still kind of annoying if you just want to hear one solid song. Also, most of the songs are the first 2 discs are pretty short, most only going around 2:30. And they did seem to rush this out with a lot of music that fans probably could've done without, like the Dude Love themes and so on. There are many great entrance themes that could've been put on here, but sadly, the big wigs decided not to. All in all, it's a musthave for any diehard wrestling fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWE Anthology Rules!!","review":"This CD is without a doubt the best wrestling CD ever!

I have been able to download wrestling themes on the internet and such but this CD contains themes that havent been ever released and ones that you cannot find, in addition there ARE remixes to a few themes, things that most anyone wouldnt realize however I did. I highly recommend this CD, I got it the second it was available and you shoudl all do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome collection!!!","review":"I could not wait until the release of this CD. I bought one of the first copies today and it's a must have. All the songs are at least a couple minutes long. Triple H's theme on disc 3 is one I've never heard before but it's still pretty good. My personal favorites are Bertha Faye's \\"Sweet Lovin' Arms\\" and Brother Love's \\"I Love You\\". If you've been a long time fan you will really like the first CD. I own every other music CD that WWE has ever released and though there are some repeat tracks on this collection most are unique. Most of the repeats have been remixed so it's cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Firstly let me say that there are people here writing reviews requesting that Booker T and The Hardyz themes be put on etc. Those themes are production and ARE NOT OWNED BY THE WWE.

Track 10 on \\"The ATTITUDE Era\\" \\"Deadly Game\\" In Your House Theme is actually the theme to WWF Survivor Series: Deadly Game 1998 (for those who have recorded it from PPV or have the WWF Home Video version).

Like a lot of people, I was a little disappointed that most of the songs on this album have already been released on previous WWE CD's.

Unfortunately, this album also contains some songs that are so unbelievably pathetic that I can't believe they were put on it. The bad songs include: Brother Love's, Bertha Faye's, William Regal's, Eddie Guerrero's, Mark Henry's, and D-von Dudley's.

I wish the Oddities were on there as well asKane's \\"Slow Chemical\\" theme (his current one),and RVD's one of a kind. I also wished they had not put Christain's \\"At Last\\" on there it's opera for cryin' out loud, and Billy and Chuck's theme, it's boy band music they both [are bad.] The others are pretty cool.

Also the underside is suppose to be water proof, I didn't test that out, but it would be better if it was a thicker maybe heavier material.

Also, I have a 8 mo old and we do a lot of park playdates with other babies - this fabric stains very easy whereas the JJ cole is wipeable. Lastly, I find the carry case worthless because it is seperate from the blanket, so I often forget to use it or don't like doing the extra step after I fold it; the JJ cole one is sewn into the blanket, so one less step.Just wanted to say that I wish I had spent the extra money and purchased the JJ cole...at least for my purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i was disappointed with the size and the thickness, especially considering the price. the size is rectangle shaped so it doesn't fit well under the playyard and it is too thin so you can feel every little pebble or twig underneath it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome for damp grass playing or picnics","review":"We just LOVE this Tuffo Blanket for sitting on the damp lawn outside to keep our bums dry, or for picnics to put on the icky table to keep germs away from hands & food.

It should be subtitled 'Soltan in New York'. Every other chapter ends with the phrase 'Heller is ruined now!'. It's like a 3-Stooges book.

Characters are beyond belief, even for so-called satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission Earth volume 3","review":"This is only the third volume out of ten and this series is already starting to get tiring. The plot meanders aimlessly at a snail's pace and the so-called satire falls flat almost every time (one genuinely funny moment was when Soltan Gris tries to call Delbert John Rockecenter). So much time is spent on the pointless subplot about Soltan's dancing girl Utanc. The real story doesn't really get going until the last 100 pages and then the book ends with a cliffhanger.

If I'm supposed to buy a new $9 filter every couple of weeks, that's unacceptable. Also I find that the cord is very stiff and makes the vacuum frustrating to use and the cord difficult to wrap.

After vacuuming a single flight of stairs, the entire area at the foot of stairs was covered with dust, I was sneezing, and the unit was covered with dust! It should be mentioned that I'd cleaned the steps only 2wks prior, so it's not like they contained a year's worth of dust. I've used bagless vacuums before, and they've never performed this poorly. Eureka certainly has tarnished their reputation by having their name on this device. It's absolutely TERRIBLE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"I luved this unit....in fact bought one for the inlaws to use on their new car....until like most other folks, plugged it in and poof...black stinky smoke and I now have to begin my research for a new one all over again...avoid this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This vacuum was worthless after two months of use. It still turns on and provides a small amount of suction, but not enough to accomplish anything. It overheats and turns off after about 5 minutes. Of course, it lasted just long enough that we couldn't return it to Amazon. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Han Vac","review":"I purchased this vacuum several months ago to mainly suck up dog and cat fur. With a dog and 2 cats, we had fur stuck to everything. Unfortunately, my regular vacuum does a less than great job getting fur off of furniture. This little Eureka does a marvelous job on removing the fur and it so handy to get out for touch up jobs as I see them. It's a little heavy, but not an issue for me. It doesn't have a bag which usually causes problems for me, but it gets so much stuff when you vacuum if it had a bag, it would have to be changed very frequently. For pet lovers this is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clean Sweep","review":"The Eureka 71A Hand-Held Vacuum is by far the finest, best-engineered hand vac I've encountered. The hose can easily be disconnected from the main body to remove blockages, and the cord is sufficiently long for most jobs. Eureka makes affordable, well-made products, and the 71A is a prime example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stop working","review":"It was great for a good Year..picked up just about everything..then it just stop working, it wont turn on..seems like the vacuum felt it did its job and then just gave up!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewildered by all the great reviews...","review":"I'm a little bewildered by all the good reviews for this vacuum - maybe I just got a dud. It worked great the first few times I used it, but now that I've had it for a few months, it has pretty much stopped working altogether. The last time I used it, I noticed that nothing I sucked up seemed to be going into the dust bin. When I turned it off and picked it up... everything I had sucked up fell out onto the rug. I'm really disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair clogs in roller and it died after a year","review":"At first I was so excited that the vacuum cleaner picked up all the cat hair! It's true, it was very strong and worked well. But the cat hair would clog in the roller and it was time-consuming and hard to pull it out. Also the filter is hard to clean and would take days to dry. Then after a year (almost 2 weeks after the warranty expired) it stopped sucking. So now it's just sitting in my closet, useless, until I have time to go have it fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little sucker","review":"I didnt have high expectations for this handheld vac, and I was pleasantly surprised.It is perfect for vacumming out the car, as well as the steps and the bathroom nooks & crannies.

I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Yellow Suction Monster","review":"I procured this hand vac for use in a mobile application (my truck).

I also bought a compatible auto detail kit to use with it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"Powerful little vac!! Loved the hose and attachment, makes cleaning very easy. The cord is very long, so you don't have to stop very often. You need to buy the replacement filters when you purchase this, it's so powerful you will have to change them soon because of all the stuff you pick up! I used it on my couch, chair and ottoman....oh my goodness, I only thought I was a good housekeeper!! You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum","review":"Great suction, easy to clean dirt cup. Rather heavy in weight & the attachment hose is very short but conveniently stores on the vacuum. Love the built in brushes.

Works well on furniture and floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor died abruptly after 8 months of infrequent use.","review":"This was a decent enough vacuum for the time that it worked. The cord was nice and long, the suction was sufficient, the dustbin was easy to empty. I did notice that dust seemed to hover at the top near the filter, but I cleaned the filter regularly so it wasn't really a problem.After eight months of infrequent use (probably once a month) there were red flashes inside and the motor made a few unhappy noises and abruptly cut off.Despite its adequate performance, I have to give it one star because eight to ten uses does not a good appliance make."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a fan!","review":"It works very well. Even better than the Kirby regular size vacuum I have. I give it four instead of five stars due to its weight as a hand held vacuum. But everything else is excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until it doesn\\"t","review":"I am on my third one of these little gems. It works great picking up the hair from my long haired dogs. I have a lot of stairs and finding a vacuum that actually pick up was a challenge. I was so excited to find this one. After a few months the brush roller stopped working. I took it apart and did everything possible to fix it. Because it had worked so well I ordered another one. The same thing happened within two months. Eureka sent me a new one. Within two months again brush roller stops working. Now they are sending me to a repair center when all I want is a refund. There is some sort of defect in this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Vacuum","review":"Great little Vacuum. It does a really good job. My only problem with it is the weight, but for the purpose of picking up pet hair, I couldnt be more pleased...especially around the carpeted stairs. I love the fact I can vacuum the stairs vertically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a fabulous vacuum for pet hair removal!","review":"Cats and dogs and carpeting don't belong together but they end up that way! I've tried many vacuums for pet hair removal - in fact I've tried 5 in 4 years without much luck...but, finally I found something that really works! After reading the reviews about the EUREKA-71B I decided to try it. It came today and I had to try it out right away. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of hair and fur it sucked up from my stairs. In fact, I needed to empty the cup twice (and I thought my house was fairly clean!) It is easy to use and empty, light weight, not too noisy, and has incredible suction and pick up, thanks to the rotating brush. I highly recommend this vacuum! Try it now!Debbie in Cleveland, Ohio"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does its job!","review":"I was looking for a vacuum that can vacuum small corners like bed sides, corners, hard to reach places. And this vacuum does it all!! The designs are easy to understand and I know that the air that it comes out is dust free because it's like a chamber that traps all the stuff inside. downside is Dont let the back of this vacuum face where u r vacuuming, it'll blow dust away. Thought still 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one.","review":"I liked it a lot as it is very handy and have a lengthy cord. Easy to use and clean. I would refer this to anyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've only used this vacuum a few times, but I really love it. I was able to figure out how to use it quickly, and the cord is very long so I can cover a large space without having to unplug. It picks up very well. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I have to empty it more often than I'd like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I bought this to clean the dog hair out of the back seat of my wifes car. Works pretty good. Has good suction and the brushes really help with the dog hair. Comes with a crevice tool to get in the cracks that comes in handy. The cord is plenty long and the filter appears to be washable but haven't tested that theory yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves this thing!","review":"We bought this as a replacement for a dirt devil that we thought had died, turns out it was just hot, so my husband claimed thos one for in the garage to clean out the cars. Well, let me just tell you he loves this thing. It does a much better job than the big vacuums at the carwash and even better than his shopvac without the bulk. So far we are really happy with the amount of dirt that this thing got out of the carpets in the vehicles. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka!...I almost found it","review":"First the positives. For a hand held vacuum this does an efficient job of picking up dirt, rice, whatever my twin boys spill on the ground (except yogurt and wet messes).As far as negatives go, this was much bigger than I expected, and for a 'hand-held' vacuum it feels a bit like a tank. It does cover a lot of surface area though which is a plus.The reason I give 4 stars is that amazon's picture doesn't depict the vacuum with a cord. Given many hand held vacuums come cordless, my automatic assumption was that this would also be cordless. My bad for not reading the fine print in the description (though I do think it is a bit deceptive to picture the vacuum in this way)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for removing pet hair!","review":"After having this vacuum for a couple of months, I'm happy with its performance. It works quite well for getting dog hair off of furniture, and the riser visor feature is great for cleaning the stairs. I find that the design makes it a bit awkward to handle, but worth the trouble given how well it sucks up the dog hair. As another reviewer noted, the dust cup fills up quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical hand Vac","review":"This little hand-held vac has been great for getting all the stairs and furniture in my house clean and for picking up small messes in other spots as well. I also like the option of having the brush on or off. The price was good too. If I could change one thing I'd make it a bit lighter and/or easier to hold and balance in one hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little machine...Big Power","review":"I am so surprised by the power of this handheld. It really has a lot of suction. It also has an onboard tool attachment which makes it really nice. I ordered this for my upholstery in my home, but I also use it on the interior of my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Hand-held Vacuum, 71B","review":"We have found this to be a good vacuum with very good suction. It cleans up well after the dog off blankets, floors, etc. The only problem I have found is that the plug prongs are not separated wide enough so it is loose in the receptable. I keep having to separate the prongs every time I use it. The vacuum is heavy but doable. The vacuum is also loud, but that is expected from a vacuum as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice & Strong Vacuum!","review":"This is a very strong vacuum. Wish it was cordless though. However, it works great and gets the job done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First use was a hit!","review":"Ordered this little gem and received it two days later. Just used it for the first time and here are my first impressions:1. Looks sleek.2. Feels sturdy.3. Suction power surprised and delighted me. Just vacuumed under sofa cushions in minutes and I have two dogs. The device is so powerful that I didn't even have to use the attachment to get into corners.4. Cord is sufficiently long for the common uses I foresee in my home.5. A wee bit heavy after a few minutes, but the heft is worth the power. Don't know that this would be ideal for, say my mother in her sixties, but works for me (30-something male.)I'm curious to see how well this vacuum performs on longer jobs and over the coming years. Overall, I am really happy with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand Vac","review":"Just as noisy as my \\"Hoover Windtunnel\\" upright and cleans just as effectivly.

I would definately recommend purchasing this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Vacuum!","review":"I bought this vacuum to use on the stair case. It got good suction and pick up a lot of dust and dirt. The cons are that it is super loud, heat up fast, heavy and the handle is not ergonomic. It is quite heavy to lift the vac and it would be nice if there are two little wheels on the back so it is easier to glide on carpet. Overall, it is still a good vac, tested on my stair case and it works like a dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum!","review":"This thing will pick up everything your regular vacuum leaves behind.

This is even better than the older dirt devils with a belt driven brush. I would definitely recommend this item. It has many features.

Buy it if you are looking for a strong built handheld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas","review":"I already own one of these, so was confident in buying one for my aunts gift.

I wondered if everyone was on crack since they were raving so much about it because really, how much power could it have?? And the answer is: A LOT!!!! The suction is so strong that you have to use a little strength to pull it along the couch but you know, if that's the worst of my complaints, then I'm in shape. And it is. In the interest of full disclosure, the vacuum only arrived today but it's worked fabulously. It comes with an attachment to get into tiny spaces and at first, I thought the only downfall was that there was nowhere to attach it to the unit when it wasn't in use and then I discovered that it could fit into the vent in the back. Snaps right in there which makes me think that's where it was meant to be. This is perfect for couches, cars, minivans, stairs, you name it. Even gave the curtains a going over and it was a champ.Enjoy the power of this mighty little beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that efficient","review":"Not that efficient Bot this unit from Amazon over a year ago based on reviews. I am mostly disappointed in the cleaning performance and ease of use. This vac is heavy, noisy, hard to push around. The dust filters clog with dirt when washed which reduces air flow the next time you use it. Filters run about $7.50 ea and with their limited capacity and ability to be reused could become a fair expense over time. I would not recommend this vacuum to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little workhorse","review":"I bought this product because I have a German shepherd whose sleep place is my sofa.

I would buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't even been a year, no longer vacuums","review":"This vacuum was great for the first few months,Then it gradually began to fail at sucking up particles.Now it makes my floor dirtier by use, even though I've cleaned it with nearly every use.It refuses to pick up a few measly cornflake crumbs, and much else.Instead it decides to just push them around...It pretty much just gets clogged by dust very easily...my room is dusty.Not worth the money if you don't plan on buying another within the next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice features","review":"The filp guard that you flip up to vacuum the back of the stairs is really nice. I like that is is bagless as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Vacuum","review":"I have nothing but great things to say about this vacuum.

That's the best little vacuum I have bought.Wonder if the upright works this well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a short while...then awful!","review":"This worked pretty well for a little while, but very quickly lost suction (even after cleaning filter)and was useless--just threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dream tool","review":"This is my dream tool that I've been searching for. The suction is stronger than my upright and the noice level is lower when using the hose only. It's a little louder when using the rotating head. The power hose fits on the real easily. It's light and convenient.The only con I would say is it's missing a brush head. I have a brush head with a long hose from my upright. It's the perfect tool when I connect that hose to this little thing, but it'll be better if I can find different brush heads with different softness for different surfaces (e.g., soft brush for computer screens).Since I just got this one, I don't know about the durability yet, but the quality looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Pet...?

The vacuum is also very heavy. I'm tossing mine and getting a lighter one without a rotating brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient for renovation","review":"We have a full-size shop vacuum as well as a conventional vacuum cleaner. We needed something portable and convenient for small pick-ups. My husband got this for Christmas and started using it immediately while doing some bathroom renovation. The dust cup fills quickly but is easy to empty. If you suck screws or nuts, you can retrieve them easily. The small hose is great for small crevasses that you can't easily reach. The cord is long and wraps around the body for storage. Full power all the time, which I prefer to rechargeable now. Good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"big things do come in small packages","review":"Do not let the size of this vacuum fool you, it's suction power rivals that of a full size vacuum.

It's power is amazing and totally worth the buy. Some people say that the fact that the dust collector is transparent is nasty but I actually think it helps because it lets you see that it is collecting dust well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"First off let me say that I didn't NEED this item. I have a perfectly fine Dyson that works wonderfully. But having three shedding Boxers and a microfiber couch and a bed that they sleep on--I got tired of lugging the vacuum cleaner to do daily vacuuming of pet hair. I started looking at hand held vacuums for those quick jobs.After seeing this vacuums high reviews, I decided I would give it a try. Let me say I was surprised how much hair and dust this little vacuum got off my couch and bedspread. I had just used the hose attachment on my Dyson the day before.The only down side is it gets a little hot where the exhaust blows out from the back, but nothing to bad. I only notice because if I am vacuuming a weird angle on the couch, I use two hands and my supporting hand will get the exhaust blow off. Still I am very pleased with this product and no longer dread cleaning my couches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Handheld Vac with Cord I've Ever Had","review":"FINALLY - I found a handheld vacuum (with cord) that works really well and is easy to use, with all the features I wanted!!! I have had at least four different models over the years, most of which didn't have enough power, or were WAY too noisy, or ended up breaking very quickly. I've been using this one for a few months now, and it is GREAT - I would highly recommend it. I use it on area rugs, as well as on the stairs, and for a quick touch-up job in small areas (including near our cat litter box). The cord is the right length (and there's an easy place to store it onboard), it's not too noisy, it's not too heavy, and it even has an easy-to-use crevice tool attached so that mid-job you can make the switch to doing corners and edges, if needed. Emptying the cup and cleaning the filter is a breeze too. Thanks, Eureka, for putting out a quality product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portable Vacuum","review":"We got this for our small apartment that has a few carpets.

It was great until about two months in. First, the roller stopped rolling. Then a few days later while I was vaccuming my area rug (this and my couch were the only things I vacuumed with this to combat cat hair) the vacuum got extremely hot. The air coming out of the exhaust hole in the back was a smokey for a second, then the vacuumed died completely. I own an extremely fat and hairy cat. I guess his unruly mane was no match for this handheld? Or it's just a piece of crap.

He wanted a vacuum with good suction and power to clean up kitty litter. We had previously used a cordless hand held cleaner, but after about 5 minutes, it just conked out. So, we thought since this vacuum is electric it would get it up and keep going. Unfortunately, even though this Eureka is electric, it does not cut it and just doesn't have the desired power and suction. It is okay for real quick and easy jobs. But it is not as powerful as we had hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get all the rave reviews.","review":"I don't get all the rave reviews. This is the first hand-held vacuum cleaner I've ever owned and if this is the best the vacuum industry can come up with for this price...there is something wrong. It is powerful, I guess...but, I have a dog (a pug = short, course hair) and it didn't pick up all the hair on the couch - which was one of the reasons I bought it - and, there wasn't even that much to pick up. The worst thing about it - besides having a cord that isn't that long - is it is VERY heavy...and I'm a strong person. I have only the slightest arthritis, and this hurt my hand after vacuuming just a couple of stairs. Maybe it's me but, I just don't feel the love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about a year before burning out","review":"I had a good run with this vacuum, but just last week as we were vacuuming the floor it started to smell like burnt rubber and suddenly the bottom part where the cord is plugged into started to emit some sparks. I suspect it's the mechanism that turns the brush in the front because it continued to suck in air but the brush didn't turn. We used it on average 15 minutes at time, once a week. I think if it would have lasted 6 more months I would have considered giving it 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great vacuum for 1 year","review":"This vacuum worked great for getting the dog and cat hair off the stairs in my house. It has plenty of suction power, and the \\"Riser Visor\\" is a great feature. Unfortunately, after 1 year, the brush stopped operating when in contact with the carpet.

It made vacuuming the multitude of stairs so much easier. I like it so much I bought one for my sister. But I really wish it had a brush attachment. When you're sitting on the stairs vacuuming you're so close to the moulding you can't ignore the hair/dust resting upon it. The crevice tool gets some of it, but not all. A brush would make this vac perfect. BTW, don't use it to vacuum sheet rock dust as my husband did BEFORE I knew what he was doing. Hopefully a new filter will help the suction. ;o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this little vacuum!!","review":"I was tired of having to haul out my big vacuum to do the stairs all the time. It is heavy and the nozzle doesn't reach to the top so I would have to switch plugs half way up the stairs. This Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum is WONDERFUL!! It has saved me so much time and back pain!! It has incredible suction and has an extra long cord which makes doing my stairs SO much easier! I can even get my kids to help out with the vacuuming now because they love it too! I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who asks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last too long","review":"This unit is one of very rare review that I have rated one star. When it worked it was with great suction power. However, the unit stopped functioning and smelled something like burned motor after I used it 4-5 times.I did not do anything unusual, I used it as light-duty hand vacuum to do quick clean up and yet, the unit failed. I will not buy the same model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This little handheld works really well on my stairs!!! and flipping the lid exposes the rollers to vacuum vertically along the riser, what a great idea!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, do not buy this!!!!!","review":"this thing is defective, no doubt in my mind. The blower stopped working shortly before the motor itself died. Within THREE USES, Very powerful at first than it just start becoming useless within a month. It just looks pretty, that is it, dont buy this spend more money get a quality vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good at what it's intended","review":"There's enough reviews on this product to get a pretty good idea how it works. In general I agree with the majority. This unit is about 5 pounds in weight and does not have wheels. It does a great job on the steps both flats and risers. It would also work well in the car or pet cages using the hose. The filter comes out easy enough. The cloth clogs quickly and will most likely need to be rinsed after every one or two sessions. There is room for the cord to wind on the back of the housing but the attachment clip on th plug is difficult to secure.All in all, this is very good at what it does but it's uses are limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a powerful, reliable, and convenient vacuum cleaner","review":"My wife and I like the portability and the POWER! The trash receptacle is easy to remove and replace. It's a bit difficult to clean the filter, so we have taken to using the big machine (a Miele) to vacuum the dust and animal hair off the Eureka filter. It's still pretty new, but so far so good. We can easily transport it between house and cabin and vehicle (a big plus). The 25 foot cord is a plus. We hit upon a way to store the attachment by simply leaving it on the hose and gently placing it in the receptacle. Not a great solution, but it works ok. We have had to clean the hose of animal hair with a coat hanger once (in the first month of usage), and if this recurs it will drop our rating from five to four. So it's four for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"it really sucks, in a GOOD way!","review":"I really researched before picking out a handheld vac.

But with a 4 year old granddaughter living with us that loves 'crafts', I decided to try again. I am very pleased with the suction power of this small unit. It is a bit difficult to push across the floor--no rollers like the big vacs, but definitely worth it for the smaller messes. It has a long cord and a hose which makes it work well for the cars too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vac","review":"We bought this based on the Amazon reviews and it has been working great!

I saved all its tools, and they fit this new little handheld Eureka perfectly!I attach the tools I saved and then place this great new handheld Eureka on a newly vaccumed floor (so it won't raise any dust). The new Eureka's hose and cord are extra long. Using the long wands from my old canasta, I can vacuum baseboards, corners, top of desks/tables, drapes, etc, rarely having to pick up and move the vacuum cleaner.It will allow me continue to use my circa 1980 upright Hoover vacuum cleaner which does a superb job on floors and carpets. The tools which came with it were not onboard, complicated and cumbersome to install, too much for my bad back to handle.Best $35 I've spent in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I was looking for a small vacuum with power roller brush. Not one that was air driven. I found it with this one. It works very well with picking up pet hair and dust and dirt. Am pleased that it is not very noisy. The only complaint I have is the filter is expensive to replace. They say to replace it every 6 months, but to stay efficient is should be replaced more than that. Overall, it serves my needs very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fantastic as I hoped","review":"Like many other reviewers, I am always in search of the perfect handheld vacuum. I live in an apartment with but a single 8x10 shag carpet in a place full of otherwise wooden floors. I have had the vacuum for approximately 2 years, and it has never really lived up to my (small) expectations. The motor is not really powerful enough to clean the carpet very convincingly, and it is sadly remiss in its bare floor duties. Or perhaps it's not exactly the motor, as I would say that the small extendable hose is fairly reliable, but not a very efficient way to clean. Rather the spinning brush that is the place to pick up dirt seems timid at best, and as such I am always disappointed with its performance. I usually have to sweep after vacuuming.All this and it isn't even cordless! It worked ok on my car (super short pile carpet covers), but not very well and it took quite a bit of elbow grease.I am obviously on the lookout for a new, better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved me","review":"we were drowning in fur dust, the usual things. We can even vacuum our rabbit.

It works great with either the suction only or with the rotating brush function. The cord is long enough to reach and winds up on the body for storage. I recommend this handheld highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will not regret this purchase","review":"I've had this vacuum for about 4 months now and use it at least a couple times a week. I usually do not write reviews, but I felt compelled to in this case. I love this little vacuum! I have two cats and so naturally there is hair everywhere, which drives me crazy as I tend to be rather fastidious. This vacuum is powerful and works like a charm - Especially for the price!! It's powerful, easy to clean, and has a long cord. It works beautifully on furniture, and also around the rest of the house using the hose and attachment (would really prefer if these were longer, but it's ok and still functional)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"This is a wonderful vacuum, especially for stairs.

All seem to be true. It has great suction power and picks everything up (so be careful!). Great for steps and furniture. The hose works well, but as others said, it is short, however the self storage is very nice. When I pull the vacuum out of the closet I have everything. First handheld I have had that is this good. Didn't think there would be a real need for the flip cover on brush but I use it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little vacuum works great!!","review":"This is an excellent little vacuum!

I really like that the brush turns on or off and the hose with a crevice tool,along with it being very lightweight make this vac versatile and very handy. The suction is excellent and the filter easy to remove and wash. I've even used it to clean my car,as the portability makes it easy to use for that as well. I highly recommend this vac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eureka Crappy Clean! Another Chinese Product :(","review":"I had this vacuum for about a year now and it is not a good vacuum.

We got this one primarily for cleaning carpeted stairs and it does a very good job. It is lightweight, powerful, easy to clean, and offered at a great price. A special feature is the head which swivels to vacuum the risers on stairs. The only \\"con\\" I can think of might be cord storage, which isn't a problem for me.

Not balanced. Must twist wrist downward to vac and the heavyest part of the vac is on the back so one is having to apply pressure from with the other hand on the suctions area all the time.

I did not even try the vacuum, knowing I was going to promptly return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum!","review":"Great vacuum.

For the price and quality of product I would recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handheld that does the job.","review":"I researched quite a bit before buying this vac, and am pleased with it's performance. I use it for picking up birdseed around the cages and primarily for the stairs. I have a dyson and absolutely love it, but it's too heavy to drag on my stairs. I wanted a corded vac because all the rechargable ones seemed to not have enough time on a charge, including a portable Dyson- which I returned. The only downside as I see it was cleaning the filter, which could get messy. Now I noticed that there are a washable ones available and I'm going to give them a try. This little guy really does do a great job of cleaning though, and I'm sure with washable filters it will only add to my satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice vacuum for many different purposes!","review":"This things has better suction than any handheld vacuum you will ever use... it is impressive. The only issue that I have ever had with this product is that the black hose clogs every so often near the area where it connects on the front. It is great for cleaning out cars, cleaning up small home improvement projects, and cleaning inside couch cushions. It is a must have, especially for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hand Vacuum That Sucks (The Good Way!)","review":"I have gone through my share of handheld rechargeable vacuums that seem to barely get the spot you are trying to clean up before the battery goes dead within the first year. I decided after reading other reviews to give this a one a shot. I am glad I did.The power is intense. I have used it to pick everything up from crumbs and play-doh from our kitchen floor to spilled cereal on our carpets. It handles it all.For a plug in vacuum, the plug actually works well and wraps up very easily. Less pain I think than trying to mount and charge normal handhelds.It is a little on the heavy side, my wife complains when she has to use it, but admits it does a great job.The hose detaches and has a nice crevice tool built in that is a really nice feature. The way it is mounted keeps it from falling off which I hate on normal vacuums.I would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as weight is not an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hose can easily be extended on this Nice Little Vacuum","review":"This nice little vacuum becomes more versatile using theEureka 61247-1 - The Boss Ultra Smart Vac Model 4870 Attachment Hoseas an extension -- just jam the tapered end of the existing short hose into the vacuum cleaner end of the replacement hose (see my review of the replacement hose.)This would be nicer if it was powered by a rechargeable battery, but that would add weight to an already rather heavy device. It surprised me that this vacuum weighs nearly a pound more than myEureka Quick-Up Cordless 2-in-1 Stick Vacuum with Bonus Filter, 96HX, which, like this hand-held, includes a powered rotating brush, plus a rechargeable battery and a handle. Maybe this vacuum has a more powerful motor, but it would seem that Eureka could do better with a cordless version of this, if they could make the motor lighter, than with their unlovedEureka The Boss Cordless Rechargeable Handheld Vacuum Cleaner, 79Bwith no brush, no hose and weak suction."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it, but...","review":"This is the second one that's died in two years. Granted, I abuse it. I have two carpeted areas that are about 8x10, plus stairs, and we use it instead of a canister vacuum. So probably I shouldn't have expected it to act like a canister. I'm sorry I killed it; it was a terrific little machine for a mini-vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool but need a better design","review":"Pro. suction power is strong, easy to use, brush can stir dust and help clean, basically, a good productCon. if possible, a new design could consider this, while using this on carpet floor, many times it becomes hard to move forward or backward if carpet is newer, I have to push with both hands, the right hand behind the product, bear the hot wind and have to shut it down every 30 minutes. The handle should be placed not on top but on top of back, and hot wind vent may re-routed to lower position. Place the handle in back top can also help women user easier to operate this small device. I am a man with 220 pounds, it is still difficult for me to operate it sometimes. 2 handles may be better than just 1. Think about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only it was cyclonic","review":"I agree with all the positives that so many people are raving about with this vacuum. I won't try to recap them all, but I don't see mentioned that this vac is also rather quiet for the power, especially compared to a Dirt Devil, which in my experience are painfully loud.It would get five stars from me, except that this is the age of the cyclonics, and I would love to have all the features of this vac without so much reliance on the dust cap for first stage filtration. I've used this one for just a few weeks, and I feel like I already need to order new filters, even though I brush it off thoroughly every time I empty the canister. If Eureka offers a similar vac in a cyclonic, I'll probably buy it and put this one on ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Almost a 5-star product. I purchased this vacuum to get pet hair out of my vehicle and off my furniture. It does a great job with almost every surface. The exception was the back of my car seats, which are covered by fabric with fine, tangled fibers - pet hair is literally woven into the fabric.The one item lacking is a soft-bristle attachment for the hose to use when cleaning areas that need a bit of 'dusting' as they are vacuumed. If the 71B had come with that attachment, I'd have given it a 5-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little vac","review":"This is a nice little hand vac with good power. It gets rid of my pet hair on upholstery very nicely. The only drawback is its short hose. It really can't get into places like under couches or my dressers. Since I am older I wanted something that could clean under my furniture without my having to move it. I am looking for an extension wand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka power","review":"I purchased the Eureka 71A hand held vac after reading the various reviews on this site. They are accurate. It DOES suck - and that is a good thing! Vacuums are supposed to do that and this one does it well. We have a bunch of dogs and I often just need a quick pick up of hair and other stuff that they drag in from outdoors. The on board crevice tool is handy. The only thing that I would say is a drawback is that the hose, when used in the right hand is either short(it is on the left of the machine) or if you turn vac then you blow the exhaust right at what you are trying to suck up. I do love the machine tho. It is easy to use, has lots of power and the cord is long enough to go everywhere I need it to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum","review":"This little vacuum has a great little motor and very good suction power considering its size and light weight. Great for cleaning the car in the driveway and for cleaning up after kids in the kitchen. The rolling brush on the head is very strong and does a great job cleaning carpet.However, I do have a couple of minor gripes. The filter gets clogged pretty quickly which can affect suction power after just a few minutes of use. This is especially true if you are cleaning small dust particles. The hose is quite short so when detached for usage, the exhaust from the motor is typically very close to what you are trying to clean up. Thus, it can sometimes blow the dirt around which is kind of a nuisance. The cord wraps around the body for easy storage but the clip mechanism to hold the cord in place is not very effective so the cord comes loose often. Also a nuisance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This thing really sucks!","review":"Out of the box, the first thing you notice is how heavy this little beast is. I bought it strictly for stairs, and with a full flight, it's a bit of an arm workout. That said, it's completely worth it - this little vac has extreme power. It was eating the stairs so hard last night I actually felt like it would pull out of my hand. The riser visor feature is fantastic as well - a great idea from Eureka!Would be 5 stars if not for the heavy weight, but again, it's worth it. My stairs have never been as clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best handheld vacuum","review":"I have owned this vacuum for over a year now. I didn't think it would work so good because of the low price I was wrong. I am so glad I purchased this. It is easy to use. I use it on my rugs,carpet,hard floors,sofa,bed,speakers,drapes,curtains.

(At last I found it). This is an awesome little handheld vacuume.It has more power than my expensive upright vacuume and that is an understatement. I have had several cordless dust buster types but this beats them all. A very long cord makes it so handy and the on board storage for the crevice tool, the brush or just suction option and the wrap around cord storage make it effortless to use.

I went online and saw that the Eureka had a great rating with rave reviews and I must agree. It picked up embedded hair on my steps that had been bugging me for weeks yet couldn't get to come up with the regular vacuum. This was well worth the $40.00 that I paid for it. The cord is long, it stores the accessory right on board and is so versatile. The only negative that I see is the weight. It is heavier than a regular dustbuster, but, still, lighter than a regular vacuum. All in all, glad I listened to the other reviews and bought this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant!","review":"This is the most cleverly designed little vacuum I've ever used. Every little feature is both useful and well-implemented. It's also built well and easy to handle.It has one design flaw, and that is the \\"exhaust\\" air flow.

In fact, I believe it is too powerful for its own good. While attempting to vacuum pet hair from my sofa, the brush stops turning because there is so much suction.

I had to return for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Helper","review":"Bought this unit to replace a broken vacuum.Works as advertised and as what other reviewer said.Great little machine that cleans.A little bit loud but I guess this is the trade off for power in suction.Also the cord does not retract which is another down side but doesn't hurt the performance.Great purchase over all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful little machine!","review":"I have a dog who munches her biscuits all over my good rugs. Tired of hauling out the big sweeper constantly, I ordered this little machine based on good reviews, and I am very glad I did.

It doesn't have as much power as the upright...that wouldn't be reasonable to expect. It does have way more power than any other hand vac I've ever used. It does a beautiful job on the stairs. It has a beater brush and a crevice tool...everything you need. I've also used it in my car and it worked very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value vac","review":"Even after reading great reviews of this vacuum we were surprised how much we liked it: Amply powered, with a decent sized dirt cavity, the low price is pretty unbelievable. All in all it's a great deal but I have two complaints: I would have preferred a brush attachment on the little hose end but the real disappointment is the non retractable cord. It has to be wound up to store then unwound to use every time and that's a time gobbling design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't wait... buy it now","review":"This is the BEST hand-held vacuum I've ever owned. I use it on everything... and with a fawn pug, a red long-haired dachshund and a dark brown chihuahua, we have killer hair bunnies of every color rolling all over our bare floors within days.

I was so excited at how strong the suction is that I spent hours vacuuming little nooks and crannies. We have white carpet on the stairs that gets dirty fast but having this helps keep it clean a little while longer. The vacuum is a little on the heavier side but it doesn't really bother me unless i'm trying to get something up high. For all lower wall and floor jobs, I can just keep it on the ground with no problems. The electrical cord is long so I don't have to keep replugging in other outlets. The only thing I don't like is that the filter is a little hard to clean but the pros far outweigh the cons. Definitely worth it for such a low price tag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Vacuum","review":"Origianlly, I had a Shark vacuum that I used for cleaning my car. I purchased a new car, Mercedes-Benz C300, and figured it was time to get a new vacuum to clean out my car. I was going to get another Shark vacuum, which is decent by the way, but decided on the Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum 71B. Let me say, it is amazing.

I thought to try another brand/style because of the battery life of the B&D. The You Reek just blows the dirt around, i.e. very poor at quick pick up of dirt. Its suction area is very, very selective on its position for sucking in debris. I guess I am spoiled by another brand - if you have no other experience you would most likely like the You Reak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"You'd think from the reviews this would be a no-brainer, but you'd be wrong, Shortly after I started using it the filter on the inside clogged reducing the suction by half.

I still greatly recommend it for someone who would benefit from a corded handheld vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate","review":"We got this primarily for use in our cars. Electrical access is close, so we did not need a battery or 12V unit, and we thought this would have more power. However, it does not draw as good as our cheap (and old) tiny wet/dry vacuum from Harbor Freight. It's a little clunky, and it takes me twice as long to effectively vacuum the cars as it did before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"This is a TERRIBLE vaccum!! I seriously don't understand how anyone could give it a good review! Crazy! When vacuuming it's sucking up a GREAT amount, it is very powerful, BUT HALF OF IT COMES OUT THE BACK!!!! It blows it right back out the back. I was vaccuming my entry rug, which was sooo dirty and then I looked behind me and the hardwood behind me was COVERED in a layer of dust!! Then I felt behind the vacuum and felt it coming out. It wasn't anything that wasn't put together right, it's just how it's made. I don't know how anyone could possibly use this vacuum! It took me longer to clean up the mess it made then it took to vacuum the rug. haha DO NOT BUY THIS! But, amazon is awesome and I returned it the next day and didn't have to pay return shipping or anything. Just went the the process of requesting a return on amazon, and ups picked it up at my door the next day with the prepaid label.

I had to try plugging it into several outlets before I found one that held the plug, which fit loosely in most outlets. The filter cup filled quickly (which I expected) however; it's not easy to empty as my dog's hair and debris affixed to the filter and required peeling off. Basically, emptying the dust filter over the garbage made a mess. I ended up using a tool from my large upright vacuum to clean off the filter. On the plus side, it collected a lot of dirt, hair, etc. from my staircase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little vacuum is the best.

Being rather Tim Allen like, I had to get something more powerful. I am also one to read reviews and research products before I make a purchase. The only real knock I saw that I was concerned about was that the unit is heavy. My wife agrees with that assessment, but is nevertheless in love with this unit. It's great for the little cleanups, and does a fantastic job of cleaning the cat & dog hair from our sofa, and from the dog bed. I have not used it myself yet, but the shear fact that I have not heard any complaints about it tells me that the design is good regarding ease of use and filter cleaning/emptying etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong suction power!","review":"Small and strong.

It really \\"SUCKS\\" nicely, and is relatively light and easy to handle. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because the hose is a little shorter than I was expecting.

Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, but very effective vacuum cleaner","review":"Yes, it's loud, but it's very effective and provides enough vacuum for cleaning the house. We bought it solely to use it for cleaning the carpeted stairways. It was so effective that I've used it to clean other areas of the house. We have $500 Dyson vacuum cleaner, but it has been useless when it comes to cleaning carpeted stairways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hefty little brut","review":"It works just as advertised.

I couldn't be happier with the job it does. The riser feature works great for going up the carpeted boat sidewalls. We have an old boat with Navy Blue Carpet and we have a yellow lab(makes for a vacuuming nightmare). I must say after using this vacuum the blue carpet looks brand new. and with the attached wand feature I was able to clean out the many nooks and crannies. Also the long cord is handy. And the suction is powerful enough that it sucks out any water left in the carpet(probably not recommended), but it has handled it with out any problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Pets!","review":"This product is great on my cloth couches, especially trying to get off the pet hair from my yellow lab.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I initially went looking for a full size vacuum or maybe a cordless one for my stairs: I hate doing them and it's so hard. I read the reviews and thought I'd try it as the price was right. I'm so glad I ordered this. It has the power to get everything and is so easy to do my stairs now. It is a bit heavy, however, I don't work out and I can still use it easily for about 20 minutes. It has a nice long e-cord; the attachments for crannies is right there. I do find myself emptying the small dust-catcher regularly (twice on my stairs that hadn't been cleaned in a while) but I'm so happy with the results and I wouldn't want it any bigger. Even my husband and child love to pick it up and use it for spot cleaning. It also works great on the couch and chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little sucker","review":"This little vaccuum has great suction power, much more than I expected. We use it for stairs, upholstry (with care of course because of the high speed brush) and cars.Pros: great suction, easy to clean, excellent built in accessory hose for tight spots, good cord length, well balanced.Cons: none that come to mind.Overall, this is a great tool. I considered the ShopVac and Dyson handhelds but I am very pleased that I bought this Eureka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great in cars, sofa and steps","review":"Bought it for my steps, but it is also great for car clean up.

It works really really well. It is a very strong vacuum and takes a bit of arm strength to push it around the carpet. Its not that heavy though, just powerful! It is corded, which is really nice. Don't have to worry about charging it up. The air filter does need to be cleaned after about 5 uses. It stores easily in my closet. It is not too loud either.

First, the power switch allows you to shut off the roller brush if you don't need it. Next, the roller brush itself has a cover that rotates 90 degrees to facilitate vacuuming vertical surfaces on staircases and furniture. Also noteworthy is the filter cup, which works great for picking up fine dust and dog fur. Lastly, the vacuum sports a detachable hose that I can use attachments from my other vacuums on such as duster and sweeper brushes. Great compliment to my upright and wet-dry vacs - I highly recommend this product for pet owners and others looking for a powerful, versatile, and easy to use hand-held vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I purchased this little vacuum to vacuum my stairs since the attachment that came with my big vacuum was a joke.

The brush suction is good, which would be the main thing you look for, but to me that's overshadowed by the negatives: 1) the cup falls off easily and doesn't sit flush in its spot 2) the filter is hard to clean 3) the cord doesn't stay wrapped 4) there isn't good suction from the hose. It is heavy and doesn't get into small areas but I would even live with that if it weren't for the cup, filter, cord and lack of hose suction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product for me","review":"I bought this product to vacuum my stairs in my 2-level townhouse apartment.

It is lightweight, convenient, and has the suction power to tackle just about any job. It's great for vacuuming out your vehicle, stairs, moldings, etc. Most of all, this hand-held is FANTASTIC FOR PET HAIR!! The one and only \\"con\\" I can find is that the filter can get very dusty thereby reducing the suction power of the vac until the filter is cleaned. I simply take the hose of my regular sized vac and vacuum the eureka filter, restoring it. I suggest spending the $7-8 to purchase a spare filter, well worth it. I am extremely pleased with my vacuum purchase,worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This vaccumm is great and durable","review":"This vacuum really helps clean small corners and areas in your house.

The first time i used it l couldn't have been happier however it worked once then the roller decided not to work after that. Suction started getting weaker and weaker. By the 3rd time of using the vacuum it failed to pick up anything and it now makes a nasty burning smell when i turn it on. i have tried cleaning out the pipe and the brush but nothing helps. l had high hopes but it was a Big disappointment. Save yourself 40 bucks and put it towards a decent vacuum is my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"For the price, this little guy is great! I appreciate how compact it is and that the crevice tool fits into its own compartment, but I do wish that the hose for the crevice tool was a bit longer.

I had just bought a Bissel powerforce compact vacuum from the store without first checking the reviews online and it was too heavy for me to use on the stairs. Guess what? This Hand-Held vacuum is just as impossible. The suction is great which earned one star from me. That's all I am impressed with. I tried vacuuming the stairs and it was too heavy to hold and maneouver. It didn't reach the little nooks. I thought it was just me. I didn't mention anything to my husband about it but he had used it on the stairs and had the same complaint.

It is powerful, handy and has created it own place in the mix of cleaning equipment, as it gets used on a daily basis now, just because of it's small size and portability and powerful suction. It is very easy to clean, and I am not sure how we ever got along without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I never thought I would say this, but I love this vacuum so much!As the owner of two black dogs, I pretty much just accepted the fact that I would never be rid of the fur all over my floor. But I decided to give the Eureka Hand Held Vacuum a go. I purposely picked this model for two reasons 1) plug in rather than battery for more power and 2) has a hose which the Bissel pet one did not.This is just amazing and sucks up every little hair on the carpet. I am actually excited to vacuum! Works great on stairs, furniture, car interiors and whenever you don't want to bust out your full size vacuum. I was initially a little surprised by how heavy the vacuum was (I think it says 5 lbs?), but really that just speaks to the quality and durability of the vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked...","review":"Worked ok for awhile, now it doesn't work very well even after changing the filter. Plus, the electrical plug end does not stay attached to the cord, so the cord always unravels. Drives me crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"angry at my Eureka vacuum","review":"I wrote a raving review of this vacuum a week or so after I got it. I have to change my tune, now. The filter got REALLY gross, really quick. It was very difficult to get the microscopic type dirt out of the filter. I bought a replacement filter. For some reason, it lost about 80% of it's sucking power even with the new filter. Today I was trying to vacuum and it died. It just died. It worked great the first couple weeks, then went kablooey. If it had even lasted 6 months at the capacity it had at the beginning, I would consider it well worth the cost. But it started petering out after a few weeks! Lame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"It product works good, it is very powerful, but makes ALOT of noise and if you don't hold it just right, the exhaust will blow away what you are trying to clean up.I got it to clean up after our little bunny, he flings his litter out of his cage, and it was a pain to get the big vaccumm out every time. I mostly use the the hose which does clog if I try to pick up too much or something to big. It works good for what I bought it for...I gave it four stars because it is powerful and picks up as good as my big dyson, but it does clog, it's really loud, and the cup fills up quick. But I would buy it again if I had the choice to do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I was very impressed with shipping; the product arrived within a few days after I placed an order. This cleaner gets the job done. It's actually not as heavy as others have made it out to be (I don't consider myself particularly strong). I would appreciate it more if more time was allowed for usage before the machine shuts off to cool down its motor but since I have a small space to work with it's not a huge deal. Probably not recommended for those who need heavy duty cleaning within a large space. Overall it's a nice gadget for a small room like the one I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum for the money","review":"I gave it 5 stars for sucking power which is what I needed. However, on a couple of my carpets, I have to hold down the ends or the vacuum will suck up the carpet, but that's not the vacuum's fault as I have other throw rugs that I do not have to do this to. I would recommend this. I also bought the washable filter for this vacuum which should save money in buying filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This vacuum is great. I use it to clean my stairs, couch and car. It has great suction and the attachments help me to get into smaller areas. I especially love that I can flip the front cover to do the front if the stairs. If you a looking for a great hand vac look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Little Guy","review":"I bought this to kinda clean up after my 2-year-old and was surprised at how powerful this thing is. I thought I'd need a shop vac for the messes but this worked perfectly. The suction is super strong and it's lightweight. I am absolutely satisfied with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corded portable vacuum","review":"Although understandably heavier than cordless models, the addes suction and brush features make this a must-have applicance, especially for pet owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good!","review":"I have hardwood floors throughout my home and I needed something little for stairs and rugs! So far this have been wonderful. I have used it four times and there is no problem picking up dirt or fuzzies (I don't have animals). The filter is already really dirty, so I would recommend buying some at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Handheld","review":"We replaced the battery operated Shark handheld vacuum we had with this vacuum. Over time the battery was getting weaker and the replacement cost for the pack was half the price of this new Eureka.Going from battery to corded was a drastic improvement. This is one small powerful vacuum. The design is smart as well. The cord winds neatly on the back end. The tip attachment for the hose fits into the backside of the vacuum for storage. The hose is nice when needed as is the drop down front to vacuum vertical surfaces(great for cat hair on the side of a couch). The cord is long so you don't find yourself having to move the cord for areas to vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great vacuum - until it burns out (about a year)","review":"This worked great. A little heavy but good suction. However, our first burnt out at 11 months. Thankfully, we live near a service center and they replaced it with a brand new unit. The second lasted perhaps nearly two years.It wasn't used that much and I expect better. My floor vacuum is 9 years old and running, my Mighty Mite (which I don't use much at all) might be 20 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"vacumn","review":"This is a greatvacumn for picking up a quick mess or for stairs.

We've had two of these in the family and I had to get one for myself. It's powerful, has just the right amount of features and is very portable. Easy to clean as well. Just dump out the dust holder, and optionally wash the air filter with water and let dry when necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this","review":"I am very happy with this purchase. It has great power/suction. Gets the job done. I've only used it for the stairs so far & it did a great job. I have a Lab & a Himalayan cat & it did great with the pet hair. The cord wasn't quite long enough so I used an extension cord. I can't believe what a great price this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy Likely","review":"I have purchased 5 vacuums over the past two years while trying to counter the maddening shedding cycles of a hypermetabolic dog. This Eureka hand-held is the only unit capable of quickly and effectively extracting pet hair and funk from my couch cushions and blankets. My weekly couch cleaning has been reduced from a 15-30 minute task to a 2-minute task. While the 71B is easy to wield for quickly cleaning carpeted stairs as well, a more powerful vacuum would be better suited for deep-cleaning of carpet. However, I doubt there is a more capable or convenient unit on the market for rapidly removing pet hair from upholstery, especially in the sub-$50 price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"I live in a tiny room (dorm room sized) in a big house with a vacuum cleaner that desperately needs cleaning and a new filter, and which I have to lug up some pretty steep stairs to use. Needless to say, I never vacuumed my room before I got this little Eureka. I needed a vacuum cleaner that didn't take up a lot of space, and that had a detachable hose so I could get all of the cobwebs in the corners of my room and under my furniture. Thus far, the Eureka has done a fantastic job. It sucks really well, and the hose does a decent job. However, it does fill up pretty quickly, and when I open the top I have to be careful not to release a ton of dust all over the place--but I think that's a small price to pay for the ability to easily vacuum my room. I've only had it for a few months, so if it spontaneously dies in 9 months, that would be unfortunate, but given the other options for a small vacuum cleaner that works well and has a hose, I think this is as good as it's gonna get."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful, bulky","review":"Pros: cleans up everything. For cleaning, don't forget to disconnect both ends of the hose (just a good twist and yank).Cons: it is too bulky for under the furniture, and the cord is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I bought this vacuum for my daughter and got feedback from her that it's a wonderful product with very strong suction power. Also, it's versatile and easy to maneuver."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay if you don't have that many animals","review":"I read ALL of the reviews on how great this is for pet hair. I have 16 cats and to get the cat hair off of the furniture I need to go over the couches about 10 times with the vacuum. It's perfect if you only have a couple of animals - but if you have more than 5 then it gets a bit harder. What I've been doing is using a lint brush first then go over everything wearing rubber gloves and this way the cat hair sticks to the gloves. FINALLY I go over everything with the vacuum and it makes it MUCH easier. I know it's alot of work and it has to be done on a daily basis but it's better than sitting in cat hair. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A handy little hand vac","review":"This is a very handy little hand vac. Nice suction and can be used easily with small attachments used for cleaning electronics. It gets into small places wonderfully. Great for cleaning crevices and corners and cobwebs. Just wish the hose was a little longer. The electric cord is nice and long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka 71B Hand-held Vac","review":"I purchased it to use on stairs & am happy with its performance. I also like it for furniture. It seems fairly easy to empty & assembly was easy. Good instructions. It is heavier than I expected, but not unmanageable. It picks up pet hair. Being corded, it is always ready to use, assuming there's an outlet within range.Hope it lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife finally agrees this is better.","review":"I have this sitting in the garage since 2005.The wife insists her Eureka Mighty Mite is better than this one.Rule one of marriage: don't argue with wife. Just don't touch her stuff.After 6 years, she finally agrees this Eureka vacuum is better.It is lighter than Mighty Mite, and has similar vacuum power. The amps are less, but the sucking power appears the same.We need it for the spots the Roomba won't do. She still complaints the hose is too short, after we attached the extension from the Mighty Mite vacuum. Yes, it fits.She is just too lazy to bend down her knees 2 inches, and the extension will touch the floor.Don't ladies call this plie in ballet ? The only time she plie is in front of the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after the first week.","review":"We got this vacuum for the office and within the first week the vacuum broke.

I don't recommend using it to pick up dirt/soil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems good at first - doesn't last!!!!!!","review":"********BROKE AFTER 3 MONTHS. Doesn't suck anything any longer and it's NOT the filter. High rating is likely people not returning to say how their vacuum broke! Wait, can I give it less stars??! ******** Perfect thus far but...if I could add anything, it'd be an internal cord holder, and some telescoping handle so i wouldn't have to hunch over (because this lil thing is actually stronger than our larger vacuum and I'd prefer to just use it!). not too heavy. powerful. sucks my fluffy dog's hair off everything. assuming the only part i wont enjoy is cleaning out the filter. this is probably the only hand-held vacuum i've used that really works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Sorry to say it is a piece of junk.

But every time we try to vacuum, all the dust that comes in, gets out at the back.

Thanks again to Amazon for another great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful little vacuum","review":"I got this to get rid of hairs on the carpet of my tiny studio apartment. I really like the fact that it's powerful, and has a pretty long cord. But I'm going to talk about two cons for my consideration.First, hairs got tangled on the rotating brush (i have long hair), as happens with many other upright vacuums. It would be nice if you can remove the rotating brush to clean the hairs that got stuck on it.Second, the manual says you shouldn't wash the filter, however, just after one use, it seems to me impossible to thoroughly clean it without washing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum","review":"I had an old Eureka hand held and it lost its power after many years. So I bought a different brand, that was battery run. I hated it! I used it for 2 months and decided to look on Amazon.com for the Eureka hand held vacuum. The price was great! I love my new vacuum.

We always take the dogs with us...two large dogs. One of them sheds and the other is a dirt magnet. I love this vacuum. I use it everyday we camp to clean not only the floor, but every surface, including the sofa. I can use it on shelves and even the top of the bedspread to make sure there's no dog hair left inside. It takes a total of 10 minutes to clean the trailer with this vac and I love that it's bagless...one less thing to take camping. The weight is perfect for me and the suction so far is really great for dog hair and lose dirt. I recommend this for any small space. We chose this one over a cordless vac because of the features and the anticipated additional strength in suction, which we thought would be necessary for the dog hair. This vacuum exceeded our expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have four cats and this thing is AMAZING!!","review":"GREAT vacuum for in-between clean-ups. I use this weekly to get four cats' worth of hair off of my couch and chairs. Works great and picks up all the junk really well! I gave it the \\"lint roller test,\\" meaning that I vacuumed the couch and then used the lint roller to see what was missed. Amazingly, not much cat hair was left behind! The ability to swivel the brush cover for vertical cleaning is super useful!Minus 1 star for being a little on the heavy side, not having an additional handle in the back for extra carrying support when cleaning, and for making it too easy to accidentally open the dust catcher when turning the vacuum off. This last thing hasn't happened to me yet, but I can see how it could. All not big issues by any means.This thing is a definite EXCELLENT buy for pet owners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great suction--all the other reviews are correct","review":"Works great.

My orange and white long hair cat has very fine cotton-like fur that has a way of weaving itself into my furniture--I had almost given up until I purchased this vacuum. It's miraculous! It made cleaning my furniture almost fun because I could see the results so quickly.

We have 2 dogs with wiry hair so getting dog hair out of our sofas is quite tricky. This hand-vac does a superb job of picking it all up. I was shocked the first time I used it at how well it worked. The little hose comes in handy also, and I really like how you can adjust the front piece so it's easier to clean hard-to-get places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hand Vac","review":"I purchased this hand vac to get my golden retriever's hair off the front of my furniture. I wanted one with a motorized brush roller. After researching many hand vacs, the Eureka 71B seemed to be the best fit. It does a great job in removing the dog hair and is easy to empty. I also like having the hose attachment fit right on the vac along with the cord. It also adjusts for vertical and horizontal vacuuming. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"We have a lady bug issue in our 100-year-old house, and I bought this vacuum to easily move from room to room to sweep the little critters out of our windows. However, I have found that I use it constantly! It has great suction, and is so much easier to use on stairs, vacuuming close to baseboards (where my other vacuum seems to miss), and vacuuming our cars. I use attachments from my large vacuum to reach places where the attached hose doesn't quite reach. I've had this small vacuum for about 2 years now and it is still going strong...however, if it does break, I'll be buying a new one without hesitation. I really don't know what I would do without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable vacuum","review":"I bought this product mainly for our vehicles and to pick up our pet's fur.

I love the fact that it has the hose and crevice attachment attached. I've used it on lawn furniture and car seats as well as carpeted steps and upholstered furniture--and no paper bags to buy. It's easy to empty and amazing how quickly and thoroughly it cleans up pet hair. I've tried the battery operated cleaners and they just don't have the power to clean up the hair. The cord is a sufficient length. Overall it's a great machine for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush motor lasted for only 27 months","review":"I purchased this vacuum in late June 2010. Today the brush stopped spinning due to brush motor failure. I confirmed that the belt was not the issue after I took the vac apart. The belt lasted longer than the motor; how do you like that? I used the vac once per week in a small (960+/- sq ft) carpeted condo. Each weekly use was for no longer than 15 minutes. I will contact Eureka tomorrow and complain. What a disappointment, not to mention this 7 pound yellow plastic brick entering the waste stream."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for rugs","review":"I use this to clean little things in the house. I hate to always use the heavy duty vacuum cleaner for small stuff. I use this for little spills or places that my big one can't get to. It works well with rugs. I have rugs in the living room. So I use this to clean the rugs. In the bed room I would use the heavy duty vacuum. Great for small jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Sucker is Sweet","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend as a replacement for another hand-held vacuum.

I use it principally on carpeted stairs. The carpet has a medium height shag. The vacuum's motor is very strong, the brushes are quite long, but the brush roller has no height adjustment, making it difficult to move across the carpet. I overcome it by lifting the vacuum slightly as I move it, but it would be much better if the brush roller had a height adjustment to accommodate varying shag depths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned out after 2 uses","review":"I got this vacuum on Nov 19, 2008 and used it 2 times, the third time something started smelling really strong and bad (burned plastic and rubber) and although it still sort of works, the motor seems to be melting away. I just missed my return deadline (Jan 31) from amazon by 9 days so I can't return it. However, Amazon offered me a replacement. I hope this one works as I am not impressed with the longevity of the previous one. I will be sure to use it a lot more to test it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suction, but could be lighter","review":"Its amazing how much dirt this little baby sucked off our couch and upholstry.

The attachment is very handy (and well designed storage when not in use). I dropped this down a flight of stairs (twice) and it still works great. Just a tip/word of caution, it is a little heavy so if you have a bad back or will be using this bending over significantly it could cause discomfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum!","review":"I bought this Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum because taking out a large vacuum for a simple job can be a pain. I'm amazed at how powerful it is! I've owned many hand-held vacuums before, and this one is by far the best! It has a long durable cord, so you don't have to worry about charging it or running out of power. The hose comes with an attachment that works great in cracks and crevices and has plenty of suction power. It's nice and small for easy storage, but not too small. I don't understand how there are any negative reviews, this vacuum would get 5+ stars if it were up to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum, but it really is a lil heavy","review":"This has great vacuuming power but it weighs 6 pounds and the hose attachment is a lil short. So Ill have to minus a star until they invent a vacuum just like this with a longer hose and is a lot lighter. I love the design and the thought that went into this. I believe the reason its so heavy is the jet engine they use in this for a motor. Alil loud but not as bad as reviews led me to believe. They havent heard my hoover heeeee. Now thats a loud vac. I recommend for people who dont mind a lil extra weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This is a good little vaccum for the steps and small jobs in the house. Great pickup and does exactly what I needed it for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Be Better","review":"I have 2 medium-sized long haired dogs and I purchased the Eureka to use on a daily basis to clean up after them in my bedroom where they sleep at night. The vacuum does have really good suction when the dust cup is empty or nearly empty. The problem is that the dust cup is really small and doesn't hold very much. With 2 dogs to clean up after, it has to be emptied frequently in order to work well. In addition, the filter clogs easily and it's pretty messy to beat all the dust out of it (that has to be done outside). The plastic bristles on the roller really trap hair, so it's necessary to pull the hair strands off of them at least once a week. Lastly, the cord isn't very long and the plug pulls out of the wall socket easily. This is my first Eureka hand vac and it will be my last. Dirt Devil makes much better hand vacs for dealing with pet hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but not for the car","review":"I bought this vacuum with the intention of using it to clean the car. As a vacuum it works very well, and is not as noisy as many claim. After all, it's a vacuum it has to make noise. It's easy to clean and works well. Though it's a bit on the heavy side for such a small vacuum.It does not work with the car. I attached a converter plug to use with the car, but it would not even start. I figured that it simply needs more power. So I attached the converted plug into 150w power inverter but it still refused to start. So you can't use it for the car, but it certainly works well if your intention is use at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71B","review":"Great Vacuum for a great price ... very powerful.

The first one died about being used about 20 times because the brush motor burned out. Since this product got generally favorable reviews on Amazon we decided to buy a second one. After about the third use the brush motor burned out again. Based on other reviews this seems to be a common problem and a design flaw that Eureka should fix or at least make it a part that the user can replace. If they fixed this problem it would be a great vacuum. It does a great job of picking up dirt and cat hair. Time to shop for a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"eureka hand-hele vacuum","review":"really great little vacuum, perfect for car, really good for carpeted steps and corners in home, any small spaces in home. very powerful to be so small. really satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little heavy, but does the job well.","review":"I have had this item for less than a week.

NOT a rechargeable, which means it has LOTS of suction power. It has a 20 foot cord so I can plug it in midway in my unit and reach everywhere. The cord wraps around the base with a grip on the plug to lock it in. The hose is attached to the unit, and the straight nozzle stores in the base. It doesn't require a bag, but contrary to what I read in another review, Eureka DOESN'T recommend washing the filter with water. Only the cup around the filter is washable. Amazon does have an aftermarket filter replacement which is washable, I might have to check it out. All in all, I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little hand held rocks!","review":"I've had several hand helds including Dirt Devil,Sharks and several cordless ones and this vaccum is the best one I've ever used! Wow does it have some power! We have two cats and their hair gets everywhere they lay. My floor model Kirby, with it's attachments on, doesn't pick up the hair half as fast as this does! I also LOVE it's long cord. We just got rid of our Shark that had a retractable cord, but it was so short I sometimes couldn't reach the whole couch from the outlet. I agree with other reviewers that this vacuum is indeed a bit heavy, but that must be what makes it so strong too! I think it would be too heavy for someone who is elderly or has some weakness of the wrists, but otherwise it is fine...it's not like you are vacuuming the floor of a whole room with it! I rarely post reviews, but felt I should because I love this so much. I've already recommended it to other friends with cats/dogs.

Eureka 71A Hand Vac, you're my best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vac!","review":"I bought this hand vac after my Shark hand vac blew up.

I tried to look on Eureka's website but they don't offer an extension for this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Hand Held Vacuum, 71B","review":"The vacuum was better than we expected.

I bought this for use with my car and some spot cleaning around the house. It was more than capable handling both tasks. IMO, the power is comparable to the vacuums at the gasoline stations. I did not have any trouble getting into the nooks of my car and the vacuum picked up every piece of dust and pebble. The cord length is generous and I run an extension cord with it if I need extra length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works reliably, but the cord is very annoying, and the air shoots out at you (read more)","review":"I bought this vacuum several months ago to use for quick clean ups when I don't feel like taking out my big vacuum. Unfortunately, I made the wrong decision when I picked this vacuum. The cord is nice and long, but very annoying to coil it back in place. Once you have it coiled up in its slot, you have to tightly clasp the plug to the cord and if you don't get it tight enough, it unravels again. I always find myself spending way too much time putting this little vacuum away and I think to myself \\"I should have just used my regular vacuum.\\" And another annoying thing about this vacuum - the air shoots out of the back, which often times blows the dust/crumbs/whatever mess all over the place. I really don't like this vacuum and I'm going to buy a cordless dust buster to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuums so good sparks fly...well sort of","review":"After reading the glowing reviews on here, I purchased this vacuum to use on the steps in my home. Plugged it in, and I will say for the first 10 steps it did a TREMENDOUS job...was cleaning like crazy. Then, all of a sudden my vacuum lit up like a Christmas tree, a small ball of fire came out the back, a big puff of smoke and then as the sound of the motor got weaker and weaker, sparks began to fly out the back. I realize with all the good reviews, I must have gotten a lemon...but I will say this was one of the best fireworks displays I have ever seen...which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great suction power, but weight and power cord are negatives","review":"This little handheld vacuum cleaner has great suction power. But that's really all I have good to say. I bought it because it had so many good reviews, but I'm not too happy with it.- It's as heavy as my Bosch canister vaccuum, except I have to bend over to use it, which is actually harder on my back.- The weight wouldn't be so bad if it didn't also have a cord. I never thought to make sure a small handheld vacuum would be \\"cordless\\"...just assumed it would be. The cord defeats the purpose of the convenience in my opinion. Also, you have to manually unwrap and rewrap the cord to put it away. At least my canister vac has one of the cords you pull on, and it automatically rewinds itself.- My last complaint about is the exhaust air shoots out the back/bottom side, which sometimes blows the very things you're trying to vacuum across the room if you're not careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum 71B","review":"I looked at many hand-held vacuums before chosing this one. Most of the reviews were good. The firt time I used it, although it was a little heavy for a hand-held, I was pleased with the suction and the brush. Today, was the second time. What a nightmare! I took off the hose to add the crevice tool which worked fine, but reattaching the hose to the vacuum was horrible. I tried, my husband tried, I tried again, etc. We finally got it back on with much difficulty and it came off as I was vacuumimg. My husband said, \\"Send it back!\\" I shall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Have not had this very long so I cannot comment on durability, but it works great and is amazingly powerful for the size. just wish it had a slightly longer hose for times when you do not want to use the rotating brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum!","review":"great hand held vacuum, love it for my stairs. sucks animal fur off of furniture and blankets great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One answer to dog hair.","review":"Found this product works great to get dog hairs.

This is a very powerful vacuum with a rotating brush that may be enabled or diasabled as desired. It does a fantastic job of vacuuming carpeted stairs.

An attachment kit is available that will add to the versatility of this compact unit, I really like it,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent.","review":"Long cord; I use it on my car instead of the gastation vacuum. I don't really like it's shape (a smaller, less fragile design on top would be better), but I am not returning it. I like that it's plugged in and it's life does not equal the battery recharge memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"This machine is awesome","review":"For a hand vac this machine really has a lot of power. It made short work of our stairs and furniture. I've also found that once the filter starts to plug up all you need to do is brush it off with a bench broom/brush into the trash and it's good to go for another round. After about 5 times of cleaning the filter with the brush I blew it off with the air compressor and it was back to performing like brand new again. There's no need to buy a new filter as often as the manufacturer would like you to believe. I bought this because it's corded and has POWER. Cordless vacs just don't have a long enough run time to really be effective. For forty bucks you can't go wrong with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This vac is incredibly powerful - it even picks up coins.

I have two cats (one a Himalayan). This vacuum WAS amazing for the first 2 years. Suddenly I smelled something burning, not like rubber burning, more like electrical. Then I saw sparks inside like near where the cord goes into the vacuum. I cleaned the brushes all the time but it still sparked up. I am so disappointed because it worked so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacuum, small drawbacks","review":"I got this vacuum for my mom for Christmas. So far she has been pleased with its actual performance, but she has a few complaints. First, it is heavy so it is portable but hard to use for long periods of time because of size and weight. Second, the dust cup is small. She has two cats that shed a lot and she has to empty the cup several times while vacuuming a single area. These are complaints you could apply pretty much across the board to handheld vacuums, especially in this price range, so I would still recommend this product and I would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what we needed","review":"We wanted a light weight hand held vacuum that was easy to use to pick up dog hair on furniture. We have been disappointed in the past with cordless hand helds as they seemed to lack power or did not hold a charge so this is our first corded hand held. It did a good job on dog hair on upholstered furniture. The cord is sturdy and plenty long enough to cover a room without constantly having to move to another outlet which I have had on some vacuums. It has a nice balance of feeling well made and sturdy but light enough that you don't need to be a weight lifter to handle it. The see throgh dirt trap was easy to remove and reinstall and lets you know the vacuum is working and when it needs to be emptied. For what we needed, this is just fine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71B","review":"Love this item. It is just what I wanted, small and powerful. It has as much suction as my canister. I like not having a bag and being able to see when I need to empty the unit.I would certainly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hefty but Powerful Handvac","review":"As other reviewers mentioned, the Eureka 71B is a little heavier than you'd expect for a handvac. However, it works so well that I'm not bothered by the weight. The heft actually helps make the vacuum seem better built than most. I'm not at all worried that it will fall apart when I use it.I mainly bought it for cleaning up after my cats -- one of them likes to knock the dry food out of the bowl and onto the floor -- and it works great for that. This little vacuum has no problem sucking up the pieces of dried cat food. It also does well at sucking hay out of the carpeting in my car and that's not an easy feat, even for a full-size vacuum.The only thing that slightly bothers me is that the outflow of air is pretty strong. Considering how hot it is in Texas this summer, having hot air blowing on me isn't a positive. I'm only using the vac for small/short jobs though, so this is a really petty gripe on my part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely designed to do the trick","review":"Car vacuuming made easy. Also good for vacuuming out the area beneath the lint trap in the dryer. And the fridge coils that get clogged with dust.Like it a lot.Edited to add that it seemed to stop working (i.e. it fired up and made the vacuum noise when you turned it on, but there was no vacuum power, it didn't suck anything up or grab onto any debris), and I was ready to chuck it but then I took a closer look and found a candy wrapper clogging up the hose attachment (it was deep on the inside), and once I managed to dislodge it using an old unbent wire coat hanger, it worked like new again. So be careful vacuuming up bigger debris with the hose attachment, because if that side hose gets blocked with old leaves, wrappers, etc. then it kills the vacuum power of the entire unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems great!","review":"I bought this vacuum about a month ago because I live in a room in a shared house. Our \\"house\\" vacuum doesnt work very well and the carpet in my room always seemed dirty. I decided to buy this vacuum just for the room and it really works well. I really like the fact that it has an attachment and that it is a small vacuum, yet it still has a cord. I had to return a \\"cordless\\" vac earlier in the year because it wasn't strong enough and didn't hold a very good charge. This Eureka vacuum was even cheaper and works MUCH better. So far I enjoy it and have no complaints. I guess it would be nice if it had a HEPA filter, but my boyfriend and I both have allergies to cats and dust and since using this vacuum have noticed an improvement (there is a cat living in the house). I think it's great for use in a small space, such as a dorm room, closet, bedroom, car, etc. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best little vacuum ever!","review":"I am so happy with this vacuum! We just purchased the first house we have had with stairs. I was having such a hard time getting them clean with the regular vacuum cleaner, so I did a little searching for a solution and found this handy dandy item.

It's more than the wife wants to lug around and is a little workout to get the job done. That is my only gripe, it cleans well and it has plenty of suction. The flip door it kinda handy. I will deal with the weight if it cleans well and last a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"I am really impressed with this vacuum. I had an old Dirt Devil vacuum that I used for stairs and the new Eureka is so much more effective. I could not believe the amount of dirt and cat hair that came out of the carpeting with the Eureka, even on the main carpet areas that I regularly use the big vacuum on. Great for upholstery, too.

I just received mine and tried to vacuum up some clumps of dust and dog fur and it was a nightmare.

Granted I'm basing this review on my first impression so I hope to do an update in a month or so, but my first impression tells me that this vacuum is wonderful, especially for the price.

On the upside, the vacuum generates an impressive amount of suction. It picks up pet hair and is great on stairs.On the downside 1) the \\"filter\\" is not terribly efficient. When you empty the dirt cup make sure to power the unit back on outside - it emits a very substantial cloud of dust when you first turn it on. Better still buy three or four extra filters and wash them between uses. 2) The dirt cup is quite small and requires frequent emptying. This then leads to the problem noted in 1). 3) The slide switch that selects the operating mode and releases the dirt cup jammed. The only way to operate it was to force the switch with a screw driver. Then the switch broke, rendering the vacuum useless. I really miss my dirt devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I just got this vacuum and immediately tried it on the stairs. It worked great.

I looked on line at the reviews of hand held vacuums and liked what I read about this one. Well, the reviews don't lie!! This is wonderful! I still must be on my knees to keep the rug clean, but it does the job so much faster. It is amazing the amount of hair this picks up. It is easy to clean, too. The dust cup comes off easily and I just remove the hair and then brush the filter off into a trash bag. Once in a while I have to remove hair that has wound around the brush, but that is easy, too.

For the first test of this unit I went to a sofa that cats normally sleep on that was just vacuumed with another vacuum and had a sticky lint roller used on it to the point hair could not be visibly seen. I ran this unit on the sofa and it was soon a quarter filled with large clumps of hair and dirt.Long power cord. The power cord is of a good length. I don't need an extension cord to vacuum my staircase.Adjustable brush. This is great for risers. You can have the vacuum brushes point down or up.ConsShort hose. The hose is rather short, perhaps a foot long or so. It means that when vacuuming the car with the hose you'll have to move this unit around or place it strategically.Loud It's fairly loud. Then again, it's powerful so perhaps it's expected.Overall I highly recommend this unit. It's very powerful, portable and at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reviews Were Right AND RAINBOW ATTACHMENTS FIT","review":"Its big. Its heavy.

Two seconds of fireworks, no seconds of vacuuming.I'm not taking a chance on a second sample either-even though I purchased an extra filter that will cost me a re-stocking fee and return postage to the vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks everything up, spits it back out","review":"I don't have time for a video review, or else I would show all of you fools how terrible this vacuum really is. I can't believe all of these 5 star ratings. Did you people actually use the thing? The only way it sucks things up is by using the hose--the roller is completely useless. As soon as you turn the thing off, it drops whatever was picked up in the roller right back on your floor! And god forbid you try and suck up a massive mess! Try spilling baby powder or flour or any sort of fine substance on your floor, and watch the Eureka 71B Hand-Held POS suck up all of it and spit it right back out, AT YOU!!!! All the dirt flies in the front, and then out the so-called \\"exhaust port,\\" and ALL OVER YOUR CLOTHES. WHAT A PIECE OF POOP. I would swear all I could if Amazon would allow it, because this is the biggest waste of 45 dollars that I have ever spent.FOOLS!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS NOT CORDLESS","review":"The reviews looked great, and I almost bought this...until one of the pictures showed a cord. Amazon, you're showing this item under the title \\"Cordless Hand-Held Vacuums,\\" but it's NOT cordless. It may be a great little vacuum, BUT IT'S NOT CORDLESS. The is the second time in the last few days that I've found this type of mistake on Amazon. Now I know that I can't take any thing on Amazon for granted.

I was shocked at how much crud this got up that my other vacuums missed. It is perfect for stairs and super easy to empty and clean. The little crevice tool is super handy and gets the job done. And! It totally picks up pet hair...and all those little feathers that get everywhere if you have a down comforter and down pillows.Eureka should really give me a free filter or something for this glowing review...because truly, I love this vacuum. And I never thought I'd EVER say that about a vacuum...especially a hand vac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Darn Heavy!!!! Not worth it.","review":"I bought this because of the rave reviews but my dirt devil works just as well on my stair cases. This is just too heavy.

My hand and wrist was tired after using it and I don't think I'll use it often because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"It cleans well, but it takes a lot of strength to operate it.

I have to say I was not expecting this kind of power from a machine! Great power not too loud and cleans very quickly, Couches, pack and play, dog bed, kitchen table. Pretty much anything I really don't want to wipe down never saw it coming with this little machine. It also had the extender for in between cushions, corners and the brushes for better pick up.

It's great for picking up the paper scraps, glitter, etc. that are a part of crafting. I find that it is quite powerful. The cord is long enough to do the entire carpeted area.

The suction on this vacuum is average at best. I have a cat and needed it to vacuum up around the litter box and I use pine litter so it is very light no reason for it not to do the job. I used it for stairs and again I have to swipe the stairs many times because the suction just isn't there. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for carpeted stairs","review":"I wanted a vacuum for the newly carpeted stairs of our basement. This was exactly what I was looking for. It is very easy to use. The cord is long enough that I don't need an extension cord to vacuum the stairs. Our basement has bare floors so we use a Swiffer to gather all the dirt and this vacuum is great for picking up the gathered dirt or any bigger pieces of debris. I have used this vacuum on the foam mats we have and it works well on them. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"We had a big vacuum and it sucked we had to use the tool to vacuum around and that sucked too.

It is just terrific to clean stairs, tight spots around the home and perfect for the car.Recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for stairs","review":"We just had laminate flooring installed and needed a way to quickly vacuum the stairs. This is the answer. It is light and maneuverable and has strong suction. The power cord is farly long, enough we can do an entire flight of stairs.The only cons to this vac is it only comes with one tool (a crevice tool), but there is limited storage on the vac anyway.One word of caution, do not use this to vacuum dry wall dust, even a little bit, it will clog the filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little vacuum","review":"Bought this for the wife to use on our carpeted stairs.

This has no filter so it is low maintance. Its an excellent machine and well built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpet, Tile, Hardwood & Microfiber plus Two Dogs!","review":"This is the perfect vacuum for dealing with dog hair on all four. I use Amazon frequently and although I am almost always happy with my purchase this is the first time I felt compelled to leave feedback"},{"rating":"2","title":"It SUCKS (in a good way)","review":"I got this for the purpose of cleaning stairs....I was happy to see how much power was abvailable. The rotating blade considerably improves the availability of sucking in dirt when compared to dust busters. Anyway, I enjoy how it has a rotating shield so it does stair raisers. The attachment for the hose covientently tucks it away and the cord storage is easy too. So far so good with it. I would buy it again. Oh..and I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars b/c the hose attachment does not have a bristle attachment to prevent me from scuffing the baseboard when I run it along it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Power!","review":"Great Vacuum. Has a lot of suction power. May be a little on the heavier side but manageable. Really like the flip front for the brush. The collection bin is a little small, but u should empty it all the time anyway. It has really been a great product. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cleaning out my truck","review":"Basically it is all or nothing, meaning if I want to use it I must unroll more cord than I care to roll back up. I wish it had a self retracting cord or a better way to store the cord. If it werent for this cord issue it would get 5 stars. This is a great little product. It works much better than any little dustbuster and the brush head really helps to pick up stuff. My cat hair on the couch and stairs dont stand a chance. The hose and tool are convenient. My only complaint is the storage of the cord is poorly engineered and easily slips off the unit when you are trying to store it and there is no way to unroll just what you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My Gosh!","review":"Wow! This thing REALLY works! I could not believe what nastiness this thing picked up immediately AFTER I vacuumed with my Dirt Devil Vacuum! There was so much dust/dirt that the Eureka picked up that I got on my hands and knees and \\"hand-vacuumed\\" my entire room! It was amazing! I am so impressed with this tiny guy that I'm buying one for my mom! This is great for the couch and dusty furniture!And I love how it plugs in and doesn't \\"charge\\" on batteries. All of those rechargable vacuums use their power by one year. I love the long cord and the power this baby has! I love love love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans like a champ!","review":"I just recieved my hand vac today and was ready to take it to task. I have a stairway with a high pile carpet . I also have two dirty dogs that love to hangout on it .This vac did an amazing job getting the hair and dust from the carpet. It is easy to use,lightweight, strong suction, and sells at an amazing price! I am so thankful for everyone's reviews , it really lives up to it's fine reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"mine was a waste after a couple months","review":"I don't know if it is because we have a dog, but this little eureka was a real waste after a couple months. The filter was hard to clean and it just stopped having any suction power. I loved the idea of having a little vac for the kids to use, and me too, for the stairs, so it would be a little more fun...but I ended up throwing this out. It was great in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent: small yet powerful!","review":"This vacum is great for stairs and furniture. It has good suction power and directiional bar lets you choose option for suction to come from front or bottom which allows easy vacuming of the front portion of stairs or backs/sides of chairs. Cord is long enough so you don't have to keep changing electrical outlets. You just have to make sure the cord is tightly wound when winding it so that it doesn't fall off the back of the machine when storing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerfull cleaner during its relatively short live","review":"Used it only to clean the stairway. Maybe 10 minutes once a week. Then the little belt that drives the rotating brushes came off. I opened it up and put it back on. (Very hard to get to and put back together again) It came off again twice after that and now it is in vacuum heaven.If you want something that works very well for a very short time, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I thought I was a good housekeeper until I used the Eureka 71AV. I can't believe all the dirt I got from just one chair. Even my husband was amazed. Today the chair, tomorrow the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great.....until the brush motor burns out","review":"The first time we bought this vacuum it lasted less than two years before the front motor that turns the brush burned out and quit running. I searched for replacement motors since it seemed such a waste to throw it out when it was simply a burned out motor that I could replace, but I couldn't find anything. To me this seems like Eureka considers it a disposable appliance so if it develops a problem it gets thrown away, not repaired. Since it did such a good job at picking up cat hair, we bought a second one thinking the first was a fluke. Now only 14 months later, same thing - the motor for the brush burned out again.Looking at other reviews, this motor burning out is not a rare thing. I think Eureka is a Chinese word for \\"junk that lasts a year...maybe a bit longer.\\" Time to shop for a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka EUK71AV Handheld Vacuum","review":"I am a professional purchaser for a nationally recognized R & D institution.I reaserched hand held vacuums utilizing exactly the same methods I employ on thousands of work related products.I specifically looked for a light weight,powerful,quiet,multi functionalhand vacuum. I previously utilized a Dust Devil unit that weighed considerabley more,constantly screeched until you were deaf, and couldn't do the verticle portion of stairs.The Eureaka EUK71A alleviated all those problems.The only side effect was when I vacuumed some carpeted stairs and discovered to my chagrin, how much dirt and debris that was really hidden in the carpet.Except for the unknown longevity of the internal filter, I give it a big thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This vacuum sucks up soo much stuff - simply amazing. I liked it so much I have convinced 2 other people to buy it and have convinced others that their vacuums simply aren't up to snuff.Pros-excellent suction-long cord allows for easy reach for everything that I do-hose is nice for getting along window sills, etc.-a little heavy, but not bad in my opinionCons-cord wrap up could be better, not a huge deal in my opinion for the price-hose could be a bit longer-crevice tool falls out of the storage spot with the slightest bumpAll in all highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on for a great ride","review":"This vacuum is great, it has a lot of power so hang on. Very neat at getting into those areas that the larger vacs can't reach. The attachment is very handy, dirty creases look out, your time is up. Easy to clean, I use a real cheap 1\\" dry paint brush to clean filter. I have tried the Dirt Devil, not even close. Someone said the motor is noisy, if it bothers you try a nice quiet broom."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this little vacuum","review":"love love love this vacuum. great for the stairs, my car, the motorhome and does great job. i little heavy but most of the time you are not holding its weight anyway and I think it needs to be in order to do the great job it is doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it!","review":"This is a great product and a FANTASTIC price! It is very powerful and comes with a long cord! Arrived FAST and has strong suction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Hand-held Vacuum Rocks","review":"I used it to clean my car carpet and trunk. it is powerful and it does a good job of vacuum dirt and grass. The noise level is lower than my previous one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this powerful vacuum","review":"I have had this vacuume for three months and I LOVE it. It is very powerful, does not get clogged easily, and the cord is long. My regular vacuume has been broken and we are on a tight budget and haven't bought a new one yet. I have been vacuuming my whole house (4 bedrooms) with this hand vac on my hands and knees, and it is still going strong. It is great for cleaning cat hair off couches, cleaning crumbs out of the baby's highchair, flies out of windowsills etc. When emptying the canister I do use an old small paintbrush to brush off the filter after I bang it off. I am guessing that will prolong its life. My only suggestion would be a retractable cord.UPDATEI have now had this vacuum for almost a year and am still using it for my whole house. Yes, I know, its crazy, but I really love this thing. I have also used it for the van and all the time to clean up near the wood stove. Suction is still great and I am still on the original filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Great Performance","review":"I know this has lots of good reviews but I still wanted to add my own. I was looking for a vac to do high pile carpeted stairs. This thing is AWESOME! I did all 14 of my steps in about 4 minutes. It even sucked up lint that was stuck to the carpet. My old handheld dirt devil would take me 15 minutes going over and over the same spot to get everything. This little vac picked it all up in one pass. It worked so well I decided to try it on the couch....then the hair covered dog bed. It worked great. I spent about 15 minutes playing with and looking for more things to vacuume because this cause it impressed me so much.I like how you can shut off the brush roll too for hard floors. I was looking at the new dirtdevils before I bought this and understand that a \\"turbo brush roll\\" is useless. This has a separate electric motor for the brush roll. I can't say enough good things about this little vac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest working little vacuum","review":"This product absolutely exceeded our expectations. Our home has 18 foot ceilings with high plant ledges. Since both me and my husband are disabled, climbing up a ladder to dust the ledges and any cobwebs causes concerns for our safety. With this hand vac all anxiety is blown out the windows. It is very light weight with maximum suction power. The only complaint is the vacuum hose could be a tad longer. You will not be disappointed in this product and the price really seals the deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized and difficult to use","review":"Due to the organization of this book it is extremely hard to locate any particular diecast unless you have the diecast number or item name or designation.

It is a simple, basic devotional which starts in Genesis and proceeds through the whole Bible. The Bible (blog) part of the reading is written by what I take was or is a Pastor mentor of the newsboys and is solid based. Pastor Laffoon makes you think about characters in the scriptures with an application you may never have considered prior. One of The individual band members at that time-Peter, Phil, Duncan, Jeff contribute a short commentary at each reading's completion which really show you their hearts for God and can be touching and convicting. They take turns doing this and each is in the commentary on a rotation basis of 3 three months, taking one month at a time.

Working up to just months before his recent death, he again demonstrates why he was a musical genius. There isn't a bad track on this album, but I have some favorites. Ray and Elton John singing \\"Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word\\" is just magic. And, there were tears in my eyes when I heard Ray & Willie Nelson sing \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\".

The CD is worth having for those three songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very sad end.","review":"Ray Charles was fabulous. This album is not.I would not recommend this album. Ray Charles was a consummate performer and musician, whether it be jazz, pop, or traditional standards. However, this album is very weak.The duets style approach is interesting on face value (it sort of worked for Frank Sinatra several years earlier), but the performances do not carry any energy. Ray sounds very weak during most of the album and it is quite sad to hear such a powerhouse in his final months.You are much better off buying \\"His Ultimate Collection\\" or his classic 1950's recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius Loves Money","review":"This is the worst thrown together compilation of artists I've ever heard.

I don't think that I've ever liked jazz so much before, seriously. Ray's genious really shows in this album as he plays some really good songs, none of them my favorite Ray Charles material, but still, really good stuff.

Not groundbreaking but very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, Ray","review":"It's Ray-Ray, which would be enough, but the folks he hooks up with are heavenly.

Fabuloso"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Soul","review":"I was really disappointed with this album. Overproduction caused the soul to bleed from each and every track, leaving the listener with something inoffensive and bland. It's as if the musicians were given some Xanax and a script to read from. I'm going back to the old Ray Charles albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Ray, Really Sorry","review":"I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray. This was terrible. Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous. I'm sorry Ray, I love you. It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"i love ray, but this is pretty bad","review":"this could have been an excellent album, considering the talent involved. instead it's an album with no energy whatsoever, and shmaltzy tunes galore. of course it won a ton of grammy's, but we all know the grammys are a joke anyway. very sad to see this as his swan song, when most of his material was filled with soulful energy, and fierce originality. this plays as though it was put together by a muzac executive, with no feeling for the music whatsoever. very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUMMMMMMMMMMMM ALL ABOUT THE FUSSSSSSSSSSSS","review":"It's all about the fuss, cos it's no doubt Mr. Charles was blessed with talent. But he has better records and this was benefit by the GRAMMY's and MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Last Effort","review":"The upbeat anticipation I experienced prior to hearing this album was sharply contrasted with the reality of the production. Although I resisted the feeling, it was nevertheless a tired and frail Ray who was occasionally spliced into the songs of various other artists and their bands. A few of the tunes were listenable, but this is not the energized, bright and beautiful Ray Charles who cut through the music scene with his own sound. Don't buy it, I'll send you mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Ray Charles at His Best","review":"For nearly 60 years, Ray Charles was, and still is, even after his death, an icon in popular music. He has experimented with, influenced, and been influenced by most every genre of music from rock & roll to country and from Jazz to reggae.\\"Genius Loves Company\\" shows Charles in a series of duets with many of music's fine contemporary artists like Willie Nelson, Van Morrison, James Taylor, blus master B.B. King, and the rising Norah Jones.Charles revisits several of his old classics and many of his fellow artists' hits such as \\"Sweet Potato Pie,\\" \\"Crazy Love,\\" \\"Heaven Help Us All,\\" \\"Hey Girl,\\" and \\"Sinner's Prayer\\". Each song is a classic varying in style and creativity. \\"Genious Loves Company\\" is Ray Charles' finest work, his final gift to his adoring fans. This is an essential for any Ray Charles fan, young and old. The album is a milestone in R&B; and all-around music history. Any listener won't be disappointed. I guarentee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius is the right word!","review":"Ray Charles gives us more reasons to hear why he's The Master in wondrous duets with Norah Jones, James Taylor and Van Morrison. His rendition, with Elton John, of \\"Sorry Seems to be The Hardest Word\\" is one of the best tracks. A must-have for ANY music lover....thanks for taking us along for a wonderful ride, Ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius loves company... and so do I.","review":"I love, love, love - this album.It shipped quickly even though I didn't select any fancy shipping methods, and I felt like it was Christmas when I opened it.No scratches, skipping or wear.Ray Charles makes me simmer.Would totally buy this again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this history making awesome CD!","review":"This CD is easily one of my favorites.

I found myself flinching whenever he entered the duets. Sad choice to end a career like this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I received this CD as a Christmas gift. With the single exception of the duet with Bonnie Raitt, this was a total disapointment to me. Do yourself and Brother Ray a favor. Get a CD of his earlier works. This simply does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This music I can't listen to","review":"This man is really genius!Unfortunately, I can't listen to his masterpieces without headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ray Charles unfortunate Last CD","review":"I have had a hard time listening to this CD. I love Ray Charles but this CD is a poor attempt at a final goodbye. Whoever mastered of the original tapes, should have their hearing checked. I found off pitch singing and questionable tempos on most of the tracks. Most of this should have been fixed in the studio.However, some of the tracks are great especially Ray and Bonnie Raitt on \\"Do I ever cross your mind\\" and with Gladys Knight on \\"Heaven Help us All\\". As a whole, this CD reminds me of the Sinatra Duets. That album also had many of the same problems.I will purchase other Ray Charles CD's but, God Bless Ray, I will not purchase this CD for my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragic, final release","review":"And what POOR company he surrounded himself with here. I gave this a listen and it is dreck from start to finish. It is the most boring, asinine, watered-down, flavorless album I've heard since Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\". What a shame; the people he duets with are washed-up has-beens (except Willie). What was Ray thinking? Was this album messed with by the sharks / suits at his record label? Was outside \\"help\\" brought in long after Ray's contributions to \\"tweak\\"? This is a HORRIBLE record. I cannot recommend anyone buying this unless you want to fatten the coffers of its record company or if you're a masochist. The Grammys further evade anything resembling credibility by giving THIS \\"Album of the Year\\"! This is music at its worst. Throw this in the garbage, because that's where it belongs. This is a travesty and an injustice to the musical legacy of Ray Charles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little full of himself don't you think?","review":"Wow! Ray Charles calls himself a \\"Genius\\" on his new album? Um...show me the papers that say it. Your IQ is above genius level?I worked hard to be called a genius. I had to compete in the Genius Olympics held every year in Boca Raton, Florida. I won gold in 6 events and set the world record in the \\"How high can you count?\\".This album is ok, but Genius? Come on Raymond! I've never trusted people with 2 first names anyway...this just goes to prove my point even more. I say skip this album and get that Twista CD with Ray Charles on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius Got Gone","review":"Genius Loves Company has Ray Charles sounding as if someone had a fistful of his liver, which wasn't far from the case when these songs were recorded. Terminally ill with degenerative liver disease, Ray was in no condition to record an album. Sadly, the people around him and several of his musical cronies advised him differently.It is impossible to reconcile the Ray Charles on Genius Loves Company with Ray Charles in his prime. The songs on this disc are a sad sendoff to one of America's few true musical geniuses. In most cases the material here sounds as if it was cut and pasted together - Ray doing duets with another artist's voice tracks. The result is insipid to the point of tragedy.If you love Ray Charles or you think that you may, do yourself a favor and pop for Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, at least on that album and many, many others, the genius still lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst!","review":"I have been an avid fan of Ray's for over 45 years and this is my least favorite album. Some of the duets are unlistenable. I archived 4 tracks to a mix CD and tossed this thing somewhere -- I don't know where or care."},{"rating":"2","title":"When It's Good, It's Really Good. But When It's Bad...","review":"3.5 Stars. This album was kinda disappointing, but packed with some really good stuff. The best song on the album is the B.B. King duet \\"Sinner's Prayer\\", although I also like \\"Fever\\", \\"Heaven Help Us All\\", \\"Crazy Love\\", \\"Sweet Potatoe Pie\\" and \\"Here We Go Again\\".On the other hand \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\" is a very dull song. The orchestra is, to say the least, overblown and unnessacary. \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\\" is a really boring country song. \\"Over the Rainbow\\" is a poor take, despite Ray's emotion near the end.Also, I feel that Ray's career should've been delved into deeper. Classics such as \\"Hit the Road Jack\\", \\"What'd I Say\\", \\"Busted\\" and \\"Let's Go Get Stoned\\" (my four favorite Ray Charles songs) are completely ignored.But I'd still buy it if \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" was the only good song. Buy it for the six aforementioned songs, or just download them."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much background!","review":"This CD had all the potential in the world when you look at the talent involved. What it amounted to was a hyper-engineered and overly orchestrated collection of songs. What a waste. I wanted to strip away the strings and hear the vocals. All except for 'It Was a Very Good Year', with Willie Nelson. That track should be removed completely - strings, vocals and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Ray","review":"I have never written a review on any musician or music that I have bought in 50 years. Ray Charles was the first little 45's that I owned and from the first note I was hooked. He gave us so much and took so little. I am going back through my music library and listening all over again and must admit shedding some tears for what we are going to miss. God speed Brother Ray and give heaven an earful. Genius Loves Company needs to be a part of every music lovers library as it is a gift from Ray Charles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very deserving of accolades","review":"This is a great ADULT album and it deserves the Grammy. Sympathy vote or not, this is a fine goodbye from one of the very best in music. The arrangements and the production are as good as it gets and the vocal performances are first rate. I read reviews saying that Ray's voice sounded weak but I don't agree. He still hit the high notes as well as anybody and his playfulness and emotions ring through. The only shame is that you have to wait until the last cut to hear his great duet with Van Morrisson. The younger generation may not have much appreciation for this kind of music but I'm glad that those who understand the artistry involved in this kind of endeavor voted with their hearts and ears and put it on the pedestal it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"heavenly choir\\" is so much fuller now!","review":"Like the last studio album by the late Johnny Cash, Ray Charles's \\"swan song\\" is a fitting conclusion to a career that spanned almost five decades. The twelve-set collaboration with those that are legends in their own right is a splendid blend of familiar songs, slightly altered to suit both Charles and his partner. Music fans will find something to savor among this eclectic bunch.\\"Critics\\" of this album fail to realize that the singer was ill at the time of these recordings; thus, he may not have been \\"up to par\\" vocally, but the trademark soul of this major musical talent could not be abated.His partners were keeping good \\"company\\" when they signed on to accompany Charles, praising him on the disc's liner notes.Legends of his caliber don't deserve less than five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Changed Me","review":"This CD is absolutely phoenomenal. I didn't realize how much of a Ray Charles fan I was until I saw the movie and heard so many songs I already knew. Getting the CD was a must. Mr. Charles certainly opened my eyes to a whole new genre. Don't wait. Buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd only like this...","review":"If you like record:You have terrible taste in music.This record would've been good if there was a duet with sum 41 or Ludacris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did this win a grammy?","review":"There is nothing new or innovative about this record. The only reason it won a grammy was because he died. I don't hate Ray Charles or his music but it pisses me off that becuase some old guy died all the new music gets looked over to honor him."},{"rating":"1","title":"This things earned 8 grammies?","review":"What a joke. They shoulda awarded those grammies to talented musical genuses like 50 cent and Jessica Simpson. Ray Charles was a great singer, no doubt but compare him to 50 cent? dont even go there. Buy The Massacre instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm sorry this is the last of this master's legacy. Much of it is schmaltzy stuff. Seems like it was conceived to cash in on the commercial appeal of these duets than for the artistry of it. Get \\"Ray Charles and Betty Carter/Dedicated to You\\" instead, an enduring classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very old Ray whistling through his dentures as he sung.","review":"I am a big Ray Charles fan but this disc is terrible. Ray doesnt sound like himself, just a bad old voice trying to get the magic back, unsuccessfully. He was off key and failed to reach the higher octaves. The mixing of the music and solos is also quite poor. I listened to the first song and started searching FF for a better song,it wasn't on this disc. So sad but true. Monster Music did Ray an injustice by making this disc. They should have used tapes from his younger superstar recordings and overlayed them on this disc. Jamie Fox would have sounded better. I was so looking forward to this superdisc but stuff happens. Don't buy it or you'll be sorry. P.S. Johnny Mathis did sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best music ever...","review":"I purchased this CD just after the movie \\"Ray\\" hit the theaters, and I was not disappointed. For the music lover, this satisfies. Ray Charles was influential to so many artists, in so many genres. Again, I am not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sad waste of talent and what a sad final tribute.","review":"The proper final album for the great Ray would have been one that recognized the sadness of his fading light.This album did his talent enormous injustice by undermining what his music was all about.As the other reviewers noted, this album was overproduced in the extreme--to the point of distraction and disservice to Ray's music.Perhaps the most egregious misundersanding of Ray's talent and music was the Willie Nelson duet, It Was A Very Good Year. A soft, quiet, low key duet with Willie and Ray would have been perfect. But the producer, John Burk, went over the top, ruining all the potential with a Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. type of production. This was a disgrace, evidencing a fundamental misunderstanding by the producer of the song, the artists and the music.I could go on and on. The album is an abomination, spoiled not by the artists but by the idiots who conceptualized it. Shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Genius","review":"I am glad that I had a unique opportunity to see such a great legend in concert during my graduate days in New Haven, CT a year or so before he passed. Thanks Ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love genius loves company","review":"Incredibly easy to listen to. The best variety. Listen to it before you read the artists. What a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still great work","review":"The genius of Ray Charles comes across in this recording, as he is able to pull-off pairings with one of the more eclectic groups of musicians to ever share a CD cover. He hits all his genres, from brassy big band ditties to soulful, stripped down lyrical odes, in a CD that will at different times have people tapping their toes and drying their eyes.That this is his last original release should not be forgotten. With many songs recorded in the last days of his life, Ray Charles's failing health is painfully apparent in many of these tracks (most especially the duet with Willie Nelson).A testament to Charles is that each reviewer on this site seems to have different favorites. I prefer his work with Diana Krall, Bonnie Raitt and the incomparable Norah Jones, but that's just one man's opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master","review":"Ray Charles is the master and this is his masterwork. This cd is really a masterpiece and there's nothing else to say. The song with Norah Jones is amazing.Rest In Peace Ray Charles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love. love, love this","review":"I have been searching for a good arrangement of A Sinner's Prayer for several years. This selection featured two of my all time favorite artists-Ray Charles and B.B. King. Absolutely, wonderful. The rest of the album is great. I like the musical selections and the combined talents of Ray Charles and the other artists who share the tunes with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Don't Even Have Souls","review":"What is wrong with our education system? We don't have souls we have brains and if I have to hear the Kooks talk about something that doesn't exist ad infinitum I am going to get sick. The songs aren't even catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"They will conquer the world","review":"The Kooks is the best new band to come out of England since the Who. Aggressive power-pop blended with an incredible sense of musical timing and those ballads mixed in showcase more talent than I've heard in years.The opening acoustic \\"want to go to the seaside\\" and then a power leadin to \\"do you want to see the world?\\" The Kooks write incredible songs, plain and simple. While they might not have the post-punk sensibility of their peers like Arctic Monkey and Maximo Park, etc. They make up for it in universal power-pop appeal not unlike the Who did in their early days. Oh la is classic and there just isn't a weak track to be found. When the quirky bands have passed their attraction, the Kooks will be writing their equivalent \\"Who's Next.\\"On my top five list this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"ok debut . some nice britpoppy songs mingled in with some dreadful reggae influenced dirges. if you like this cd you'll love CAST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good cd.","review":"After I listened to it a few times, I loved it.

I bought the album with the hope that the rest of the album would exube the similar quality.I was dead wrong. The rest of the album was patchy at best. The tunes were almost monotonous and arrangement/sound engineering was amateurish . And the lead singer's accent, which sounded cute in \\"Oola\\" and \\"she moves in her own way\\", sounded almost pretentious. It sounded like he was desperate to make the boring songs sound interesting but failed miserably.Bottomline: Go to itunes and buy those two songs and save 11 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic British Band (well all british bands are good)","review":"This debut from the brighton-based quartet shows what the band are capable of, both in musical and songwriting ability, and all at the beginning of what is sure to be a long and successful career. The album boasts an array of excellent songs of which my favourites are Ooh La, She Moves In Her Own Way, Naive and You Don't Love Me, however the whole album is superb and is a much better debut than that offered by the arctic monkeys. I picked this album for about ?5 but having heard It I would have paid four times as much. The only question that remains is will they make it big in the US, answer: Who cares! there massive in Britain and that's all that really matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Top class tunes, cant wait for there next album.If you love indie, its one to add to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rarest of Ace recordings","review":"Just last week (3-7-07)I played these recordings for Mac Rebenack.

No one else has read it. That's because it's almost unreadable. The type is very small. The author cannot have omitted a single scrap of his copious research. His selection skills need honing. People with only remote connections to EG, and many with no connection at all, are discussed in tedious detail.This book is definitely not for the common reader.

They all want to own him in some way, which simply doesn't make sense as there is nothing interesting about him whatsoever. He just blunders on, into greater and more improbable situations, none of which I found funny in the slightest. It is like reading a novel by Eugene Ionescu, without the humor and surrealism.In other words, I just didn't get it and don't think it is worth the effort.

Italian MTV had this video on heavy rotation, yet I couldn't hear this song enough. I kept the TV on mute all day until I saw the video appear. The song is catchy and elegantly simple, its lyrics make use of Jamaican patois, and it makes your body bob and weave. The singer reminds me of Roland Gift (of Fine Young Cannibals), andthe song is one of those crossover oddities. I ordered the CD single, and have played it for friends whose tastes range widely. Everyone loves the song. To tell you my tastes would be no help-- they're all over the place.

I found this book to be very similar to that of the newer book \\"The Messengers\\" where Jesus' life is also chronicled. It makes you feel as though you have experienced Jesus's life firsthand, and that's a unique perspective.The last few chapters of the book discusses other lives experienced with her spirit guides; I found this portion to be less interesting.

This was a basic how to play craps, for a novice. Very disappointed. Very small book, only recommend for anyone that does not know the game or has never played the game. No strategy in here for the experienced player. I am very displeased with this book for those reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor engineering","review":"I purchased a new one in April. It is now November. The fan motor that sucks the smoke out shuts off after 30 minutes and you are left with a smoke filled room if you are grilling more than 30 minutes (with guests). After 2 different service companies sent by Jenn aire, and 6 new motors, the problem persists. The problem is the motors draw twice as much amperage than they are spec'd. Finally found that out after having them bench tested, which is something the \\"brains\\" engineers at Jenn aire never did. These Chinese imported motors are not to spec, and the Jenn aire product engineers \\"don't care\\" as I was told by customer service. They refuse to return my money, or replace it, here I sit six months later still unable to grill steaks for my extended family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Accurate","review":"This was a gift for my boss who was always telling people they were late according to his watch. So this watch I gave him is as accurate as possible using the radio signal to set time. Many fewer people are late now and even better his watch and mine are set by the same radio signal. Always right on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right book at the right time...","review":"I stumbled upon this book weeks after losing my feline companion of over twelve years. As much as I appreciated the openness and the excellent writing style of this author, the book was simply the right book at the right time for me. Part of my dealing with the loss of my beloved cat has been writing fictional stories of the bond between humans and cats, and this book was a marvelous, therapeutic read for me. I've never written to an author before, but I plan to write Mr. Jordan and thank him for this gift of love and loss he shares in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming","review":"As an animal lover this was a very heartwarming book of a relationship between Man and his Pet. Althou Mr. Jordan referred to Darwin (the Cat) as more of a partner, and treated Darwin as such. Mr. Jordan articulates the growing relationship with his cat quite well and sucks the reader right into the relationship as well. You feel his pleasure, love and pain; and also get great insight in the battle of his logical brain versus his heart and emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I felt like I was reading a textbook rather than a heart-warming kitty story. It was boring and I had to skip those parts where Jordan analyzed and spoke as a \\"biologist\\" which sounded sarcastic to me. I couldn't stand Jordan's arrogance, which in fact explained how ignorant he was about cats and about being a cat owner. I was particularly frustrated and disgusted when he kept putting Darwin outside at night despite his cry, when his neighbor threw a shoe at Darwin (really, it's not funny at all), and when he kept spraying water at Hoover (he felt terribly afterwards but it was too late.) I guess the point of this book is to show how Jordan changed because of Darwin. I do get the point. However, his mistreatment of cats, stubbornness, stinginess, and scientific way of thinking were awfully irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cat Named Darwin","review":"This was a good book, a little drawn out sometimes, but otherwise a very good read.

It was still good, but not as funny as I remembered. The second season was much funnier and by the third season they were clicking constantly.The cast had really grown into their characters by this time, and nailed it time after time. The writing was outstanding, and every one of these shows was funny.The only negative thing I have to say is that if you're looking for extras these sets will disappoint you. The only extra in this one was a 9 minute featurette, which was just Bob talking about the show. It was interesting to hear, but there wasn't much of it.I can't wait to see season four!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Newhart never grows old!","review":"I have always been a Newhart fan.

Being born and bred in Chicago, though, there was a great mystery here...In the opening sequence, we see Bob leaving his downtown Chicago office. We then see him repeatedly going back and forth across the north branch of the Chicago River. Which leads any reviewer to speculate on the causes for this:1. Did he find Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) too hard to take, and was debating whether to go home or not?2. Did Bob have undiagnosed ADHD?3. Was he looking for the Billy Goat Tavern?The audio commentaries on the DVD, while great, leave these questions unanswered. What we do get here, though, is great TV: no innuendos, no racial humor, nothing but straight, funny writing and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Newhart - 3rd season","review":"the series arrived in a timely manner.

As Tricia moves through school, students call her dumb. She sadly begins to except their teasing and begins to believe she truly is dumb; until, Fifth Grade when she is blessed with an outstanding teacher, Mr. Falker. Every classroom should not only have this book, it should be read aloud.

Trisha loved to read books and draw ever since she was a little girl. When she was young, her grangfather read to her and when she started goin to school, her grandfather past away. In first grade, Trisha had a lot of trouble learning how to read. She still had trouble reading in 2nd grade and then one day, a she had a new teacher that believed in Trisha and his name was Mr.Falkfer. Thanks to Mr.Falker, Trisha finally learned how to read and write. I really liked this book because Trisha always thought that she too stupid to learn how to write and read but Mr.Falker proved her wrong. I liked the way Mr.Falker was confident that Trisha would learn no matter what. This is why I liked this book and I am sure other kids and students would enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Mr. Falker","review":"My Reading teacher read this book to the class, and I thought it was very touching.

That reviewer obviously has never tried on someone else's moccasins for a walk. As a school librarian and mother of 3 boys with learning disabilities, one of the hardest messages to get across the way LD kids feel. This book and this author eloquently describe the fear and anxiety of a child who desperately wants to read but needs more help and support than she's been given, until Mr. Falker comes to her aid.Polacco's verbal imagery,--of her grandparents \\"letting go of the grass\\", for example, and the illustrative imagery make this more than an ordinary story of overcoming the odds.I have already shared this book with Language Arts teachers and SpEd teachers in my school and all plan to incorporate the story into the curriculum."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read to all students in any grade","review":"this book was read in a class i'm taking, yes teachers. all of us loved it. a few tears were shead. we all have had a child just like that, or was a child like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dare you to read the whole thing without crying...","review":"....I sure can't, and I've already read it about 10 times.

I have seen the faces of the children who feel \\"dumb\\" and I think that Polacco captures this dismay in the illustrations of her book. I have read this book to reading teachers and education graduate students and I believe that it conveys a message to all teachers about their value in the lives of young children.

The moving narrative of the author's journey through the minefields of reading is both touching and thought provoking. If only there were easy answers to helping a child learn to read. In addition, the question of bullying is addressed. There are no easy answers for that, either. My third graders are \\"off track\\" for the month of December, but when we are together again in January I intend to read and discuss this book intensively. There is no doubt in my mind that children struggling with reading and/or being teased will identify with little Patricia immediately. THANK YOU, MR. FALKER would be a wonderful gift for any learning disabled child to build self-esteem and let him/her know many children have gone through the same stress and anxiety.

I hope he is still alive and can bask in the knowledge that he did, indeed, make a difference in a child's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Mr. Falker","review":"The illustrations are beautifully rendered, and the story is touching.

Gloria Estefan's voice is soft and laid back, pretty, and best suited for easy listening classics, like the ones sung by Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Vikki Carr and Eydie Gorme. Although she's Cuban, her singing isn't well-suited for Cuban music. Sorry Gloria, you'd sound better singing something smoother, calmer, where the listener isn't expecting a fiery, deeply passionate performance. Fire, that's it, that's what's missing in her voice.Cuban music = fire, passion.

Yes, it's sung in Spanish - and Ms. Estafan's family came from Cuba - but where's the meat? Which Cuban CD sounds anything like this stuff?Having been a pop singer for many years, Gloria suddenly discovered her Cuban family roots and her parents anti-Castro-ism. I guess it would be too cynical to say if you buy into the American dream, leave your homeland and become an American then there's a musical price to pay....and this rather tepid CD is a testament to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloria lost me here!","review":"I borrowed a copy of this cd from a friend -- and as a HUGE Gloria fan, this one was quite boring. It's no Abriendo Puertas, and the album's title song is far from impressive (I got the single, and I just can't learn to like it!)I don't mean to put down Gloria (she's beautiful!) but out of EVERY CD I own from Gloria, this was a bit disapponting.

This new discovery is now added to my collection of best loved \\"foreign\\" music (I'm an English- educated Chinese living on a tiny little island somewhere).I find some of the songs here most hauntingly and achingly beautiful, especially those about love. The voice, the rhythm, the percussion, orchestration - everything is lush, smooth, intoxicating', moving etc. Gloria Estefan's songs are as beautiful as she is!I guess music is more universal than we realise and touches people everywhere as we share the same human feelings.

Aside from one major design flaw they work great, and the cat is no longer lying/sitting next to the heater.The design flaw is the spaces between the plastic \\"spokes\\" that kitty can fit his paws in. He's no longer lying in front of it all the time, but still occasionally squats in front of it and claws at the bottom of the unit. So for my purpose, they are flawed, as the cat can still get to the heater.Since these are useful, I won't be returning them. Instead I'm going to buy the solid mats so that the cat can't maneuver around the nubbed areas.

The cats either walked in the spaces of the mats, (why are there spaces?) or endured pain to get back into their corners.I realize that training doesn't happen overnight, but the mats are based on the notion that the \\"fingers\\" will cause discomfort, and thus discourage a negative behavior.Did not happen in my household,, to my regret.

The nightlight basically lights up the entire blue water tank, and it's actually quite attractive if you're not after serious darkness. The light is under the water tank, so you'll see it each time you refill it with water. I simply removed the two small screws on the light bulb's plastic cover, gave the inside of the small cover a couple of quick squirts with black spray paint, let it dry an hour or so, and replaced the cover and screws.

I have used it on doors, and in build cabinets. It has never let me down. I would recommend it. It is a great hand router. I say hand router because it is not designed for a table router.

This was a bad move on their part...Anyway, this show wont do more than 2 seasons and I have a great record of calling the failure of tv shows, see my arrested development review, so unfortunately this show just isn't funny.

That was when it began to show some real potential and begin to shine on its own, regardless of what was going on in \\"Family Guy\\".\\"American Dad!\\" contains some of the sharpest political satire this side of Steven Colbert and John Stewart. Like Colbert is mocks the state of affairs in the nation today with an \\"everything is rosy!\\" attitude, and that's something I always enjoy. It also helps that this show can go even more over-the-top than \\"Family Guy\\" can.Really there's not too much more I can say about this show.

One stood out and cannot remember who said it (Richard Foster?) - instead of escaping the world our purpose in getting alone with God is to listen to Him and be energized to go back out into the world and show His love to others by serving them.A great challenge and encouragement.

And the pulling off of the insulation always seems to pull out some strands of wire too. On solid wire (Romex) you don't have this problem, because the wire is all one conductor, fat and solid.

As a pregnant lady, you get so much \\"advice\\" from everyone that is total nonsense. Broder backs up his advice with research, evidence, and facts.

I wound up tossing \\"What to Expect\\" across the room when I got to the section that suggested I buy organic food. Of course, there is no evidence to back up such a ridiculous, expensive, and guilt-inducing suggestion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful information, but sadly lacking...","review":"I thought this book did a pretty good job of separating fact from fiction when it comes to pregnancy concerns. However, I felt that many of the views expressed were a bit cavalier. I also felt that I was being talked \\"down to\\" many times, or made to feel foolish for my pregnancy-related fears. The overall tone of the book (as might be expected from the title) is that basically all pregnancies end happily, so just don't worry. Sadly, I know first hand that this is not always true, and I fear this book may foster a false sense of security for many expectant parents. My first pregnancy ended in a stillbirth at 39 weeks, so I am all too aware that tragedies can and do happen. Overall, I think this book might be helpful to someone who is in a first pregnancy, and blissfully ignorant of what COULD happen, but if you are one who has been touched by a real tragedy, this book will be of very little comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is safe according to this doctor.

I understand where he is trying to go with this book. He is trying to say women should basically not worry so much, but anything goes according to him, except smoking and doing cocaine. I almost feel more panicked knowing there are doctors out there like this. I've read so many more books that discount what he says and has the sources to back up what they say. His explanation to everything, \\"there is no study to back up that doing this or that is unsafe\\". He is just an M.D. not an OB-GYN. Most OB-GYN's disagree with him and I think they have the upper hand since they specialize in women and pregnancies.

However, as someone who has tried to get pregnant for 9 months and suffered a recent miscarriage, I find this book to be insulting. It is also filled with all sorts of misinformation and incorrect facts. The author is using outdated medical information and a lot of \\"People used to do it before they knew better so its okay\\" logic.

Physicians were the only ones who were scarce with information; they were only slightly more willing to answer questions then a large animal vet would discuss pregnancy with a heifer.

I know that I'm not supposed to drink alcohol, eat sushi, etc, but I want to know what the no kidding statistical data say about these things. This book gives you historical data, stats and percentages so that you can make informed decisions for yourself. I still don't do all of the (potentially) risky things that the book says are probably okay, but it's nice to have the peace of mind when I realize halfway through dinner that the waitress brought me a med rare steak instead of med well or that I accidentally drank some egg nog that was spiked instead of regular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information well-presented, needs update and more","review":"I found this book more informative and less condescending than other pregnancy guides. Rather than simply give a conclusion or recommendation, it will give a fairly detailed reason so that the reader can weigh her own choices and analyze conflicting advice better. When good information or epidemiological studies are missing, it says so.I do wish the book would be updated (if it has, I haven't found the updated version, and this isn't it). There may be more information now than we had in 2004.

I dropped out of school in 9th grade and later got a G.E.D. It was my discovery of Wilson's The Outsider that inspiried me to go to college and study english and philosophy. That Wilson is amazingly erudite goes without saying. After reading the Outsider, I went on to read almost all of the authors he mentions, and was fairly well read by the time I entered college.

A thorough history of this amazing airplane and those who flew it through a collection of great first-hand fighter pilot's stories. Some are told from the author's own experience and many more from other Crusader pilots interviewed by the author. For example: John Glenn's record-breaking flight in his own words, along with many accounts of Vietnam MiG encounters. I loved this book and plan on reading much more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a reference book for the modeller!","review":"While I would agree that this book turned out to be an engaging read, it was far from what I expected. As an aircraft modeller, I was looking for a book along the lines of Don Logan's excellent books, also published by Schiffer, which are filled with color photographs of aircraft from many different units as well as excellent information on technical data, such as weapon loadouts. Not so with this book. Yes, there are color and B/W photographs, but there are many portions of the book where it is nothing but page upon page of text.In summary, a great history book, but not a good reference for the modeller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orientalism at its worst","review":"The author apparently believes that Turks should wear fezez (and Swedes viking hats, and Americans fur caps etc) in order to satisfy his taste for the picturesque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fez Review","review":"As an avid reader of travel lit, I looked forward to passing a plane flight \\"by traveling to Turkey w/ Mr. Seal.\\" Whatta an impossible read! Maybe it is the translation, if there was a translation? Sentences are so run-on, sometimes longer than six lines -- and they often weave between past and present. It's hard for the reader to hold the original thread of what Sales is trying to say. I stopped mid-way through, disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuccesful","review":"The author of this book has concentrated on his own prejudices and expectations as well as on the realities of Turkey -- which are presented here as colored by those very prejudices.

I looked for the fez, and got very similar responses! This book is best read by someone who's been there, or has at least more than a passing interest in Turkiye. Trust me, you will fall in love with the country and it's people all over again. Jeremy writes with warmth and humor. A joy to read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warrior Pistachio","review":"In this book Mr. Seal carries on the time-honored tradition of British travel writing by depicting the natives as primitive but hospitable and sometimes friendly monkeys. We read on the back cover of the book that Mr. Seal is fluent in Turkish. This is surprising, given his translation of the name of the city of Gaziantep as \\"Warrior Pistachio\\" (see the map on the first few pages). I guess his confusion, if there is any, arises from the type of pistachio sold in markets as \\"Pistachio from Antep\\". Also, the name of the city of Menemen is translated as \\"Omelet\\", but this is as if one translates the name of the city of Vienna as \\"Schnitzel\\". I would be interested in reading Mr. Seal's deep analysis of origin of names of perhaps, Liverpool and Arsenal. All I can say is, Mr. Seal, please first grow up and then write another travel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eccentric, funny, well-informed Turkish travelogue","review":"This is a very well-crafted travelogue about Turkey by a writer/journalist who has taken the time to learn Turkish as well as the history and culture of the places through which he is traveling. He turns a mean metaphor too.It is however very puzzling that he chose to tour the country in winter, including the frozen highland parts of the country in the east, which makes for hard traveling and unlovely cityscapes. Combine the wintry weather with his quixotic quest to find the origins of the fez (the funny-looking Ottoman headgear), and you have a downright eccentric kind of travel book. Despite that, read this book and you'll learn a lot about Turkey, and laugh out loud quite a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I picked this book up at my local library in preparation for my first trip to Turkey.

This is just another book that is quick to offer scathing and exagerated reprobation veiled in cheap British humor by highlighting individuals' quirks. It is also outdated -- a better choice, watch \\"Keeping up Appearances\\" on PBS. Brits are much more tolerable when they are making fun of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old orientalist","review":"Being a native of Turkey, I found Seal's book not only carrying strong Orientalist motives, but also uninformed or misinformed in many occasions. The book being built on the 'Fez' theme sounds interesting first, but it is not meant to be simply a travel book and attempts to analyze complicated cultural and historical issues of the Turkish society. Unfortunately, the writer lacks the academic (or seems to lack any strong background for that matter) to be able to draw educated conclusions. I often felt that the writer had a views in mind and was trying confirm them with his observations in that direction. His characters were extremely uncommon and seemed deliberately selected, if not fabricated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sociology","review":"This is poor sociology.

When I finished reading this book, I felt that the author's main objective was to make fun of Turkish people. The book is full of manipulated historical references and mistranslations. Either J.

From the streets of Istanbul to the border of Syria to the Black Sea, Mr. Seal accidentally (on purpose) gives a compelling account of the social changes in Turkey from the Ottoman Empire to the present while describing his search for the origin of the Fez hat. This would be a great book to read during downtime in Turkey, but probably better before or after - you need to relax during downtime while you're there."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing...","review":"I found this book to be boring. I kept hoping for it to get more interesting, have more color, more humor, more detail, but it just didn't happen for me. I have travelled to India and parts of Africa, but not Turkey. Maybe if I'd been to Turkey, I would have appreciated the book more. I read almost three quarters of it, and then just put it down.

The tires were a perfect match to the OEM tires that were on the bike before. I was a little thrown off by the picture of the tires, as them show them flat (deflated) and they did not look like the tires on my bike. However, after they were installed and pumped up, they were nice and round like the existing tires they were replacing. I would recommend these tires to anyone needing a 22x10x10 replacement. The first time out with them this weekend, it rained a lot, and they never missed a beat nor did I slide or skid.

I got home and saw the hat and it was way cooler than the picture, which shows it lighter in color than it actually is, it is more of a rusty brown, which is perfect as the one thing I wasn't super stoaked about was the light, almost shiny look in the picture. i was also a little concerned about only being one size, but this thing fits me perfectly, just an all around awesome hat that was delivered insanely fast by USPS.

Everything from flattering remarks to simple comments on how good I look with it on. My only complaint is the material is starting to break loose already but to be honest that has nothing to do with the manufacturer of the hat, it's just the materials its made with.

The writing is right, I am not sure how else to explain it. The characters live their lives in smaller English towns and villages, they do this or that yet it is all there. Barbara Pym captures her people in their lives and their thoughts and writes with wit, respect and affection for them. It seems quite a few of her books have recently been re-issued.

The only problem I have with the gauge is that every 5 or 6 readings it will not turn off. Because this has an automatic turn off feature, it is a real problem. The only way to turn it off is to open the guage and remove the batteries. I sent it back to the factory explaining that it works most of the time, but fails after 5 to 10 uses. They sent it back claiming they could not replicate the problem. I don't think they tried very hard, because the same thing is still happening.The product works well enough that I normally would not hesitate to replace it, but with such poor customer service, I will just continue using it as is rather than taking a chance of getting another lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"The gauge was delivered promptly.

It's truly amazing.The outlines and footnotes are one of the monumental works of the 20th century.

I have used 1/2\\",3/4\\" & 1\\" pins with this nailer, all have worked well with no issues. The pins are set with very little to no marring. A light sanding and it pretty much disappears.

I'm liking it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for constant use","review":"I bought this about a year ago and use it about once a week for pinning returns. Yesterday it stopped firing. When I disassembled it, I found that the slide that sets the pin size was bent where it came off the track. I was able to bang it back into place, but I think it will fail again. I like the size and shape of it. And before it broke, it worked like a charm. I wish it was better made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"Major disappointment. First it wouldn't set the 3/4\\" pins below the surface of the 1/4\\" maple scribe that I was attaching to 3/4 ply using 120 psi. No adjustment to set the depth deeper. In softer woods it would set the pin, but leave a big dimple from the un-padded shoe. After about 30 pins it quit working. The piston would not return to its upper position. Cleaned and lubed and it still wouldn't work. I'm shipping it back and am ordering the Senco. P.C. is catering to the hobbiest now days, not to the professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter-cable my choice","review":"This is the first Porter-cable I've owned and I love it!

As for the rest of the show, you know he is at the left part of the stage, and that's it. The paycheck must be really good.The show itself is much worse than the CURSH DVD from 2000.

When the space is tight, and I don't have the room to swing a hammer (much less fit a framing nailer), this tool is a lifesaver. I'd definitely put it near the top of my list of favorite tools to own. It's relatively inexpensive, easy to use, built very well, and comes with a bunch of attachment which I'll probably never need, but somebody else might.

I am notoriously bad at driving nails by hand, and this tool has prevented untold amounts of bent nails, bruised thumbs, and sore wrists. I don't know how I ever got along without one. My only complaint: I'm not crazy about the screw-in collar that secures the nailing head to the tool body. As shipped, the collar was screwed in so tightly that while trying to remove it, I damaged one of the included wrenches. Once it finally came off, I had no further problems. However, I'm always worrying that I'll overtighten it again, or that I won't tighten it enough, causing it to vibrate loose during use. Porter-Cable should reconsider the design of the collar mechanism; otherwise, great tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful nailer","review":"This nailer does a nice job.

Maybe Spike Lee can put it on the silver screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanzz Fails Again","review":"Mr. Evanzz's first book on the Nation of Islam, 'The Judas Factor,' was a miserable failure and it appears that Mr. Evanzz is trying again. By what I read, I can see that Mr. Evanzz was either misguided or took it upon himself to fabricate much of his material or at worst, made a decision to just outright lie. If Evanzz's source of information was from the FBI's Freedom of Information files, he would have done well to publish copies of the files with their file numbers, so that those who know the facts can not only level their attack against Mr. Evanzz, but also the the FBI-a government organization that spent an enormous amount of money, resources and time during those years trying to destroy the Nation of Islam. If this book of fiction were a movie, I would suggest saving the money and waiting for the television premier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Misleading","review":"That is all the author did was take declassified FBI records and wrote a book.

Regardless of your feelings about either Muhammad or the NOI, he's worth a well-written, honest, balanced biography, but this isn't it. That book is \\"An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad\\" by Claude Andrew Clegg III--well-written, well-researched, intelligent, honest and balanced. First-rate, unlike \\"The Messenger.\\" Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, insightful bio","review":"Karl Evanzz wrote a fascinating account of how power corrupts in \\"The Messenger: The Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad.\\" Evanzz supported his biography of the man responsible for the enormous growth of the Nation of Islam with almost 200 pages of documentation. However, he clearly lost all objectivity toward the second half of the book. Yet, I found this true story to be a compelling one worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of fiction","review":"This book spins a tale based on fabrications and slander. I cannot recommend this book based on the fact that the commentary used is biased and unsubstantiated, unlike other biographies, where the principal is interviewed, Elijah Muhammad NEVER gets a chance to speak in this \\"biography\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterness and hatred of the worst kind","review":"Recent and future events will expose this work of pitiful self-hatred for what it is. The very people who wrote and support this book are the most in need of healing their sick, self-righteous hearts with the knowledge of self and others. A reviewer wrote, \\"The book explains in depth why the NOI ... was doomed to be limited to criminals, outcasts, and other folk on the fringes of society.\\" Well, Elijah Muhammad's mission was to ressurrect the fallen of society. What would the author and his supporters prefer, rounding up our misguided brothers and sisters and sending them to concentration camps? The program of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad will well outlive those who seek to sully his name, yet live in the safe, secure environments that were a result of his work. The Pharisees asked Jesus, \`Why sit ye with publicans and sinners?' He responded, \`It is the sick who need a doctor.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Truth on human nature","review":"I have seen some of the files on Wallace Ford(a.k.a. Fard Muhammad, founder of the NOI) and Elijah Muhammad, plus, I used to listen to Elijah's Sunday afternoon sermons on the radio as a kid and read \\"Muhammad Speaks' the local barbershop.Much of what Evanzz writes is raw truth, not only about the NOI, but of the dark side of human nature. Not only has racism created a condition where an Elijah Muhammad can galvanize the undereducated ghetto masses, but it points out the failure of black intellectuals to get out of their ivory towers and teach the masses the truth and of Black fathers to come back and do right by our families so our youth would not be so lacking in father figures as to depend on charlatans. This is also true of humanity in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unclear perspective of a great reformer","review":"One chapter in this book, named, \\"Macbeth\\", seemed most disheartening to me. The Shakespearean play tinges the idea of \\"Fair-seeming is bad, bad is fair-seeming.\\" With this in mind, a stage is set illustrating appearances that can be deceiving. While this chapter in \\"The Messenger\\" is constructed to mock Elijah Muhammad, it reflects back on those in most need of reform and right-thinking who seem always to be blinded by their \\"superior intellect.\\" The best rebuttal against this entire book is the success of Elijah Muhammad's assignment, including the atonement and reuniting of his family today. If the author's book was indeed \\"truth\\" i.e. an actual biography, and not fiction, the events of the day would lend credence to his work...

Cats have millions of expressions but you are not going to forget this one, and those inside the book. Living with Ernie for 2 years, Mendoza grasped the essence of this special cat with his talent in photography. All the photos are black & white, together with the thoughts of the photographer and Ernie's himself. I am impressed by the photo on page 77 - Ernie was jumping to catch the left hand of Mendoza (while he took the photo with the other hand). It gives me the thought of \\"When you target on something, go for it!\\". I admire the brave of cats. When you have read through the book, you would probably like me - become a fan of Ernie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cat Book Ever","review":"This book is in the waiting room at my vet's office.

All of us cat lovers (fanatics, if you prefer) know our animals well enough that Yes, We Do Know what they are thinking at times. The author perfectly captures the cat/human relationship with words and pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi Ernie, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance...","review":"I encountered Ernie while visiting the Tate Modern bookstore here in London over the weekend, and was instantly won over by his crazy, self-possessed ways. The genius of Mendoza's work lies in his ability to faithfully capture the personality of his feline subject, with the same amount of detail and devotion one would expect to see in photographs of people. As a filmmaker and photography enthusiast, I have accumulated a library of photography books by those renowned in their field, and Mendoza's masterful memoir deserves its place amongst them. Sure, he is not a Pulitzer Prize winning war photographer, the subject is light-hearted but it is also sincere, which is the most you can ask of an artist. Ernie is a fine example of what photography and portraiture should be: an engaging and revealing insight into its subject, one that compels the viewer to revisit the photographs again and again, delighting and inspiring with each subsequent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Cats?

What bothered me the most were the chapters inserted here and there that were Ackroyd's fictional accounts of Dickens meeting his characters or other writers who did not live in his time. I found them corny and unbearable. I have never seen anything like this in other biographies, and I think that's a good thing.

Speaking of gouging, a new magazine is about [$], one third of the cost of a new nail gun!

There are some flaws, like for example Chomsky really criticizes the Marshall Plan as being American centered and doesn't give credit to what has really revitalized Europe and Japan, regardless of the intents starting out or some of the authoritarian beginnings.This book really put it all together for me. The thing with Chomsky is that all of his information is documented, and he shaped his theories on what is actually recorded. An example of this is that if you tell most people that George Bush Sr is connected with the Bin Laden family, they may call you crazy.

Besides putting pressure on the spokes, it is too low to hold the weight of a mountain bike, the support arms can hit the derailleur and throw it out of alignment, and the movable side (adjustable for tire width) usually moves over a couple of notches when you take the bike out. Furthermore, as they are made of plastic, they are very light and the footprint is not wide enough to keep the entire unit from tipping over with your bike. Also if you set it tight enough to hold the wheel straight it doesn't release when you try to pull the bike out and you have to push it off with your foot. I own a Saris version of this stand and have had nothing but trouble with it. My bike has fallen a number of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand Bike","review":"It is made of plastic, a little bit wobble and there's no hole to put bolts when connecting the vertical bars to horizontal bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, a perfect stand","review":"Look no longer, fellow riders. From the most unexpected place, Husky Bicycles, comes a great stand. Check it out at [...]. Quality materials, low price of only $15 and a perfect solution to keeping bikes securely upright without stressing the spokes! I had to peel an unattractive sticker and it made it perfect. Recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice for all size bikes","review":"Product received was not as advertised. This bike stand is only good for bikes with 20\\" wheels or larger and doesn't state in description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"Actually this stand would have been great if the seller hadn't left out the screws to put this together. Very disappointed. My first triathlon on Sunday and now I have to search for screws to assemble a product that should have come with it. Not happy at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"this really shouldn't be purchased. yea its cheap and it appears it might work, but really it doesn't. the bike wants to fall over and it leans against the spokes. spend $40 and get a good metal rack that holds the whole back tire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damages the spokes","review":"I read the reviews, especially the ones about pressure on spokes and decided to buy anyway. I reasoned that if the bike is kept upright the pressure on the spokes would be minimal and thus safe to ignore.Once I assembled the stand and put my bike in, it became clear that this is not the case at all. First, the bike *always* leans on one side or the other, there's no way to balance it. Second, accidentally bumping into the bike causes it to bounce back and forth - this does real damage to the spokes. Bad buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"I purchased this bike floor stand to park my mountain bike in my garage. The product description mentioned that the stand is made of plastic; which I was fine with, until I saw the actual stand. This stand WILL break eventually--it simply is not rugged enough for the use I had envisioned. If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a more durable metal stand. The other complaint that I have with this product is that the metal screws did NOT ship with threaded bolts--I had to purchase after market bolts from Home Depot (9 cents each, no big deal) in order to make this stand work. In retrospect I should have returned this product--it simply won't live up to repeated use. I got what I paid for--a cheap plastic bike stand. Recommended for light use. But for more active bicyclists, this will not survive the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic and unasembled","review":"Doesnt really work well. Bike falls over still. Pain to assemble. Maybe it would work for smaller bicycle. Spend the extra bucks and get a good stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsturdy","review":"I have a 29er mountain bike and I can barely get the tire into the stand and the stand will not support my bike. It's plastic and very unsturdy. It might work well with a light weight road bike but its useless for a mountain bike.I'll end up giving it to someone else who might be able to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after first tries with it","review":"Only use for the smallest of kids bikes, not for a full size person mountain bike its not sturdy enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand 8 years and still doing it's job.","review":"I have used one for 8 years and no problem. Never failed once with my 1700 dollar bike. 2005 to 2012 and still working : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"Too light weight to properly hold a bike in place, and the maker did not include the screws. I would not recommend buying this product. It is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought a new tire because of too many broken spokes","review":"The design is fundamentally flawed. The stand puts pressure on the tire spokes. Consequently, the tire spokes will break more often than usual.I visited the bike repair shop 3 times while using this. A total of 9 spokes were broken over 2 months.1 spoke broke. Got it replaced.2 spokes broke. Got them replaced.6 spokes broke. Had to buy a new tire because the tire frame bent too much by this time.All spoke breaks occurred on the back tire where the \\"Gear Up Grand Stand\\" held my bike.Don't buy this. I put mine in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bike spoke risk","review":"Initially I thought the wheel base was going to take the weight of the bike. Now that I have a chance to you the stand in person, I can see how the majority of the bike's weight is supported by the wheel's spokes and not the wheel's rim. For those with pricey wheel's, it's a concern. Especially when using the stand for repairs and cleaning when there's a lot of stress and motion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, basic, American-made product","review":"I bought an identical one several years ago. It is definitely a well thought out design. I needed one for a second bike and found it here. Same price that I paid last time. It's great because it's portable and I can take it anywhere. Highly recommended for the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SURPRIZE","review":"midsomer murders series is really enjoyable t.v. i always thought anything on bbc was dull and boring.this series prove me wrong ,it keeps you guessing to last minute.i will be getting other show.i've become addict."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],C={key:0},j={key:1};function O(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(x,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-43a4c007"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/23.md","filePath":"quotes/23.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/23.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
