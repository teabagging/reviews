First, it is super slow, but I was willing to put up with that, but now it just started leaking all over the place. I would like it replaced with something better. I'll pay the difference if need be, but this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too small","review":"This makes about a 1/2 a cup of coffee and without a warming plate you have to drink it immediately because it gets cold quickly. All of my other mugs were too big to fit in this thing. Waste of money as I had to buy a better/bigger coffee machine within a week of trying to get this thing to work.Save yourself the headache and some cash and get a machine that is slightly bigger with a warming plate/heated cup holder too!Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again.","review":"Yes, it's relatively cheap, but you get what you pay for. It's very black inside - my elderly dad had a hard seeing clearly enough the inside workings of the top part where you put the water and coffee in. Also, it has a little arm thingy that dispenses the hot water that you have to move out of the way to put the grounds in, and then, yhou have to remember to swing it back into place before you shut the top and turn it on, or it will not make coffee. You come back to get your nice hot cup, and duh! you forgot to swing the arm back. Drove my old dad crazy. Also, didn't make very hot coffee at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I bought this little coffee maker because I typically only drink one cup of coffee in the morning. It makes the perfect cup of coffee and holds several mugs of different sizes. Two little cons: 1) it's best to pour the water into the coffee maker with a measuring cup because the opening is not very large and you may spill some water. 2) It does not keep the coffee hot so either drink it right away or pop it in the microwave for a few seconds.Other than that-excellent purchase for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm disappointed in this little machine: it drips so slowly that the coffee is cold.I have a similar Black and Decker one-cup machine that makes excellent (strong and hot) coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!!!!","review":"Bought this as a gift, didn't work from the start. In process of sending it back.The only reason 1 gave it 1 star was because I had to to rate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"We bought this to take on a trip as it was small and would provide that nice wake up cup in the morning. Well...it did --- one time. After the first cup it completely stopped working. I had to toss it and get another brand -- which worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splish, Splash!","review":"Yes, it does splash, whether you use the supplied mug or your own. I've found that removing the hard rubber grommet in the hole where the liquid passes through to the mug lessens the splashing somewhat. And raising the mug also helps.I was looking for a replacement for my Black & Decker Cup-at-a-Time. The Toastess feels cheap in comparison, and the coffee is not as good nor as hot. And it's s-l-o-w.Well, I spoke too soon. Removing the grommet works okay, as long as you position the mug as far back as it can go. Otherwise, some of the coffee misses the mug. I'll go back to my Krups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for work","review":"This Toastess coffeemaker fits my needs at work perfectly. It's tiny and bare-bones basic, but that's what I wanted, something cheap to keep at my desk and I don't have to share the office coffee pot. It comes with an 8 ounce mug, a 12 oz. mug fits underneath as well (you ARE limited to brewing a 10.5 ounce cup however). The coffee comes out at the perfect temperature, hot, but not hot enough to scald the roof of your mouth. I also use mine for instant soups and oatmeal.Two complaints. It's slow - I didn't time it but just guessing 3 to 4 minutes to get a cup of coffee. Also it tends to slide around when you're trying to switch it on/off, it needs some rubber feet.NOTE: Don't forget to remove the coffee scoop when you unbox it; I almost didn't notice it inside the water reservoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cup o joe EVER","review":"I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased this machine from Amazon. However, all I am left with is a bad taste in my mouth. And I mean that literally! I don't even taste the coffee- I taste what I can only presume is burnt metal and electronics. I was used to a Black and Decker single cup coffee maker that worked diligently and very well for over 18 years! This one I have owned for about 2 months and it has simply performed very poorly. Don't waste your money on this very inferior product. If you are foolish enough to do so, watch out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee, but!","review":"I used this coffee maker exactly 4 times and on the 5th day it quit working!!! It turned ON but it would not heat up no matter how long it was on. I tossed it in the trash and went to Target to buy a new coffee maker. These are inexpensive for a reason!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow coffee maker","review":"I have been using 1 cup coffee makers for many years and this is the slowest one I have ever used. I purchased it because my current one is very old. I will use this one for backup only. It takes at least double the time to brew one cup of coffee. My 4 cup pot is faster, I do not recommend this because of it is slow and does not have automatic turn off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing Product!!","review":"I'm sorry that I didn't look closer at the details of this product before ordering it. I'll list the problems I found with it:1) It takes a lot longer than it should to make a single cup2) It doesn't have an auto shut-off feature when completed3) The arm that pours the hot water over the grounds does not automatically mover to the proper location when you close the cover. poor design!!!There are much better ones online than this one for a similar price. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Thing Wrong","review":"There is only one thing really wrong with this coffee maker and that is that it is MESSY! The water reservoir is too small to successfully pour a cup of water into with out spilling it all over the counter, and once you are finished mopping that up and actually turn it on, it splatters coffee all over the counter. The fact that you have to remember to turn it off doesn't bother me, but cleaning a quarter cup of water off the counter DOES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap","review":"Coffee maker is very cheap, plastic is thin and very light in weight. Tips over easy when trying to remove the mug because of the plastic ridged disc it sits on. You can't leave it alone as you have to turn the power off when its done or it goes crazy making all this sizzling noise, kinda seems like a fire and safety hazard to me. I've had a few different cup at a time coffee makers and never came across one that was as horrible as this one. Go with Black & Decker! Oh and I forgot to add, its SUPER SLOW!!!! Water trickles out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good personal coffee maker from Amazon","review":"This is my first review, and I always read reviews before making a decision to purchase as I find themso very helpful. I really like the Toastess personal coffee maker. The only reason I give it only 4 starsis because it drips slower than previous others I have used, but then, being retired,I have time to wait.I do wish however, that it would have had an automatic shutoff as my others had, as I am a little forgetful,but all in all, it does a good job reasonably priced and came quickly. Thank you Amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical coffee maker","review":"For me this is a great little item. It takes no time in the mornings to get it going. It does splatter a bit, but that's not a problem to wipe up. And cleaning is a cinch. Thanks Toastess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked as intended","review":"The product arrived on time and has already been used for coffee and water for hot tea, which stood up well to the caffeine-addicted future mother-in-law test. The only minor issue with this coffee maker was that it does drip slightly after turned off, however, it is very slight. All liquid is caught by the cup holder, and does not spill onto the counter in any way. The price was great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I have two of these. One in our home and one in our summer home. We use them constantly. Great for just one cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. I think you save on coffee, also. When I make a pot of coffee, I usally end up throwing some away. With the one-cup, you only use enough coffee for one cup. Just a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water not hot enough for proper brewing","review":"Unfortunately this coffeemaker does not make the water hot enough to brew a proper cup of coffee. I was dissapointed, but thankful that this thing was not expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opt For The Black And Decker Brew N Go","review":"When my old single server died of old age, I searched and found this Toastee and a Black and Decker both of which seemed to fulfill my requirements. As each was only about $15, I decided to get the two of them and let the better man win. Both lost points for not having a see-thru indicator to show the water level at 1 cup or 2 cups and I declared B&D the winner because the Toastee's brewing time is much longer. It also came with a piece of its plastic chipped off, but I'm sure that was a misfortune that can happen to any machine. As it didn't affect its working condition, I'm not taking that into consideration with the rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 2 weeks of use","review":"I ordered this item and within first two weeks of using it it broke - just stopped working altogether.

I received it as a gift, and I wish I had gotten Lonely Planet, Let's Go, or Rough Guide; even Frommer's would be better. If all Moon Handbooks are this poor, I have no idea how they stay in business. It is poorly written--it reads like a seventh grader wrote it. The language is flowery rather than informative, and when the writers try to include cultural or historical information, they base it on hearsay or simply get bored with writing and leave the reader wondering what the real story is (their section on Garifuna history, for example, ends in 1832--surely the Garifuna have done something in the last 171 years). Do yourself a favor and buy a different guidebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best advice, although a little out of date","review":"My husband and I just returned from a 16 day trip to Belize, and this was definitely our favorite guidebook on the trip! We bought this book as well as Fodor's Belize, and together they were the perfect combo. The Moon book was right-on for budget travelers who want to be more than a tourist--the authors' sense of humor & interest in getting to experience new cultures really made the book. We used the local buses for transportation and tried to stay in places under $50 US (which isn't hard in Belize!), and this book was right-on with recommendations and descriptions. The only negative was that it is getting a little more out of date in regard to lodging, restaurants, and prices, but that's why we bought the Fodor's book as well (Fodor's Belize 2007 edition). Overall, this book is 5 stars, and because of it, we had an awesome trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Award-Winning Guidebook","review":"It's fitting that this 6th edition of Moon Handbooks Belize has won the prestigious Lowell Thomas Award granted by the Society of American Travel Writers (SATW) in the Best Guidebook category.

Some of the suggestions are a little subjective to older middle-aged men, but if you can get the gist of what Frank is talking about, then the whole borgata is completely applicable.

The Knights Templar story is a fascinating one which has lead to some fevered speculations about their secrets, treasures, and religious icons, including the Holy Grail.

I love Nathaniel Parker as Lynley (I love him period). It doesn't bother me too much that the BBC's Simon appears more emotionally than physically disabled. I don't mind the fact that they have to play with the plot a little to fit it into a 2-hour program. But what I can't stand is that they changed the ending COMPLETELY! A hero becomes a villain.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would reccommend any person struggling with calvinistic issues should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately an Unbalanced View","review":"Dr. Geisler is, unsuprisingly, a very well known apologists, however, and 'apology' is what may be needed for this \\"unbalanced\\" view of the doctrine of election. Geisler should just come out and say he's Arminian instead of hiding behind the mask of \\"Moderate Calvininism.\\" He equivocates and misrepresents many of the most crucial issues regarding \\"extreme calvinism\\" (which is how he characterizes the view in this book). Geisler attempts to use certain Scripture to support his views, unfortuantely he seems to be grasping at almost any verse to try and get this \\"support.\\" I have read many of his books and find them very rewarding so it is with sad respect that I have to admit that this was not quite up to par with his other works. However, this book should stir up more contraversy over a much debated issue. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the doctrine of election, but with a warning that this is not a very well balanced assessment of election."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear thinking","review":"I'm thankful to Dr. Geisler for attempting to find the truth where the answer is not as simple as some like to pretend. He allows the scriptures to speak for themselves, though that doesn't give the clear cut answer that most people demand. This book is done with Christian charity as well as conviction; as opposed to James White's rebuttal, which is arrogant and condescending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rose by any other name...","review":"Four point Calvinism (yes, I know that's an oxymoron), better known as Amyraldianism, has been ably refuted over and over. Anytime any one makes a fuss about the five points, why is limited atonement always the target? Geisler's book doesn't break any new ground in this old debate. He makes the same tired arguments that fall, limp as yesterday's fish, to the dirt. For a man who wrote an introduction to informal fallacies, Geisler does a top-notch job of committing just about every one in this book: ad hominem, post hoc, equivocation, and on and on. If you can read this without your blood pressure going through the roof, you are a) not a Calvinist or b) not following Geisler's argument as closely as you should be. This is just another example of the inability of anyone to make a good case against limited atonement. Anyone want to tangle with John Owen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing and very incomplete","review":"Without question, the two most important texts in the debate over the Calvinism-Arminian controversy are Romans 8 and John 6. While Geisler holds to his 'foreknowledge' view that God foresaw faith in the future of those who would choose Him he fails to make hardly a complete page of comments on John 6. The fact is, John 6 does not support his view. This is a poor book and a book that fails to match the respect Geisler has deserved over the years. His argument against Calvinism and Arminianism leaves him in middle -- a gray area that is very confusing and not well presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I obtained this book as a counterpoint to Dr. James White's The Potter's Freedom. Unfortunately, White was fairly accurate in his representation of CBF. Although I can respect Dr. Geisler's attempt to reconcile the two viewpoints. I cannot believe some of the types of arguments, attacks, and misquotes of various Reformed Authors' both Modern and Classic. I agree with White considering the work on other subjects that Geisler done. This is probably not his work. I refuse to believe so unless proven otherwise.This issue is of the utmost importance. It creates these armtwisting and pressure methods that cause more damage than help to the cause of Christ. Mind you they are unbiblical. Geisler keeps pushing on Man's Freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for Geisler","review":"I think the outcome of this book is very simple; Geisler got in way over his head. I truly appreciate Geisler's work as an apologist, but he gave a very poor effort here. James White completely dismantled this in his book, The Potter's Freedom.Geisler makes some fair points, but I truly believe that he doesn't fully grasp the tenants of reformed theology and misappropriated many of them in this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion or Arminianism?","review":"Given Mr.Geisler's reputation as a scholar, I was stunned to find that he made the glaringly obvious (Intentional?) error of mistaking classic calvinism, for the increasingly common fault of attacking a straw-man called \\"Hyper-Calvinism\\". Since most new to the subject fail to understand the difference between biblical, full calvinism and the VERY few people who are so-called \\"Hyper-Calvinists\\". These few are either against the free offer of the gospel,(which is NOT \\"Hyper-Calvinism\\") or are either \\"Anti-Evangelistic\\", \\"Antinomian\\" or \\"legalistic\\",none of which is charecteristic of true calvinism. So,all in all, making such a basic error makes Geisler at least an unreliable guide to Predestination. Try Boettner's \\"Reformed Doctrine\\" or R.C Sproul's \\"Chosen by God\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Balanced View of Divine Election?\\"","review":"OK, I'm sort of stuck between a rock and a hard spot with this one. On one hand, I think that Dr. Geisler has misrepresented the average Calvinist. On the other hand, I think that his own system, i.e., moderate Calvinism, is right on. Too bad he didn't just write a book expounding his own position and leave out the attacks against the other camps . . . the attacks could have been a separate book. In short, however, I think Geisler's position represents far more Calvinists than do the extreme Calvinists. Often people who claim to be \\"Calvinists\\" are really moderate Calvinists, they just don't know it, but when they are presented the facts, they often identify more with moderate Calvinism."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent text","review":"I think many people expected Dr. Geisler to \\"parrot\\" what they already believed. When he didn't, they were upset. Geisler's book is an excellent text that shows various perspectives that Christians may have on these issues, and he clearly reveals his own position. This text is an important contribution to the overall discussion of Calvinism vs. Arminianism. Dr. Geisler is an able philosopher and theologian. Don't read this text looking to find your own position reflected so you can feel good about yourself. Read this book as student of the ongoing discussion of this issue, and learn from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Geisler","review":"This book is extremely disappointing. As an individual trained in both philosophy and theology I found this book to be poorly researched. \\"The Potter's Freedom,\\" is a much better book, although far from perfect--both authors could stand to study up on informal fallacies. Although I appreciate what Geisler is attempting to do with his work he is probably one of the least competent Christian philosophers writing. Individuals like Bill Craig, J.P. Moreland, Kevin Vanhoozer, Alvin Plantinga (who Geisler grossly misunderstands), C. Stephen Evans, etc. deserve to be given attention instead of wasting time with a sloppy wanna-be philosopher like Norman Geisler. By the way--I am not a Calvinist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose to read another book","review":"The Predestination folks and Free will folks have been in hot debate since the beginning of the the New Testament era, and it will rage on and on until the coming of our Lord. This book lacks any exegesis and was easily steamrolled by Dr. White's rebuttle. After reading this book I confess that I was irriated and a bit indignant that anyone would actually write a book like this and that anyone could actually read this book and take it seriously. It really is a deplorable book; weak in every way.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK WITHOUT READING JAMES R. WHITE'S REBUTTLE!!! This is not a good book if you take the Scriptures seriously. PLEASE, if you have any interest in what THE BIBLE SAYS read James R. White's \\"The Potter's Freedom\\". It is the best book on the market that carefully discusses WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS about the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthesis of Aristotle and Soteriology","review":"The author definitely mangled some scripture to fit his system and that turned me off. I found it goofy that he wholeheartedly supports the idea of God the Holy Spirit \\"actuating\\" in initiating salvation but rails against the idea of the Spirit \\"creating a desire\\" in initiating salvation. This book is further proof that we all live on Sixes Road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly misrepresents Calvinism","review":"I had read Geisler on apologetics and appreciated the work (even though I didn't agree with every point). But I could not appreciate this book at all because it completely misrepresents Calvinism and then attacks the misreprententation. If you want to argue for Armninianism, which is exactly what Geisler does (always claiming he isn't), then one should at least be honest about your opponent and about your position. A book on this subject should deal at length with Romans 9 directly as well.Get another book, this one will \\"win\\" the argument simply through misrepresenting everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prep of Your Ordination Council","review":"Our church has been struggling with this debate for many years. I've found most authors write with an agenda in mind and publishers seem to favor printing extreme views (perhaps it sells more books). Geisler's agenda seems to be balance and logic.As a pastor, this book has helped me prep for my ordination council and work through more critical areas of theology. I highly recommend it along with Norman Geisler's exhaustive volumes on systematic theology (vol 1-3)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chosen But Free","review":"I have had much respect for the apologetic work of Dr. Geisler. However, Chosen but Free is a careless mess of confusion. Sadly, I gave up on it half way through the appendices. James White's rebuttal, on the other hand, is cogent and refreshing to read after Geisler's depressing diatribe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokey Joe' Cafe","review":"I had seen Smokey Joe's Cafe before & I wanted a copy for my self.

I read the reviews and with most of them being positive, decided that I would be getting the most for my money with no leakage. Today I prepared a flan in a water bath and all of the carmelized sugar leaked from the pan into the water. I paid $26.46 for the 2 pans and am extremely disappointed with the results. Shipping cost to return anything back to Amazon is ridiculous, especially when the item ordered does not stand up to what is expected. Now I have 2 springform pans that leak and am afraid that even a cheesecake recipe will seep out from the bottom.I have been a longtime customer of Amazon and am extremely disappointed with my last 2 fulfilled orders."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Leak-Proof at all!","review":"I too, bought this pan because it was supposed to be leak-proof. Not be a mile. Mine isn't dented, but it doesn't seem to be perfectly round either and the first time I put it in a water bath, it filled with water. Maybe cheesecake batter won't leak out the sides and bottom (on the other hand, my graham-cracker crust goes all the way up the sides, so batter leakage has never been an issue for me) but you certainly cannot put this in a water bath!And since the bottom has such a large lip on it, it's not as easy to wrap foil around the bottom to keep water out than a regular \\"leaky\\" spring-form pan.This was not worth the money and I wouldn't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks","review":"I had high expectation based on reviews but it leaked like crazy upon the first use.

They shipped it with the very heavy dutch oven and didn't package it properly. Amazon quickly replaced it and the replacement plan was also misshapen, thought not nearly as bad. I tried to make it work, but it leaked. I returned it and Amazon is issuing a refund. So, not sure what is going on, but I wouldn't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaky","review":"For all intents and purposes, this springform pan does the job. However, after some usage , the non-stick coating on the inside begins to flake off. So, if you like non-stick chemicals in your cheesecake, by all means buy it. I prefer the Kaiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Bought this pan because the product dimensions stated it was 3 inches deep. (recipe I want to try states need springform pan at least 3 inches deep) The inside depth is closer to 2 1/2 inches because of the leak proof construction, so this is not going to work for me. Picture of product doesn't show this. Probably works great for cheese cake but I already had a good cheese cake pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Works exactly like it should. When pouring just plain water into my pan, only a small amount leaked out the bottom. However, this design features a rim around the edge that caught this small amount of water leaking. The additional pressure prevented any further leaking.I've made one cheesecake with this and not a single drop of batter leaked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked before use!","review":"I got 2 pans for Christmas. I decided to test them to see if they were truly leak-proof. I put water in both pans and sure enough, water leaked out onto the outer rim.

Definitely FALSE advertising on the leak-proof!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Get","review":"It is a gift for someone, so it has not been used yet, but I was very disappointed that I didn't get what was in the picture. I loved the navy and silver, thought it looked really nice.

Hopefully it will still work as well as it says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"If you like to bake, especially cheesecakes, you know how important a spring form pan is.

And he overloads a tad on his British sense of humor.If you like it thats great. But it was very dull and boring for me. No offense to all 14 or some 4 or 5 star reviews. But I do reccomend Only You Can Save Mankind ( Terry Pratchet). It it's a great book about a computer game with connections to aliens. I also reccomend any book by Cornelia Funke.

The final few minutes of Act II have to be heard to be believed. Rysanek's performance was beyond Total Theater. The audience response, the wild roaring, is testment to her achievement. Luckily, the engineers don't cut off the ovation. It just keeps going on and on. Time and time again, the artists return for bows, but then Rysanek gets called back for solo bows. You might think you have heard audience hysteria before, but you have to hear this. Then the end of Act III is also followed by the prolonged audience frenzy. The sound of a packed house roaring over and over and over is something we just don't hear anymore. In case I haven't made my point, the final minutes of Act II and the audience roar that follows is probably the greatest documentation we have of the effect Leonie Rysanek had on an audience live in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're called the triangle of death for a reason","review":"Can't believe they still sell these.

It takes you through Addy's life and the small child she has fallen in love with. I felt every emotion with this book. It would take turns I didn't expect and kept me wanting to turn the next page.

They come together and heal each other in unexpected ways. it is heartbreaking, yet I could not put it down. It was a hard act to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"May make you re-think your next judgment of a person...","review":"This novel is a page turner. I simply could not put it down, and read it all in one day. The story of an old lady with many stories to her life and a little girl with terrible stories of her own. You will want only the best for Addy and Sharla- and burn with the need for justice when the best doesn't always happen. Lori Lansens is a wonderful story teller, I found myself compelled to keep going to find out what would happen next, and sad when I awoke this morning to realize that I had already finished the book and the story was over. It is written in a rather spare style, which makes the events even more poignant. It is non-sentimental, and Addy Shadd is one of the best heroines I had recently read. Five stars is the least award I would give this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope Lori Lansens continues to write novels","review":"Though I have read the reviews on Amazon.com for years, this is the first time I have been so moved by a book that I had to write. One will be rooting for Addy all the way through, hoping that things will turn out well for her and Sharla. This is one of the best written books I have read in a long time and I read a lot of books!

This is her second time duping the public, guess what potential readers, she's not going to tell you a single thing you haven't heard on her show, in fact she's even more reluctant to give up information. She can try and deny it all she wants but it is painfully clear that she is afraid of Suge Knight (I can't blame her, but if she's not going to fess up then she should shut up) and she won't release any names involved in scandalous acts. And her photo spreads, sigh, why would she do that to herself? She looks a mess and it is pointless, we want to see pictures of her son and husband so we can have a good laugh, not ancient pictures of Big Lez and Queenpen, sheesh, who cares?There's no juice here, just dried pulp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhh....","review":"Was passed to me by a friend for beach reading...

Quite frankly, all of the material covered in the book has been covered on her show more or less. Additionally, many of the interviews are plagued with answers like \\"no comment\\" or Wendy will actually tell the reader that she will not publish certain parts of an interview.This is the second book that I have read of Wendy's and this is the second time that I was disappointed. It won't happen again as I will no longer waste my time! Wendy should stick to what she does very well and that is her radio show.

Walker gives insights into baseball players and personnel that I had not seen in other books (if that is possible considering the volume of baseball books out there). A non baseball fanatic might not find \\"Fantasyland\\" as interesting but there is certainly a human angle that most people will find appealing. It might even make a decent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true fantasy book.","review":"This entertaining tale of a fantasy become semi-reality hits many entertaining cords to be enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummmmmmmmm.","review":"This book kept me going for hours. Sam Walker writes so that a novice fantasy baseball player could understand the history and parameters of the game. He provided laughs along the way with his \\"front office\\" of \\"Nando\\" and \\"Sig\\". For vetran fantasy players, he gives you an inside look at how the most competitive fantasy basball league is played. He also introduces some new stratigies and some debates that fantasy players always face. Do you go with the numbers, or the physical talent? Or the Geeks vs. the Scouts. Anyway this is a book that anyone who plays fantasy or someone who is interested in fantasy should absolutely read. Maybe you'll gain some knowledge that I lacked before my draft (Dropping Chris Shelton for Conor Jackson. Shelton hit hi ninth HR today while I have already parted ways with Jackson)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The author takes the reader thru his project of attempting to put together the ultimate rotisserie team in a league based on the 2004 season where he is a rookie and most of the other players are the so called experts. He hires two employees to help him statistically evaluate the player pool. He even consults an astrologer. He visits teams and players thruout spring training and the actual season to gain further insight. Of course, such activities and that he has press access as a sports columnist for The Wall Street Journal separate him from most fantasy league participants. To quote the author \\"The problem with building a Rotisserie strategy around inside information is that it always comes with an expiration date. Minds change,injuries defy prognosis, and performance always trumps opinion.\\" By the way the authors team finished 8 in a 12 team league. To me, this was a fascinating read. Very enjoyable and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Stuff","review":"Whant some \\"Dirt\\" on some of the biggest names in the game? This is the book for you.

I definitely recommend this book to every fantasy sports geek, it is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insincere effort by the author","review":"First, I admit I am a fantasy baseball fanatic. As such, I looked forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed by this arrogant author's obvious style of embellishing the stories in the book. I suspect he used creative license to produce a successful book. He approached his subject like a writing assignment and not an adventure. I have more fantasy baseball knowledge in my little finger than he will ever have in his lifetime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOT = WASTE OF TIME","review":"The only reason people like this book is because they play fantasy sports and its the only (or close to only) popular book about fantasy sports. On its own, its quite boring and adds nothing at all to fantasy sports. C'mon, if this book were about horse racing, it would be a stinker. Stop stroking your own egos. Hopefully we will get something worth reading, but for now, I'll stick to the so-call experts' excerpts about their fantasy seasons. Try than and you will save many hours. But if you play fantasy sports, and you get a kick of knowing some guy drafted your guy and wrote that in a book, than this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this ball workout. I was hoping for a fast paced, high energy workout with some challenging and different moves. I don't feel like I got what I was looking for. The moves are nothing new (if you have done a ball workout before) and my heart rate barely moved.Also, my ball did not work well with this workout. The ball used by the instructor is REALLY large. Mine is the recommended size for my height, but didn't work well with many of the moves she does. Her ball came up to almost high thigh (when standing). (My ball comes up to about my mid thigh--and when I sit on it, my rear is about even with my knees.) This factor made it even harder to get a good workout.Positives: The scenary in the video is nice and the instructor is good. The production quality is better than most workout tapes. And I've given the tape to my mom, who is on a much lower fitness level."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so sure this one's a good idea.....","review":"I'm concerned that the posting exercises put too much pressure on your knees.

If the author had taken the time to tighten up the book and used only half as many words as he did, the resulting book would have been first rate useful.

Large margins, explaining the obvious, repetition, unnecessary quotes, all add up to a book that's only about 25% actual content. If this book was 75% shorter, I'd give it two, maybe three stars.

Some of the humor probably lessened the more sad aspect of the story - growing up fatherless - or worse - rejected by a father who was inaccessible and seemingly impossible to please. Yet R.

Men will easily relate to the misadventures of youth - and the difficulty and sense of separation from their own fathers that so many men experienced as teenagers...and learned to live with as adults.

That is what I wanted and why I purchased it. It is not 7 inches. It is 6 and 1/4 inches. May not seem like a big difference to some but it really mattered for me.

I was a little surprised to find it in print because it is the opposite of so many newer kids books. The story tells of a cat who learns to be good through effort. The illustrations are fairly rudimentary, although the drawings of cats are fairly good. It's a nice story with a good lesson, but it is not at all slick.

It's a great story for young readers with an important message to make things right. Some have commented that the illustrations are \\"crude\\". I think opposite.

So, now, they want to go back to the way things were, because the high drama of hunting for a man is preferable to realizing everything is a mess. This is not a fear of commitment. This is a problem with the socialization of women and girls to think they need a man to be complete. I was completely disappointed and annoyed with this book because she does not talk about commitment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I bought this book thinking it would help me better understand, and hopefully remedy, my fear of commitment. While it is cleverly disguised as a self-help book, in reality it is just a string of stories about the author's friends. The bulk of the book consists of the relationship histories and life stories of these women that the author knows: Paula, Annie, Sarah, Eva, Susannah, Maggie, Lila, Elizabeth, Isabel, Karen, Jane, Kate, Lydia, and Cynthia. I drudged through each woman's story, hoping that I could glean some kind of advice or explanation for my own commitment-phobic behavior. Unfortunately, I found no such luck. The author offers explanations for each woman's fear of commitment, but unless you have the exact same history as one of these women, these explanations are of little help to the reader.

I love everything Wolff writes, but this one has a special place in my heart because it speaks to the literary geek in me. It reads like a memoir and once I finished it, I wished it could have been me that wrote it. Wolff is a perfectly balanced writer and the \\"memories\\" he lays down on paper of his schooldays are absolutely captivating for those who cherish the importance of the written word.This is the perfect book for a quick and enjoyable experience without too much excess or filler. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Treat","review":"At the risk of making it sound dull (which it isn't), 'Old School' is a primer on the philosophy of literature. As with a good education, good literature doesn't just feed you information and stories, it helps you to think for and about yourself and who you are. Wolff's book is a rare treat. It posed questions about the lives and thoughts of great writers and of each of us as well. What makes a story 'great'? Was Robert Frost's writing more \`real' than Allen Ginsberg's? What makes a truer hero: Ayn Rand's Ubermench or Hemingway's wounded soul? And finally, what does any of this have to do with us and our lives?Wolff's answer is simple. Only when we strip away the masks and are honest with ourselves about whom we are can we be great, or for that matter happy or even comfortable with ourselves.\`Old School' is one of those rare opportunity to learn something while enjoying yourself. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're missing out on something great!","review":"Tobias Wolff is a master at writing about boarding school. A product of one himself, Old School is set in the milieu of a prep school in the 1960?s, where literature is an important part of school life. The book centers around a competition in which seniors submit pieces of fiction to win an audience with a famous author. The narrator is so taken up with this that he does not acknowledge anything around him. And so, finally, in an effort to win an audience with Ernest Hemmingway, he commits the worst of all scholastic sins- plagiarism.This slim volume chronicles plagiarism and integrity at many levels. It is sparse, and brings home its message clearly and succinctly. It deals with the theme of memory as well, and the ways in which character is formed. A must-read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This is an intellectual, entertaining, quick, and satisfying read!

What should I do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money.","review":"This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. It drags on like a rusty knife for far to many pages. The book could have been good, could have saved itself if it had ended on page 152 instead of page 195. The story after 152 is irrelevant, pointless, lacks continuity, and ultimately leaves the reader wondering why it was included. Instead of the sad story of the young writer, you end up with that plus a monologue in which the author attempts to build sympathy for himself, justify his existence, and generally prove that at 50 he amounted to something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing with style","review":"Tobias Wolff used his own experiences at the Hill School to write a tersely crafted story about a youth at boarding school who seeks to excel at literature and win the school prize to meet Ernest Hemingway. He uses the foil to compare the protagonist with the Dean, both falsely taking credit. Wolff skillfully compares the main character with a brilliant young woman at a neighboring Girls' school. In fact, the latter are both hiding their Jewish heritage and middle class backgrounds in an upper class dominant atmosphere. Even though 50 years have passed since the setting of this book, human nature with similar tragic flaws persist today as well as the tendency toward veiled prejudices and punishments in privileged schools and clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary forray into adulthood","review":"First and foremost, the story is interesting. That being said, what captured me was Wolff's style. There is a great range of sentence structure, making the experience pleasantly varied and enjoyable. There are sentences that you can bite into and sentences that seem to float by you in an elegant sort of way.If you enjoy reading novels for their structure and style, this is probably something you'll enjoy.I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because it didn't really take my head off or anything. It was excellent but not earth-shattering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof that meaningful fiction can be an enjoyable read","review":"Tobias Wolff considers the sins of pride, deception, and pretension in this readable novella. I agree with those bothered by the pasted-on ending, but his lyrical prose and the portrayal of Ayn Rand are worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidestepping Cliches","review":"The trick in this book is in sidestepping expectations from this genre. You'll decide if the author was successful or not as you wait at one pont for the other shoe to drop (speaking of cliches). I have yet to decide if the unnamed narrator and the restricted aspect of this personal point of view works as well as an alternative point of view might have worked. I've been reading this author since he first published and greatly admire his short fiction. I had read three of these chapters as exerpts in magazines and found them powerful by themselves. This novel has that quality of an episodic collection of stories for at least the the first three or four chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School","review":"Reading this novel is very difficult because the plot of this story is very bland, and has no real point to it. The protagonist is arrogant who thinks of nothing but winning the writing contests, and becoming a famous writer. He takes his dream to the extreme that he even plagiarizes someone else's story and calls it his own without truly realizing what he had done. There is no real form to this novel because it lacks all the essential parts of a story; for example there is no sign of a rising action, climax, or falling action. This book just rambles on about the narrator's dream to win a contest so he too can become a famous writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School","review":"The novel Old School is a tale of integrity. While reading it, you experience many twists and turns, but ultimately goes absolutely nowhere. There is no emotional connection with the narrator, let alone any of the other characters. You go through this long boring story with this boy who has no life, and you hit the ending and you're dumbfounded. Are you kidding, that's the ending? A book can atleast redeem itself if the ending is somewhat exciting, but I think this ending placed this novel into the negative stars. Maybe someone out there will find this novel great, but it was not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolff is simply the best","review":"With this novel Tobias Wolff cements his status as one of the greatest writers of our time. 'Old School' - his first full length novel - does not lose any of the impact of his short stories and proves that he is an author capable of taking on any format (including his autobiography 'This Boy's Life'). At a prestigious boarding school for boys in the early sixties we meet our narrator as he begins his senior year - a year which will bring him successs and great consequences. 'Old School' masterfully weaves a variety of themes including friendship, honor, betrayal, and the loss of innocence with a palpable love of literature. This admiration for the classics and also for the craft of writing adds a heartfelt layer to a book that was already amazing simply based on its story. And how appropriate that Wolff pays tribute to classic authors like Hemingway and Ayn Rand as 'Old School' itself is an instant classic (not to mention a joy to read).

Cannibal tells the story of awoman's trek through Africa; following the man she loves. As their journey unravels she begins to suspect that he is not what he appears to be, and in fact he may be starving her. The story is told from inside the woman's head.

The journal is set up so that Day 1 (upper body workout) appears on the first two pages. The next two pages are for Day 2 (aerobics). Day 3 is two pages for lower body. I prefer to keep my progress on a single page for upper body and another page for lower body. This way I can easily see at a glance where I have improved and where I have been slacking. Also, as a new page is created for each workout, you must rewrite your lifting program each time. If you generally keep the same program for 4 to 6 weeks, the book requires a lot of additional writing time.Too, if for some reason you need to change up the order of your days you are stuck jumping around in the journal. For instance, I started the journal on a lower body workout day, so I had to start the journal on Day 3.

It even includes the folks that needed more than 12 weeks to get to healthy and fit. Without the tracking, you can't tell where you were or where you're going.

The three books show how easy it is for a mindless person to get his nonsensical garbage out to the bookstores. In this book, the author is selling his nice looking picture on an empty binder. In all his books, Bill Phillips shows total disregard to modern science and preys on unwary readers seeking healthy way of living. Physical health cannot be promoted by commercial supplements and hasty workout plan. It must be a life-long pattern of staying mobile and active.

The pig smashes the wolves' houses with a sledgehammer, then a pneumatic drill. The wolves build a house that looks like a cross between a bank vault and a prison, complete with barbed wire, which is destroyed when the pig uses dynamite to blow it up.

Yes, the 3 little pigs story is old to us, but young children aren't born knowing it. It's new to them. The original is still a fun story with a good point after all these years. 2) When the wolves are unable to do anything to keep the bad pig out, children whose lives are touched by violent crime will be frightened by the truth in it. 3) The \\"moral\\" of the story is pretty confusing"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're No Walter Williams","review":"This writer makes some good points relative to government's responsibility to protect the people from unbridled capitalism. However, he goes way too far in trying to trace our current economic troubles to Ronald Reagan. Also, do not make the mistake of confusing this author with the brilliant syndicated African American columnist Walter E. Williams, and Amazon errs in suggesting a link between their writings.

It takes a lot for me to do this because I believe books to be sacred objects, but this book is no sacred object, so I threw it into the trash where it belongs.The ONLY reason this nasty book got rated one star is because there isn't a \\"no star\\" rating that I could choose.

She and other female characters are basically cardboard figures used to show whether the sterotypic male characters are good or bad. This book is duller than plain corn grits.And the writing...geez...clumsy, thin and the action and dialogue are as cliche-ridden as the characters. This book has the feel of a trashy romance novel. It's so bad it's funny but you might weep over lost time and this book's contribution to the decline of fantasy fiction. Do authors think that the only fantasy readers are young teens?

The book starts out okay, but by the end you will just want to throw it away and curse yourself for the wasted time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just back from the Prado...","review":"I haven't bought this book, but I saw the paintings this week. Really affected me. So...black. Most of the subjects in the paintings have grotesque faces that are merely smudges of black, grey and silver, as if they were gargoyles that had been burned alive. With subjects sometimes grouped together, they composed \\"the mob\\" which Goya detested so much--from seeing mob atrocities from the Napoleonic-Spanish war. As disturbing as they are, they are painted in such a powerful manner that it was hard to turn away from them. Several of them lack real focus, as if Goya had grown so disgusted with humankind that it wasn't worth the effort to have his subjects actually doing anything. But he is at least painting for himself, not indulging the vanity of the Catholic Church or rich members and patrons of the Royal Family. So much artistic talent wasted during this period on overweight Dukes on horseback..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first time trying kippers","review":"There's a lot of fish in the small can. I thought kippers were supposed to be really smelly, but I might try eating these in the office. I really enjoyed the natural flavor of the fish with crackers, even though I had a little trouble opening the can. Very low sodium. A healthy treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Snaps!","review":"I just bought this item for the first time and the pop top snapped off with very little pressure. Make sure you have a can opener on hand if you buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kipper Snacks I've ever had","review":"I'm more of sardine fan but I bought these just to try them, as in the past I'd tried several brands of kipper snacks.To be brief, these were great. Neatly packed, fresh, flavorful kippers! So, if you love kippers I can't see how you wouldn't love these, and if you've never tried kippers and you want to, I'd say start here. Though if possible you may want to buy a can retail just to see if kippers are for you. Kippers are a world all their own and just because you like other kinds of fish doesn't necessarily mean you'll like kippers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Review","review":"The book, \\"A Seeking Heart: Rediscovering True Worship\\" was ordered as a gift for someone else. The turnaround time was great; I believe I received it in a week from order date, and the book arrived in excellent condition as advertised. I have ordered a few books from Amazon lately, and I must admit the sellers are very prompt in getting the items out very quickly. The price is also reasonable, which is a plus during the economy. Thank you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raboteau's prose effectively gripping","review":"There's too much to say about this novel, so I shall leave it to a few short comments:Raboteau's advance stylistic techniques are a pleasure to read. Her fragmented chronological order is quite Tarantinoesque. You find yourself in a love/hate relationship with each of the characters, and the supreme irony is poetic yet unsettling. 5 stars. It doesn't get much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glittering debut","review":"A glittering debut from a young author who is definitely going places. Raboteau molds her characters with a delicate, cunning hand. I had the sense that she took great care in polishing the book because the story seemed to flow effortlessly, almost as if Emma, Bernie, and others were propelling themselves.Raboteau's skill is most striking in small descriptions, in details, where her style is poignant, sometimes disarmingly brilliant. If you haven't read \\"Kavita Through Glass\\" in The Best American Short Stories 2003, you're missing out. There, too, Raboteau makes the most out of subtlety and understatement, speaking with a quiet voice that somehow resounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be of help for those with identity crisis.","review":"This book being Emily Raboteau's debut is not bad at all. There are quite a number of signs/symbols in the story you should pay attention to. Perspective jumps from one to another, but not really difficult to follow. How the protagonist's brother got into a vegetative state is inappropriately comical, and it's not all that sarcastic either. One of the chapters is somewhat out of the blue and I can't really find a connection with the main plot. The last 1/3 of the book is somewhat pointless in my opinion. Comes off thought-provoking at first but really started dumbing down after 2/3 mark. Character development is somewhat interesting. Events unfold in a natural manner. Emily was able to make the readers visualize. Messages are fairly obvious (one is reminded at the end and another requires some deep thinking). Good read but not a must read.On a side note, it is one of the few books I feel could be turned into a movie. Just sayin..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pac-Man on Wheels","review":"I don't care much for racing games, but World Rally is actually fun to play. Children and adults can have playing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun it ought too be illegal!","review":"Terrific Graphics , simply gameplay , easy controls , and a soundtrack that will give you Pac fever like it's 1980. If there is anyone who could compete with the ol' plumer we all know and love it would be Pac-man and the gang. If you are any old schooler just now discovering some of todays systems as I am , or just want too have a blast , Pac-man world rally is the game for you. Choose from the entire Pac-cast with there different fun styles and vehicles. Unlock several new level's such as Winding Wetland's , Galatic outpost , or Funhouse of Terror. Race in Circuit mode , Battle each other in last Kart standing or just pratice in a single race. With Wonderful classic character's , 2 player option and great nonviolent straightfoward gameplay make this the perfect gift for the entire family.Warning: This game is very addictive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Anyone with some sexual experience will find this book totally useless. I bought it out ouf curiousity and found nothing new and interesting in the book. In fact, I have bought a few books from the same author, primarily attracted by the title, and found none of it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gains time","review":"This clock is awful. It continuously gains time. It has to be set it back ten or fifteen minutes every couple of days. Which makes it pretty useless as a clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal!","review":"The Coby clock radio I purchased was exactly as advertised and exactly what I was looking for. It is user friendly and quite attractive and most of all, takes up minimal room on my bedside table. I love the \\"towerdesign\\" and the readout is easy to see but unobtrusive in the dark. Overall, a 5 star item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective after less than a month.","review":"I received this clock not more than two weeks ago and it is defective already. It gains over 15 minutes per week! Its not worth the shipping cost to return....just another regretable instance of low quality junk...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one problem","review":"This is an excellent product that Ive had next to no problems with. My only complaint about it is the headphone jack. After a month it started acting funny so if you move the jack at all the sound fades or distorts. Its a minor problem though, so Im not worried.One thing I like best about it is the recording ability. When Im playing my guitar I usually come up with a line only to forget it later. This lets me record it so I can remember it later. Its a great feature thats helped me out many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Comparison with the Zen Micro","review":"I bought a Muvo for christmas for my wife, and it was nice and all.. But the 256MB size was quick to fill, so I went and bought a Zen Micro for her (and I of course, kept the Muvo..) With the exception of the Zen Micro having more features and an easier interface, the sound is literally identical. I took 1 ear bud from each player, and managed to get both of them to play the same song at the exact same time, and it sounded exactly the same from both players. So if you want the same sound quality as the Zen Micro, but can't pocket out about $100 more for it.. The Muvo definately has the great sound quality that you want, and the fact that you can detach it from the \\"battery\\" and plug it directly into the computer is another plus. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mp3 player!","review":"I will make my review short and sweet. After using the RCA Lyra 1071 for nearly two years, I thought it was time to upgrade. After checking consumer reports, the Creative Muvo and iPod are the top two mp3 players to buy for this price range and memory. However, the Creative Muvo is hands down the best player. First of all, the software (although it takes a few minutes to get acquainted with) is awesome. Just simply insert your CDs, let it read them, and rip 'em. Next, to import to your player, simply plut it in. It doesn't even use battery life while your song searching!!. The armband is very comfortable, and the headphones are sufficient. A 5 star buy and great price. However, buy it at Wal-Mart. You don't have to wait and it's the same price as Amazon. A great deal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good player","review":"i got this mp3 player and im totally blown away. the sound is great, i transfer music in a second and it couldent be any easier to operate the device. the fm radio has very clear reception. i like that it has a radio recorder but the voice recorder is kinda weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I have been using this mp3 player almost everyday. It works great the battery power lasts longer than what they claim so that's really nice. The controls are easy and the players is really compact. It also works as a hard drive sometimes I use it as one. Only negative comment that I have is when scrolling through FM stations if you accidently hold the scroller longer than 2 or 3 seconds then it will scroll through all the FM radio stations in your area. I strongly recommend people buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to display more that the song title","review":"I just got this today, so I haven't had it long enough to give a review, but I noticed that other reviews commented on how you can only see the title of the song in the display and not the artist. What is shown in the display is what is in the title category when it's on your computer. If you go to the file and right click and go to properties, then clikc on the summary tab there will be a box for title. Just type in whatever you want for the title and that is what will be displayed on the mp3 player. A quick way to see what the titles are is if you look at the files using detailed list to view them (where it shows all the info about the files). If you right click at the top where it says name, size, filetype, etc. it will give you the option of displaying the title. This way you can easily look down your list and figure out which ones you need to change. Hopefully this will help some people, I'll write a review of the mp3 later when I have used it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative NOMAD MuVo TX FM 256 MB MP3 Player -A great value!","review":"I was going to purchase a different mp3 player( headset type) until I read several bad reviews.So, I started searching products and read 2 EXCELLENT reviews regarding this product.I purchased this product and think it is an EXCEPTIONAL value for what you get.1. FM transmitter- very clear2. Tiny size3. Simple and well thoughtout controls4. Very good Microphone to record( Apple sells separately for $49.00)5. Rubber Case - I already dropped it, and it was saved by the case.6. Arm band- ( Apple sell it separtely for $29.00)7. Battery -included -lasts 15 hours( don't use usb port to recharge).8. Software9. Earphones - OKNo, this isn't an Apple- iPod, but for working out at the gym, biking, walking carrying it around. It is everything you could ask for.Excellent value , I strongly recommend this to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Workouts","review":"If you are buying an Mp3 player to use while exercising, this is an excellent product for the following reasons:1.) It is lightweight and durable. I have ran through some extreme weather (heavy rain, snow) without any adverse effects on the player.2.)I am 5'8'' and 155lbs. The included strap kept the unit stable on my arm. People with wider arms might have problems with the strap, however.3.) The software is easy to use. I was able to convert my CDs into Mp3 format within minutes of installing the package. Because a flash-based player, you just have to plug the flash drive into your computer and drag and drop the songs.4.) The FM Tuner gets good reception in urban areas.5.) Long battery life. I get about 16 hours of use before having to change the triple A battery.Again, I only use it while working out. I can't give an informed opinion on the more advanced features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mp3 Player!","review":"I recieved this mp3 player for x-mas. I didn't have to read the directions because it's so simple to use. It is hard for me to plug it to the thing in the computer.( of course I'm only eleven so...) Anyways the earphones hurt my ears and often fall out. Another thing I don't like is it always skips in the middle of songs. I like the fact that you can record things, but it's hard to understand yourself. Something I do like is the accesories. It comes with a belt clip and an armband. I don't use these but my dad often borrows it and he finds them useful. My mom uses it too. BEWARE: IF YOU GET ONE BE PREPARED TO SHARE!!! I also recieved rechargable batteries which are a life saver. I would definately recommend getting some. In the end this is a great mp3 player. It comes with a couple minor glitches but nothings perfect. (speaking of perfect please excuse my spelling in this review)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet MuVo","review":"This is a good mp3 player but only holds 4 hours of mp3 which for me wasnt enough but its light and compact and is easy to carry on the go and to perform extreme activities without it weighing you down.............I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MuVo TX 256 MP3 player - broken usb connector","review":"I saw another review with a broken usb connector problem. It happened to my MuVo too. The connector is not really broken but is cleanly separated from the player (and attaches firmly to the battery unit). My MuVo player is now completely useless. The CL \\"Award winnging customer service\\" web site has no address or phone number to call for repair. Needless to say, CR loses me as a customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Units Both Skip Even After Firmware Upgrade","review":"I really like the design of this player. Unfortunately both of the units I bought for my sons for Christmas skip during the song playback. At first I though it might be that the MP3s were encoded in variable bit rate format. I converted them to 128 bps and tried again. Both untis still skip. I then tried to download the latest firmware 1.12.04 [per another review here, thanks!]and format the drives. Even after all that both units still skip during song playback. I've contacted Creative support and I'm hoping for a fix soon!! I have two very dissapointed kids with what now appear to be $120 lumps of coal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muvo looked to be a great deal until.....","review":"This was a great little MP3 player. Great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. Worse yet, I call Creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. They said the warranty was for 90 days!Huh? The rep at Creative said they'd give me a \\"discount\\" and only charge me $45 to fix it. I asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. He said he'd call me back today, but I'm still waiting.Beware ... Creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from Creative. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Piece of Crap","review":"I have had this player for a little over a year and have hardly used it. It has never worked correctly. When trying to switch tracks, it automatically shuts off on me. Now, it won't even turn on!

If you have this player, do not get rid of the paperwork!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a month","review":"I used it hard for a month and I left it go for like two weeks and it just read file system error on it.

After 6 months of no problems my player just shut off on me yesterday. It would turn on, then after 20 seconds, it would shut off. I swapped out the battery, still nogo. I formatted the drive and tried listening to just the radio, nogo. I loaded the new firmware from Creative's site, nogo. So now I'm stuck w/ a broke MP3 player. Creative wants $50 to fix it. BEWARE: Their warranty is good for 90 days (not 12 months). I went to Creative's forum and it seems that ALOT of people have this same problem but yet Creative does nothing about it.I wish I had bought an Ipod. Creative sucks. Their products work for a few months then crap out on you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can skip to the middle of a song","review":"One previous review titled \\"great production with some flaws\\" said that you can not skip to the middle of a song.

I won't bother going through all the features here. The things I like most are:1) pretty samll and light weight, good for taking it with you jogging2) it's really a jump drive, so you can use it just like a jump driveA couple of complaints:1) The earbuds are very uncomfortable (at least for my ears), even though the sound quality is pretty good. I had to junk it and get a new one.2) The belt clip holder could be much better.Also, a previous reviewer complained about a warning label on \\"lead contamination\\", I believe that is the same \\"warning\\" they put on all Christmas lights. In fact, I think that warning is only for residents of California. :) The same reviewer also mentioned the size of the armband being too big, actually if you put it on the right way, it won't be too big."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immediate Breakdown","review":"I loved the unit. It just broke right away. The size was great although it is sparse on storagge. However, my rating is based on a 3rd or 4th time usage problem that caused all the music to be distorted and unlistenable.I found nothing about that in any literature on the product and researched online as well. I returned it as a result of never getting it to sound good again. Get something with better reliability as the products are getting better all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I hope this product works fine with a PC: I wouldn't know, because I own a Mac, with which this product does not work. It would've been nice had the \\"Product Description\\" specified that; as it was, it made a disappointing Christmas gift for my girlfriend (who also owns a Mac) (and who is now very happy with her new iPod shuffle).A pity, because the MuVo seemed to pack so many more features into a similar size, and at a lower price.

On the plus side I do like the small conveinent size,with easy to use controls. It would be perfect for cycling. I did have two concerns.1. On page 12 of the manual there is a warning notice to wash your hands after use, because you \\"may\\" have lead contact with the cords. It does not specify internal or external. Based on how harmful lead can be I didn't want to take any chances. I don't think it matters on the size of the product and its components that contain hazardous materials. Warnings are usually there for a reason.2. The Sports Armband has a poor design. Unless you have 16 inch arms than it may work for you. Having to gather the fabric to make it work felt odd and noticeable. As for performance I never go that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative MuVo TX FM 256 MB MP3 Player","review":"I find this thing mind boggeling.

The software that comes with it is a little awkward to use, but not too difficult after some practice.It does go through batteries rapidly! However, I've been loading MWA files on it, and they are supposed to drain the battery more quickly than MP3 files. I plan to experiment with this.If you've got more money to spend (I didn't), I'd recommend an MP3 player with more storage...this unit holds the equivalent of about 4 CDs, so I'm having to periodically erase the MP3 player and load up different CDs.

It still works as a USB drive, but only when tilted in the slot! It seems to be an internal connection problem.

It was wonderful for the first 100 days or so and I loved most every aspect of it. I was just about to add to the rave reviews when it failed.A few days after the warranty expired, it stopped working properly. First it wouldn't turn on. After repeated tries, it powered on but I can no longer access the plus volume control nor can I use the scroller knob to access the other functions. I can still load songs, but cannot raise the volume or use the fm or recording functions. Creative will not provide any help after the 90 day warranty period, and the suggestion on the web site to reformat the player does not help.I can still use it as an extra drive--but it is a huge disappointment, especially since I loved it so.

Helped me to find very my own and right way! This is a perfect book for beginners, or even for craftmen who still have some questions about what they are doing exactly.

It is amazing how Deva's voice and musical arrangements speak to the inner spirit--bringing peace, harmony, and balance to life. This is the primary purpose in the repetition of the Sanskrit chants. I use several of Deva's songs when I teach yoga classes. \\"Om Namo Bhagavate\\" is perfect to use for svasana (relaxation pose). \\"Shree Ram Jai Ram\\" and \\"Rang De\\" are playful. My Yoga students have also become fans of Deva. I love to listen to the CD as I drive. If drivers listened to Deva, there wouldn't be any road rage! Any feelings of disharmony quickly dissipate as I sing along with Deva. The purity of her voice is unlike anything I've ever heard.

However,for music that would be useful for meditation or trance work, this or any album by Deva Premal I would not recommend. Her songs are repetitive and uninspiring.

The character set up is cool and at first you think it might be good, but oh boy... yeesh, really dry, but I did like the visual character of this one head school girl with big gray hair.

Is there any girl in the three sister schools that isn't gay? I'm jealous I didn't get to go to an all girls private school and wear a neat uniform. I liked all the characters, even the two bad girls. I do have to say I was hoping the main, main character would pair up with her roommate. I loved the anime and the classical music that played in the background. If Strawberry Panic ever played on American TV, I'm sure the ONE MILLION MOMS would have kittens.

I returned it and asked for a replacement, communicating that the item needed to be checked for a functioning battery.The second watch arrived promptly, but it also had a dead battery. Even if I'd been willing to replace the battery (a cost I wasn't willing to shoulder), the instructions with the watch cautioned the owner not to let a dead battery remain in the watch as it may leak and damage the watch.Again, I'm normally really pleased with Amazon.

With the exacting physical eye of an entomologist and the social-moral vision of the great writer he was, Zola immerses us in a world of detail, and a complex world of people all vying for various pieces of the pie. There's the brash capitalist who owns the new megastore that dwarfs all else in the neighborhood (reflecting the actual, new reality of the department store), the hierarchy/community of the store's management, employees, and shoppers, and there's the small businesses in the neighborhood struggling to maintain their traditional values of business, personal business relationships, and quality that are being swamped by the new model of mass consumption and desire.

I do. O'Shaugnessy delivers in spades. His opinions include some guesswork, but also thousands and thousands of checked inflation-adjusted returns from decades of the stock market, graphed nicely, so I can check his work and come to my own conclusions. I can imagine no better book on technical investing for me.He also has good quick summaries of his findings at the end of each chapter and in the introduction, for the rest of you :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is worth your attention","review":"What an amazing actress. Such an array of emotions - her face seems to be transparent. Love never dies and the longing never dims for some. So sorry it is only a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks from the first frame.","review":"When the main character first appears, she has a phony, stupid smile plastered on her face as 2 men tell her stories of her father and then she is seen with various dates where she blabbers out stupid banter and the men quickly get turned off and ditch her. So, from the start we have a main character that is so obnoxious and phony to the audience so that we are quickly turned off to the whole movie in short time. Not a way to start a movie. I did not even want to wait and see if the character would eventually figure things out and seem likable, or at least tolerable, which I doubt she did. A failure of a movie. Do not waste your time, there are many better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I wanted to love this book, but I didn't. The \\"hook\\" of a body that looks just like the heroine, Maura, is a good one, and I expected to explore more of the depths of Maura's background. However, both the explanation of the \\"twin\\" and the emotional resonance are not satisfying; the treatment of both seems to be superficial. Beyond this, the investigation of the crime and tracking of the killer had little challenge to it. And to me, the ending was a letdown"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Picked up The Surgeon last week, read that, thoroughly enjoyed it, went to the library and got this one out. It's a fantastic read, scary and atmospheric. I love how vulnerable some of her characters are, Maura being divorced and 40, Jane being pregnant & Mattie, with her rubbish husband. With Patricia Cornwell, all her 'good' characters are so strong, scarily efficient and capable, but TG's are more real, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Read!","review":"This is a terrific book in the Rizzoli & Isles series.

A worthy read, worth your valuable time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Fast moving and interesting. I would recommend this book if you enjoy this genre. Keep these great reads coming. Good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roots","review":"We all take for granted the \\"knowing\\" from whom we inherited the shape of our mouth, the length of our nose, our funny shaped ears. This book explores the effect that \\"not knowing\\" has on individuals. Like a cancer it eats away at us until it takes out confidence and our future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing.","review":"Tess Gerritsen knows how to write suspense; and this is definitely suspense and much less a medical thriller than most of her books. Although the opening is a bit clich��, what follows is engrossing and disturbing. There is suspense, twists aplenty, and a climax I definitely didn't see coming. It's a fast read because you don't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book, AGAIN!","review":"This is oe of my favorite suspense authors. I wish she would write faster. I really have enjoyed all of her books. They are well written and interesting, exciting stories.

I bought it sight unseen as soon as it came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripping, awesome","review":"I read this non stop, and liked it so well that I had to order the rest of her books as i had never read her before. This was a well written convoluted, complicated book, just absorbing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Writer I'll Read Again...","review":"Sorry, I'm just not a fan of Patricia Cornwell wannabes or their genre on the whole. When someone tells me,\\"Read this book. You are going to love it,\\" I'll read it because \\"I'm going to read something\\" anyway. I can't return this one fast enough. (Either that or throw it in the canal!)Far from sqeamish, I'm not a big fan of books about burying people alive, or cutting babies out of mother's wombs. \\"Gee, is that just me?\\"This book is more like a lame Creative Writing project for a Graduate course in college. Pregnant cop hunts killer of someone who captures and kills pregnant women. Old man has \\"Barbie\\" trophy wife. Two detectives, divorcing, are caught in squabbles of jealousy. Only one will survive! Yikes! How orignal!Keep your Tess Gerritson, Dean Koontz, Patricia Cornwell, James Patterson books. I don't need them. I suggest you don't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"I've been a fan of Gerritsen's ever since running across Vanish. Body Double is, by far, my most favorite of hers to date. That's not to say that I didn't like her other books.I remember the chills I got when discovering where the prologue tied into the story. Gerrtisen has such a smooth delivery. I can only hope people view my writing the same way.I look forward to reading Gerritsen's most recent release: The Keepsake!~Chad Clegg - Author: The DOMINO EFFECT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Read.","review":"I have never read the author before and thought I give it a try, I am glad that I did give it a try. The story sucked me in from the beginning to the end. I will definitely read another book from Ms. Tess"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite in the series so far...","review":"Story Rating: 5 Wine GlassesAudio Rating: 4 Wine GlassesThis is probably my favorite in this series so far. I really enjoyed all the twists, turns, and swerves that the case took. In true \\"is it a good mystery\\" fashion, I did not guess the ending in advance. That being said there was a part about the ending that irked me but it was still done well. The plot and pacing were fantastic. At no point did I think the story stalled or was unbelievable. We got more Isles in this story which is good because up to this point it has been mostly Rizzoli. I am hoping in the future the books are more balanced with both. They really are a good team together: both loving their jobs, being good at it, and being women in a male dominated field without it being a big issue.I would highly recommend this book to fans of thrillers. I don't even think you really have to read them in order as you would only miss a few things and those are not part of the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"I love a good, quick read that gives me a good, quick, exciting ride. This did it.BODY DOUBLE is a thriller/mystery that involves several murders, the possibility of more than one bad guy/gal as perpetrator(s), at least one human \\"monster\\" behind bars and perhaps one on the loose.Add to that believable characters that engage your emotions and you get just the right amount of bang for your buck.The first 25 pages or so dragged just a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless Tension","review":"As with all of Gerritsen's books, the pace is relentless and the reader always feels that something bad is about to happen. High suspense. The plot revolves around Boston Medical Examiner Maura Isles. Isles is an adopted child who never knew her parents. The book starts with a bang: the corpse of a murdered woman who seems to be her identical twin. From there, the reader is taken on a roller coaster ride as Maura unravels mystery after mystery. Oh, don't read this book if you can't handle thoughts of being burried alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I won't ever write the plot of a book, because I think it ruins it for the reader.So needless to say this review is brief.My opinion...If you've never read Tess Gerritsen's books but like medical/thriller/coroner type books, you'll like her writing.I find her books have a feminine \\"feel\\" to them. Not to discourage any males out there from reading them... The main characters are female and I'm female..so I relate.If you read THE SINNER (her last book) I think I liked this one more. The characters seemed more developed.Just my opinons :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"In the 4th series of Rizzoli and Isles, we uncover an even better understanding of Dr. Maura. Her family background is very interesting to say the least and the who-dunnit is cleverly disguised. Not heart-stopping but enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"True thriller","review":"I love Tess Gerritsens writing style and this book is another great example of what she is capable of! I suggest reading the r & I books in order..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerritsen always pleases--and chills!","review":"Body Double is Gerritsen's fourth novel in the Detective Jane Rizzoli series of medical thrillers. She interweaves her main plot, discovering the murderer of her main character's (Dr. Maura Isles) adopted twin sister, with several subplots, including locating her birth mother, the pain of a frustrating romance, the death of another lover, all intermingled with personal death threats. Her series hero Jane Rizzoli is in the last trimester of her pregnancy, which adds another layer of apprehension to the novel, in that the suspected murderer is involved in human trafficking, namely selling babies stolen from their mother's womb. The story has very little \\"down time,\\" and Gerritsen does a first-rate job of building tension throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerritsen's Guarantee","review":"Gerritsen novels are guaranteed to keep you up and reading long into the night, they are almost impossible to put down and will definately have you tired the next morning. Gerritsen is an amazing writer who never fails to come up with the most original and unique storylines. Body Double is just another example of her talent as an author, just when you think you know who done it, along comes a mindblowing twist you just don't see coming. I've loved following the lives of Rizzole and Isles and can't wait to read more to see how Rizzole combines being a new Mother as well as a butt kicking detective. Hope Isles finds love too considering this story sees yet another disappointment in her love life. But then again, you wouldn't be reading Gerritsen if you were looking for a romance novel, as these novels are strictly sensational medical thillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First \\"Tess Gerritsen\\" Novel","review":"I'm a Newbie to Tess Gerritsen's Novels... I really like the Rizzoli & Isles Series I've watched 3 of the shows and I LIKED them Alot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST drug book out there!","review":"I'm a former Saunder's fan, but when I saw this book I knew I had to have it! Being a new MT, it is helpful that the drugs listed also list their 'sound alike' names, as well as giving you an appendix in the back with diseases and drugs prescribed for them accordingly! :) It's an awesome book, and I'm a loyal Quick Look Drug Book fan! You won't be disappointed with your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Symphony No. 4 / Requiem","review":"Two large scale Schnittke works featuring choir.The Symphony No. 4 is brittle, frequently dissonant and abstract, but not wholly inaccessible; not a piece to immediately grab at a listener. While demanding, the work has sections of alien beauty, such as before and after the entrance of \\"Ave Maria\\". Unfortunately the entire piece is relegated to a single track on the CD.The Requiem is more immediately approachable. Eerie and gothic, I'm surprised that it hasn't shown up in a soundtrack. The rock drumming near the end seems a little shocking but is surprisingly effective without seeming a pandering fusion piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great art, hopeless verse","review":"I wanted to like this. I really did. But ... I didn't. It's such a brilliant idea and the execution is so disappointing. The art is excellent - wonderfully creepy and Gorey-esque - but the selection of alphabetic entities seems arbitrary at best to anyone with a half-decent familiarity with Lovecraft and the \\"poetry\\" is hopeless. The little verses show a real tin ear for rhyme and meter, and don't even attempt to stick to a consistent stanza form throughout (in contrast to Gorey, whose little poems were always as beautifully crafted as his drawings). A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"I liked the illustrations and the information. I was able to get the information I needed and it will help me with future references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb - Ranks alongside The Last Herald-Mage Trilogy","review":"Truly outstanding trilogy, ranking alongside The Last Herald-Mage as her finest works to date. Gripping from beginning to end with tears, laughter, happiness and sorrow. Keep up the good work!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books this century!","review":"This is one of the best book's I've ever read. A real attention keeper, and an inevitable tear-jerker. Talia is a great heroine, and the enemies are horribly evil and decieving"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stunning!!!","review":"I read these books the first time when I was about 13, and at the time was completely absorbed and having read them since (I'm now 21) I've picked up on many things that I never before noticed. Talia is one of the best realised heroines in modern fantasy and her trials during this story are both heart wrenching and inspiring - it is a tale of loyalty and betrayal, love and hate, all tied together in a magical kingdom where you are seen for who you are and not what."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most emotional books I've read in a long time!","review":"If you've read the other 2 books in this trilogy, and you have come to know and love Talia, you won't be able to put this one down. I remember saying to myself, \\"Ok, I'll stop at the end of this page...oh wait, no, the end of the chapter. Oh, no a clifhanger...I wonder what happens...ok, at the end of THIS chapter...\\" and so on! It will make you cry even if you went through Titanic dry-eyed! Warning! It's a page-turner, so only read when you have plenty of time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"This is an extremely good end to an equally good trilogy. I was literally in tears through the last three or four chapters. It's got everything, pain and torture for you sadists out there, heartbreaking romance for the deathless romantics (::waves to fellow deathless romantics::) and action/adventure for the heroic types. Mercedes Lackey skillfully brings all these threads together in a well-crafted book. READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice!","review":"This trilogy was wonderful! My best friend gave them to me after I had read The Last Herald-Mage trilogy and I absolutely loved it! Yes this book is rather graphic, but they are not intended for children. The fact that Talia was tortured only makes it all seem real. I mean how many villains are going to go, \\"Well, I want to take over your country and kill off your queen. Would you care for some tea?\\" This book is wonderful and left me teary eyed at the end. I've read it a grand total of 8 times and feel the same way each time I pick it up. I definetly recommend it to anyone who likes real fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talia grows up","review":"Although these first books in the Valdemar series lack a certain maturity (especially when compared to the Vanyel series or \\"Storm Warning\\" and \\"Storm Rising\\") they're still a must-read to truly appreciate the series.Herald Talia has grown up, earned her whites, and faces triumph and tragedy (with much stronger violent content) that may shock younger readers who began with the milder \\"Arrow's Fall\\" so be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars is Not Enough!","review":"This is my favorite book! When I finished it for the first time, I turned back to page one and read it cover to cover again....twice. 'Nuf said."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This book was very well written just like all of her others. it draws you in to the magical world of valdemar and you can picture everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was a great book! I LOVED it!!! No, it was not too graphic! If any of you people researched the subject, you would find that torture in the middle ages was a LOT worse. To bad about Kris...Also recommended: All of Lackey's Heralds of Valdemar books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've ever read!","review":"I finished the book just yesterday, and since than it is all that i can think about! I have read the other 2 books, and I have found that this one is by far the best of them! Some may argue that it is too graphic, but i really don't think so. It is a book you can never put down, and it is truly a tear-jerker. I was reading this book at one point on a bus, and i had to stop reading for a few minutes, bite my lip, and try my very hardest not to cry. It was such an amazing book, and I think that i will read it many times to come. It will probably stand as the best book I've ever read for years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot and writing are too predictable.","review":"I try to like Mercedes Lackey, I really do. However, this trilogy is written in black and white rather than shades of gray. The villains are evil (and she gives you very graphic descriptions of how and why) and the good guys are Good, and never the twain shall meet. All this is fine, but it makes for a very predictable, even boring read. It's also disturbingly graphic. Ms. Lackey shows us, in very minute detail, all the evil things the bad guys do, and then holds up her hands in horror and says Oh! How terrible! I have nothing against violence if it somehow has a point within the plot, but here it doesn't. It just shows us in nauseating detail how bad the bad guys are and why it's so right that the good guys are fighting them. I'd say this book has the right sort of plot to appeal to teenagers and novice fantasy readers, but the graphic violence is just too much. If you're a parent, read this book before you let your child anywhere near it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Training through Hardships","review":"Finally, after years of training, Talia has finally earned her whites. Now all that stands before her is a year and a half intership with Kris as her advisor. The 1 1/2 year goes by slowly. Monay things happen that try both her strength and will. Through snow and feelings of doubt, Talia finds new friends, confidence, control, and most importantly, the lessons she has learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This may not be as good as the ESPN movie Four Minutes that came out later, but it's not bad either.

The presence when these hats are played open, is something every drummer should experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Value","review":"Compared to the original leather case with a magnetic latch on the flap, this Nylon camera is pretty cheesy.

With clear and crisp descriptions, it is quite well written. The step-by-step instructions and procedures go from simple to more complex, making it easy to follow along and actually use as a guide for making boxes (Unlike many other similar texts.) Not only can this be used to make the exact box illustrated, but the instructions are easily adapted for boxes of your own imagination. In addition, the author shows you multiple techniques for a range of box making aspects, allowing the reader to exercise his/her own creativity. I have literally hundreds of woodworking and design books and this is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Help","review":"All my previous wood working had been on a relatively large scale. So when I wanted to use the scrap wood to make small boxes, I didn't know where to start. This book has pointed me in the right direction as far as dimensions of the wood thickness, joinery, finnishing, and ideas. The book is good for both beginners and intermediate woodworkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a \\"basic\\" book that is basic","review":"I am a new boxmaker and have really enjoyed this book. The author explains the basics of a number of different types of boxes that get progressively more complex as the book goes along. I only dock it one star for the lack of color photos. As a child of the 80s, I need the flashing lights, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonexistent target audience","review":"I really doubt many people who are interested in a beginners book on box-making already own a table saw, bandsaw, miter saw, drill press router and power planer. But David Freeman expects the beginner box-maker to own all of those machines. That's a start up cost of what? Two thousand dollars to make your first box? He gives no information whatsoever on hand tool techniques. This pretty much exemplifies what's wrong with most contemporary woodworking books.Believe it or not, beatific boxes can be made entirely with inexpensive hand tools, and were made that way for a long time. Native American craftspeople of the Pacific Northwest made cedar bent-wood boxes without any metal tools.Conclusion: this book is useless. Beginners will not have access to the equipment; people with the equipment will already be familiar with the woodworking fundamentals covered here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publishing Errors","review":"I had to return this book because it was printed with page out of sequence. I don't know if this was the fault of the author or publisher, regardless it made the book impossible to read. It looked like an interesting book if not for this flaw, and I was sorry to return it.Edited 5-23-08I found another copy of this book at a locale woodworking store and the pages were out of order in that copy also."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to construct unattractive boxes","review":"This book will show you in detail how to make unimaginative and unattractive boxes.

A light rain beads on the cover and attenuates the signal enough to stop reception. Snow collects on the cover as fast as it did on the dish - and it takes less snow on the cover to stop reception. I have worked with covers on large commercial microwave dishes. The concept does work. If you always have exceptionally dry snow and when it rains it pours (no sprinkles, no mist).

Nothing really spectacular but catching the flair of the late 70's, beginning 80's in a most delightful way. Watch the clothes, specifically Ricci Martin's white trousers. To be honest, there could have been more of everything, but I doubt if the movie would have been the same again. Anyway, the best is the music by England Dan & John Ford Coley.

It is absolutely authoritative, but reads in a very personal way. I literally have stacks of Reiki books that seemed compelling at first, but \\"Reiki: A Comprehensive Guide,\\" has risen to the top and withstood the test of time.

Despite far from being the ultimate Reiki guide or something (I haven't found any so far) it gives a great view and different perspective of Reiki practice.Miles focuses many interesting aspects, which are very important as for clients, as for practicioners, as to regular medical professionals.Enriched with many recent studies in medical area, as well with statements of recognized professionals of ocidental medicine, this books makes Reiki simple as it is, but bringing very interesting information about the practices and concepts related to Reiki.A very grounded reference book, for nowadays practice. Preparing the terrain to consolidate alternative therapies in the hall of official ocidental terapies.I liked very much this book, a must have.Not as technical as some books are, nor balmy as others, but very informational, bringing light to a greater understand of Reiki.Tiago H."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authoratative, informative, inspiring","review":"Pamela Miles' extensive experience in Reiki makes for compelling reading. Her tone and lucid writing style make the experience enjoyable and inspiring.

I personally believe that all people are capable of bringing energy into themselves, whether it be through Reiki, healing touch, qi gong and a host of other healing practices. I was attuned via the internet and I was extremely satisfied. I have experienced amazing results with Reiki with myself and many others. This book did an excellent job teaching me some of the important things I may have missed in a one-on-one experience.

The show from 1994 seems incomplete. There are a few fadeouts during the set, which makes me wonder if some material was left out, or if the order of the concert was rearranged. Second, why not the whole CBGB's show? This DVD does not seem particularly long and they could have fit more material on it. Third, the interview, while entertaining, is embedded in the show, why? It is pretty annoying and probably should have been part of the bonus material. I wouldn't avoid this DVD if you are a Jesus Lizard fan, and the video here is amazing, but a much better job could have been done. In the interview, David Yow mentions that they have hours of live footage, and several music videos, so hopefully more live material will see the light of day soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, except for...","review":"...the confusion and exclusion of \\"Then Comes Dudley.\\" I had really hoped to be able to geek out to its acrobatic guitar lines on video. \\"Mouthbreather\\" appears in its stead. Nevertheless, it's an entertainingly characteristic JL show -- the band deftly pounds away in its usual relentless, machinistic manner while David Yow screams, spits, and jumps into the audience. The sound quality suffices and the cameras capture the band members pretty well. Of course, nothing compares to being there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, great show","review":"I saw the Jesus Lizard several times and this DVD pretty much captures the experience. Not \\"super\\" high quality but it features multi camera shots and good (surround) sound. The bonus footage from CBGB's is bootleg but still worth a look. Overall a fun DVD from a great live band. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed JL live or those that missed out and want to see what they were like.

If you can, wait for the original to be re-shown on TV and record it. These \\"original\\" DVD versions of popular soap operas are all terrible. Badly planned and executed. Just a cheap way to rip consumers off. The day I bought this DVD I bought two others, Los Ricos Tambien Lloran and La Madrastra.

The writer seems to do a lot better a reporting the straight facts - how to ascertain time of death, blood pooling, blood colors, etc. rather than conveying his own experiences. I found \\"Dead Men Do Tell Tales\\" by William R.

Susie dances worse than many beginners I've seen, hopping around like she's doing jive. Marlon is more mumbling than dancing, his method in teaching is not having one. His moves are very basic and some look just ridiculous. Actually I'm speechless. If you're so bad it's a crime to let people pay $ for a DVD... At least my friends and I had a good laugh!

If you start dancing Salsa this way in any Latin club i've visited anywhere in the world, you will be laughed out of it! No self-respecting woman who knows how to dance any style of Salsa - classic, modern, or ballroom - will subject herself to the nonsense that Marlon teaches.

As with the very best albums, there is barely a wrong note in the entire CD, let alone a bum track.Trying to describe the appeal of music that doesn't have much of a signature other than its quality is tough, but if I tried I'd say it's warm, catchy, and moving (in both senses) - with shades of the best bits of Hall and Oates in couple of tracks. It compels you to pay attention, sing along if you can, dance if you're able - so try not to listen when you're performing surgery, flying a plane, or trying not to make a fool of yourself.Now I have to go off and submit a couple of two-star reviews to make up for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"dance dance dance","review":"forget about all the catagorical hair splitting and just get down on it. these french guys really know how to lay down a thick groove without being heavy handed. it's more like old school michael jackson, than modern electronica."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm dancing in my seat right now","review":"I had to give it about 3 listens until I caught the groove.

Points are made here and there, but few are made. The 'everyone is accepted here' is beat over your head for a majority the film, cheating time that could be spent on other aspects of Rocky. When the film is over they just kind of put a tag on it and call it quits.Shots in the film can go on much longer than need be, adding to the rambling feel of the video.Plus, they keep including interviews with two African-American guys who clearly know nothing about Rocky. Because the two people in questions have very stereotype voices, clothing and body language, it really comes off as racist. To focus that much screen time that adds no valuable information or content to the film, but simply seems to perpetuate stereotypes seems to really work against the 'open minded' theme of the piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love rocky but this was awful!","review":"OK first off the animorphic 16:9 displayed in 4:3 was a pain in the neck, this dvd looks like someone did it on their home PC and then released it to the world, the menu is awful, words are cut off in text that appears on the screen, although i have been a major part of Rocky for over 15 years i would not recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the use of this book ?","review":"I bought this book.

They are brutally honest at times, pointing out things that most reviewers would not. Their descriptions are so accurate that I sometimes wonder if they are sitting on the very next stool with a glass of red for her and a draft for him.For nightlife, this guide has opened up and made sense of what otherwise is a complex metropolis.

The story was an interesting take on the boy-meets-girl archetype.This film is good entertainment, and one that will appeal to the romantic at heart.

One of the sadly destroyed Doctor Who stories. The Massacre is the story of the The De Medici Massacre of the Huguenots on St Bartholomew's Day. It is also the story of the Doctor's involvement and his inability to do any thing to prevent it. History must not be changed. As such, it is a tragic tale all around. Lucarotti tells it well. The writing is solid with just enough description and character shadings to bring things to life. As the reader can use his or her imagination, Lucarotti also has a bigger budget than the show ever did and the Paris of 1572 comes to life. As should be the case with a historical story, the reader will come away with much knowledge of the events leading up to the Massacre, the politics and the personages involved and, while ultimatly sad, it is still a rousing adventure filled with suspense and intrique. And, as I've remarked in another review, Steven Taylor was a great companion. A good solid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very romantic","review":"I found this book romantically satisfying, and the characters fairly well fleshed out and believable. The only aspect I felt a little hard to believe was the speed by which Falcon Hawk and Maggie developed a relationship. One day her husband was dead, and the next she was in love with this handsome Indian chief. Granted, she had never truly been 'in' love with her husband, therefore she didn't feel that kind of remorse, but it felt sort of wrong with how quickly she went from one to the other. Falcon Hawk certainly is one of Ms. Edward's more charitable and generous characters, willing from the beginning to take in Maggie's unborn child and raise as his own, even accepting Maggie having lied to him about the child's existence! I believed in their love from the beginning, so I would recommend this to anyone who loves to believe in love at first sight, if they don't mind the speed of the relationship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want definition? Get one of these...","review":"All the magic from this sticks comes out from it's tiny round tip. Besides, it's as long as a 5A regular stick but a little thinner, wich makes it more light and fast. Could produce some less volume but that should not be a problem with proper technique.It can take out a very articulate and definite sound even from some \\"dark\\" cymbals. It's tip doesn't have much contact with the cymbal producing that result.If you want to notice the difference of this tip, then try it on a ride cymbal. Compare it with any regular stick or even the Peter Erskine Ride Stick. If more brilliance is needed, then go for the nylon tip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Eptor - Buyer Beware","review":"If you are expecting 6 pair of inexpensive sticks like the picture shows, this is NOT what you want.

Not the case here.Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"As a fan of both golf and films based in biography, I expected to thoroughly enjoy this film. Unfortuneately, it was, on the whole, a let down. Part of it was the casting... with Jim Caviezel in an awful dye-job that was a constant reminder he was just playing a part, his appearance and his acting did not begin to enbody the man I have studied thru books, internet, and documentaries. Part of it was also the script that lacked engaging dialouge. With the exception of Jeremy Northam as Walter Hagan (the one bright spot in the movie), the characters were two-dimentional and forgetable. My advice... if you want a good golf movie with true story backround, skip \\"Bobby Jones\\" and see \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played.\\" It outsines it by a mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"W","review":"Big fan of James Caviezel, good fun.Excellent transaction, exactly what I expect from Amazon. I use Prime, and will continue with this program. Have never had an issue with Amazon at anytime. Perfect execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Old Fashioned Flick","review":"I loved this movie. Jim Caviezel did it again. I guess it made more of a homerun with me because he had a slow debilitating disease, so I could relate to it perfectly. But aside from that, I think he hit on the true person of who Bobby Jones really was - a genuine, good person who gave his best to himself, the game, and his fans. Despite his degenerative health, he gave his life to his family, both immediate and married families. He pursued what he loved with every ounce of passion and decidedly chose the path of being an amateur instead of a professional. I loved the resilience he portrayed despite any misgivings he may have had during the course of his life. I wish I were more like that. This is a great film - watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"If you love golf, you will enjoy this movie.

The screen writer and director should not have added profane language as a part of Mr. Jones dialogue. Nothing that has been written to date about Mr. Jones has indicated that he used profane language in the manner that was portrayed in the movie.

It's a shame that the movie did not match his standards for quality in his golf and his life. It is slow and plodding, the acting stiff and the scenes awkwardly staged not very natural. Instead of feeling you were in 1920, you constantly sensed that it was shot today trying to imitate 1920. James Caviezel was actually pretty good, but the movie as a whole just had an amateurish production quality. Bobby Jones was a great person, more so than a great golfer. The movie tried to show this, I just wish it could have been done more professionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash and Garbage! Too much swearing.....","review":"Not a PG! Trashed it!

Especially a story of a true sportsman, a true gentleman of the game, someone who loved to play the game for the game itself.But this movie doesn't spend enough time telling us about the real Bobby Jones. It leaves us hanging and wondering. There is one point where he is playing with a woman golfer and she is refered to as his girlfriend - WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? At another point, he is in the hospital, temporarily banned from the game. Then flip to him writing a letter of apology, then flip to him playing golf. Well what happened to the hospital stay? What happened to his ailment? How did he get better, is it a long time/term disability? Later, he and his wife are arguing over him going to another tournament and then PRESTO there they both are at the match.Scenery - beautiful. Story - while interesting it leaves viewer disappointed.

Otherwise, consider these caveats:1. Not all information is correct. For example, the verbal descriptions of characteristics and habits ascribed to yellow-fin tuna are actually those of blue-fin tuna. Another error is the statement that all corals live in tropical waters when, for example, some of the most beautiful coral in the world is off Alaska's coast.2. The gratuitous accent on predation panders to the worst side of us. It gives violence a veneer of acceptability while ignoring predation's benefits, such as strengthening of species and eliminatin of injured or sick individuals. In The Blue Planet, we can be voyeurs to terror and suffering and let our consciences off the hook by claiming \\"science.\\" In reality, the proportions of this set of DVDs devoted to hunting and killing as compared to other aspects of marine life are way out of whack."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

The underwater bits don't look real in places especially with the multicoloured tiny fizzers. Also the dolphins are singled out as something special like in most fish films, but they are just a fish! This is since Flipper set the benchmark of what to expect of a fish. The documentary would have scored higher if it left out the dolphins and made Dave say 'tuna' not 'tuna' as he pronounces it. He says 'tuna' as in 'tooner' where I say 'tuna' as in 'choona'.

If you grew up like I did fascinated by the undersea photography work of Jacques Cousteau - co-inventor of the SCUBA - then this takes it to a whole new level. Some of the underwater shots are SO amazing that you keep wondering how it was all done, and that is revealed in the special features.

And if you're fascinated in the least by ocean life (as I am), this set is a must-have. I've owned the original version that I bought in the UK in PAL and had to buy a NTSC copy when I moved back to the US. The US copy started to deteriorate and I bought the digital copy. That's how much I enjoy watching and re-watching Blue Planet.The Frozen Seas and the Deep Ocean episodes are my top picks. Rare glimpses of worlds the average person will never see.

The only downside is some of the footage is reused in the \\"Planet Earth\\" documentary.

Otherwise stay away. Or look elsewhere. Mullova/ Ozawa (BSO), Kyung Wha Chung/Previn (LSO) and Khachatryan/ Krivine (Sinfonia Varsovia) are fine choices. Heifetz/Hendl (CSO)is amazing, if a certain level of hiss doesn't bother you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes less really is more....","review":"I'll get the negative over with first... My only complaint with this CD is that the balance between the orchestra and the soloist is a little off. The violin is too quiet some of the time (especially with the full orchestra is playing with it), and the orchestra sound is a little muddy for my tastes (too much reverb or something...). Other than that, the CD is great.I think the original version is interesting to listen to from a musicological standpoint, but as a stand alone composition, it is far inferior to the revised version we're used to. The original has too much material, much of which is poorly developed, and generally just sounds disorganized and wandery compared to the streamlined revised version.The original version is very interesting to listen to and, if nothing else, it will make you appreciate the economy and unity of the revised version all the more. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ...","review":"After heard both concerts, and compare the versions, I really enjoy the original concert, much longer - much beautiful. After this version the second one is a reduction of the original conceived idea of Mr. Jean Sibelius. The second version, the version that everybody plays, is a magnificent work that Mr Leonidas play very well. But after heard the first one and continue with the second version you will feel that the concert is uncomplete. May be some years more from this CD, the people will make justice to the original version and forget the actually played cut version.The composers needs in many cases much time for take the accept from the public, this because many times the people evolution is slower than the composer vision.Adquire this CD, this is a jewel for your collection. Excellent violinist.

Well I got shutdown. Deniros acting was great but the story was just boring. People say Norton acted good as the mentally challenged person but come on now, I think it'd be pretty easy to play a mentally challenged person. I didnt even think Brando had that good of a part. There no action at all in this movie, none.

Edward Norton is pretty good, but both of them looked fake. The story was very plain in the first half, then it went into the tried and tried formula of excitment----who is cheating who?

This is a mind game of who gets to out-smart who."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par!","review":"Although the performances of both Edward Norton and Robert De Niro where great. The film did not deliver what you'd expect from a movie combining De Niro with Norton.The fact that De Niro and Norton gave great performances is something to be expected at this point in time. So we shouldn't be surprised that they did. We also expect them to be picky about what roles they will take.My opinion was that the film left me feeling very very deissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"i can't believe this movie averages 4 stars","review":"everyone i have spoken to who has seen this movie found it mediocre at best. i paid 2 full price admissions (me and my wife) to see it in the theatre, and came out thoroughly disappointed. with the director and cast involved, i expected greatness, or at the very least, entertainment. what i walked out with was a profound sense of disappointment and regret for shelling out hard-earned money for a lackluster (and really quite predictable) heist movie that got average performances from great actors (deniro, norton), and a laughably poor performance from a once-great actor (brando). what peeved me the most was the fact that edward norton seemed to have been typecast with an almost exact replica of the character he played in primal fear, which led to a subconscious as well as conscious premonition that blew the so-called surprise ending... four stars my heinie."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINING","review":"I knew this movie was going to be good when I saw the cast, and I was right. It was very good. Edward Norton was very good...maybe another Oscar nod, because no other performance, except Hayley Joel Osment, has stood out, yet. Very good movie. Good ending, but slightly predictable. The only problem was they kind of wasted Angela Basset's talent, since she only had a few scenes, but overral a very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the trailer or TV spots fool you....","review":"\\"The Score\\" is not the action adventure thriller it was made out to be that you expected from viewing TV or at the movies. Instead, it's a character driven crime drama about two men, both of different ages determined to make one very big payoff. It's engrossing to see DeNiro, Brando, and Norton all share the screen with each other as the three best actors of their generation. They're etched in their characters so well that they manage to hold the plot down as entertaining. Frank Oz, doing a complete 180 from any lightweight summer comedy he's directed, handles the material with finesse, with beautiful cinematography and a nice jazz score. Very much an entertaining film that is a character driven heist flick, and not an action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worn Plot, but......","review":"This is still a good flick. Even though the story has been done before....De Niro is his usual expert self. He is always easy to watch. He plays his parts well. Brando... What to say. I expected much more from this pairing. Thankfully, Brando's role is small in the overall scheme of the film. He appears for mere minutes. The real story is with De Niro.Anyway, the coolness factor is very high. De Niro as the experienced thief is great. Norton as the new guy is also good. The item to be stolen is well guarded. Norton is the inside man on this job.The film moves along very quickly. Not a lot of the technical details or planning is explained. It would have been better if they would have gone into that a little more. But, they had Brando and De Niro. Probably too much $$$ involved to go that direction.I can easily reccommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Fortunately for me, I rented it.This movie is really bad.It lags and drags for an hour and 45 minutes, and then suddenly and out of nowhere comes the action.The ending is expected.-RoNNY"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good popcorn movie","review":"Let's just say this: it does what it sets out to do. The three main actors (DeNiro, Brando, and Norton) are all terrific, although Angela Bassett is wasted in the girlfriend role (perhaps she had more that was edited out). This is one of the many recent \\"last big score\\" films and it is perfect. It doesn't make you think and it's entertaining. Had it been more action-filled, I might have suspected Jerry Bruckheimer's hand in it. Includes another amazing double performance from Edward Norton (see Primal Fear). Suspenseful, only marred by a fully predictable twist (just one) at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Score\\" really scores!","review":"Anything Robert DeNiro does has to be tops and always worth watching. \\"The Score\\" is one of the tops of the tops. DeNiro is superbly rational and fearsome, Ed Norton was a relative newcomer in this movie and with all that talent will be a star for years to come. An added plus is Marlon Brando in his last movie role, and he was, as always, great - and always Marlon. A super treat, even if it did come out years ago. An edge of your seat thriller, without all the gratuitous violence so loved by producers as a coverup for bad movies. This is not a bad movie - it stands on its own as a wonderful entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winning cast","review":"I have to admit, I rarely buy/see a movie based on the cast. That may seem nuts, but I prefer certain story lines. However, when you put Norton and De Niro in the same film, how can you NOT want to see it?These two play off each other beautifully. Whoever was in charge of casting is either brilliant or damn lucky. The whole polished professional vs. up and commer was executed to perfection by these two. Each seeming to size up the shortcomings of the other... move, counter move. All very cool.Why do I give it 4 stars instead of 5? I guess I would have to point to the editing. I felt like the pacing was off during the middle of the movie. I found myself thinking \\"Ok... moving right along\\" about halfway through. If that does not indicate poor pacing (for me anyway), I don'tknow what does. If I had the option of giving this one 4.5 stars, I would have done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to fall asleep to","review":"Wow What a cast amazing actors old and new in this very bland and predictable movie about a big robbery(hence the score).Nothing that great to offer in the story department(seen it all before), but worth watching for performances by Edward Norton Robert De niro, and of course a very annoying and hard to understand Marlon Brando.This movie starts off very slow and continues on that track till the some what exciting end(although everyone knows or should know what is coming at the end.)So I say this is just another average movie with an average story but staring a great cast.Rent it but please do not buy (unless you are having trouble sleeping...hammy"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.","review":"I wonder if this was written in the same amount of time it takes to watch. The actors may not have been given any direction at all. It seemed like I was watching an unfinished version, as if they weren't done editing the film and scoring the music. The story takes a couple turns, but it's about as suspenseful as a ferris wheel. I love De Niro and Tyler Durden, but honestly, unless you have nothing else to waste your time and money on, don't bother with The Score."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!","review":"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's a plot that didn't interest me (they had about 3 plots running at the same time.....guy in a scam for the money, another guy falling in love, and the same guy trying to pay off his debts) While Norton did a good job of playing a guy who acts ..., De Niro hasn't changed....he's still boring and I don't find him such a great actor.....his movies don't interest me but I saw this one since I heard good things about it....I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.....the only good scene was the last one but the rest is all dialogue and useless scenes....don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps the most over-rated movie ever","review":"With a cast full of great actors and a classic plot this should have been an excellent movie. However, it moved painfully slowly towards an overly abrupt ending. Norton did a great acting job which often causes viewers to consider this a quality movie. He is so good that often the nonsensical ending to the movie is overlooked. If you believed that this was a good movie I ask you to watch it once more and try to imagine how the heist could possibly be pulled off in that manner, there are siply too many flaws to deal with. Feel free to watch this movie, but please think about it before you take the slow paced plot as a sign of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even De Niro's brilliance can't save this garbage film ...","review":"What an unpleasant surprise ... as a rabid deNiro fan I was expecting another 'Heat' film with De Niro, Al Pacino and Val Kilmer .... WRONG ...This movie comes nowhere close to the quality entertainment that we have come to expect. Although De Niros role as super thief surrounded by 'you better do everything I tell you, or the gig is off' partners in crime is well depicted, but, that is about it as far as this film is concerned.There is no character development here, the story sucks and I bet DeNiro would probably want to forget about this film and pull it from the shelves if he could ....What a dog .. save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I pay to see this in a theater?","review":"I saw this movie with a friend, both of us having the expectation of a suspenseful movie.

The plot is a mild variation from the genre. The only thing that keeps this from being a standard B movie is the cast and a few (very few) nice lines of dialog.One of the big disappointments in the movie is that we never get to know the characters. We know absolutely nothing about Norton's character, slightly more about DeNiro's and a little more about Brando's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Score","review":"The movie starts a some what slow but moves into high gear.

Loved Montreal, but it did not make up for lean and lacking script and clear characters. Norton was on the fringe (wasted) and Marlon (huge and lisping-looking healthy, though) seemed to be wasted here. De Niro is as usual busy and masterful but I found I was easily distracted and not paying great attention to this movie.Was there a script or did Oz depend on actors to carry the dialogue and story along? VERY DISAPPOINTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Generations of Top Acting Talent Wasted","review":"Yes, this film shows the A list actors of the '50s, '70s and '90s in a totally predictible, flat caper film. DeNiro is the main thief who works in association with Brando and is aided by Norton. Norton does do an astonishing acting job portraying a retarded man, at his job in the customs house as a janitor, so that he can scope out the scene of his crime. When he's not at work, he is \\"normal\\" and the character trait difference is extreme. In fact, maybe this film had an overload of talent and should have just used Norton in this role as a solitary thief, especially since DeNiro and Brando don't get a chance to show off their similar range of ability. A huge disappointment for me since I normally love Brando and DeNiro in anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK movie; average script; poor ending","review":"This movie reminded me (because of the way it was wrapped up) of \\"Boiler Room,\\" that movie that contained less than 10 minutes of really good acting (Ben Affleck's cameos), with an OK script, but a lousy ending! Same here... When it was over my wife and I looked at each other like \\"What on earth happened here? Is that all?\\" The plot, pretty basic: De Niro is Nick: he steals expensive jewels and collectibles for a living and is faced with a very large coup, his last one, where he's joined by Edward Norton (Jack). It's SO predictable that Jack is going to try to set Nick up, that I don't mind saying it here! Plus, Marlon Brando's part is more than secondary: in fact, you could almost do away with it altogether... Don't know: the more I think about the movie, the less stars I feel like giving it. At least I didn't pay [money] for two movie tickets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FROM OVERSTOCK_DEALS","review":"The DVD I ordered, The Score, was not in the sealed package.

There is no recourse with the seller as too much time has passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sccore wins","review":"The score is a fast paced thriller that will keep you guessing from start to finish. Robert De Nero is the consummate heist man ready for the 'last job.' Marlon Brando does what only Brando can do. He is brilliant on the weakling colleague who needs a big score or lose his life because of an extravagant life style. Ed Norton is the brash young turk who thinks he can out smart anybody. Well think again Ed. The movie has as many twitches and turn has you can handle and then adds one more for the kicker. Outstanding movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Is A Compliment","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Predictable","review":"You have to wonder how Hollywood is greenlighting screenplays these days. This formulaic, predictable and utterly unimaginative heist-flick has only one redeeming quality - its cast. But sadly, the absence of a quality script is highlighted by the fact that the cast is so good, since you can't help but notice that they have absolutely nothing to work with. The twist at the end is such a lame payoff that a high schooler could have thought of it, and the audience is left thinking...that's it? Is that what I waited 2 hours for? All in all, if it's on TV it's ok as background noise, other than that, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet the expectations","review":"When you have a cast of Edward Norton, Robert Dinero and Marlin Brando you expect a great hit. Unfortunalty this wasn't it.The acting obviously was great. All three lived up to there abilities, the plot however was too straight and plain. I kept waiting for the twist that would make the movie but it never came. It is really an unfortunate dissapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of a Brilliant Cast","review":"I saw this movie because of the dazzling cast only to find out they were wasted on a luke-warm script and a less than dazzling heist. Everyone seemed to be walking through there parts, with the possible exception of Edward Norton. Though it has immense potential, the result is annoyingly flat. If you want to see Edward Norton preform in a movie you'll actually enjoy, try Fight Club, American History X, or Primal Fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is great - movie is too long","review":"Ok, my impression is that this movie should be shorter. After some time you can predict it. There is no movement.But what a great jazz music they use: Casandra Wilson, T. Monk, Conanball Aderley, Diana Krall. I think I watched to the end of the movie just to lissten to this music. Good test Mr Oz, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't play the game if you ain't gonna score...","review":"...in this case, as an entertaining film & story. This project misses the mark big time. I agree with others that wrote about the film having an unfinished feel to it. I'm a fan of DeNiro but he was definitely on lithium throughout production. Norton is the highlight, but doesn't [take]the show because there isn't one. You get the feeling you're watching the \\"dailies\\". Frank Oz should stick to light-hearted comedies.Elegant Angela Basset is wasted in the three measly unimportant scenes she's in (obviously a DeNiro cast choice since everyone knows he's always preferred black women).Two stars for both of Norton's characters. Basset should go back to finding her career groove, and if this is the type of character DeNiro is comfortable in playing, he is quickly joining Jack Nicholson in simply not trying anymore.It's pretty much a \\"[copy]\\" of the great Michael Mann film \\"Thief\\". I dare you to watch that and see the blatant comparisons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, predictable, tired score - see Thief instead","review":"Total waste of talent. DeNiro looks tired through the whole movie. A jewel thief for 25 years, he still has debts to pay and needs one last score to allow him to retire.The Howard Shore musical score is unbeleivably boring and contributes to the movie dragging.Get Thief with James Caan and a dynamite Tangerine Dream score to see how its suppossed to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scores only slightly more than the Detroit Lions","review":"A great waste of Deniro and Ed Norton.

I called Invicta's Customer Service and after 3 days and leaving 5 messages with no response, I sent the watch back vowing nevert to buy Invicta again.I broke my vow and bought Invicta's Pro-Diver, the watch that supposedly \\"put Invicta on the map.\\" The Tritnite is the only impressive thing about the watch. The besel does not turn without special tools, so it is useless as a Diver Watch. The crown wiggles which makes it difficult to screw it down properly. The pins are hard to get at so forget about swapping out the 2 rubber bands that come with the watch.Don't go out of your way to buy Invicta.

I am a little critical because I tend to compare it to my Omega Seamaster that cost many times more and my Seiko Diver that cost twice as much. First I don't like the magnifier over the date. You need to position it just right to see. I do like this package that comes with the rubber band. It looks great and I can keep the metal band for dressier occasions.

Christian Lindberg is an extraordinary Trombonist! This CD truly shows off his strikingly pure tone and magnificent musicianship. I highly recommend this CD! It's simply amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very decent project","review":"Some lovely playing here. Lindberg and Pontinen read each other nicely and achieve a blend of tones that comes across as toffied and seamless. However, BIS is a little too proud of its \\"dynamic recording\\" and that means showing off dynamic range even when it's not so wonderful. Triple forte in a concert hall is one thing, but on a recording at home, minus the hall's ability to handle reverb at that level, it can bear a striking resemblance to traffic noise at Hollywood and Highland (on Tchaikovsky, no less). That said, it's still a fine recording. Just set it a little quieter than your normal level and you'll be fine. Okunev is a sweet find and I imagine I'm not the only one who will wonder what else he's done. Ewald is always a treat. The Denisov is the \\"de rigueur wtf piece\\" on an arty recording (no doubt fun to play, but only mommy applauds). The Prokofiev is appropriately spunky and, unlike with Tchaik, spots of brashness are welcome, invigorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korea in Our Living Room","review":"This series is wonderful, especially for children. The film on Korea showcases two children, a girl and a boy who live in different settings in South Korea. I bought this video for my adopted daughter who is of Korean descent. Many pertinent facts about the country are imbedded in the narratives, which are done by English speaking children. The film might be a little dated because it was made in 2001, but it is perfect for exposing my child to her Korean roots and the way life was there near the time of her birth. Our family now has three of the Families of the World series and I plan to obtain additional titles to broaden my children's sociological awareness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor material quality","review":"These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs.

It neither has one coherent style throughout the book, nor does it give accurate representation to all styles available. It tries to represent many different styles, but in the most generic way possible. There is the occasional nice picture, but not enough of them to justify buying the book. Most of the furniture is overstuffed and there are lots of florals. Now I like florals and include them in my decorating schemes. However, there is a point at which you just have to say no.

Nor is a heaven-like ecstasy always conveyed by speed (think of Bach's slow choruses). Of the several \\"Sonneries\\" in my collection, this is the only one I can hear any number of times without diminishing the effect. The recorded sound is superb, with an \\"in the room\\" presence. Altogether a truly fine disc to treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear.....","review":"On the face of it i would say it is pretty bad.

Good luck to negaholics ! If you're just a bit negative on occasional basis and suspect that you're a negaholic, don't waste your time.

I was getting so tired of rubbing stain remover on my girls clothes- (mostly neck and legs, where they dropped their food) This is the perfect solution- it saves me time and sanity- I don't have to worry about staining their clothes. I wish I had gotten this sooner!One recommendation-- the elastic on neck and cuffs absorbs water, so make sure that after you wipe the smocks down, you should squeeze out any excess water in these areas so that it will dry out for the next feeding. (otherwise it will stay wet and get stinky)Also, for smaller babies, the neck opening is still somewhat loose. So it's helpful to put a cloth bib underneath the smock to catch any liquids or pureed foods that might run down the neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for Art than for Eating!","review":"I bought this to use as a giant bib since my boy is a very active eater who always seems to get the undersides of his arms covered with food. This happens when he twists and turns in his chair and reaches for food, drink, etc.,. The smock provides great coverage but it could benefit from a pocket along the bottom and it could be much easier to clean. I have other \\"safe\\" plastic/vinly type bibs that are much easier to clean so I hardly use this one. I would not recommend it for a messy eater or even a mildly messy eater as it does not clean or dry quickly, especially for the price. Also, the color is not very well defined so food can get under it fairly easily, a wider border would be helpful.

Nothing is really memorable here..It's all about hype, hystrionics,poor taste ( and the front-cover picture shows it all )....as always...as seen on trash TV ,where Celine, Mariah and Patti herself ( who never knew what 'understatement' is all about) are the ubiquitous,undisputed theatrical Queens of ....pop music melodrama !I really don't understand why they let this old lady keep releasing EVERY YEAR a new album with no insight and substance.Listen,you'd better skip it and buy Regina Belle's refreshing and soulful 'Reachin' Back' or her latest sumptuous offering 'Lazy Afternoon'.Trust me !"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY WONDERFUL","review":"I am truly star-stuck by this masterpiece. I am a life long fan of Ms. LaBelle - I still have the older stuff on LP - and this, truly, is her at her best. The selection of music, the arrangements, and her fabulous VOICE are all phenomenal. This is the best CD I have purchased in a very long time...I had to actually go back and buy a second copy- one for home and one for the car!Ms. LaBelle does each of the songs extreme (I mean true and extreme) justice. Some \\"remakes\\" leave one with a really funny taste in the mouth but THIS is so well produced and executed that I am itchy for more...I hope and pray for a classic moments II so that we can all enjoy the music she was not allowed to share with this album.YOU GO GIRL."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding release","review":"in the CD booklet Ms. Patti thanks Dr. Sugarman for getting her pipes up and running.

This Cd has Patti reaching..and bending and doing everything that most singers could not come close to.I would have loved to have just....patti singing on Ain't No Way. I have heard Patti perform this song before and by herself she out does Aretha.....I would have loved for Patti to do a recording of BLACK PEARL for this album.Land of the Living is one of my favorites on this CD.I hope she tours with this CD and if she does please come to west palm beach, fl.Three great CD's bought in just a few weeks.1.

While it's worked quite well for Queen Latifah, Rod Stewart and Chaka Khan, it fails mserably with this CD. I'm an admirer of Patti, but quite frankly, her voice has not held up so well. More disappointing though is the poor production quality on this CD. The music and background vocals seem lifted from a karaoke disc. Buy a greatest hits CD and try to remember her at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"a diva's sad swansong","review":"I can understand why hardcore Patti LaBelle are rallying behind their star in times of crisis and are writing positive reviews. But this album is musically so bland and uninspired it would put your average Holiday Inn lounge to sleep. And Ms. LaBelle's vocal problems about which she talked so openly in interviews are so obvious that listening to this album becomes really painful. Emotionally and painful on the ears. This should never have been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"Fist off I have to say I loved Patti Labelle--she was truly a legend. However, this cd supports the advice she received from a throat specialist (tv1 interview)who said, \\"you must stop singing.\\" For those who may be wondering why she is only singing in her mid to low register, that is why. The prayer of Diana Ross has finally been answered: Patti has finally lost her voice. Celine Dion once rested her voice (no speaking or singing) for three weeks and was able to restore her voice. I don't know the extent of Ms. Labelle's vocal damage(she told a sound engineer who suggested she wait a couple of weeks to overcome \\"hoarseness\\" that \\"its not going to get better\\") but she should at least consider a rest, if not for herself, let me stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"very Average","review":"Patti Labelle is a very Talented singer,but She usually gets the short end of the Musical Stick when it comes Album projects.alot of this Album she is Oversinging&the Material doesn't match her Intensity at all on a whole.this is another in a long line of just Ok Patti Labelle Albums.She makes tight Singles but never gets a Album that captures Her range&Depth fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of her best","review":"Patti takes some of my favorite tunes over the years, and does them in her own way,making them sound even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This recording is just ok.

I must say this is a great cd...I can't stop playing it. Patti Labelle takes these songs and makes them all her own. Her voice is still in top form after all of these years. The songs that struck me most are:Didn't I Blow Your Mind This TimeI Keep Forgetting: Patti does Michael McDonald a big favor with this remake! (In my opinion)Love BalladYour Song featuring Elton JohnI'll Write A Song For You: Only a true vocalist could have pulled off this EWF classic...Silly: I think Patti sings this in a lower key than the original...she still sounds great though.I'll Stand By You: I've never heard this song before Patti...she made me cry with this one...Land of the LivingPatti Labelle is truly a class act and this cd is definitely worth a listen...well a whole bunch of listens!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing!!!!","review":"I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but \\"ain't no way\\" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't \\"make\\" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT! BUY IT!!!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Picked this CD cause it was Patti.....could not get out of the car once it started playing!!! She is the only DIVA! Her band and back up singers are great!

Play Love Don't Here Anymore over and over....u can't help but groove on that cut....BUY THIS CD OR U ARE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who better to redo a CLASSIC than a true classic herself!!!","review":"Every singer wants to put his/her singular stamp on a song associated with another. And who better to do than the divine Patti Labelle, one of music's premier songstresses.This 14-set collection of covers is nothing short of a masterpiece, with Labelle in perfect form as she assays songs formerly performed by Aretha (\\"Ain't No Way\\"), Michael (\\"He's Out of My Life,\\" altered to fit Patti's gender), Deniece Williams (\\"Silly\\"), Michael McDonald (\\"I Keep Forgetting\\"), Elton John (\\"Your Song\\"), LTD (\\"Love Ballad\\") and The Delfonics (\\"Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time\\").Changing very little with the instrumentation, background vocals, and rhythm tracks, the singer gets to put her trademark vocals on each of the familiar songs.If the singer loses a star, it's for the dress she sports on the cover.\\"Scarlett O'Hara\\" looked better in the curtain creation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She has tried....her best !","review":"She has tried her best and I admire her for the effort.She sings with her heart , but ...I like some of her old stuff.If you like her , you should listen to another great Lady who is the only one who can match her nowadays , Regina Belle.Try her latest release,\\"Lazy Afternoon\\",and then let me know :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Patti Belts it out of the Ballpark","review":"On this cover of well-known favorites, Miss Patti demonstrates the unique style and range that have made her a music mainstay for nearly half a century. Stand-outs include a duet with Elton John on \\"Your Song\\" and a rousing rendition of The Pretenders' \\"I'll Stand by You.\\" In a time when music performers are empty shells produced by the music marketing machine, it's refreshing to hear the pipes of a true talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best hairspray, especially for fine hair!","review":"I have fine, straight hair; I've tried soooo many brands of hairspray but they weigh down my hair and make it look darker and lifeless. Aquage water-based products work great for me! I've been using the finishing spray for at least 10 years; the mousse is great too! The finishing spray gives my hair body that holds all day long, even on humid days. It's not stiff and sticky; I can run my fingers through my hair. For me it's worth the price. There are no salons near where I live that sell Aquage products so I have to order it online....thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best hair spray ever!!","review":"My beautician started using this on me and I have very hard to control hair. I do get perms but at the end of three months, it was a hassle. I like my hair a little looser and natural and the only way I can do this is to use Aquage transforming spray. You can only get it through a beauty shop and they charge from #18.00 to $20.00 per can!!

It focuses on both permant migration as well as temproary migration. Sowell shows how their culture has affected what type of job these groups have gone into and how they have faired in comparision to their native populations. It shows how native populations differ in how they treat the migrants like the differenced in the treatment of the Jews. It also shows how native populations can start a backlash against the new ethnic groups like Jews in various countries, Chinese in Southeast Asia, Indians in east Africa and Germans in Russia and eastern Europe.Overall, the book tries makes connections between how cultures affects its inhabitants even as the move to new lands and how it affects the descendants of those people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"After using these sheets as a back up set (when my regulars are in the wash)for the past few years, they have literally disintegrated.

Not even single star rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and obvious","review":"I found this an extremely dull and stilted story with no sense of humour or appreciation of a child's wit at all. It read like a school book with its clinical political correctness. If you're looking for a picture book about divorce for young kids I would recommend a book like Babette Cole's The Un-Wedding (also published as \\"Two of Everything\\") or Emily Haughton's Rainy Day. Cole's book is full of humour and yet deals with serious issues - my 4 y.o. wanted me to read it for her again and again in the months after the separation. Haughton's book is more dreamy and has a double meaning that appeals more to me than to my 4 y.o. but has a far higher quality than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So depressing!!!","review":"I guess the point of this book was to get kids to identify with the lead character, know that their feelings around divorce are not unique, and help them to discuss how they are feeling. While it may succeed in those aims (if those were the aims), it manages to paint a rather bleak and depressing picture, and just made our family feel sad with very little positive to focus on. To give you an idea, the final words of the book are: \\"My mommy and my daddy love me too. Just not together.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Solicitation of a minor!!!","review":"For anyone reading these reviews please be aware of what kind of a person this author is.My 7 year old daughter flew by herself for the first time from her biological fathers summer visit. The author of this book was apparently sitting next to her. When my daughter arrived at the airport she informed me that this women discussed her situation with her. We discovered her card for family therapy in my daughter's backpack with this book written on the back. What kind of a person tries to get business this way. My daughter informed her that she could not accept anything from strangers (as she is supposed to). The author told her it was ok because of who she was. These actions put a very sick feeling in my stomach.This author is equivalent to an ambulance chasing attorney. I am not saying \\"don't by the book\\" , I have not read it and I will not.

It was action packed, sad, surprising, and so much more. Out of all the books that I have read it would have to be on my top ten books, because I really like how the beginning of this book starts with just one lonely bat trying to find some food in the middle of the night. This book wanted me to read more from the very first page. I would love to read to sequel to this book called Sunwing. This book really caught my attention just from the cover.

I thought it was amazing how 2 bats,Shade and Marina,Silverwing with Brightwing teamed up to make the long journey to Hibernaculum.

This is also a wonderful read aloud book for younger students. Next time I see a bat, i'll certainly have a different percpective and sense of appreciation.

The instruction is not filmed well and sadly the male instructor doesn't cover the moves particularly well. Additionally,if you are a woman hoping to use this set, don't even try. The woman in the videos simply smiles her way through each lesson, never saying a word and there is no passion or flair in the very limited full shines.

It is based in the world Brust created for his Taltos series, albeit about 1000 years prior. For those who appreciate a good deal of humor along with the Dumas style, and exciting swordplay, this book has the typical Brust quality characters and dialogue.I highly recommend it for anyone who ever loved the French classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I think Brust is a charming and subtle writer (a rare quality in sci-fi). Unfortunately, this book is really not that interesting. It lacks the emotional depth and complex plotting of the Vlad Taltos books, settling for basically flat characters and an uninvolving march through an uneventful plot. The humor, while present, is pretty thin, and lacks the edge of his other work. Read his other books"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I'd wanted to read Dumas, I'd have read Dumas","review":"I had to put the book down after a couple of chapters. Some people are saying \\"homage\\", I think a more appropriate word is plagarism. I think the idea of a 'novel' is that it should be new.

I laugh when I read that Brust is a genius at dialog? I guess the characters just talk weird on his world but really thats what made me hate the book.It was so frustrating to read I didn't finish it. I later read that he was making an ode to three musketeers. It doesn't change the fact that it makes it hard to read.He does do a good job describing action, and in fact I loved his descriptive abilities and world building but his characters speak like they have mental illness!

I love reading, read a book a week and can safely say I have never read something so pretentious. I couldn't make it past 40 pages (made me break my 'give a book 50 pages' rule). Imagine a stuffy old college English professor, someone who loves nothing more than the sound of his own voice, then imagine said professor writing an epic Fantasy and that is what you have here. The narration reads like bad stage directions to the reader. Seriously, how in god's name did the editor sign off on this narrative voice??? \\"Hey, I have an idea, write in a narrative style that is as slow and dry as possible with plenty of invisible wall references to the story, our story so far, the reader, readers of the story, etc. etc.\\"I literally threw this book across the room.

This book is a sterling example of such fantasy. There is worldbuilding and tension aplenty, but it is Stephen K. Brust's marvelous adaptation of the Dumas/Sabatini style - and his lovely comedic touch that make this book - so much so that it is one of my top 3 fantasy books, and I am a convinced fan of the epic variety.

The content was just too much too fast. And WAY too much algebra. Good luck with the exercizes, they're *impossible* (Check out page 30, problem #5, I was like \\"What is he Talking about?!\\"), and it got worse from there. By the time I got to chapter 6 I got so lost that I completely \\"zoned out\\" of this book and never picked it up again. I wish I could return it, but it is a nice book to rest my coffee cups on.I really thought that this made zero effort at humor or easy learning, or even plain english (like it said it would in chapter 1).The best book for newbies (with the worst title) is \\"C for Dummies\\" by Dan Gookin (Check out the reviews here on Amazon.com). C for Dummies holds your hand every step of the way and makes it easy and fun to learn advanced topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better or luckier than this!","review":"I had the unsual opportunity and privilege to learn C from this book and directly taught by the author himself. K.N.King has mastered not only the art of C programming but also the art of communicating his knowledge of the subject even to the least common experienced programmer(believe me, I have first hand experience with the author. and Boy I do miss all those office hours!) The book is internationally appealing(It is used in many countries by programmers of all levels) It really stands head and shoulder above the rest of all of them. It's unique in its spiral approach to the subject.It also does a pretty good job of shutting out all the critics who claim that you can't be a big shot C programmer right out of college. Not if you read this book from cover to cover and stop complaining about page 30 exercise #5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"I am a programmer by hobby who has browsed and read quite a number of books on C. Without a doubt this is the best book available for learning C. I might add that the general consensus in the programming community seems to be the same, many people holding this book in nearly the same regard as K&R (the \\"bible\\" of C). Having read both K&R and this book, I concluded rather easily that King's presentation is more practical and engaging. K&R is wonderful too, but if I were a programmer looking to learn C, King is by far the best choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This book claims that it caters for beginners. I don't think so! It's only of any good to those that are already familiar with programming or another programming language. The language used is arcane at times that only people with previous programming knowledge would understand and benefit from this book. Its exercises are also pointless since there are no answers given. I recommend C by example for beginners which assumes nothing.

The statistical background of the author should be very weak.

Did Dr. Ron Sederoff who wrote the foreword read the book thoroughly? If so, he should have pointed out those very obvious errors. Of course, Dr. Sederoff should not be responsible for those errors if he has no background in Statistics. I hope the author can check the book thoroughly before it goes to the fourth printing or just withdraw it from the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intermediate text for the teacher/real student","review":"The buyer should realize that this is an intermediate text, not a beginner text. Everything is in Spanish--combining the user's already established skills with the development of further skills. Reasoning is a necessary component of learning a language and this book requires that the student think, rather than translate and fill in the blank. If you really want to learn Spanish, this is a great text with thorough explanations. For the teacher, there are good, open-ended activities to use in class and the text is diverse enough to pick and choose and to work on all language skill areas. Vocabulary is well integrated and practical. There is a 4th addition with more culture, etc. The weakness, at least of the 3rd edition, is the lack of an index. If you are just trying to earn your required credits or take a weekend trip to Mexico, this is NOT the ideal book; if you are in the process of really learning the language, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"This has got to be the worst textbook I have ever had.

John Cleese as the narrator is the only star,but everyone sounds just as they should.A couple of the songs are a bit cute and sugary to an adult ear, but none arepainful, and some are quite funny.I even enjoyed the lack of a real plot.

We've seen some fabulous Pooh adventures in the past but this was pitiful. For very young watchers who only know the one dimension Pooh of the Disney channel, this will be entertaining. But if you expect this to hold the attention of all ages like some of the others, don't waste your money. Just when I thought I might get into it, it was over.

The star of the obnoxioussong \\"The Backson\\" makes an appearance at the film's end in a somewhat funny manner. Sure therewasn't much of a plot to the movie, but there was enough action and interaction between charactersto entertain my 5 year old.

Now we have seen this movie (Pooh 2011) probably close to 100 times now and we never tire of it. The voices are fresh with new actors taking over the roles. The storyline is based on Milne's original work (unlike the more recent Pooh incarnations). Someone negatively commented that the characters have been changed. I would agree to that to a point, but I think they've been changed for the better...more updated. This movie has enough great music (Zooey Deschanel)and action for our little one, but enough inside jokes for Hubby and I to enjoy this for another 100 viewings! All in all a great movie!

Before I had my timers set up correctly the lamp worked just as advertised. All the lights went out and the dome would glow. Toothless would look at the glow just as she is on her way to bed.The reason it isn't all that great for me is that I am using an Exo Terra Electronic Dimming Terrarium Lamp Controller, 2 x 40 Watts cCSAus (I tried adding a link but it didn't work) and I have my basking lamp shut off 20 min before my lights.

It was here, while waiting for my brother, that I started this story, although, of course, at the time I did not know that stories of life are often more like rivers than books. But I knew a story had begun, perhaps long ago near the sound of water.

You probably couldn't present a comprehensive sales training course without mentioning Schiffman, who's been a high-profile sales training leader for more than 20 years. Although his advice is as sound as ever, this book has an episodic structure that seems jumpy. However, the book is written for busy sales professionals, and Schiffman's first rule of sales is to know your audience. Sales executives and business travelers will find this an easy, useful read.

It changed the characters and the characterization in the book is what made it so enthralling. Physically, the movie takes the two-dimensional words from the book and makes them three-dimensional by putting them on-screen; metaphorically, the book is three-dimensional while the screen version of the story lacks such depth that I would feel generous in calling it even two-dimensional. I reiterate: if you've read the book, I cannot imagine you enjoying this movie; if you have not read the book, buy it and enjoy the Mists of Avalon not the movie that stole its name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendously disappointing","review":"I was glad to hear that someone was making a miniseries of this, and Juliana Margulies seemed like an excellent choice for Morgaine. Unfortunately, the finished production did not live up to expectations. The book dealt not only with the legend through the eyes of women, but with the clash of cultures. The movie paid lip service to this theme, but didn't really grapple with adequately. I don't think I watched it all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing!","review":"How a director can take a very good fantasy novel, assemble a superb cast and dumb the production down to the level of the worst WB fantasy programs is beyond me. From the script to the costumes to the poor use of the sets, I was completely embarrassed to be watching this! What a waste! Now I understand why Angelica Houston never really plugged the movie in her interviews, but instead talked about how much her friends loved the book! It really is that bad. Hopefully someone else will undertake this again -- someone who's actually read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time","review":"If you have read Zimmer's book do not rent, buy or even think about watching this movie. While Angelica Houston and Julianna are two of my favorite actresses, the costumes and sets were beautiful, and the soundtrack was well used, these factors do not make up for the absolute butchery that the producers performed on the Mists of Avalon story.Huge parts of the plot were left out (i.e, Morgaine's visit to the fairy land, I mean, she is called Morgaine of the Fairies). These deficiencies were not made up for in any way. The acting seemed forced and obviously fake at times and I was just confused at times.Then, to make matters worse, the DVD has no explanation whatsoever of why the producers chose this version, or chose to portray the Aurthurian legend in this way.Very, very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good","review":"This movie was VERY well done- a great movie all in all- although having read the book it is a little disappointing in that some very key parts are left out. To make \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" into a movie and to really DO it right would have taken a lot more time, and the movie would have been about twice, maybe three times as long. So as it is and for what it is, I give it thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"I loved the book, and I thought a minseries based on it could really bring it to life. Obviously, a 3 hour movie based on a 1000 page book is going to have to cut out some parts. However, when I was watching the movie, I kept waiting for any scene that resembled the book, and there were only a few moments that did. Some of the major plot points made it in, but that is it. Everything else is different. For instance, early in the book two characters die. In the movie, one of them is still alive at the end, and the other dies in a bizarre double-murder scene at the very end.If you have not read the book, you might like the movie. If you have read the book, you will hate the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the complexity?","review":"i felt that this version of \\"mists of avalon,\\" one of my favorite books, lacked so much of the complexity that the original text held. the book was very careful to blur the line between good and evil, yet the movie ignored that concept entirely, clearly labeling the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys.\\" i felt that the miniseries only scratched the surface of the plot, leaving out many deeper aspects of the story. if you have any respect for the book, i do not reccoment this. however, if you are looking for a simple fantasy story, then go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the book, don't watch the movie","review":"How excited I was to learn that one of my favorite books was being turned into a movie! And with such talented actors! Then I watched it - and my temper flared. It is one thing to edit a book to make it into a movie, but it is another thing to butcher it. In their attempt to cram the whole novel into a three hour mini-series (4 hours with commericials), the audience is left confused by rushed events and unexplained plots. It would have been better to make it a longer mini-series or feature film so that the true story could be told and that the actors could shine even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing adaption of the novel","review":"Having loved Mists of Avalon since it was first published, I was interested to watch the TV adaption of the novel. Sadly, I found it to be a disappointing adaption, from the wrong ages of characters (Morgause was about 14 in the beginning of the story she can't possibly be played by a woman almost 50!!!) to tacky looking sets. I kept wondering if I was watching the same basic story.Perhaps had I not read the novel, I would have enjoyed it more, but I would not recommend it to those who were hoping for an adaption more aligned with Zimmer Bradley's original work.On the plus side, I did think that Julianna Margulies was an excellent choice for Morgaine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the book, but still a success","review":"For those who have read the book, this movie may be a disappointment in that it does not follow Bradley's story uniformly. However, the movie is enjoyable and informative in its own right and is a nice tribute to the works of Marion Zimmer Bradley. For those who enjoy the movie, the book comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"On it's own, I think it would be a decent movie. However, for people like myself who have read and adored the book, it was a horrible disappointment. It skipped almost everything that is wonderful about the book. At times I found myself wondering if the filmmakers had even read the book. =/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time...read the book!","review":"This DVD in no way conveys the magic or messages of the book. It is as if, in preparation for filming, the individuals responsible for the movie read a synopsis of the book instead of the actual work. Then, to add further insult to injury, they could not have possibly understood what they read. The magic and wisdom that Marion Zimmer Bradley's characters convey throught the novel could not possibly be put into film. However, this attempt even failed at grasping the commonly known Authurian plot (despite Bradley's unique and thoughtful twists). My advice is to read the book and forgo the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the book!!!","review":"I should know by now that the movie verisions of my favorite books are typically a sorry disappointment --This is no exception. While I was pleasantly surprised at the Julianna Margulies' portrail of Morgaine (an actress I typically find forgetable); the actors for Lancelot, Guenevere, Aurthur and even Igraine were FAR from the rich, well-developed characters that I loved with, cried for and genuinely cared about in the novel. The adaptation took liberties in areas that were not necessary even within the time constrates of film - such as the variation on the character of Morgause and the exit of Viviane's character.If you think the movie sounds interesting- BUY THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Hadn't Bothered","review":"I generally like Marion Zimmer Bradely's books, so I thought a movie based on a book of hers couldn't be too bad. Now I wish I'd just spent the time to read the book and skipped the movie. While watching the movie, I was simply left with the impression of grief, jealous, and basically a lot of hurting people. Though who were manipulated (oh, poor victim me! pity me!) go through the movie setting themselves up for falling again...and again. Those who do the manipulations either feel bad they didn't get what they wanted or feel bad about what they did, but still feel justified (despite it all failing). There is no true hope offered in this movie and only cold comfort if any. I didn't watch the movie to get depressed, but this one sure tried!While the movie obviously wanted you to think that paganism and Catholic Christianity are basically the same, I will note that the one sister who became a nun found forgiveness, but the others never stopped hurting until the day they died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Female version of Excaliber!","review":"Saw it on TNT awhile back.

This movie sucks!!!","review":"If you love the book or waited to watch this until after you read th final chapter, this movie will be a big, huge diappointment. I rented it based on reviews found here. Within the first 5 to 10 minutes it breaks from the book. To me it seemed that the only thing that they kept from the book were names and places. The dialog and backgroung were made up!I don'trecommend watching this unless you plan to do so before you read the book. Then you can (maybe) enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful & Dissapointing","review":"I have read the book so many countless times and loved it that I got my hopes up when I heard about the made-for-tv-movie. There are just too many things that were not true to the story it was so so dissapointing. Igraine dies in the book, not a convent and ugh! I could just scream. Maybe its because TNT did it and it just couldn't give the full oohmph that a bigger studio could have, but mostly its just that the book was just a powerful twist on the Aurthurian Legend and the movie just reduces Bradley's beauty to drivel. If she had been alive right now she would've died.I gave it two stars becuase I liked the casting of Juliana Margulies as Morgaine. Even though she wasn't given very much to work with for character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the book, don't watch this movie...","review":"I have read the book so many times, and was so excited when I heard it was being made into a movie. I was also excited about the cast, which was excellent. I couldn't even get through the whole movie - I had to shut off the TV. The Mists of Avalon is a long book - and cuts certainly had to be made - but the movie also cut all of the soul out of the story, and turned it into such a comical shadow of the original. I'm not just a stubborn fan who doesn't want anything changed. This is simply a bad movie.If you are at all passionate about the book, you will be downright angry by this interpretation of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding story, outstanding DVD","review":"This is one of the best movies about the King Arthur era I have seen.

When the combined talents of Angelica Huston, Joan Allen and Julianna Margulies can't save the film, you've got a real stinker on your hands. Granted that filming the book in anything close to its entirity would've made for a far longer series, there are just some things that if you can't bother to do right, you're better off not beginning--read the book if you want the magic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An incestuous, podding mess","review":"It's incest all the way down, folks, and it's nauseating to the core. Good people are manipulated in ways which turn your stomach; not for family viewing. Of course, the Celtic goddess is \\"real\\" and the Christian God (and his followers) are trash, in this movie, with the usual stereotypes.Not to say the worshipers of the goddess come off any better, what with their prediliction for causing in-family breeding abominations and such, but at least the goddess answers sometimes. It's all about the women in this turgid feminist fantasy.The casting of Lancelot and some other characters - or maybe it's just their costuming and hair - is just terrible and forgettable. The pace is plodding and agonizing. At the end, we're just glad Avalon is finished and done with - at least this version of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and pitiful attempt at the real thing","review":"This movie is just a poor representation of the marvelous tales and legends of King Arthur. Not just that, but Quinevere was turned into nothing more than a woman with very few morals. Orgy's run amuck throughout this movie, actually, there's very little here except for the orgy's on the Midsummer night party where especially King Arthur decides he wants Quinevere to sleep with him and Lancelot at the same time. Just because he was afraid it was his fault that the Queen couldn't have children.So. I wouldn't say having the Queen sleep with your best Knight was the way to go. Especially as Quinevere was allegedly supposed to have been burned at the stake for the accusations thrown at her for sleeping with Lancelot. Its horrible the way history will be distorted all for hearthrobs.I could go on and on, but I think its safe to say I've said enough as far as my opinion on this movie goes.Time spent here could be better invested elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mists of Avalon - same ole","review":"Really thought there would be more to this movie, nothing wrong with it in general. Perhaps this type has just been done to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mists of Time","review":"This movie is based on a book, but I haven't read it yet so I can't comment on the differences between them, but I felt the movie was pretty good. Originally a TV mini-series on TNT when watched without commercials holds your attention fairly well. It tells the story of King Arthur from a woman's perspective. And not only that put tells it from a pagan woman's perspective. Something not often done.The acting here was pretty ok. It wasn't anything outstanding, but it wasn't horrible either. The plot of the story can kind of get you confused if you don't really know the story of Arthur that well, and there are some who don't. The costumes are a bit...out there are some points, but this movie isn't trying to be historical, but more of a fantasy with a semi-historical setting.It's a fun movie to watch though. It does have pagan themes, but don't look to it to be anything instructional. It's there to inhance the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wandering in the Mists - the writers got lost","review":"I hope Marion Zimmer Bradley made good coin for the rights to her amazing book, because the movie stinks. The costumes are great, the music is great, the acting is ok, but the adaptation is horrible. Morgaine is entirely changed in her focus and drive, which spoils the whole story. Your time and money would be much better spent on the book - It is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible misrepresentation","review":"Too rich and complicated of a story to be presented on screen, I did not expect to be impressed with this release.

Poor casting, over simpified characters, and the removal of key events and players. Worse of all, the ending. The screenplay was insulting to pagans and christians to boot.If you've never read it, do yourself a favor. Don't buy this tripe, save your money and buy the book instead. You'll like it much more, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sham, a mockery and a debical...","review":"This movie was annoying at best. It hardly followed the plot of the book at all and even made up events (gratuitous fight scenes etc.), perhaps to add a little masculine 'punch' to this feminist classic. If you fully appreicated the depth of the original book you will be sorley disapointed with this poorley acted, and even worse directed film. Maybe one day artisitc justice will be done, though without Conan as the main plot contender I imagine it will be a long time before Hollywood and the rest of those money making grubers turn their attention this direction again. Don't waste your time and if you must, rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This was a horrible adaptation of a fabulous book. I fear that those who buy the DVD will either be fooled that it represents the story or they will be so turned off... did I mention it was terrible... that they will not read the book. Don't buy this.. don't rent it... read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Moving Shakespearean Epic","review":"I was expecting this movie to be a boring drama, but instead the story was changing in a big way constantly, and did not dwell on over-emotional reactions. Although strong and irrational feelings are very much a part of this movie, they are shown quickly and as part of the plot. The one thing that I didn't like about this movie was the odd pagan culture of Avalon, which could be a bit over-dramatic and silly at times. Another strange quirk about the story is that there is always a special reason that forces the characters to make love, which seems a bit too fanciful but makes for an interesting plot that is so enjoyably complicated that I consider it close to Shakespeare in greatness. The acting was superb except for the last bad guy, but no big deal.Overall this is a greater movie than I would have ever expected, and it's good for the entire 3 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A for effort, incredible","review":"Yes, possibly the Celtic sacred things in the film were not authentic, but what do you expect? Incredible, I never heard this story before, but the film had me believing it was a true story of the the Christian religion, that was subsequently the worship of the goddess and druidism. Acting superb throughout, best movie I seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What WAS this?!","review":"I absolutely loved the book! It is so beautifully written and spellbinding, but this movie...what a let down! One is left to wonder if the people responsible for this piece of fodder even read the book. Half of the story was completely changed, important characters omitted, events completely changed and twisted. JUST AWFUL! Had I been given the choice of NO stars that would have been too much. If you enjoyed the movie, give yourself a treat and read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Summary/Introduction to An Excellent Book","review":"I think the titles says it all. At about four hours or so this movie adaptation really is just grazing the top of what is covered in the book. The acting is excellent and everyone does a great job. The cinammetography is really good to. But they really shortened it up, took a lot of important stuff out, and took some liberties...such as Uther didn't build Camelot and Margana Le Fey new that she slept with her brother Arthur the day after the Beltane Fires not like years later. Plus, Guinevere (Gwenwyfar, or something in the book) was as much of a total freaking b*%^^%ch in the movie as in the book. You want her to be killed at the stake or something. MMMMM steak,,,,Anyways, freaking fun and good movie. But read the book and the prequels. Bradley created a wonderful translantion of a classic classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley would be horrified?","review":"Okay first of all I'm quite sure anyone who gave the movie 4 or 5 stars has never read the book. It was the worst film adaptation ever. The only thing i think the screenwriters didn't change were the names of the characters. They made the book seem like it was pro-christianity which is entirely the opposite and changed the greater portion of the plot. They even changed the ENDING!!!!!! now that i think is the absolute worst thing anyone can do to a book. The Mists Of Avalon in book form is quite possibly the most amazing piece of literature ever written and that movie made it seem so silly(i would use a stronger choice of word but hey). I recommend that everyone, especially women and those people who thought the movie was amazing, to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you look at it on its own...","review":"Its a good movie. However, if you watch it thinking you are going to see a dramatized version of Marion Zimmer Bradley's novel then you will be sorely disappointed.I am a huge fan of both book and movie. The movie has good acting, stunning sets and locations, and is over all breath-taking. Its the sort of movie that you just have to watch and not think about its source. If you do, you will surely love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing.","review":"If you didn't read the book you MIGHT be contented with this horribly abridged, watered-down, soap opera version of the story - with its plodding pace, lame-ass Celtic 101 Soundtrack, and the best performances in an uninspired cast delivered by a strangely wooden Julianna with Anjelica obviously phoning it in. Lancelot and Guinevere have absolutely no chemistry, don't seem to even be in love, and the movie's attempts at eroticism are about as hot as a ketchup packet. If you did read the book you'll probably be totally pissed-off about the merciless slashing of the plot that leaves out major themes like the Holy Grail, Kevin, Morgaine's return to Avalon, Accolon's attempt to kill Arthur, etc; as well as softening and glossing over MZB's indictment of Christianity. Thumbs way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for children","review":"there are some seens not suited for children in this movie. i sa the reviews and alomost fell over at how no one tells you that the sister sleeps with her brother and they talk about it through the hole movie, it's not a movie you can skip the bad seen and it still be a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"really enjoyed this movie","review":"I have an advantage here in NOT reading the book - I understand there is a lot more detail in the book -However once the movie started I was not able to put it down and I watched the entire movie in a single sitting !all 186 minutes . The characters were bold and intense - the acting was wonderful -the scenery and photography was wonderful -but over all the story itself I found spellbinding .The depiction of the ancient mother earth religion -just needs to be seen -I recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in ancient legends"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ENOUGH ACTION TO INTRIGUE THE MIND","review":"The movie could have been great if different actors were chosen. The special effects were not that creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mists of Avalon","review":"This film adaptation of the book of the same title starts out promisingly enough, but degenerates quickly into a mess of bland characterizations, boring events, sickly dialogue, unwashed hair and tatooed faces. Battle sequences are brief and not very inspiring, and the legends of Arthur are perversely treated despite a promising premise (the tale as seen through the eyes of its female characters). Arthurian legend is much more entertaining in the likewise made-for-television feature, \\"Merlin,\\" which delivers in all the places that \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avalon lives","review":"The best aspect of this adaptation of Marion Zimmer Bradley's classic book was the casting--nobody could have portrayed the Lady of the Lake better than Anjelica Huston and Julianna Margulies was the perfect Morgaine.I've never read the book (though you can be sure I will now) but this is exactly the way I imagined the legend of Camelot as a child--though I was glad to see Morgaine portrayed in a positive light for once. She really was the backbone of this version.The soundtrack is okay, but one would be better advised to purchase Loreena McKennitt's CD THE VISIT instead--it captures the mood of Avalon and the Mother Goddess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote the movie? Did they read the book?","review":"\\"The Mists of Avalon\\" by Marion Zimmer Bradley was one of the best books I have ever read. Sad to say, whoever wrote the script for the movie was not even close. The movie was horribly depicted and poorly interperted from the book. Unstandably so, the book was about 900 pages, but leaving out 60 percent of the characters and having people do things they never did is just poor script. I was so much looking forward to watching this movie after have finishing the book. Sadly I'm really diappointed. It was just poorly depicted from the book. 2 stars here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book first!! Then watch this mini-series.","review":"I reveived the book for my birthday about a year before this came on TNT, and my friends and I waited in anticipation to watch it. When it was all said and done, the person who set up the story board butchered the story! While the first part is fairly close to the book, the second part was ripped to shreads and clumsily pieced back together leaving huge holes in the story, some of which were necessary to the plot! If you are going to watch this mini-series, read the book first. It is much more enjoyable. On a better note, the costumes and actor choices were great. If only they hadn't messed up the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland on every level","review":"I read the book almost twenty years ago, but barely remember it. I realize this movie was made for TV, but it is so empty. It looks good enough, but it has no soul. Maybe the novel's length confounded the script, which stifled some usually good actors. Made for TV doesn't have to be this bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the book, but still good.","review":"Okay, the movie is not as good as the book, but I still enjoyed it. Granted, it did stray (quite a bit) from the book, and there were changes to the story that weren't needed. Having said that though, there was a lot to be said. The costumes were great, and the acting was belivable, the imagery was also beautiful! My only question, is why they didn't have Kevin in the movie! I would have givin this movie 3.5 stars, but that wasn't an option...so I gave it four stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best film I have ever read","review":"in my view it is awonderful film.

The story really explains the test of faith. I loved how the story brought the beliefs of Pagans and Christians together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie is horrible.

My recommandation is to read the book and forget that the movie exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawing the Mists","review":"This movie was absolutely the antithesis of everything Bradley wrote in her novel. None of the characters were portrayed accurately and none of the events matched completely with those in the book. Haphazard, the movie is more confusing than ever the closer it comes the the end. Everything become Christian and that is not what happens. Read the book - avoid the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of Goddess, don't buy this","review":"I was expecting that some things would get lost in the translation from book to film, but I wasn't expecting them to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Read the book.","review":"The only good thing about this movie--and I'm really grasping at straws here--is that it prompted me to reread the book, which I last read over 10 years ago. The book is a breathtaking masterpiece; the movie is a breathtaking travesty. A 10-hour television miniseries might, just might, have pulled it off. A movie, even a 3-hour one, was doomed from the start to do injustice to the book, but it's even worse than that: the plot has been altered enough that the book is nearly unrecognizable within it except in broadest outline. Poor Marion. She deserved much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tears of Joy, those were TEARS OF HORROR!","review":"There was a reason that they waited until Marion Zimmer Bradley has passed away before they could release this movie. There was also a reason that this movie was released straight to television.This was the WORST REPRESENTATION of a book I have ever had the misfortune to see. Not only did the just casually stray from the original parts, there were moments that that were completely new and in places that never existed in the book at all.It was also insulting to Marion Zimmer Bradley's careful work and passion if you ask me.Please just be contented with the book, and stay as far away from this movie as humanly possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still crying","review":"This movie is just awesome, the picture, the soundtrack, the actors... everything is perfect on this movie, I already saw it thousands times and I never will be tired to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Good cast. Could have stayed closer to the book, but all-in-all a good way to spend your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend","review":"I have always loved the Arthurian legend, this is just another twist. A movie well worth watching, but send the kids to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a half good movie","review":"The first half of the movie was great and followed the book pretty well. Unfortunately I realized that it had only covered about the first quarter of the book. Ted Turner obviously decided to solve the problem by completely changing the ending and thus the entire tone of the movie. If Bradley were alive I'm sure she'd be very disappointed in what was done to her book. The actors were not at fault and did a credible job but the writers should be hung. This should have been at least an eight to twelve part mini series not a three parter. It's a shame someone with a little more intelligence like Peter Jackson hadn't gotten the movie rights instead of Ted Turner. This man produces nothing but pablum. Bradley's book is every bit as great a novel as The Lord of the Rings and it deserved as good a treatment in the movie. That's what happens when an egomaniac decides he knows what's best. Proof positive that money can't buy you brains or good taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The action is good...has a realistic feel to it; not this dancing and prancing around you see in other movies, but real savage hacking -- more like it really was. The sets and scenery are beautiful. The acting is good. But the story is only based on the Arthurian legends...much has been twisted or changed, the most obvious being that it portrays Morgana as the poor girl who is taken advantage of at every turn, though she is in the original (Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur) one of Arthur's main enemies. The story being told from Morgana's perspective would have been a great idea, if she had remained the wicked foe she used to be. It is not really boring, but nevertheless very lacking. I found no moral and nothing inspiring in this rendition of the Arthurian tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible rendition of a classic tale","review":"If the author of the book, Marion Zimmer Bradley, had still been alive when this disaster was made, she would have been furious with what they did to her entertaining story. The producers of this film seemed bent on destroying the best aspects of the book and humiliating Marion Zimmer Bradley. I'm sure at this point she's spinning in her grave.The film veers wildly from the book making it a hollow, uninteresting, gutless version of the book. This miniseries will bore you senseless. There is nothing redeeming about it. Bad acting, bad storyline, boring, and poor special effects.If you really want to see a better Arthurian tale, \\"Excalibur\\" or even \\"First Knight\\" are far better. Please don't waste your time with this pathetic garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me spew blood","review":"So it didn't really make me spew blood. In fact, I barely remember watching this movie six or so years ago when it came out. I will say this, I did enjoy the jolly time popcorn I ate while watching the flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lose Adaptation of the Novel.","review":"I was a big fan of the book but the movie reminded me a cheesey soap opera. I thought the acting was alright but it certainly didn't live up to my expectations. The only real redemption of the film was casting Michael Vartan as the hottie Lancelot! Being a HUGE \\"Alias\\" fan, seeing him was a real treat! In the end, it was mildly entertaining but a huge dissapointment for an avid lover of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"don't waste three hours of your life with this horrid film. go get some paint and watch it dry instead. trust me, it is way more entertaining. this film was just plain bad. if you like a movie filled with crying women filled with feelings of self-pity and delusions of granduer then by all means check this flick out. you won't be disappointed. to everyone else, steer way clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Heartbreak Here!","review":"Hate this movie! I only gave it a star for looks!Must be the dumbest concept I've ever seen! Why in the world Morgraine would even WANT to continue training to become a priestess or care anything about Avalon, Her aunt Vivian,or continue worshipping the Mother Goddess when only terrible things happen to everyone she loves! Really despicable,self-serving priestesses. Never got a single clue of ANYTHING good ever coming from their Mother Goddess worship and what's so special about Avalon anyway? Will never put this in a class with Excalibur! This is a totally perverted, and DEPRESSING version of the King Aurthur Legend, Don't waste your time unless you like DOWNERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved this book, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!","review":"This movie was awful. It takes a magical book and turns it into a mockery. **Book Spoiler Alert** Arthur doesn't even find out he was with Morgaine at Beltane until the end?! Morgaine is thrilled to see her mother?? Morgause put Mordred out to die in the snow but stopped when Morgaine told her that the baby was Arthur's in her fevered sleep?? Julianna Margulies was cast well although her accent was wretched. Gwenhwyfar was cast way too old and the actress was somewhat haggard. Pretty, but not the extremely frail character she was supposed to be. This movie was a mockery and I am ashamed of the author for allowing this to happen. I guess money is what is most important to some people. If I could have given it no stars, I would have.Ugh. I am offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it was...","review":"First I had to take into consideration that this was a tv movie. I truly wish it had been adapted for a real film and think that would have made a positive difference, but you get what you get....That said, I liked it. No, it was no where as great as the book, but any screen adaptation rarely is. The acting was very good and the casting was acceptable, especially Morgaine and Angelica Houston who was amazing in the part...The story jumped a bit too much and lost a lot from that, but I enjoyed it very much, and in the end that is the most important thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly resistable","review":"For those of you who haven't read the books, you may gain some enjoyment from this film. Everyone who loved this movie did not read the book, but for those of us who did, we HATED this film with a passion. It moves quite slow and while I have the utmost respect for each of the actors in this film, the only ones to play their characters even remotly well were Anjelica Huston and Joan Allen playing Vivan and Morgause respectfully. I'm not familiar with Julianna M.'s work, but she was TERRIBLE as Morgaine!! Do yourself a favor, pass on the film. I know the book is massive, but its a fantastic read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Perhaps due to being overly familiar and very fond of the book, I was terribly disappointed in this mini-series. In fact, I found it virtually unwatchable. Although the cast is filled with several fine actors, they are all terrible here. The plot and themes of the book are totally bastardized. Very, very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"I was really excited to see the movie version of one of my favorite book. In the first 5 minutes of the movie I was sorely disappointed. It was horrific. Maybe I was spoiled by Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings movies in that they stuck to the story line. It seemed as if none of the actors read the book before the screenplay. Don't watch it, read the book instead!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing outline of a rich story","review":"I doubt that anyone could have taken a 900+ page book and cut it down into a 2.5 hour movie without losing enormous chunks of the story and damaging the continuity. I had at least read the book, so knew roughly what was going on. My husband and daughter were frequently baffled.Although I found the book somewhat frustrating, particularly toward the end, it was nevertheless a richly imagined and intriguing story. I found the movie sad, as it hustled through what were considered the essential scenes. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defamation of a wonderful book","review":"Anyone who has read the book and loved it is going to be horribly disappointed. This adaptation was AWFUL!!! Those of you who gave it a good review because you liked the story - read the book.

This is one of my favorite books so cruelly mutilated and disgraced--TNT should be destroyed. Now, the cast was all right--I was impressed with Julianna as Morgained and enthralled with Anjelica as Viviane, etc but what was up with the plot? It's taken so long for a good version of the Arthurian legend to come about, and how do we honor one of the greatest books ever written? We violate it, hack at it, fudge all the scenes and then display it in four miserable hours.

Everyone in this two-part miniseries is perfect for the part - except the writers. The first half follows the book reasonably well, with only a few problems. Then there's the second half, which omits every important aspect of the story. Particularly conspicuous is the absence of the Merlin succession story - Kevin Harper isn't even in the film! The old Merlin dies without the slightest inkling of why his character was important. The fairy world is also completely missing. Then there's the ridiculous ending to the Morgause subplot, an idiotic departure from the book. In all, this was a glorious idea, with a promising beginning, that comes crashing down to an ignominious failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the novel, Mists of Avalon, I was very disappointed with this video adaptation. Key plot elements, such as the complex relationship between Morgaine and Kevin and its tragic outcome, were missing and as a result, the storyline was one dimensional and boring. The entire alternative flavor of the novel was missing and this movie seemed too much like every other version of the Arthur legend. Skip the video and buy the novel( and the Marion Zimmer Bradley prequels ) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Man's Adaptation of a Woman's Story....","review":"Let me just say, the book is phenomenal, written by a woman, and told from the womens' point of view. The movie, however, was done by a man, and does not remotely do justice for the book. A film would have to be a good twenty hours to even hope to encompass enough of the story to be comprehensive, and needs to be done by a woman so the perspective does not get so skewed as it did in the making of this film. The movie is nothing like the book, and some of the characters could have been cast much better, not to mention the women in the film came across with much less strength in character than in the book. If you look at the movie as a movie by itself with no relation to the book, it is decent, but so much was changed and left out from what is in the book that the film really ends up being a completely different, and deficient, story overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the book.","review":"I have read Marion Zimmer Bradley's book and this TV production in no way resembles it.Reading the book, I did not envision Igraine as portrayed by Julianna, nor Viviane by Angelica, Guenevere as a bleach-blonde in false eyelashes, nor the women of Avalon with shaved heads and living in castles!Marion's book is far more intricate, earthy and truer to the time in which the story takes place. She weaves a tale about women that is essentially from a woman's point of view.In contrast, this film version makes many changes, with characters, settings, timelines, and is dark in nature and in appearance. Frankly, it was turned into more of a guy flick. I was so disappointed in Part 1, I didn't bother with Part 2.I found the book refreshing and inspiring, so I recommend the book instead, especially if you're a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie with a womans perspective","review":"Without telling you what the movie is about, you can read the other reviews for that, I thought it was beautifully filmed, written and played out. A wonderful movie with strong female leads and female stories. My husband and I were both surprised and impressed with the movie and will watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed pearl","review":"It has good actors, yet it doesn't satisfy.Maybe it is because it was made for TV and not even pay cable. The characters do not match the book.Morgause, for instance, in the book starts off as a teenager, and is married young to Lot of Orkney. In the book she is played by an actress in her thirties. This kills a lot of her motivations.Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book...","review":"Read the book (it is superb), skip the film. This made for TV effort by TNT has so many departures from the original story it is almost a different tale. In addition, trying to condense 800+ pages into three hours means some serious editing has been done. The result is a choppy difficult to follow film that leaves the viewer disappointed. The book could be remade into an excellent film multi-part film by a good film studio with a good budget and a script that more closely follows the book (like the LOTR films for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"I had such high expectations for this movie and I love Julianna M. But they did not adapt this anywhere near fathfully to Marion Bradley's Book. I would love to go into detail about how much they missed but it would take to long. The story is told from Morganna's point of view and is done well on paper but not on the screen. The fine points of the society of Avalon are completely overlooked and missinterpreted in this adaptation. Save your money and rent the audio from your local library if you just don't have time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not true to the novel...","review":"Granted, jamming 800+ pages into a short television miniseries is a difficult undertaking, but changing the story around altogether is doing it a grave injustice. Part I of this miniseries does a reasonably good job of portraying the first half of the events from the novel, but Part II could have been a different tale entirely. The absence of certain less plot-crucial characters in an epic's transition from page to screen is understandable, but rewriting the course of events is unforgiveable. It's certainly worth watching, but if you have read (and loved) the book, don't expect this to be entirely faithful to it. If you haven't read the book, just be aware that you'd be getting a different story altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"MZB must be turning over in her grave","review":"This was the worst adaptation of a novel, for television or the big screen, that I've ever had the misfortune to see. This is one of my favorite books ever written, and if I hadn't read it, I don't think I would have understood what was going on, because the miniseries bore little resemblance to the book. If you're a fan of King Arthur movies, see Excalibur, Merlin, or even Camelot. If you haven't read the book, I think at the very least you will be confused. If you HAVE read the book, you will want to throttle the screenwriter, director, and everyone else who had the unmitigated gall to think this Cliffs notes version of a miniseries would pass muster with true Marion Zimmer Bradley fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much story missing in film","review":"We need the Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings Trilogy fame, to do this book justice.

I am a pretty experienced baker, and my success rate, even with tricky procedures, is very high. In five attempts to use this cake pan, each ime increasing how slavishly I greased and floured the alleged \\"non stick\\" surface, and being careful to remove it per the instructions - after cooling 10-15 minutes on a rack after removing from the oven, I never got it out in one piece. The mold's detailed corners are too sharp to cleanly release the cake. I even tried letting it fully cool in the hopes some shrinkage would help get the cake out. I own other Nordic Ware pans and have had better luck with them, but this particular mold is a loser, which was very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially be if it worked. If you want to use it for Jello, I'm sure it's fine, but for cakes, it's a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Idiocy is a nice state of mind","review":"I compared this guide to three others and found the Complete Idiot's Guide to be much more useful for my family.

It would provide hardly enough continuity, so my fan switch relay would cycle rapidly, but never engage until my car was ready to overheat!I used this on my 1999 Honda Civic EX D16Y8 motor. I ended up going to the part store and bought a switch that has a lifetime warranty. Save the hassle, and buy a decent radiator coolant temperature switch with a warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality classic sneaks, great for women too!","review":"I'm a mom who loves Adidas Originals.

The concepts presented are still of primary concern. It nicely takes the student thru a simple OS and thru complex ones, e.g. UNIX and IBM's MVS, to introduce virtual memory, paging, scheduling, resource contention, and so forth. And, the student does not need 3 years of CS courses to get thru the book. For a 2 year course, or for those needing to know about Operating systems, but not the \\"gory\\" details of coding them, this is an excellent work.I have been teaching with it since the second edition.

Dr. Youssef has done a great deal of research and provides deep insight into how Satan works and the incredible deception that he creates in the world and in the hearts and minds of people of all ages and every socio-economic background. And as Dr. Youssef points out, there is no question that Satan's forces are stronger now than ever before in the history of mankind (okay, humankind). Satan (a.k.a. \\"THe Angel of Light,\\") has even infiltrated and in some cases, taken over many churches. Bottom line...read this book. It explains Satan's strategies, his army of demons, how their organized, etal.

The book is insightful and very practical and is a must for those who struggle with depression and disappointment in their Christian walk.Few preachers have the wisdom that the Holy Spirit has given Youssef, so I would enthusiastically recommend this book.

For example, the DTC resource creation was covered only in a half a page. Also, when it comes to file shares and dependencies; not very useful info there. The SQL chapter did not go into much detail, especially installing SP2. To be honest, I did not learn anything new reading this book. Even that idea about increasing the timer on boot-up on one of the nodes, I thought of that long before I read this book.

The first portion of the book explains the importance of certification, etc. All things we ALREADY know, or we wouldn't have bought the book to begin with. There is a section that points to OTHER books that can supply you with the information, but the problem is that I was looking for the information in this one! Waste of my time and money, and for that I give it ZERO stars.

Previous reviewers pretty summed up what the book content is. The only thing of value in the book is the Exam Blueprint, an outline of what topics are covered on the Network+ exam. The review questions were not really useful in preparing for the test.

His style fits the era perfectly. The content of the stoy is adult-oriented and non-superhero, providing a fine alternative to the spandex crowd. I followed the book when it originally came out. Chaykin places the main character in proximity to relevant people and places of the time, somewhat like authors Gore Vidal or John Jakes would. It would play well as a television mini-series. I recommend it to a fan of Chaykin's work or a comic book reader interested in an under-utilized period of American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been far better","review":"A comic book exploring the early '50s from the standpoint of a nonconformist, featuring many historical people? The idea hooked me in. Unfortunately, after about six issues I stopped buying. Harry Kraft is a central character without either ideals or roguish charm, which what would be needed to make the series work. He's just a jerk. The last straw was when he says to the husband who who has just blown away his cheating wife (who was only minutes before was having sex with *Harry*) \\"You're a good man, Dave\\" or words to that effect.

The fight system is simple, but still can be quite challenging on advanced settings. The Companion characters can be hilarious although most are not terribly useful. The storyline is creative and complex. It's very linear but allows an exceptional amount of player choice. Player choices really can alter the outcome of the game quite a bit. I'm bored quite easily, yet this is one of the few games that I've played through more than once. The special edition has a few options and in-game items that don't exist in the other versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"A lot of criticism for this game stems from its brevity. It can be casually played through in 3 or 4 days on easy difficulty. It does however have multiple outcomes depending on your choices, so that does mix things up a bit and add to the replay value.As far as gameplay goes, it's an action rpg, so it involves a lot of hacking and slashing, but still, there are some definite tactics involved. Controlling your character is itself no problem; it is all very smooth and integrated.But I think the game's chief strengths are its mood or atmosphere coupled with its story. Bioware really did create a very beautiful fantasy world, set in an ancient and mythical Taoist China. For this reason, it is a game that stands out, in my mind, as one that sort of transports you into its world. All in all it's a fun experience in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite funny","review":"I have just finished reading this book with my 8 year old daughter and reading it to my almost 6 year old son.

My surprise first, for discovering Pythagoras represented much more than his well known theorem as he also was a philosopher, a great traveller through space, time, spirits and dimensions. The author Karim, like Pythagoras a seeker of harmony, provided me with great delight as sweet thoughts wandered in my imagination when his book made me dive back into ancient civilisations and traditions described so precisely and so charming, in a state where these two worlds of reality and mysticism brush against each other often and mix with each other sometimes. A great thank to the author and to his thorough and complete research and work in its description of what was Pythagoras life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intersting - Magical","review":"When I first read this book, I felt an extreme sense of spirituality and belonging to the Phoenician great civilisation.

One learns about the musicians (two groups actually) and what they played that night while the life boats were being loaded. Another story details the negligence of the freighter Californian for not answering the eight rockets of distress from the Titanic. Another story details the shootings and suicide near the end of the launch of the last life boats. Still another story details why there were not enough life boats on the Titanic and most other ocean liners of the day. Walter Lord clears the air about these mysteries with his well informed writing.If you want to know more about the Titanic, read both Lord's books on the subject (A Night to Remember, The Night Lives On). They will help the reader understand this tragedy.

We all try to avoid this, but it is impossible to do just by looking at the appearance of the meat. I purchased this tenderizer to salvage the situation as much as possible, and the tenderizer does a good job of doing just that. The product is well made, and the multiple stainless blades do a good job of piercing the meat easily. For very tough meat, multiple piercing strokes will help the tenderizing process. It is extremely easy to clean and reassemble after usage, and it is a worthwhile inexpensive addition to any kitchen. I am very pleased with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Faulty Manufacturing and metal pieces in your meat","review":"At first glance, this looks like a really great product. I purchased one and used it one time, and it really made the beef roast very tender. Then I went to wash it and discovered that the stainless steel on the prongs are just pot metal with a stainless steel coating. Some of the stainless steel coating had come off and bits of it were in my beef roast. I had to throw the roast away, for fear of eating pieces of metal that would most likely cut me up inside. I hoped and prayed that the beef I had eaten, did not contain some of the metal bits. Please beware of this product.

Ironically, the book is not about a woman chaser, per se...Willeford uses his main character's view to point out a number of human failings, and the brisk plotline and well-developed supporting cast are more than willing to reveal some of life's bitter ironies. The result is an enjoyable and quick read, filled with tinges of sarcasm and understated dark humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Classic","review":"The Woman Chaser is a great read.

My wife got me a very valuable (and expensive) first edition of this book for me for my birthday. It was originally published in 1960 as a sleeze paperback, and is very difficult to come by today. Not wanting to take a chance on it getting messed up when I read it, I picked up this edition. This edition suffers from some nagging problems, such as no indication of when the book was written, many typos, and a lame cover. You should see the one on the first edition!The book is amazingly well written, and the main character, Richard Hudson, is as blunt and brutal a character as you are likely to find anywhere. The story is told from his perspective, and it leaves you pretty drained by the end. His way of handling an unwanted pregnancy is something that will haunt me for years to come.

It takes a chapter or two to get into because of the jarring narrative style but it grabs hold of you after that and is pretty much impossible to put down. Charles Willeford did a superb job on this novel, much better than his more famous but depressingPick-Up. In fact, The Woman Chaser is probably his best novel. It was turned into an unsatisfying 1999 movie starring Patrick Warburton (available only on out-of-print VHS). I also enjoyed Willeford's later Florida crime novels featuring police detective Hoke Moseley (Miami Blues, etc.), a series which easily equals or outdoes anything by Elmore Leonard. If you're new to Willeford, The Woman Chaser orMiami Bluesare a great place to start with this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"This book was shallow and a complete waste of time to read.

The main plot line was interesting and had a few nice twists, but the character of Cathy was just too over the top to be believable. How did Paul Christopher fall for such a shallow, self-centered b**** and tolerate her antics? Why did his service not consider her a tremendous security threat? Why was the intelligent, daring spy such as milquetoast when it came to his wife? This tainted the whole book for me. I was very disappointed overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Lovers","review":"This is not one of Charles McCarry's better books. McCarry is a retired CIA spook who knows the tradecraft of which he writes but he is lazy in his continuity of his characters. For example, the hero's 'outfit' handler in this book is married. In others I have read he has been single. The 'outfit' station chief in Berlin is referred to as a buffoon and is never introduced as a character while in other novels he is mentor and best friend of the hero. Finally, McCarry needs to learn something about sailing. He has his hero sailing in the North Sea in some novels and at one point had the boat sailing \\"close hauled before the wind.\\" I don't know whether this is sloppy writing or bad editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a trifle convoluted","review":"McCarry's Paul Christopher series has been extremely well written, realistic, and worth seeking out. \\"Secret Lovers\\" is no exception. There is plenty here to captivate most McCarry fans. A good read. McCarry obviously is at his best when laying out the intricacies of tradecraft, and the various attempts by rival agencies (both US and international) to outwit each other. There are a few other parts where the inspiration seems to flag or gets overburdened. One is the section in Spain, and the other is Paul's wife Cathy. The basic impulses driving his wife's actions are understandable and perhaps sympathetic (living with a Christopher could never be easy.) but her character is a bit overwritten and melodramatic. Nonetheless, recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intresting story laced with horrible subplot","review":"I read the Miernik Dossier which I really like so I was willing to give this book a shot despite reading the mixed reviews. Well they were spot on, first of all, McCarry should not write about sex, it seem gratuitous and mostly strikes a false note, it doesn't seem real. Paul Christopher is slowly morphing into a James Bond like super spy.

Like a blind mouse enticed by the hypnotic melodic sounds from the pipers flute, I found myself closer to the sales counter asking \\"yo, who's dat you playin..??\\". He smiles and hands me a CD with a cover resembling something from a colorful kids book. The track that grabbed me was \\"That Day\\". It's one of those tracks that no matter how much you try to keep still, you find yourself moving to it's groove. I was sold on this track. I can't lie, I bought a CD on the strength of one track...... I usually don't do that. The 1st month after purchase, this CD stayed in rotation on my Archos Mp3 player.

The children demonstrating the signs in the book are very easy to follow. My daughter, soon after we worked through the book with her, was able to look at the pictures independently and immitate the signs.

My roomate has a toshiba 62 inch 1080i TV and the picture quality on the SONY isn't drastically better but my opinion gravitates to the SONY, but they both have fantastic pictures on HD channels.I was contemplating a smaller plasma TV or something I could hang on a wall, but sometimes there is no replacement for a larger screen with a near identical picture. Either way, you can't beat that price for what the TV lists for, almost a grand more.I highly recommend this TV. Also if you plan on getting any warrenty with it, make sure the warrenty package is bought within the same purchase of the TV, and the TV dollar value falls within the warrenty price range listed. EG: $1,000 - $1,999 Value TV Warrenty would apply to My TV, I made this mistake when purchasing mine, and now only have the factory 1 year warrenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome value!","review":"I've had the TV about 3 weeks and so far it's been everything I'd hoped for. The picture, when the broadcast is in hi-def, is simply stunning. My first football game was the AFC championship game. My Pats not winning was the only downside(can't blame Sony for that). You could actually read some of the tattoos. Was wary of the rear projection technology-had heard about repair issues- but was assured by my tech competent son-in-law that Sony's SXRD was something new and better, not subject to repair problems of the past. So far, so good. At this point, couldn't be happier. Unless you want to hang it on the wall, why even consider spending the extra $500 for an LCD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony kds-50a2000","review":"First big screen, the SXRD is absolutely the best picture, but....somehow missed they eliminated the picture and picture feature. Sony includes a \\"freeze frame\\" function which is really useless. The \\"picture in a picture\\" or \\"picture and picture\\" which Sony calls it has been removed and priced accordingly from the other models which eliminates the ability to \\"multi-task\\" ie two channels, DVD & TV, pc monitor, etc. Still a great picture and good looking package, just limited to viewing single source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 1080p TV","review":"I finally bought this after more than 1 year of checking out LCD, plasma, DLP.

Something I want to mention however:1) Sound from the TV speakers are not that great. But then if you have a home theater system, then you're ok.2) SPDIF output from the back of this TV only work if the source is from this TVs tuner. It will not work if the source is something else.

There is nothing that can be done to fix the problem short of a $1000+ repair. Forget help from Sony, they are aware of the defect (settled class action on other models and abruptly abandoned the line and technology) but firmly thumb their nose at anyone having the same defect with models not covered by the settlement. Too bad, Sony has now forever lost my business and will receive their due references to all I know seeking new electronic purchases.

The picture itself is excellent with good blacks and shadow detail. Motion seems to be blur free and no rainbow effect. I think for the price it would be difficult to find a better unit that is 1080P capable. A third HDMI would have been nice.The sound from the built in speakers is just OK, but most people are like myself and have an external speaker setup. I would definitly do this purchase again and the service from Amazon was perfect.

I was mainly looking for a 1080P television. It was a toss up between this, or the Samsung 1080P models. I'm really happy with the television, we didn't have to do too much tuning out of the box.My only issue is the TV takes alittle bit long to turn on, which is understandable given the technology. But it would be nice to eventually cut the time in half. Also the TV does not produce native 1080p from the Xbox 360 HD player which was really disappointing. It only produces true 1080p via HDMI not VGA. So be warned if you're planning on using this TV with the Xbox 360 HD player.

It helps that I live in Austin and the shipment was from Dallas which would explain the fast shipping. I did not pay shipping so that was nice. I hooked up to my antenna to receive channels from the air. The digital channels in general are very clear. Analog channels are also very good. Watching the Super Bowl with HD broadcast was amazing. The picture quality is excellent. So far I am pleased with the result. I do wish that Sony would have PIP but I knew going in that it would not be a problem not having this feature. The remote control could be better. I was a little concern with the start-up time, but so far it is ok for me. Start-up time is in the 30 second range.

Like Clarence in his Malmsey he lurches to and fro, chapters marked by an airy, over-the-river-and-through-the-woods approach that seldom leaves the reader feeling any more informed than he was before he started. And as a previous reviewer noted, the tome is riddled with typographical and grammatical errors which do little to ease the put-upon reader's sense of frustration. Repeated and highly focused attempts at critical reading succeeded in educing little more than a profound sense of mental lassitude, with nary a smidgen of enlightenment to reward my efforts.

Jabra apparently makes these for people with either giant or tiny heads, I'm not sure which.The cheap microphone is so over-modulated that I had to tape a piece of foam over the mic to be able to use them with skype. Even turing down the microphone settings to zero in skype doesn't seem to have any effect on the mic levels of this headset.Getting them to turn off and stay off is nearly impossible.

You can turn this off after you turn it on, but you have to do it every time you use them.Also, I use them for my iPod. I don't know of this is the headphones, or the receiver, or if all products do this with the headphones, but sometimes the blue tooth signal drops out.

And with the voice command program I can say \\"Play artist Maroon 5\\" and it brings the song up with no problem.. I asked a person on the other end of a call how I sounded and they said it was clear and the could understand me better then my previous BT headset. I would recommend using some program that had a EQ setting so you can adjust to you liking but all I can say is Bravo Jabra! you made a great Pair of BT stereo Headphones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flashing blue lights","review":"The sound is okay;for me it needs more volume.

It paired up with them just fine, however the audio quality was horrible. No low or high end, nor any dimension to the sound. I can't believe more reviewers haven't mentioned how bad the audio quality is. Build quality is fine. However, it's simply unlistenable. I'm returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with Blackberry Curve","review":"I just got my headphones. They worked for phone calls (with some static), but I couldn't play music through them. The buttons work as far as pausing and skipping songs, but no music through the headphones. I contacted Jabra and found out it isn't compatible with the Curve. Would've been nice to know ahead of time. These are a little expensive to be just a remote control for my phone's music player.Check the Jabra website before purchasing to make sure they are compatible. Just because your phone supports advanced audio doesn't mean these will work with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money!","review":"It is a good product, kinda bulky, but good. You can use it with you BT phone as well and all the controls are in the headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pairing Difficulties","review":"These are excellent for pairing with phones. However, my new Dell laptop didn't pair well with them at all. When listening to music, they were horrible sound quality and this was when I was sitting at the computer. Also, don't plan on using these for Skype. Even with the proper setting they don't work well. Also, when wearing them for long periods of time they really hurt the ears. I would recommend a different model of Jabra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jabra BT620 Would Return If I Can","review":"If I could, I would return this product. I have a Nokia 5300 phone, and it really doesn't work with this headset. When listening to the mp3 player, the music has a lot of pauses. When talking to someone on the phone, there's a lot and I mean a lot of background noises and the other person can hardly hear you. On my end, it's clear, but for the other person, there's a lot of noise and hissing. I've talked to tech support from Jabra and they've sent me three of the same headset, but I'm still having problems. They don't even know why I'm having this problem and they don't know what to do. I've even gone as far as getting a replacement phone, thinking that it's my phone, but I still have the same problem. I would not get this product again and don't recommend anyone to get it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Set up and Use","review":"I just purchased this headset yesterday. I charged it the recommended two hours then paired it with my Verizon XV6800 without a glitch. It was on clearance at Staples for less than Amazon listed it. I would prefer a smaller format, but considering the price and functionality it's a great buy. The sound quality is great and there is little, if any, sound leakage to disturb those around you. The controls are easy to learn and use. The headset switches between phone and stereo seamlessly paired up with my XV6800. The headset is comfortable to wear and the BlueTooth range is better than my Motorola HS700 BlueTooth headset. More market choices should be available soon, but until something smaller at a more reasonable price is available, I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"The headphones were easy to connect to my cell phone and my MP3 player. The sound quality is good the only problem I have is the headphones hurt your ears after wearing them for more than 1 1/2 hours. Other than that I would have given these 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound, well made, it could be a bit easier to use.","review":"They are a very well made good sounding headphones. They have a very good range. However with red lights flashing and blue lights flashing, taping on the left or the right side , plus extra switches on both sides. it can be a bit complicated to use. However I would recommend them. I am happy with them. If your looking for the ultimate in sound reproduction you need to spend lots more money. Easy to install, but I am still challenged with their operation."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headset","review":"this headset is well worth the money. the sound quality is great. the loudness may not be enough for some people.

I would recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"jabra head phones","review":"Good sound for the head phones. They do lack in comfort.

From bubble-gum pop to electronica and techno-dance, she has compiled an immaculate catalog of brilliant music.

But it is a single track that is worth the entire price of this CD. That song is \\"Confide in Me.\\" Shiver-inciting and timeless, this is one of the most deserving classics of 90's pop, and makes us grateful for the talent of this brilliant performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fierce","review":"She has done a lot of great work over the years.

Disc 1 are for old school fans and that'd be me. Disc 2 are her current hits. Granted that it's missing some singles that I thought should be in here but I guess because they weren't that high in the charts they weren't added.

Also, full-frame versions of Slow and Red Blooded Woman were included when widescreen masters exist (and were included on the \\"Money Can't Buy\\" DVD).

The early videos are really embarrasing, especially \\"The Locomotion\\", but some of them have their charm like \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" and \\"Got To Be Certain\\". I really didn't like that my favorite Kylie song ever, \\"Better The Devil You Know\\", is represented here with such AWFUL sound quality. I'm not kidding, it's really bad. I don't understand why they couldn't just dub over it with the track from the Ultimate Kylie CD or something. Some of the early videos aren't in great quality either, \\"Especially\\" for you suffers ffrom too much brightness and contrast. Or maybe that's how the video was originally shot..??

My OB was OK with me taking 2 Flintstone Gummies and a folic acid pill. I must admit I still take 2 a day rather than going back to Centrum, they do taste pretty good!

I was unfamiliar with it, and started to read it, skeptically. I was hooked! So, OK, it is a bit sensational, but the character development is good, and the story is riveting.

Not great literature, but a really fun vacation read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book I have ever read!!","review":"When I first started reading Savages, I didn't think I would even finish it, because the first part of the book was a little slow. Wow. I am so glad I kept reading. This has got to be my all-time favorite book. I read the book more than two years ago, and I still think about the characters and their situations to this day.

Shirley takes the reader on a riveting ride through the unexpected perils of Paui. Shirley write of grotesque moral acts that make the reader ask the big question 'what would I do if I had to go through what the women in the story went through?...could I kill someone?...could I eat someone?...would I attempt cannablism if I was that desperate?\\" I must addmit that sometimes I wanted to slap some of her female characters for some of the stupid, 'female' things they did. I wanted them to grow up faster and triumph quicker...but the developement of the characters through trial and error made the story so rich and the ending that much more satisfying.

It was certainly more engaging than a Jackie or Joan Collins Hollywood novel.I liked every part of this book except for the end. It DID end abruptly. After investing so much time and emotion into these characters, I would have liked to have at least a ONE PAGE summary for each character of how their experience affected and changed them! Would it have killed Ms. Conran to put in 5 pages of additional work?I understand there was an option to adapt this novel into a TV miniseries..Does anyone know if that happened and what it was called?

Many sentences just don't make sense, although I could usually figure out what I think they thought they were saying.

She first gives her statement as if fact at times which makes the facts (Veronica's actual works) seem secondary.

It gets better later when the author seems to calm down and hit his stride. Oddly I found reading it from the back a better approach. There are some real gems in here, like the letter from the Viginia cavalryman which I hadn't encountered before, but its placement belongs in an index; bits of it should have been used more appropriately in the text. Unfortunately, in order to understand \\"September 11, 1777,\\" you already have to have considerable knowledge about the battle in order to sort what you are reading. For a reader with casual interest, or tourist, this one will be confusing. A reenactor may find it of value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maintains the Historical Integrity of the Revolutionary War","review":"Mr. Mowday has done a commendable job of bringing a long ignored battle to life.

The homes in this book are exceptional for Bali and for the most part would be special almost anywhere.The book covers some breathtakingly beautiful houses and the photography is excellent. Whether one is interested in Bali or not, architects, decorators, and those who appreciate creative design will thoroughly enjoy this collection of gorgeous photos of stunning architectural creativity. Those who do not know Bali will likely be blown away by its natural tropical beauty. For those who know and care about Bali, this work artfully ties all of the above together in a most satisfying volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap book, lavishly printed","review":"Kudos to Taschen for printing such a wonderfully lavish spread. The photos of the featured houses are well executed and lush. Though not the traditional Balinese homes, but rather these homes are modern reinterpretations of traditional Balinese architectural elements. This is because almost all houses in this book are owned by expats, hence they are built luxuriously. Nevertheless, this will make you sit up and think about of going to Bali."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of its kind","review":"I have bought several photo books on Bali to develop some design ideas.

Sure this film was made on a shoe string, and sure he was VERY young when he made it, but I've seen film school projects that were more interesting.

This is a movie where literally nothing happens. A guy crawls out of a car wreck and then continues to crawl for well over an hour in the woods before finally making it to a road and getting picked up. That's all folks. There is a plot that waits until the last minute to come together but saying anything at all about it will give the movie away.

If it is a little breezier it looks wobbly like it might tip over.

Part of the problem is that my \\"standard\\" 1.5\\" umbrellas don't go very far down into it. One with a wooden pole goes down about 4 inches and the other one with a metal pole only goes in about 2 inches.

There were reports that in high winds this does not work well. I could only say that in a moderate breeze this worked very well where other umbrellas without this anchor were blowing away. I'm sure in gail force winds not too much would work and besides I don't thin you want to remain on a beach with high winds that long anyway. For the price I would recommend this product.I gave it a 4 only because of the concern that the plastic handles to twist in the sand might be a concern.

The heating elements are only on the outsides of the slots. Cheap! And don't think you can put a piece of rye or other oblong bread in there. You have to cut it or toast one area at a time.

She shows how music is the background of everyday life, for example, with this definition, \\"Rhythm is a marching-band beat, a puffing-train beat, a beating-the eggs beat, a heart beat.\\"The book closes with a panoply of pictures demonstrating how music comforts and inspires, by helping people to relax, calm anger, cheer low spirits, and create or perform work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful and Immensely Enjoyable","review":"As an Equine (and Human) Therapist, I have to connect with horses in a professional setting quickly in order to do my job effectively whereby the horse can gain the most benefit in a limited amount of time.

Which is a shame, because the ideas are important and intriguing: epidemiology and animal experiments show that maternal undernourishment changes the pancreas and liver to prepare for a life of famine. Subsequent normal and especially abundant diets then result in late onset diabetes and heart disease. The fetus is also extremely susceptible to damage from alcohol and tobacco. Thus, the way to reduce diseases that are thought to be genetic is by proper maternal nourishment and hygiene.Now that you know what the book has to say, save your money and spend it on other equally interesting but better written books about late-onset disease: Why Animals Don't Get Heart Disease by Matthias Rath and any books by Dean Ornish or Robert Pritikin.

I am very disappointed that they purposely sent me out the wrong product hoping I wouldn't care and haven't bothered to remove the unavailable product from their website.

Failed startups are common, reboots if you plug/unplug power during startup, screen flicker, and rotten online support have made this a really poor experience.

It worked great for the first six months - then the problems started. First, the screen flicker (which is resolved by pushing on the cord that connects the screen to the unit, but it's a stopgap measure that only works for 1-2 days before you have to do it again). In late January, the laptop powered settings virtually destroyed the system - HP tech support's only resolution was to do a system restore. Because the disks are ONLY system restore, and not an actual copy of XP, I couldn't reinstall (which would've solved the problem). I lost everything since my previous backup - 3 weeks of e-mail and documents.Lately, the fan has started to become noisy and the DVD drive spins when a disk is in, regardless of whether or not I'm accessing the drive. No disk, no spin, but if a disk is in, it'll spin for no reason.HP's solution is for me to pack it up and ship it to them, leaving me without my laptop for 6 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Haydn and Vivaldi","review":"This CD was super budget when I bought it many years ago.

I really think that this book is essential for kids who are applying to private colleges.The only reservations I have is that the book does not alway make clear what is imperative, and what is merely an opinion of the author.

Applications are all about how you look on paper, and this book gives any student who follows its suggestions a leg up on the competition, especially in the crucial essay-writing phase. So many college prospects find themselves hampered by essays and struggle with them. Taking suggestions such as these into consideration can certainly make or break an application.

Under the circumstances, these works need the best \\"coaxing\\" they can receive: perhaps the Emersons or, at the least, the Kodalys. Here, though, the quartets fall dismally flat and hollow. Worst of all is the horrendous metallic sound.

I laughed steadily thourghout the book. While Private MacAuslan, the world's dirtiest soldier, isn't the central charecter in every chapter (actually short stories), the Jocks (Highlanders) who serve with him are each unique and astonishing in their own rights.One warning, you may find the dialect of the Jocks a bit hard to follow at first.

My second complaint that was the most glaring..to me anyways...was that I loved the character Aubrey so much that I wanted him to have his own book instead of just having his relationship with Sylvia mentioned in passing. I was bordering on liking him more than Colin and I really hate it when secondary characters become more attractive than the central players.

In this list of sleep disorders, he almost completely ignores REM Sleep Behavioral Disorder, which we are discovering is surprisingly common.

The ONLY two things present here that aren't on \\"Nothing Safe\\" are: 1) a song called \\"Heaven Beside You\\" (and if you love that song and MUST have it, you still don't have to get this, get \\"Unplugged\\" instead) and 2) a studio version of \\"Rooster\\" (\\"Nothing Safe\\" includes an incredibly good live version of the song). On the other hand, this CD does NOT include \\"Got Me Wrong\\", \\"Get Born Again\\", \\"We Die Young\\", \\"What The Hell Have I\\" and (for some strange reason) one of AiC's biggest hits, \\"Down In A Hole\\".

This is yet another blatant cash in from Columbia/Sony, and fellow hardcore AIC fans would agree that a true AIC greatest hits should include masterpieces like \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Bleed the Freak\\", \\"Love, Hate, Love\\", \\"Rain When I Die\\", \\"Dirt\\", \\"Brother\\", \\"Nutshell\\", \\"Sludge Factory\\", and \\"Over Now\\" plus where are the other singles (this compilation is basically the songs that radio ate up) like \\"We Die Young\\", \\"Sea of Sorrow\\", \\"What the Hell Have I?\\", \\"Got Me Wrong\\", and \\"Get Born Again\\"?

After many plays, however, there are strategies that are vastly superior to others, and better players will gravitate toward using them. As a 2-player game it's just OK, but with a full complement of 4 there's a bit more unpredictability so the game is much more interesting.

The most obvious flaw is the implausable plotline, in which all seasons had, but in comparison only Season 3 was more convaluted than Season 4. I still look at the first two season as being the best ones. Season 4 has some great suspense sequences, but the emotional moments of personal problems still seem silly given that the whole world needs saving.

You don't have any commercials, you can watch it whenever you want, and you don't have to wait a full week to find out what happens next. It's sometimes difficult to avoid all commercials about new episodes, but it's well worth it.And I highly recommend you buy this season on DVD.

Superlatives need not apply, we've already got most of the available ones on salary and hard at work.Good grief, this is excellent television, a periodic DVD treat that's right up there with fried scrapple, my mother's macaroni and cheese, and just one or two other really good things."},{"rating":"2","title":"24","review":"There is great action and something always going on!

The situations had potential, but, it became a puff piece. Through the first chapters my underlying thought was that these problems would be so much more with less financial support. Did each woman have to be so wealthy? Where was the average income? It has to be more fun to write about someone who can dine out whenever they want rather than the woman who has to balance going to a restaurant weekly, or more often, with buying enough groceries or gasoline. I guess if no bills exist you can concentrate on the lack of a man or ungrateful kids. This book was a quick read, I found myself skimming through because it is trite and forgettable, except for the chapter quotes. I copied them out in a journal. Yes, I journal and I hope there is more reality in my words. I've had two of the plotlines happen in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these women!!","review":"These women could be my friends.

The four main characters were somewhat stereotypical, but life in general is full of stereotypes.

Unfortunately, there is a bit of an implication that everyone in all their various circumstances finds true happiness by finding true love eventually, or if true love hasn't happened yet, then it is at least on the visible horizon! But hey, that's what makes it a romance.

Finishing this book left me disappointed - I wanted more!! The way the book ends, however, leaves room for a sequel and I hope Ms. Macomber considers it. I liked the style this book was written in. The story is about the lives of four friends and each chapter is dedicated to one of the four friends. Most chapters open with entries in their journals and then continues with their story. By about 3/4 of the way through the book, each friend's story is intertwined with that of at least one of the other three friends.

The first time (the grey button) it required unscrewing the laptop to get it back, I would imagine someone not as good with computers would have had to send it in to Lenovo.This pen isn't worth more than $20.00 max.Lenovo, listen to your customers: INCREASE the quality, or DECREASE the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"where to start?The tip does not sync with it's placement on the tablet.

This is the second pen I've had - the first one had to be sent back to Lenovo with the tablet to remove and replace.

If you apply even a little too much pressure to the grey button, it snaps, and not only is it irreparable, it also makes it impossible to get the pen correctly in and out of the PC. What's worse is if you put it in broken, it gets stuck and you have to open the computer, and last time I popped a few parts out that I have NO idea what they go with.If you can't tell, I am LIVID at the garbage quality and frequent breaking of this $50 ballpoint pen...I am on my 4th barely a year and 3 months after owning the computer-thats an extra $200 I HAVE SPENT on an already overpriced computer.

I was so disappointed. It is extremely long that a student gets bored with it after just a few pages. The storyline of the book sounded great, but I did not know it would be written with difficult syntax structure. The illustrations are not very interesting to younger kids either.

He was a precocious genius who lacked recognition (Brahms said his music was vulgar). This E major Symphony is distinctly pre-mahlerian -- its Scherzo has all the typical features of a burlesque Mahler scherzo. The sheer beauty of Rott's music, its force of persuasion makes us regret the fact that his talent could not develop -- the History of Music loses a lot with his sad fate and untimely death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific book on a overlooked battle","review":"Paul Taylor has done a tremendous job in presenting this over looked but extremely important battle that too often gets caught up as a one or two paragraph afterthought of the Second Manassas Campaign.Taylor offers a good narrative in explaining the significance of the action here.Prior to reading this book I knew very little about General Issac Stevens decisivness and bravery that day,and how his actions probably saved Pope further destruction. I particularly liked that he tells you the modern highway designations of the ninetenth century roads.

I went to the bookstore to find some books in sign language for my preschool students who were deaf. I was thrilled to find the titles, then livid with rage at what I found between the covers. These are not true signs. These aren't even invented signs, these are gestures and body language. I am iffy about teaching hearing babies sign anyway, doesn't seem to be a need for it. But if you are going to write a book about using signs with infants, at least have the decency to use actual true signs that are used by the Deaf community. What you have here is an insult to them, as well as a lie to the customers who buy your book thinking they are teaching their children sign.

I'm not sure why (maybe the pictures in the book help him visualize another baby making the sign), but after purchasing this book and working on the signs in the book with him, he is picking it up so quickly. Within 2 days, he learned 4 new signs.I think that the book offers children learning signs another perspective besides mom & dad making a sign. I want to get some of the other baby signs books by this author to supplement what we have gotten from this book.

She has yet to need a bird or flower. Dumb book, I'm extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another expensive (baby) book","review":"This book was not at all what I expected.

Only nine signs are shown and the signs are so simplistic it is not worth the money. I do not know how this book compares to the ASL version of baby signs, but you don't need this book to do the signs offered here. For instance flap you arms at your side like wings to imitate a bird. Smack your lips together to imitate a fish. All the signs in the book we learned naturally in preschool, and you don't need a refresher on. At the book list price of $6.99 for 9 signs that's about 80 cents a sign to learn stuff you do naturally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The pictures in this book are beautiful. I was hoping to share them with my daughter, but they are different from all of the signs we have been teaching her.

She is totally engaged by the color photos of babies doing the signs and loves the activity of doing each sign. She will consistently pick these books to \\"read\\" over any other. I only wish they had more books. She has mastered all the signs and has incorporated them into daily life. I now look up new sings online as they become helpful but these books definitely introduced the concept of signing to communicate.

If you are going to fry the ham and make a red eye gravy, I would slice the ham and only soak the slices for a couple of hours, pat dry and then fry, making sure you do not fry it too much.

Two problems: 1) I looked him up on the USCF's own site. He HAS NO rating, meaning he hasn't played enough games to get a rating or hasn't played any. 2) There is no such thing as the US Speed Chess Championship. I'm sure that, if there were, someone other than a bogus master would win it. So that's two lies before the actual book begins.So, what about the book itself? I don't even think it's any good as a beginner's book. The basics of opening theory can be learned in much better books; indeed, I am at a loss to think of a worse book on the subject. An average tournament player could write a book this good. Who needs a phony-baloney master to tell him this extremely elementary stuff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"Like all of his books, Winning Chess Openings is a chess book for those with only limited aspirations in chess. The openings in this book are covered only in the most superficial manner.There are many other books out there that do a much better job at this level. For a similar price, Horowitz' classic, How To Win In The Chess Openings does a much better job of describing the dynamics of the openings.

It seems to be written for an absolute beginner, which while not automatically a bad thing, is not really the best thing for an opening book. At the level this book is written for, the readers opponents will be deviating from the book very very early, and in many cases the author does not explain why these other moves are bad. The only thing this book is useful for is learning the names of the openings, which can be easily done for free on the internet. Even absolute beginners should save the 10 dollars and either learn tactics, or if you must have an opening book, get the far superior book by Yasser Seirawan with the same name.

Imagine all of that money compounding in a Roth IRA and then withdrawn TAX FREE!!Options on stock splits is the best growth strategy. The individual that wrote that you would have lost money playing splits either didn't read this book or the material went right over their head.There are five times to buy a stock on a split; five times to profit.If you are investing in options and not setting stop losses and using limit orders, shame on you!I've read the rest, this is the best.

Nonetheless, if you want to read the most elementary work on a broad range of loosely connected subjects, this books is still not for you.

The idea that you can write a 1 month call for 10% of the value of the stock is erroneous. Then, since he advises investing with borrowed money, he claims this is a return of 20% per month. He extends this to 40% just because nobody minds optimism. Writing covered calls is fine, but you do have to realize that this will limit your upside, but not your downside. He neglects to mention this!Mr. Cook uses margin buying for every example, yet never gives a single calculation for what happens when a stock goes down, for example showing how you can lose 100% of your investment by a price drop of 50%. Really, the only three ideas in here are 1. Covered call writing (with exaggerated numbers) 2. Buying rolling stocks (which are not supported by his own graphs) and 3. Buying on the stock split (which is not such a guarantee of success as he claims).Overall, the returns of these strategies are not credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"How low will Mr. Cook's detractors go?????","review":"Notice a review from someone in the USA.

Wade claims that you can make 20% a month just by reading his book and following his simple instructions.This is my investment advice. The market is a competative arena pitting one trader against another. For this reason alone the only people who will win are those whose skill is greater than most (90%? ) of the other participants. Anyone who claims beating the market is simple, or easy is merely trying to take your money. In the case of option trading success is particularly difficult due to the size of the spread and the decay of the options time value. Wake up! Trading is a profession. Success can be had, but at the cost of time and commitment. Doctors, lawyers, engineers spend years learning their craft before earning a living from it. Becoming a trader takes as much if not more effort and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a retired executive who has invested in the market for years. In order to expand my knowledge in options, I decided to read a book that would inform about such. I heard a lot about this book and the concepts are very interesting. However, I think that Wade Cook paints a picture that is too optomistic for a beginner. He also does a very poor job of explaining his methods and assumes too much. He needs to add a lot more details in his explanations. He is not a very good instructor.After reading his book, I don't feel prepared to trust in my knowledge to begin risking money in the options market. I am looking for another book with better explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Primer of successful strategies","review":"Mr. Cook's recipes for approaching the market from a cash flow business point of view are fascinating. The author describes methods long known and utilized by professional traders in a manner easily understood by the neophyte.

I bought this compilation at a local supermarket for $7.00 believe it or not. When I bought it, I found out it was two disks. I felt like they were being ripped off because I got two for the price of one. Tina Turner is one of America's foremost songstresses. I love her music especially the song, The Best. There are others like Private Dancer, You Better Be Good to Me, I'll Be Thunder, What's Love Got to Do With It, Let's Stay Together, Proud Mary, 1984, and so many others.

Tina is the finest woman stage performing musician I have ever seen....her shows with the Ikettes, Ike and the Kings of Rhythym are legendary and are an indelible memory to those of us who have seen them tearing it up in a small club.

She has been there and done that. I wish she would decide to tour again in the U.S. I would love to watch her perform again. Anyway back to the album, this album does contain all of hits of Tina Turner. They are missing quite a few hits from Ike & Tina Turner, Hopefully they'll release something soon with songs included all in one.

Daguerre is described as a lifelong bachelor seeking connection with a prostitute. What about Daguerre's wife, Englishwoman Georgina Smith? To deny her existence in this boring, uneven and poorly-considered piece makes it pulp fiction rather than historic fiction. In addition, the numerous incorrect descriptions of Daguerre's process (which could have been corrected by simply reading one of dozens of period manuals) means that the author did not bother himself with any research at all. As a practicing historic photographer, I find it especially grating when an author writes about the mechanics of a photographic process without having the slightest idea of what he/she is talking about. This book is written by a poor writer with poor writing skills, and certainly none whatsoever in this area. Do not buy, or even read this book: it is junk in the truest sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"I just finished reading this truly luminous novel - and finished wiping my eyes.It is quite simply one of the most auspicious debuts I have read in years.So often a writer who can craft a sentence with such beauty and create characters as well as you have skimps on plot. But this novel has all three and deserves all the praise it has received.The sense of place, the emotion, the ability to enter into the artists soul all have me amazed at Smith's talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the expectations","review":"I had had high hopes for this book but I was sorely disappointed.The storyline dragged like slow torture and the characters seemed barely two-dimensional.There was great potential in both the storyline and the characterization, however the author missed both marks by a long shot.So many times I wanted to just give up and put this one away but I kept reading thinking (hoping, wishing) it would get better. And it did, but only through fleeting passages. Then back to the same old labored reading.I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because there were definite resolutions to the two main conflicts presented in the story. Had it not been for those much-sought-after resolutions, the whole thing would've been a complete waste of time.If you can hold out so long as to find out how the conflicts get resolved, then more power to you. If not, no big deal. You won't have missed much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for historical fiction fans","review":"I've always been a fan of those books that neatly blend truth and fiction flawlessly. Smith has done just that. He has taken a story of the father of photography and brought it to life in a heartbreaking way. Unrequited love and obsessions are at the center of this novel. The character Deguerre is quite believable and sympathetic. The woman Isobel that he spends his life thinking about is, well, for lack of a better word, flawed. But this is part of what makes their relationship so interesting. Love is not always roses and \\"happily ever after,\\" and that is okay with this reader. \\"Mercury Visions\\" would make a beautiful movie: the scenery, the romantic tension, the characters... all described by Smith in such a way as to be felt and seen already. Just insert actors, and voila! Of course, Hollywood has a way of flubbing this process up, so perhaps it is best to just take this book as it is: you won't be disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just astonishingly beautiful","review":"I picked this book up after finishing \\"Arthur and George\\" by Julian Barnes, thinking I might be able to spend some more time in the 19th century. I did not expect much of it, I mean, having just languished in a supremely crafted work by a favourite author, I prepared myself for the blunt edges of a somewhat lesser wine.In stead, I rapidly found myself in the center of an epic read. I devoured the book in a day or two, and have been thinking about it every day for a month now. Its just astonishingly beautiful, and as well crafted as any book I've read before.

I had to ask \\"What did St. Thomas really say?\\" I went to several older translations of his work (the Summa Theologica) and this book completely mis-states what St. Thomas wrote. This is important for many reasons, but one of them is that these words of consecration have been part of internal Church contention in recent years when the new Sacraments were issued in 1970. This book should be avoided, but there are others that are more faithful translations, such as \\"A Tour of the Summa\\" by Glenn."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"was disappointed in taste,quality..ended up giving away remaining packets after trying a couple and none of us wanted to eat...was looking forward to the ease/shelf life, but no one liked"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Spool","review":"The spool has an incredible amount of space on it.

The last two pages has a spot for the picture of the child at their party and a list of their gifts.

While the information about the breed is accurate, it is also very vague. The bulk of the material is just generic information that applies to any dog. The Rhodesian is a lovely breed but is, I continue to learn, unusual in its intelligence, agility (especially when counter surfing), and sensitivity. It would have been nice to have the training information tailored to this breed. At the very least some information on finding a good trainer, who uses positive techniques rather that the traditional ones, would have been more helpful. Did like the section of the RR's sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful book","review":"Learning about the unique characteristics of the Rhodesian was fabulous.

My favorite is probably \\"Now That's the Barclords,\\" which is close in spirit to \\"Sister Havana,\\" by far the best song on their subsequent Saturation CD. Both songs sound like distillations of the best of 70's AOR radio, swaggering, bristling with hooks, self-conscious lounge music amplified to arena-rock bombast.Carrying echoes of the Manson murders, the title track refers to a cemetery in Kansas supposedly used for Satanic rituals. The stone structure on the cover of the CD is a church without a roof.

Perhaps a little too handsome, perhaps a little too cocky. But they usually aren't sleazy. And they are usually at least attractive in some sort of way to the reader. Rule left me cold. So cold, I was reaching for my sweater. Am I supposed to be amused that the 26 year old lowered the pants of a 15 year old and gave HER the \\"spanking of my life?\\" Should I find it romantic that he commited statutory rape? (17/28...hello people?!) And where is the chemistry? I mean, I thought Gray from After the Night was taking it a little too far, but at least he and Faith had chemistry. Believable chemistry. All, in all, I guess Linda Howard fans will want to read it for the competionist point of view. But if you haven't read a Howard book, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reprint of early Howard; not one of her best","review":"Ignore the listed publication date-this is a reprint from 1983, not a new story.

But, God!He interferes in her life, cancels her date with another guy (even though he has shown no interest in her so far), then, when she is reasonably upset about it, he hauls her into another room, pulls down her pants, flips her over his knee and gives her, and I quote, \\"the spanking of her life.\\"I don't need a romatic hero, I don't even need one whose always very nice, but I draw the line at physically hitting a woman. It's a no. It's wrong, and these old romances seem to give women the idea that its romantic or acceptable. It isn't, ever, ok for a man to lay a hand on a woman.No, I'm not a femenist, I like a macho man's man as much as the next girl and Ms. Howard is normally a great writer who can deliver a tough guy who still doesn't actually physically hurt the heroine.

Ms Crispell usually has a percusssive approach to the instrument but here her touch brings out the lyrical side of her mastery, as well as her impeccable control of space. If anything, and even though this a democratic meeting of equals, I have to say Mr Peacock has never sounded so ravishing. There are four tracks devoted to \\"free\\" playing and eight \\"composed\\" one by Mitchell Weiss called Prayer. The clarity of every instrument on this recording is amazing, the piano sings, the drums are crisp but not dry, and the bass full and clear. There seems to be no barrier between the music and the listener. Musically and technically a very satisfying CD of contemporary improvised chamber music. Likely to remain a friend for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like Their First Album, Anyway","review":"A clockwork nightingale to the trio's own incomparable \\"Nothing Ever Was, Anyway.\\" The balance of harmonic sophistication and plain lyricism was a naturally emergent element in the earlier outing. I didn't need to read the liner notes' admission of programmatic lack of focus, either; it's just plain inattentive on some tracks and one or two technical blunders spoil a lot of it.These artists are capable of *so* much better; I wish ECM could have afforded another session or two for this album.

It is a biography of Grandma Moses' life. She was always interested in painting but really did not get to do too much until late in her life. We read this book for reading but would also make a good history book for the late 1800 - early 1900. It could also be used for art.

The lobbyist sometimes resorts to illegal means to accomplish his worthwhile goal of supporting children in underdeveloped nations. The CIA official is ruthless and uses murder, blackmail, and his considerable influence to further the power of himself and his agency. In the middle of this intrigue are Faith, the lobbyist's assistant and Lee Adams, a private investigator hired to protect her.

I admire his attempt to raise awareness for the plight of LDC's, but how about writing a readable book & subsequently donating the proceeds. This book reminds me of Grisham's Street Lawyer, more opinion than story. You would be better off rereading Absolute Power or The Winner, then plow through this sub par work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci Stock Plummets","review":"I should have heeded the other posts. No, I gave weight to the Amazon review which led one to believe this was much better than it indeed was. Do not disregard your fellow readers. Do not purchase.

I was not impressed with Baldacci's new \\"thriller\\" at all. In fact it made me do something that I hate doing, fast forwarding (skipping ahead).There is nothing in this book that I haven't read before. For God's sake, the guy names his dog Max! It lacks a unique story that I would have expected from Baldacci--good guy befriends woman in trouble, they fall in love, fight off bad govt. employee, climax at the end. I feel like vomiting the number of times I've heard this plot. If you are a reader who likes reading different subjects, then please spare yourself and skip this book.One final thing...I noticed that on the back cover of this book Dave is smiling--surely this is because of his paycheck and NOT because he has written something to be proud of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-paced and -witted","review":"This latest from Baldacci is worse than ever: condescendingly torpid storytelling and set-up, a phony love story between two protagonists who resemble life sized Barbie and Ken dolls, and all the action practically spelled out for the reader in capital letters. It's just dumb, dumb, dumb --it would be nice if Baldacci let the reader think for him or herself for once. But he persists in cranking out this third-rate junk. It's a sad slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite forced dialog","review":"characters act as paradies of real people. The author has a disgusting view of both the male and female anger and love.

Was this book rushed, written to quickly to satisfy the publisher's contract? Where is the imagination? Where is the \\"unpredictable\\" suspense.

Unfortunately, well written words do not a good novel make. The characters and plot were far too predictable for my tastes. I suppose one could liken this work to a poorly researched, Tom Clancy wannabe. Perhaps Mr. Baldacci watched too many episodes of Mission Impossible as a child. The representations of the CIA and FBI agents as a mix of Attilla the Hun and Barney Fife was just too hard to swallow. And really, a drunken, naked, abusive, nearly sexual assault scene? Do books need a sex rating like the movies? I can't deny that I was entertained - I like spoofs as much as the next guy. Unfortunatley, I doubt that the authors intent was a parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak plot","review":"Being a Baldacci fan I was quite disappointed by Saving Faith. I think that the premise of the plot, a lobbyst turns to corrupting U.S. lawmakers to help third-world populations, is quite unbelivable. The best part of the book is the relationship between Faith and Lee while both the Tornhill and the Buchanan characters are not well defined. The second part of the book is quite predictable and there are no surprises as in Baldacci's previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Faith","review":"I could not believe how boring and predictable this book was.

How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.

Similar to Richard North Patterson. Unfortunately Balducci's stories (except Winner) doesn't read like a Patterson book. Saving Faith actually started out very good, but toward the middle it started to fizzle. I didn't care about the characters at that point. Even though Balducci is a better writer than the other Patterson (James), I think Richard North Patterson is the top guy in his field."},{"rating":"1","title":"If all his books are like this . . .","review":"I have never read a Baldacci before, and I can't say that I'm sorry. I always read books thorugh even if I don't like them, but this one has been painful from the start. I'm sad to say that I will not be finishing this one, and that I will probably donate it to the public library. Obviously Baldacci's other books must be better, or we wouldn't be a bestselling author. I have found Saving Faith to be confusing, somewhat boring, and lacking a hook to get me interested. I'm about 50 pages into it and I still don't know what the whole ting is about. I think I'll stick to Grisham for crime thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Effort","review":"Fbi, Cia, lobbyist on capitol hill, murder, romance, espionage, all in this book.

This has to be the most boring book I've read since required reading in high school 25 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO SLOW!!!!!!!","review":"The first David Baldacci book I have read and if I don't change my mind will be my last. There was some few very good pages but most of the pages seemed to be just talk. People would spend page after page talkng about what was gong on or thinking and talking about what had happened to them in the past. Much to slow moving for me. Also to unbelieveable. I think things do go on in our government that are wrong but this is so far out it is unreal. No need to talk about the characters as I did not even finish the book, yes, I did give it a chance, read to page 300 and thought that was enough. Very, very slow moving!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith needed to be saved...","review":"Look! There on the shelf! Is it a political thriller? Is it a spy story? Is it a techno-thriller? Yes to all of the above! I've yet to be disappointed by one of Baldacci's books, and this one is no exception. At times, though, it seems he's having to work really hard to keep the suspense building, rather than just bringing things to a conclusion.All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Strong as Other Baldacci Novels","review":"\\"Saving Faith\\" can be described in one word--predictable. This book seemed to go on forever with relatively no excitement. After getting off to a quick start, Baldacci lets the rest of the book stumble over what is supposed to be suspense. When something did happen, you already guessed it about fifty pages ago. Reading it becomes more like a job instead of enjoyment. I was very dissapointed with the book, especially after reading \\"Absolute Power\\" and \\"The Winner\\". I suggest reading those before you try this one. They are much more surprising and entertaining.Just a hint--read the first fifty pages. Then skip to about page 350 for the suspense to pick back up again. You will not miss anything and the book will be more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the faith-this book is great!","review":"I read this book a while ago and really enjoyed it. Then I read more of David Baldacci's work and liked it all--however, \\"Saving Faith\\" is still my favorite. It has everything, suspense, well drawn and compelling characters, a tightly woven plot, romance and intelligent dialogue. I won't rehash the plot. You'll have to read the book for that- but you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he phone this in?","review":"I've read everything Baldacci's written and liked most of it. This book, however, is a trite, contrived, predictable, boiler-plate mess!Nothing about the story really \\"grabbed\\" me and there was nothing compelling me to continue, so about 3/4 of the way through, I just quit. I read the last three pages, and found out what I already knew would happen...no surprises and certainly no interest for me.Thrillers should pull a reader in and not let go until the very end. As thrillers go, this was a dud.Read some of the earlier works. Don't waste your time on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This book didn't begin to meet the quality of \\"Total Control\\" and \\"Absolute Power\\" or even \\"The Winner.\\" There was little mystery or suspense. The illegal government conspiracy plot was boring and hard-to-believe. The government, FBI and CIA characters were not developed into people that were interesting or worth caring about. The \\"love\\" story between two of the characters was on the level of a cheap dime-store paperback romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having trouble sleeping?","review":"I have been a fan of David Baldacci's writing since his first novel Absolute Power. Each of his subsequent novels were high octane thrillers which kept me glued to the page. However, Mr. Baldacci has certainly slipped down a few notches in my estimation of his talent, with his latest book. This story is patently predictable from the start, and there is nothing new here to make this book worth reading. Didn't anyone at Warner Books bother reading this before publishing it? I experienced some trouble finishing it, but it was only because it kept putting me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Disappointed!","review":"I have followed Mr. Baldacci's books from the beginning and was looking forward to his newest. I found the more I read of \\"Saving Faith\\", the more bored I became. Too much detail went into the political agendas, and not enough into the three main characters - Lee, Faith and Buchanan. I wanted more suspense, not just two or three lines every few paragraphs. I don't think that I will be buying the next hardcover, because I feel that I have wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made it 'til the end","review":"There were a few times that I almost put the book down on the \\"couldn't finish it\\" pile, and I fell asleep once while reading it. That has never happened to me before. I believe the reason is that I had a good idea what the ending would be, and there was a lot of tedious information on Lobbying. But, what bothered me most was the amazing coincidence in the book that broke any belief I had in his story line. This was also true in \\"Simple Truth\\". I am now reading Carl Hiaasen's new book \\"Lucky You\\", also dealing with Lobbyists, and I know it is a total farce. I am having an easier time accepting all the absurdities in \\"Lucky You\\" than I had accepting the single coincidence in \\"Saving Faith\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Baldacci's Earlier Standards","review":"This book is overblown (too much writing about each incident or item). This book is not very credible (too many 'shazam' escapes, no credibility of the villain's role in his organization...who is his boss?, why is he able to act so independently in what we all know to be first and foremost a cumbersome bureaucracy?). The hero is too 'magic'. The women are too pure-hearted. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes \\"Faith\\" to finish this book","review":"David Baldacci's latest is one big disappointment. I have read all the others, but this one isn't even close to being in their league. The plot is thin, the characters are not very believeable and the result is contrived. I hope the next one finds him returning to a better work, but I will check it out before I just buy it on his up 'til now well deserved reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes. A winner here.","review":"Five stars. I think reviewing a novel is best achieved by comparing it to others most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. Keeping Faith is a spellbinding novel of intrigue, it has the relentless pace and stunning power of The Triumph and the Glory, the plot twists of Grisham at his best, the vivid imagery of Cold Mountain, and the style and flavor of Tom Clancy's Executive Orders."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING! Baldacci does it again.","review":"This books flows remarkably well you will be on page 451 without even knowing it. After reading Absolute power and seeing the movie I became a die hard Baldacci fan. The Simple Truth was very good, however this book was better. I found I related to the character Lee Adams very well being a 6 foot 5 240lb man with very blue eyes. I found myself really relating to him. To all women considering this book I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one a disappointment","review":"I have purchased all of Baldacci's hard covered books and enjoyed them. \\"Saving Faith\\" is his first let down and disappointment. The plot became muddled and it was an effort to finish it. I will think twice before I invest in his next hard covered book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted and Forced","review":"I've enjoyed his previous books, but this one seems forced, like he needed to quickly produce something to meet a deadline. The plot wasn't very interesting, the characters never really captured me, and the whole FBI vs. CIA theme was way overblown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly, the worst book I,ve read","review":"Ouch, thats a pretty bad title but I paid a whopping 8 bucks or so for this alleged thriller and was determined to finish it.I have put it down at least ten times for many reasons, 1, it really stinks, 2,very poorly written,3, lousy boring plot 4,naive horridly constructed characters 5.He,s really written a few books we,ve all enjoyed and now is doing it purely for dough.Oh, well, ;its better than getting maimed in a car wreck, or a huge bill from the IRS or your Dr. saying,\\"oh, this doesn,t look too good\\" while reviewing your lab work, or various types of std,s.Uh, that would be sexually transmitted diseases and is too much of a low blow to count but its what came to my slightly demented but highly educated mind at the time.Avoid this book.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy and forgettable","review":"Ever had a book hangover? You know the feeling that you get when you've read a brilliant book and you can't get it out of your head? OK, well you won't have to worry about it with Saving Faith. It's about a woman named Faith and a guy called Lee and the CIA and FBI and it's set in Washington and people get killed and rescued and shot and stuff. I read it in 24 hours, and beyond that description all I can say is I wish I knew what happened to the dog. Did the FBI hurt it when they stormed the house???? If you're doing a last minute trawl through an airport book store to find a book, sure, grab this one. If you've got time, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good","review":"This book is pretty boring and not very well written. Baldacci's writing style is flimsy, awkward and fairly transparent. He uses a lot of words and basically says very little. His characters come to conclusions that make them sound like they are in sixth grade. Also the whole CIA vs. FBI thing got very dull and tedious. I found it virtually impossible to believe that the CIA would ever employ someone so incredibly stupid and arrogant as Thornhill. Don't waste your time with this horrible book, if you have some extra time on your hands and want a good suspence novel re-read Michael Connelly's: The Poet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diane Yannick","review":"David Baldacci, you should be ashamed of yourself!

But, give it to page 50 and the plot begins to come together. There are more initials...CIA, DDO, FBI, CTC, PAC, etc. in the first few chapters, than Liz Taylor's monogrammed towels. The plot coasts along, in predictable hate/love/hate/love fashion, until someone has a close call with death. The punchline ending is the best part of Baldacci's talent, as it features a few surprises. The \\"bad guys\\" are revealed and everyone lives happily ever after, under the safe umbrella of some \\"initials\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"or better yet, get it from the library, so you don't spend money on it.

I liked the title. And that was it. The first part boring, annoying - no Baldacchi at all. The last few pages with the big show-down, that was a bit more Baldacchi. I can't recommend this book, sorry for this time, but I think, it's the most unlikely and rushed book I've ever read by Baldacchi.

Will not order from there again."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect fit on my inspiron 6000","review":"my old keyboard space bar went bad, and I was happy to find this one for such a low price. very easy to install (I am comfortable working on laptops and computers) and fits and works exactly as the original keyboard did. just what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dell 6000 keyboard","review":"Took a while to get here since couldn't choose the shipping method.

BEWARE !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit 9300","review":"1. the ribbon cable on the keyboard looks to the side of it, whereas in my inspiron 9300 the connector is at the bottom of the keyboard. Had to twist the cable a little to get it to the connector slot.2. the keyboard didn't quite close down after doing this, because the ribbon cable wouldn't fold3. It didn't work, anyway...probably a defective unit.on the native keyboard the ribbon cable goes straight down, directly to the connector slot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item","review":"The keyboard I received does not match description nor does it match the picture. key pattern is different, shape is different, mounting holes are different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful Product","review":"This keyboard was just what I needed. A near exact replacement for a failed laptop, saving a client much needed cash in a strapped economy. I would say my only (VERY MINOR) complaint would be the lack of installation instructions. I have enough experience in repairs to know how to install keyboards but the lack of instructions might cause less experienced DIY'ers to send the item back thinking it was wrong fit. The Dell Insspiron 6000 has an adapter you have to swap to make this work whihc is not the sellers fault but even Dell doesn't mention removing the adapter to put a new board in. I blame Dell not the maker of the replacement keyboard for poor documentation, I just wanted to say something about it for others to know. The adapter requires you to pop the tabs open slightly on the side of the ribbon in order to remove old ribbon and snap back in place after installing new one. Overall easy replacement, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Bought it to replace my Inspiron 9200's keyboard but there was no use to it. Although the size was a perfect fit the ribbon cable on the keyboard had a connector which wasn't needed (as someone said, on the native keyboard the ribbon cable goes straight down, directly to the connector slot) and even after carefully removing it without damaging the actual thing and making it go in place (which by the way had to be done by twisting the cable around) many keys wouldn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"some of the keys don't work","review":"no instructions and most keys don't work.seemed to be used also. some stains on the keys. i will be returning right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lyrical voice","review":"Fashions exist in poetry, as in most things, and David Anthony is not afraid to be unfashionable--both in using traditional forms such as sonnets, villanelles, and triolets and in revealing emotions such as affection, sympathy, and nostalgia, which can get writers labeled sentimental. But there is a subversive character to his use of forms: he uses the triolet, usually a lightweight form, to tackle serious themes, as in \\"A Winter Funeral,\\" and can poke fun at the conventions of sonnet-writing in the course of writing a sonnet, as in \\"Stuffing It In.\\" He has some amusing versifications of well-known jokes (my favorite is \\"Cushioning the Blow\\") and takes a wide-ranging interest in the world around him, in poems about his native Wales, England, America, and Japan, showing a fondness for Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Harry Potter, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Always accessible, he can be conversational, but most often is notable for the lilting, lyrical quality of his lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This software is a mess!

Avoid this product unless you already have a basic concept of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Money","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews on this product before purchasing it. I would have saved my money. These \\"instant immersion\\" CDs have you attempting to respond to conversations and place words in correct grammatical order without ever giving you the translation. You don't even find out where the glossary/dictionary is kept until you are well into the first hour of lessons.Worst of all, there are glitches in the software that cause it to create nonsense words. This is especially evident in the dictionary and the crossword puzzle.What good is language learning software that creates nonsense words, I ask you? Honestly, this program is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Stay away from this product. Besides the software setup being very confusing, the lessons themselves don't seem to be organized properly. A good language software should build the next lesson based on the previous knowledge. However, this one didn't seem like that, it would throw new grammar, vocabulary without ever introducing it before; I found this very confusing, had to click on the dictionary button constantly to figure out the exercise. Because I had some background in Italian before, I was OK for the first few lessons, then I was completely lost. I can't imagine anyone with zero background learning anything from this software. Unless you are trying brush up on what you once knew, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!","review":"The first 3 cds are audio only and there is no book to go with it....

I have tried so hard on multiple occasions to use this software thinking that if I just keep going I will start learning. NOT!!! I am so confused so fast that I get frustrated and give up! Within minutes it wants you to be able to fill in blank sentences and crossword puzzles when you have no clue of any vocabulary!!There are word associations but it does not tell you anything about the words at all, it just wants you to match them. I end up just guessing over and over until it tells me I have it right.Now I am reading a great book on Italian and am looking for some new software. I'm hoping that once I start learning the language I can go back to this software and it will be really great."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad for beginners","review":"Listen to these reviews, because everyone is correct. DO NOT buy this product if you know no italian whatsoever. This product is only good for people who have previously studied italian for a few years and want to brush up on it. I took one semester of italian in college and although i know some basic words, this program is still difficult for me, because you are asked to complete activities, like filling in sentences, without having learned any vocab. I should have listened to these reviews in the first place and spent extra money on the Rosetta Stone program, at least people were happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it","review":"I wish I read the reviews because they are right, this product sucks! If you don't know any Italian or even a little, this product is useless. It is more like a word activity software, but oh yeah, you have to understand the language to use it. I don't think they have any English in there, so you can't really learn what is going on. If I were you, I would not buy this software if you want to learn the language! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"I was really excited to get started in my quest for a second language, but this software really put a damper on that. I thought I was missing something, that there HAD to be more translations somewhere, but after reading all of these reviews, I see that most people are having the same problems. I know ZERO Italian, and it's obvious that this program assumes that is not the case. It seems to me that it is assumed you are quite fluent in the language and are only trying to brush it up a little bit. On top of that the software is really hard to get through. I'm sure eventually that part would get easier, but I'm not going to put any more time into this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"A lot of mistakes in the CD's.

It feels like an extension of my hand. My favorite -- until a year ago when I first picked up the Shun santoku.I still love my Henckels and use it for tough jobs but for everything else, the Shun is more versatile. Deadly sharp out of the box and has easily maintained the edge (I use steel with each use and a Chef's Choice sharpener when needed), it handles perfectly. Perfect balance, easy to control, it can handle precise trims of small work, slice a delicate tomato with the ease of a breath, or draw through big meat.I've recommended this knife many times and everyone loves it. It's my most-used knife -- the one I pick up the instant I walk into the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"food sticks to knife","review":"anything you cut with this knife will become glued to the blade and you have to force it off with your other hand. get the one with the blood grooves or you will suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shun Santoku Sharpening","review":"The many five star reviews with which I concur, justly recognize this superior knife. I just bought a third as a gift for my hosts upon sharing a week at their home. The second was a present to our foodie kids a couple of years ago. The original purchase, was my wife's Christmas gift. After three years it isn't as sharp as a new one. Still it's noticeably better than every other knife around.As woodworker my chisels and planes are nice and sharp. But this knife is something else. The Shun website includes instructions for returning the knife to them in Portland for free sharpening including return shipping. The biggest disadvantage is turn around time without this go to implement, about a month, and one way shipping cost. They offer an electric sharpener. But it's cost is more than half of another knife which I intend to buy before returning our original for them to restore."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STUFFED POTATO FROM FROZEN","review":"These potatoes are full of good flavor and you can easily eat the skin and all.

Serious doubts.This reminds me of Davie Jones' many jokes about buying a cheap device from a One Hung Low company. I will abstain from purchasing from this vendor.Amazon! For shame! If you're collaborating to fullfil the purchase order and giving the product and vendor the Amazon Prime treatment, you should at least review the product on your sight.

The Boston Massacre, the fighting at Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill, the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's ride, are just a few of the events that took place in Massachusetts. This slim book will tell you all about it, and more.The \\"Portrait of America\\" series is a wonderful introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. This \\"Massachusetts\\" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like \\"History\\", \\"Culture\\", \\"Economy\\" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. The \\"History\\" section is, of course, the most satisfying part of this volume.This book, as well as the entire \\"Portrait of America\\" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grass Really is Greener on the Other Side!","review":"Don't waste your carbs and calories on tumaro's low carb tortillas.

One day my husband helped me by grocery shopping and brought home \\"Mission Low Carb Wheat\\" wraps. I was steamed. I made this dip and wanted to bake low carb chips.

The texture is also dry and quickly hardens when you warm the tortilla making it feel like cardboard.If you're buying these as a bread substitute, be aware that they won't taste well with everything. If you use lots of vegetables and spices, they're alright. But if you try to make a simple cheese wrap it will taste awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent ensemble playing","review":"I have performed the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quintets in concert and the difficuly level is quite high. The Stockholm Chamber Brass do very sensitive performances on each quintet, but (my only complaint) the horn player needs to be heard much more clearly. The performances are almost a note-for-note duplicate of the Empire Brass Quintet recordings released during the 70s. The many tempo changes are treated with a delicate feel and a positive forward movement. The 2+3 (5/4) second movement of Quintet No. 1 are very quick, but with a sure knowledge of the structure. The trumpet/trombone cries of agony in the Andante movement of Quintet No. 3 are superbly performed. This is a truely fine addition for any brass player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it be about Marsden Hartley","review":"This film has some value with information about Marsden Hartley, the man and the artist. But unfortunately the huge ego of the filmmaker gets in the way. Somehow the film ends up being about him and not the artist. Since he directed the film, he has given himself ample camera time. The camera stays focused on the filmmaker as he lectures the audience (sometimes for several long minutes!). Instead, we could have seen more of Marsden Hartley's artwork (sadly very few of his work are shown in this film). The filmmaker should be commended for taking on the task but he ruined the film by turning it into a long lecture and making questionalbe and not very well researched pontifications. Case in point: Marsden Hartley was a Nazi Sympathizer!!

If you have not yet encountered Holmboe's symphonies, I would recommend starting with the CD containing 8 and 9, both of which are rich orchestral works that sound good on first hearing and invite repeated listening to absorb their aesthetic content.The other CD gets off to an unpromising start, as 1 and 3 are pleasant but do not, at least to these ears, bear repeated listening.

His style and simplicity as it pertains to the blues is incredible. Thank you Brother - your music is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game A Must Buy!","review":"Alright first of all. Okay 10-Year old kid that wrote very dissapointing. Your review is terrible, the game is worth alot more praise than what you gave it. The graphics could not really be any better, if the graphics had to be better go buy an x-box. Alright now. This game is great. Its got a terrific story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting to play more. The squad based features are very cool along with the whole trust interface feature to make it even cooler. What I like the most is that you can give your members the gun you want to give them, have them heal you, have them fix things for you. The only downside is that you cannot cure them of an infection. This game is just too cool for me to explain in 1000 words. Go rent it see if you like it and knowing that you'll probably like it then go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I like the idea of a video game based on the movie \\"The Thing\\" by John Carpenter, and I was excited to see how they would play on the fear the players had toward eachother- \\"Is he the Thing? Is She??\\" As it turned out the game play was extremely slow moving, and at first the controls and interface were difficult master. The graphics are a bit dated, and if you walk close to wall, you may get a piece of the other room on screen. In addition, it really didn't follow the movie at all. It seemed closer to a sci fi shooter like Cold Fear or Extermination, rather than the mind games I assumed it would contain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thing PS2","review":"If anyone thinks this game stinks,they are crazy!!!My son and i both love this game!!!It has suspense,horror,state of the art graphics,and lots of violence,it's like playing a horror movie!!!This game was the best game decision i ever made...If you ever want a good action game this is the game you should check out!!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I've only been playing this game two nights and I'm ready to just give up on it.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK! The plot is horrible, the gameplay is immensely dull and the graphics are 2nd rate at best. This game makes a mockery of th John Carpenter classic. You will be ready to hurl your controller through the TV after you try to kill a larger alien with fire (which is the ONLY way to kill them) and run out of fuel and die a horrible grisly demise or light a fuel barrl on fire and die a horrible grisly demise 100... times in a row.

I'm a huge horror movie/game fan and I almost crapped in my pants when my buddy changed into the THING the first time. Also it has in my opinion, the best atmosphere in any game PERIOD. I find the other reviews kinda funny, most are split between not liking and loving this game.I love it. The only bad thing is, you have to exit to the main menu to load a game every time you die(this happens a lot). Other reviewers were correct in saying this game is tough, I beat this game in a week, but played hours every night.Very challenging, and if you buy into the atmosphere you will sweat from the tension, when you finally beat a level/boss or the game you just'll sit back and let out a big sigh of relief.

The best thing about this game that is different from other games are the fear and reaction-interaction of the other teamates with the main character. They aren't just a bunch of mindless backup guys that do whatever you tell them. If they get to afraid, they could start freaking out and blasting their gun at you or other teamates. It's up to you to keep their fear level down. The graphics are a little gruesome, especially when using the sniper rifle. This game does live up to the movie! I read a couple of reviews where they said it was a cheap imitation of socum or half life. This game is more like resident evil with soldiers & monsters instead of zombies. If you like any of the resident evil games or blade 2, then this is the game for you. I'd like to see more games like this being made! So far, this is the only game made where the backup guys are not a bunch of mindless robots."},{"rating":"1","title":"i just didn't feel it","review":"i don't have a lot to say except that the game is frustrating and dark.i know this is not helpful but i just wanted to express myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad game based on one of the best horror movies ever -","review":"An absolute joke of a game, with many unintentionally hilarious moments. There are quite a few bugs and errors, and the whole game seems unpolished and unprofessional.Why they bothered tying it into the movie is beyond me, they just didn't make good use of the license. Most of the time you are running around in the snow or some featureless hallway with not much clue of what you are doing.Save points are spaced ridiculously, some are too close together, some too far apart.Trust system works....not at all. All your companions \\"turn\\" so there's seriously no point to it. As for story and character developement...forget it!A special mention about the bosses in the game because they are stupid. Last boss is easiest of all and the second boss you can just run past to the next level.Badly designed in all areas, boring, and directionless, with characters you don't care one whit about.

Actually, the thoughts I had of putting a gun in my mouth were much more entertaining than this piece of shiz. I mean seriously, at least if I put a gun in my mouth I get to have complete control of the gun and where the bullet ends up. The latter statement brings me to my main point, and that point being, if I can't control the aiming process of my gun then what am I actually doing? Why do the gaming companies feel like they have to cater to people by implementing a lock on aiming system rather than a manual one. It completely takes the fun out of the entire experience. Whats truly amazing about this game is the fact that even with automatic aim implemented it's still a freaking hard game!

Savina Yannatou sings not only in Greek, but also in Turkish, Arabic, Ladino, Spanish, Sardinian, Corsican, Provancal, Hebrew, Albanian and Syriac! Her voice is pristine and almost too beautiful. The last song is particularly interesting, being a mixture of a Thracian mourning song for the lost Constantinople and a North African love song in Arabic.

The best song is the theme song and Ocean City Girl, because when my husband and I were driving to Assateague Island, Maryland this summer, he played Ocean City Girl for me when we drove through Ocean City, Maryland.

If this border didn't protrude all the way out to be flush with the dash, but instead was flush with the radio face, then this wouldn't be an issue.Google Tacoma radio installations and you will see what I'm talking about.

The Scosche kit is absolutely hands down....night and day better than the Metra. The Metra would not allow me to use the factory DIN sleeve with my stereo, which I must admit, I like to do when installing stereos. So I had to try to use the \\"hard\\" mount method. The Metra doesn't have the screws you need to do this with the kit, shows you how, but doesn't ship with all the stuff needed to accomplish it. When I did buy the screws and installed it, the fit was terrible! There's a gap all the way around the stereo face.

The only slight improvement that they could make (in my opinion) would be to provide a piece of non slip material for the floor of the storage area beneath the radio, but I will use some of the material I bought to line the drawers of my rolling tool box.

I think that it is the right thing to put Bruce Lee on videogames,to remember one of the gratest fighters of all in history of martial arts.i recommend this game to all fans of fighting games, and thosewho are martial arts fighters, so they can learn moves fromLee."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright","review":"I enjoyed all of the action fighting scenes. But there is almost no story line to this game. You couldent do anything else but beat people up. Also beating them was almost too easy at times. You can buy upgrades for yourself but it barly made any noticeable difference. If your realy realy loved final fight for snes, even though Bruce Lee isn't half as good as that game you might enjoy it. otherwise I just wouldent suggest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPIDEST GAME EVER MADE","review":"this game just bugs me. i've seen some of his movies there great but this games SUCKS! the story you don't learn until the 5th level. the dragon coins? big whoop. the whhaa sound he does every punch or kick. it gets very anyoning. get this you have to buy move! why not just have say expirence and learn with the right amount. once you are a black belt you still get beat by fat, weak, and slow guys. to sum it up, this games blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get past the horrible gameplay","review":"I rented this game just to check it out. I expected a poor story and ok fighting gameplay (in other words my expectations were not high). I was still very dissapointed. I can't really comment much on the story or on the game as a whole because after about 10 minutes of punching the A button (or was it the B) I couldn't take it any more and returned the game. The fighting gameplay is incredibly primitive. It's on par with something like Double Dragon from the 80's. Definitely do not buy this game without renting it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is terrible","review":"This game is bad as hell. If you like then thats fine but the Xbox should have improve it more with better graphics and the fighting styles. The fighting stlyes were pathetic and now they give this review almost 3 star, I wont give it 1 star and a half. This game is wasting my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Satisfied","review":"The first game i've ordered on amazon and it was like new, not a scratch!

The graphics sucks and the plot of the story doesnt even make any sense at all. Dont waste your money on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"There he is. Lets, get em\\"","review":"This is just another bad attempt to try to capture the coolness of Bruce and bring out only the bad. If they couldnt get his face right they shouldve tried to capture the mood, wich is what new games often neglect for the sake of realism. It should have been a role playing game. There have been so many attempts to capture the mood of a good old Bruce movie that it wont probably ever be given the chance to do it the right way again.. I think they could've simulated the shadeing and lighting of the cameras in those times to make it more nastalgic. It just seemed like a typical shallow representation of Bruce Lee. I cant wait to see the day when video games cancapture worthwile personalities with out messing them up. It is still a fighting game though and still adictive so it isnt a waist and is cool at times. They did though do a good job at capturing the stupid personality of the cheesey bad guys along with thier bad acting you would see in a 70's movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Everything","review":"This game has bad everything. Bad setup (aka you can beat bosses with your eyes closed.) Bad graphics. Bad Consistancy (With gameplay and graphics.) All of that together = a game that is not worth buying.

One of the best decisions I've made! This game has horrible camera work (no control at all) and the button lay-out is also terrible. Maybe if it was made by a better company that has been making games for awhile it could have been better, but it would require better button layout and control and much better camera work!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"Herky-Jerky movement and mindless button mashing are what describes this game best. That, combined with low-rate graphics is why this game could very well have been released on PSONE. The game reminds me of the repetitive side-scrolling games of the late 80's where you just kick kick punch punch, then move a little farther..kick kick punch punch..yawn yawn. Skip it and demand more from game developers. I'd prefer to wait two more months for the developers to iron out all of the kinks than to get a game that's released before it's properly tested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The sound and the cinematic story are the only part that kept me from giving this game a negative score. The gameplay is boring as can be, due to the repetetive nature of it all. sure you develop/buy new moves, allowing for more moves, but overall, the game is move from section to section and beat up the bad guys.Moral of the Story: This game is Boaring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Linda Howard run out of NEW things to write?","review":"I can't understand why Linda Howard is reissuing her earlier work? 1) It's not good. and 2) These stories DO NOT hold up over time. I got through the first 67 pages, and had to stop reading it because I kept rolling my eyes. Dialogue and characters are vapid. Just couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad on many levels","review":"This is a re-issue of one of Howard's earliest paperback books, and should have been clearly indicated as such before readers pay the very high hardback price. A cheat on that level, and a really bad book besides. While I vastly prefer Howard's older style of writing, she hadn't yet put together her signature elements of alpha male/woman who softens him in any believable or even enjoyable way. These characters are cringe-worthy: the \\"hero\\" is arrogant, obnoxious, mean and dated in style, verging on sadistic. The heroine is just too cutesy and wide-eyed innocent to be either engaging or even likeable. The two together strain credulity and the outdated plot makes it worse.This is a book that should have been left decently buried as a weak effort in Howard's evolution, not put before the current buying public in hopes that they won't notice it's old and shell out a price that is 4 or 5 times what the book originally cost. Don't be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously - There went a few hours of my life I'll never get back!","review":"WHAT ON EARTH is a modern day author thinking writing a story where the \\"hero\\" is a pushy, disrespectful, cave man like \\"Brett??\\" And the biggest emotion I could muster for the main character \\"Tessa\\" was relief that women as stupid as she is portrayed are few and far between. I was insulted that such an ignorant and insulting portrayal of a female falling all over some man who was one hair short of being a rapist and abuser, was how this story was told. HORRIBLE book... It's the first and last I've read that this author wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't my favorite","review":"This one isn't nearly as good as some of LH's other works. Brett was rather boorish, rude and manipulative (The best part is when Tessa throws some lemonade at him...believe me, you will cheer). Our heroine turns into a quivering lump of jelly when suspected of embezzlement. I'll give it 2 stars for the lemonade scene. Tess and Brett aren't even in the same ballpark as and Marlie, Faith and Gray etc. They are as poorly rendered and unlovable as that Greek jerk in \\"All that Glitters.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"re-release from 1985","review":"This book, originally released in 1985, is a waste of money. Ms. Howard should be ashamed to have inflicted this on her readers by writing in the first place and again by this misrepresentation as a new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scammed","review":"my wife is a long time Linda Howard fan and is livid with anger over being scammed into buying a 27 year old book. I'm happy since I feel this will save me money as she said Linda Howard!

If this is a test then here's hoping it fails big time.Just a quick note...Howard has always been an auto-buy. Love her books & have reread most of them - some several times so usually remember if I've read her book before. Howard should be honest in trying to reach readers new to her writing but have respect for her older readers that do remember - AND above all be honest in pricing her reruns. This issuance is a slap in the face as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful as usual!!!!","review":"This book is worth reading!!!! LInda Howard did a fabulous job as usual!! It was riveting especially when I saw how they could overcome their differences (or rather, grievances)and come out scathed, but alive and more mature in their relationship.

Shame on Linda and the publishers for this scam, glad I dodged it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another disappointment...","review":"Thankfully I've been fooled by publishers enough in the past to check the reviews first before I purchase books by some of my favorite romance authors. Publishers will keep doing this as long as there are people out there who will click buy without researching (and who should have to?!). The real thing that grated was the fact that Amazon sent this to me in an email titled \\"Linda Howard's new book\\" ...there's no need to lie, Amazon. If you were lied to, you should make the publisher aware that your customers don't appreciate this duplicity and get them to stop. Otherwise you're just as guilty."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap shot at scamming LH fans","review":"On a tip by other reviewers, I went to my old paperback collection, and there it was, this cheesy but still enjoyable (at 1985 paperback price) drama. Howard's later writings are much more polished and exciting to read, so I would have been tricked into buying this had other reviewers not warned me. Shame on this publisher! Short term profit for long term bad reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak early work of a great author","review":"This is an early (1985) Linda Howard and it shows! Her character development is really weak, the villain sticks out like a sore thumb, and the story is totally unbelievable (even for a romance). Of course, LH must have developed her ability to write a scorching bedroom scene early in her career. If anyone's really interested in LH, I would recommend Dream Man or Son of the Morning as two of her better works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda Howard knows how to keep readers enthralled in reading","review":"As most critics say you can't read just one Linda Howard. She knows how to blend a romantic story with strong lead characters in an intriguing storyline. I got hooked on her writings with \\"Mr. Perfect\\" a couple of years ago and have been actively searching and reading all her other books I can find. \\"The Cutting Edge\\" is one of her stories that will keep you turning pages late into the night because you have to find out how it will end. Brett's character is one you have to learn to appreciate, he doesn't show all his cards until he has no other choice. I don't want to give the story away, but you will love Tessa's strong will and deep sense of self-respect. She's a woman who's independence fights the challenges she faces. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Amazon","review":"Thankfully I recognized the text of the story. At first, since Amazon said it was a new book, I thought it was a continuation of Brett and Tessa's story. Why would anyone re-release a paperback into a hardcover? How many people were taken in by it? Shame on Linda Howard, shame on the publishers and shame on Amazon for marketing a book in such a manner. This is not good marketing, and from here on ANY Linda Howard books are suspect. It makes me suspect Amazon as well!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reissue","review":"Does this amount to false advertising? Since this book was initially published in 1985, in my opinion, it does. Several years ago Nora Roberts was faced with the same kind of advertising. The problem waw solved by putting NR on the uppper right hand corner of the dust jacket. It appears that this is a publishers decision since Amazon is advertising old Linda Howards books as new also."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This book is a release.

Unfortunately, within 6 months of heavy household use (no dishwasher, no dropping on the floor, no cutting on anything but cutting boards) this knife developed several sizeable chips that have been very difficult to sharpen away.

I don't let others use it. It takes a wicked edge and holds it great. Actually comes sharp from the factory, most knives don't come truly sharp. I can sharpen a piece of cardboard but this knife takes a keen edge like no other, better than any of my german knives. It is just the right size to do both nice garde manger work while also having utility as a general cutting knife too. I can't stress the quality of edge this blade takes on. If honed properly (always hone a blade the direction you steel it) it will get so sharp as to stick into the board it cuts on and retains that edge well. Every so often steel it on a good quality steel and it stays keen (I use an F. Dick micro steel; F. Dick makes the ONLY steels and cleavers in my book).

The problem is the writing. The movie can't decide whether to be a Romantic Comedy, a Romantic Tragedy, a Caper movie, a Rival Brothers movie, a Character Study, or any of several other things.It ends up trying to do all these things, and doing them all badly.Throwing in quirky characters helps, but only temporarily.Ultimately, the movie lacks energy. Lacks tension. Lacks conflict. Lacks suspense. Lacks coherence.It has lots of ideas, lots of (paper-thin) plot, lots of beauty, even lots of interesting lines, but none of these work together.Pity.It is no accident that by far the most interesting character is Bang Bang--who has no lines.Without a coherent script, no movie can succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially for fans of Brick and Wes Anderson","review":"Fantastic movie.If you're a fan of Brick, you'll probably be a fan of whatever this director does.

The idea that a story of control and bigger issues was written around a con is a interesting story line. The movie itself is a cute con with fake endings and lots of fun. It does take on some life issues. Is your life being controlled by someone who loves you or do you enjoy the freedom and pain of writing your own script. The idea that the writer of the script (older controlling brother) having to die to free his brother is intriguing. I am sure deeper stuff is present in this movie and a thoughtful person can have loads of fun just trying to pick up the angles in the picture. It is just a fun movie more than all. The \\"mark\\" is well played by a zany Rachel Weiz. Brody and Ruffalo do a great job too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, bizarre & amusing","review":"Very entertaining.

Anyway, the movie tries way too hard to be smart, and some of it was creative, but it just lacked that one important thing that keeps the audience interested: Entertainment! Its a shame, I all three actors, but just the way the movie did not flow right, trying to be funny in places when it was not, it was just downright boring. I'll be honest, I thought it was so bad I didn't finish it.It did however remind me of an older movie about two con artists, which was funny and entertaining, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, starring Steve Martin and Michael Caine. I do not recommend the Brothers Bloom movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hats off.. and on... then off again... then on again... then...","review":"I watched this movie on a plane flight from Chicago to Portland. All in all I'd rather have slept. This film is hard to describe, because it intentionally tries (very hard) to be clever and quirky. The writer seems to have a headware fetish as people wearing hats of every conceivable kind seems to be a major objective of the film. How many can you count? All kinds of hats. Even some of the statues in background scenes have hats. Oh yes, and eyeware. Goggles, regular glasses, sun glasses, enormous binnoculars take your pick. And gloves, multiple multiple gloves and handware. It seems they must have spent half the budget on hats, glasses and gloves for the charactors. Weird budget choice. Then there's the pointless and silly explosions through out the film. Same your money and more importatnly save your time. This is a bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start on a good read","review":"Ok, I like this book. It was a bit slow to start. Think of starting fire with two sticks and it took 120 pages to get fire. Once you sit through the set-up, it's a compelling read that cannot be put down. At a guess, I'd sat John Ringo has been hanging out with a scientist because there is a lot more science in this fiction than is usually the case with his works. I suppose that's the Taylor influence? Anyway, great read and kind of a unique variation on the replicating machine plot. Worth reading. Wait for the soft cover though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting start, but what next?","review":"Very interesting spin on one of the staples of the sci-fi genre: the alien invasion. The authors go to some length to give the bots in the book advanced technology but not so advanced that humans would have no chance of winning without some sort of impossible deus ex machina tactic ala \\"Independence Day\\".My criticisms would be that the book falls into a fallacy that many similiar books have done; while US soldiers are able to kill tens of thousands of bots using giant lasers, potato gun grenade launchers and explosive paint ball rounds, a full-scale nuclear strike from Russia and China doesn't seem to slow the bots down at all. And why exactly is the US going it alone in the world and not working with other countries to develop weapons to fight the bots?Overall it's very entertaining and worth a read. But what happens next? I don't think there is really enough interesting material to keep the series going for two more books as seems likely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good balance on technology, sci-fi and military material.","review":"Book starts slowly to build background for story (which I believe will be followed by additional books to complete it) for half of the book, and passes to fast paced action which is actually very fun to read, although some might find too thick to swallow.When moving to the book end it climaxes before ending leaving you wanting to know of how the things will eventually end. Hopefully there will more coming soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat characters and swis cheese like plot","review":"The book seems to be an attempt to a high paced plot but where Bolo series succeeded this one failed.

This book has little of his usual touch. It is burdened with huge amounts of scientific trivia. It interferes with the plot and makes the book only of interest to those to whom such trivia is of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I've read and enjoyed several books by John Ringo over the years but Von Neumann's War is one that I will discard from my bookshelf immediately.This book was nearly unreadable to me because of the mishmash of styles between Ringo's hard-boiled MIL-SF and co-author Travis M. Taylor's highly technical and verbose style. What resulted was a story that felt very stiff and academic even as it was trying to be a fast-paced thriller.Overall, this book focuses far too much on the science and not enough on the fiction as it goes on and on about technical minutia but leaves the reader wanting more in terms of character and plot.I've found that Ringo is at his best when writing alone or collaborating with David Weber. However, his mixed collaborations with other writers such as Travis M. Taylor, in this case, or Julie Cocherane in the case of Cally's War have turned out some of his worst material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, just plain bad.","review":"Barely any plot,no character development, an overuse of meaningless technical terms , a very USA centric book that seems to be devoid of any knowledge of anything outside the USA.I skimmed the last 1/3 of the book but the end was just as bad as all the rest.Dont bother to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The self replicating machines are coming.","review":"This is a quirky little tale about self replicating robots coming to call.

Since i refuse to buy Fantasy books in hardcover(I cant be seen with such a dorky item), i waited for my birthday and recieved it as a gift. This book isnt a masterpiece like the Vanyel series or anything, but it was quite adequate to fill me with the warm,fuzzy feelings Misty's work usually exudes.Tastes great,less filling.There are some inconsistencies in the text, both explicit and implied,but nothing focal or obvious enough to be really annoying.The funny thing is,i never particularly liked Skif in any of the other books-he always seemed kind of frumpy and uninteresting,even stupid.But this history of the pre-chosen Skif made me like him a lot more.In conclusion, this book is great for a nice Lackey fix, until her book about Alberich comes out this fall or whatever. I recommend you buy it in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who Dreams of being Chosen","review":"If you are familiar with Valdemar, you will most likely greatly enjoy this book, despite the few oops in continuity.

I love Mercedes Lackey and don't think this was her best effort. It was a good read and an entertaining story though. I thought Skif's backstory was interesting.The over use of dialect was bothersome and had the unfortunate tendancy to pull me out of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an interesting character!","review":"Having been a fan of Merceds Lackey for over a decade, I've gotten to the point where I can't wait for her books to come out in paperback. Her new books about individuals in Valdemar fit my impatience very well. Each book is tied into things I've already read about, but it doesn't leave me waiting for the rest of the story. I think it's an excellent way to fill in some of the colorful bits that might otherwise be overlooked in more sweeping epics.I enjoyed learning about Skif and the things that made him who he is. I particularly enjoyed her depiction of the life of a good-natured thief. There were parts of the story that could have used some more detail, but they did not significantly detract from the adventure. All things considered, it was a pleasant weekend diversion and a nice change of pace from the wars between nations. If only she could write as quickly as I want to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"\\"Take a Thief\\" was my first encounter with Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar. I dilligently trudged my way through the first half of the book, giving it a chance to get exciting. Luckily, I was more than rewarded. Once the book shifted away from Skif's life as a thief, I found it nearly impossible to put down, as I knew nothing of the lives and training of Heralds.Lackey does a wonderful job showing the true roughness of Skif's life and accents this with the written dialect she uses for his speech. It lent more crediblity somehow to Skif's situation.Looking back on \\"Take a Thief,\\" now that I have read The Heralds of Valdemar Trilogy, it is fun to see younger versions of some of the characters in those books.Bottom Line: Fun for non-Valdemar fans and a real treat for lovers of Valdemar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Thief","review":"Skif was a thief, and a herald, the first thief-herald, But he wasn't always a thief-herald, Take a thief by Mercedes Lackey, is the story of how Skif became a thief-herald. I didn't find this to be one of Mercedes best books, However I enjoyed this book very much. on a scale of 1 to 5 I would give this book a 4"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly one of the worst","review":"Generally, I find Mercedes Lackey's novels to be slightly strained as far as the plot is concerned, but the characters and major events of the stories are always vivid and memorable. This book, however, annoyed me no end. The plot is, for lack of a better word, terrible. The characters and events are not believeable. Also, many of the rules and laws of Heralds so well-known by all faithful readers are rewritten, and in a rather unsettling manner.In short, I would not recommend this book to anyone. Not even a devoted Lackey fan. It's hardly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro into the Valdemar Series","review":"I had never touched a Mercedes Lackey series before this - in fact, the only fantasy series I read regularly before this was the Xanth series from Piers Anthony. With this book, the purple cover and beautiful horse caught my eye and made me lift it from the shelf. The book description made me buy it, and the ensuing story made me love it! Immediately, afterwards, I began devouring the rest of this great Lackey series, and have now finished them all - eagerly awaing Alberich's book in October.For the reader like me who finds it difficult to leap into a new fantasy world, this book is great at \\"teaching\\" you this great new world. As Skif learns, you learn - and trust me, it's a great series to leap into, with so much great possibilities in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good book with a problem","review":"The low born speech wasn't easy to pick up at first and I didn't understand some words, but as I read more I got used to it. I really found myself enjoying the book until I got to the part with Alberich's Yoda impression. I know it has to do with him living in a foreign land and so his grammer isn't great, but it was too distracting and unreadable.from the author's website:\\"Alberich speaks in something like Germanic syntax. \\"The German plunges into a sea of rhetoric and emerges on the other side with a verb in his mouth.\\" (Mark Twain)Or Yoda \\"Backward teach you to speak will I\\" \\"Maybe it was a good idea in theory, but it makes Alberich's lines painful to read. Bad move."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 and a Half Stars","review":"This is certainly not the best Valdemar Novel, but it is an enjoyable read. Unless you hate accents. If you ever have any trouble reading accents, avoid this book, you'll never get past your annoyance.Me I like accents and I like this book. Light hearted and light reading yes, but it fills in more of the rich detail and character which most Valdemar fans are so fond of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"I dragged myself through the first few chapters wincing at the implied accents. Once the main character reached the Collegium I thought it would pick up, which it did, then began to lose momentum. I'll still wait for another Valdemar novel, but this one doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great look at the history of a thief...","review":"I think that this book is a great look at Skif. I was always wondering why and how he had become a thief, but nothing was ever said in the previous books. This book really clarified all of my questions. Im a big fan of the series, so I might be a bit biased... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards","review":"I was very disappointed with this one. If you bother to get through the thick accents that plague the first hundred pages, you might even manage to make it to page 300, where the real action of this 350page book begins. I usually really like her work, this was not typical.If you are a true fan, don't buy the hardcover, it will leave you feeling cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough about Skif","review":"In other Valdemar books, we learn that Skif can get in any room, remove any item from a person, and so forth. In this book, it seems that he isn't *that* good at pickpocketing on the street, even though he milks it in the Collegium. And then, it seems that he quits being a thief long before he becomes extremely talented at breaking and entering.I found this very inconsistent, and would have been more disappointed had I higher expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story painfully written","review":"I am a fan of the Valdemar books. Although they are not great literature, they are generally good stories. I looked forward to Skif's story, as I found him an interesting character, particularly when he was a Herald Trainee. This book was a huge disappointment. Alberich has started to speak like Yoda, the dialect was painful and painfully inconsistent. The plot was thin and predictable. I found myself putting the book down in disgust, or skipping pages that were just too awful. In the end, Skif is offered instant herald status for acting as a decoy. Hello? Lots of herald-trainees have done risky and noble deeds, and never a one went to instant Herald. The repeated references to Herald Myste were contrived and painful. I finished the book, but it was rather like a train wreck - it's horrible, you don't want to see it, but you can't help looking. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"I really loved this book! It was nice to return to Valdemar. This book is worth the money! The ending is better than some of her other works, this one did not feel rushed. The whole book was smooth and interesting, at no point was I bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the Valdemar stories","review":"Mercedes Lackey brings the world of Valdemar to life - her characters and their stories are easy to read and finish way too soon. Get to work, girl - give us more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is the first (and only) Valdemar novel I've read. I'm familiar with Mercedes Lackey's Elemental Masters series, so I already liked her style. This book looked interesting and I tried it out, and really liked it.This book is part of the Valdemar universe, but it can be read as a stand-alone novel, since I found myself able to keep up with the story, it was mostly self-contained and required little knowledge of the Valdemar universe it was set in. The story follows that of a young man named Skif who is at first raised by an abusive uncle, he then runs away and becomes a thief. The story is nicely-written and well-paced, and I enjoyed it from the first page to the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable essential","review":"I bought this as an addition to my office gear. I have a wall charger at home and a car charger (somewhere) in my car. But what happens when I'm at the office and my phone needs juice? Or I'm in my wife's car or out with our friends? I have this in a kit that I carry, literally, everywhere. No more worries about the phone going out when I need it most.

After charging it all night and connecting it, my two really enjoyed themselves. However...the charge only lasts about thirty minutes and then to recharge it you have to take the nose off, disconnect that, unscrew four screws, remove the battery and connect it to the charger. So..after thirty minutes of fun, you have to go through alot to recharge it and then use it again approximately five hours later. As far as I'm concerned, you only get about 30 minutes of fun a day out of it. Also..it's the weekend so I can't contact their customer service and they put on the box that you CANNOT return it the store where you purchased it after you have removed it from the box. I'm VERY disappointed. My 12 year old who weighs more than 100 lbs can't use it since the maximum user weight is 100 lbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY HAZARDOUS","review":"This product literally BLEW-UP in my son's face.

The author points out that chess is a lifelong learning experience and gives some good advice on starting out giving pointers on some errors most often made by beginners. The book has been helpful to me I have not yet gotten out of the novice status but I intend to! The book points out the names of the pawns and the arrangement of them on the board in a very helpful manner. The author does not patronize the reader but rather shows an interest in getting the reader ready to move forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better!","review":"I ordered this product in hope of a good program that would help me learn Japanese. I instead was found with a program that, instead of teaching, sent me more on my own to learn. Its a lot like going to a book shop and buying a Japanese dictionary.Though the program has a lot of information, it doesn't give a good guide to show you where to start. There wasn't even an instruction manual packaged with the software. I would recommend another product because I am very displeased with how this one is performing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This product is garbage... My mother is a native Japanese speaker, and I've taken two years of Japanese, so trust me and stay away from this product, as it does not address very important aspects of Japanese grammar which should be learned immediately upon an introduction to the language. Also, take note of all of JP26's (the aforementioned reviewer's) reviews...all of them are for Topics Entertainment products. I think that it would be safe to assume that JP26 is somewhat biased. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't teach you Japanese--There is no instruction!","review":"If you buy this product expecting it to teach you Japanese, you'll be extremely disappointed. It is a bunch of drills and exercises, but with no curriculum. Without a curriculum, it's impossible for a beginner to go through the drills with a clue as to what's going on. It's like taking a Japanese test without being taught any Japanese beforehand. Some of the drills, like voice recognition to test your pronunciation, are worthless gimmicks.The software itself is also poorly documented and when you load it up, you'll be wondering what it is you're supposed to do. I'm not sure who the target audience for this software product is. If you don't know much Japanese, you won't be able to use it. If you already know what the software requires you to know before you use it, you probably will be advanced enough to not need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever","review":"I have tried many different language programs and this is by far the worst. I couldn't even figure out how to use the thing. I really that learning a new language isn't easy, but this is by no means the proper way to go about it. The software is confusing, there is no reference book, and it is definately not for beginners. Stay away from this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Software","review":"Probably one of the worst pieces of boxed software I've seen. I've been learning Japanese on my own for 6 months and would really like some software to help me drill and provide some structure. This is not it.

Forget learning grammar or anything with this crap.I've gone with the Pimseleur Level 1 & 2 courses...much more expensive but worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this title just last night in the hopes of finding good software to help me learn japanese. Within about 5 minutes of installing it, I was ready to return it. It comes with no book, so I had to guess what all the CDs were first of all. After I figured that out, the program itself was confusing to navigate. What I discovered were a lot of weak looking drills that were basically for testing what I already knew about the japanese language. Unfortunately, what I know is NOTHING--that's why I bought the software in the first place!! I'm assuming that the \\"lesson\\" portion of the program was to teach me, but seeing how nothing happened when I clicked it, that didn't really help... (XP issue?). Hopefully BestBuy will let me return it even though I opened it... I really want my money back. If you want to learn japanese, you're probably better off getting a book instead. It may be harder, but at least you'll learn more from that than this software."},{"rating":"1","title":"No structure at all","review":"I came to this program with no experience with Japanese. For the longest time I thought I must be missing something. Where is step 1. Every section seems to require prior knowledge.I was able to muddle through it, but I felt like it was fighting me rather than trying to help me. I want to spend my brainpower learning how to speak Japanese, not trying to understand this program and its contents. It did make good use of the PC to help teach me how to say things. But most of the time I had no idea what I was saying.The interface was cute and clever, but helped to obscure the functionality of the program not make things clearer.In the end I just googled some lessons and found it much easier going. I think it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I would never recommend this software to anyone who was actually interested in learning a language.

After reading many books for many years, I have yet to find an author who breathes life into the characters more convincingly.

This is a worthy finish for the trilogy, and if you liked the first two, you won't be disappointed.I'd recommend stopping here and avoiding the \\"Dragon Token\\" trilogy which follows this one. That series takes place years later and focuses on different characters I liked less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series","review":"If you are patient and enjoy reading the details of how everything in the made up world came to pass, you will love this series.

None of the characters were really interesting and rather one diminsional. Rohans character was way too good and faultless it seemed.I couldn't stand the fact that every female in this book seemed to be blessed with red hair while living in a dessert. As a matter of fact the dessert would have darker skinned individuals not redheads or blondes with fair skin because of the heat of course, duh.Every female and male character seemed to be the virtualy the same, Sioned and Sionell as an example. The only character in this whole series I really liked was Andry because his character seemed to be developed properly unlike Pol's. Also Andry in my opinion unlike many of the other characters had faults, besides Pol's indifference towards Sionell not that I could blame the guy.Anyway don't waste your money on this series just go and get it from the libary if your interested in reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product, good price","review":"This cord was a great purchase.

In every book of hers where someone gets pregnant there is always a line about how they would never stoop to abort the kid. So here, the heroine's sister is passed off as a slut, where the hero bore equal responsibility for being careless. I hated the book. It pins the blame squarely on women and Brown needs to get rid of the notion that women are solely responsible for their actions. It reappears again and again in her other books.

I like trying new horror writers and Gord Rollo suprised me with this one. The beginning of the book takes place when our main characters are young boys. I found this part of the book to be really interesting and entertaining. The author spends a lot of time getting you to love his characters and the book is pretty frightening. Then we get to the second half the book which jumps ahead to where these characters are young adults and suddenly they're not as interesting for some reason and the creature isn't quite as scary. I started to feel a little disappointed where the book was going midway through but then the book took yet another complete turn. The last third of the book takes place in a prison and I found myself hooked once again. Looking back, this was an enjoyable read that I cruised through in a couple of days.

While King beautifully develops his characters and makes the reader interested in the everyday lives of the children of the book, Rollo simply can't seem to match up. The parts that I read weren't SCARY per say, they were disturbing in a disgusting way. Somehow King has his \\"monster\\" horrendously kill a cute little boy and it isn't disgusting, but Rollo has his kill a baby and it IS disgusting. Don't ask me what the missing element is to Rollo's novel, because I can't put my finger on it.I recommend Joe Hill's \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" instead. Excellent read, I guarantee that you will be creeped out by just reading the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland storytelling told blandly","review":"I wish I would've read the reviews before I bought this waste of paper. It is true that the opening sequence with its vivid description of blood-soaked mayhem does get your attention. But after that Rollo kicks it into neutral and idles along at a mind-numbing pace for 300-plus pages. It's sentence after sentence of boring explanation of what is happening to the boring characters. I really wanted this to be a good read, but instead it turned out to be a good example of how not to write a horror novel. Avoid this unless you're an English teacher wanting to show you students how easy it is to get the craft of storytelling wrong. And I would compare it Stephen King's IT in the way you could compare a fresh bouquet of fragrant roses to a torn black and white picture of wilted daisies: Yep, they're both flowers but that's all they've got in common."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!","review":"OK I LOVED JIGSAW MAN.

They were boys for only a few chapters and then they were adults and even less interesting. As for the plot -- did anyone really understand it? It was so complicated it ended up being laughable. I won't go into it if someone has the time to waste reading it, but I in no way recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This book is supposed to be superior to 'It'??? Laughable. There is no character development, no atmosphere. It is supposed to to be about a group of young friends battling this monster. They are young boys for a few chapters.

Author Gord Rollo is obviously someone knows and loves the horror genre, and that makes \\"Crimson\\" a lot of fun to read.

Except for one column from 1961, the book only has his columns from 1990 to 1998, columns he wrote after he received the Pulitzer Prize. Wouldn't a reader expect to see selected columns he wrote since the beginning of his career? After all, these are the ones which earned him his Pulitzer, not the ones after 1990!

Nine months later the screen went black and the \\"fun\\" began - scheduling and waiting for repairmen, sending the set to the repair shop, waiting for part after back-ordered part to be tried in the set. After eight weeks of repeated phone calls to the dealer, repair shop and Sony, Sony finally gave me a replacement - a REFURBISHED set, the same model as the piece of junk that I bought.

Howwever, the optical light engine, a $1400 part by the way, is backordered for about a month and a half from Sony. This is probably due to the fact that so many others are having the same problem. Sony has recently discontinued this model and now have a new one (which now fully supports 1080P).Do yourself a favor, ban Sony products.

Not only is this a matter of concern in terms of the stability of our food supply--lack of genetic diversity makes the few remaining species that are widely used much more vulnerable to unforseen problems--it means that many gardeners are being denied the opportunity to grow vegetables that are widely held to be better tasting.

While a compelling read, I also found it a difficult one. The reader is taken from the poverty stricken streets of London in the late 1700's to the penal colonies of Australia. Ms. Grenville presents a compelling account; at times stark, certainly not romanticized, giving readers insight into the conflicting moral/ethical issues into which the Thornhill family finds itself drawn.

It kind-of reminds me of the storytelling style of Diana Gabaldon. If you like Diana Gabaldon you would like this. Maybe not vice versa though, Gabaldon is a little racy. I really enjoyed the sneak peak into the lives in the story. I did however think the ending lacked a bit of oomph. The climax was a mini-climax.

In the novel, some recognise that there was a third way which alas was never accepted and troubls us to this day.The desription of the river and its power and beauty is moving. Couple this with the fact that it is based on Kate Grenvile's research into her own family it is an important book well told with its ending becoming increasingly apparent s the story progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening story","review":"As an American who has never traveled to Australia, I thought the author painted a very detailed picture of the scenery.

The authors are adept at teaching the fundamentals of this art in a broad but comprehensive survey, while introducing you to the language and culture of the jyotishi. This text therefore gives a Westerner a nice introduction to the jyotishi's perspective in such a way that a Westerner can understand Eastern astrology in context of its culture. The authors' periodic explanations of how the two systems are different are also insightful and valuable information. The authors are humorous, intelligent, well learned and their language is very practical and down to earth. What I am amazed at is how comprehensive this introductory survey is. Eastern astrology is an ancient, accurate and intricate art, and this text is a great starting point if you are pursuing this path of learning, particularly if you already have a Western perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lgical & simplified approach to complex matter of Relationships","review":"This books is an admirable effort to explain logically, an extremely complex phenominan called Human Relationships. very systemetic guidance on the subject. a must read for any Jyotisha."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real common sense guide.","review":"We loved this book because it so thoroughly covered all aspects of horse housing.What we particularly liked is the author's acknowledgement that available building materials may vary in different geographical areas.Planning, Design, and Building - it took us through each step with gentle guidance helping us make our own decisions on what we could afford with time, materials and money available.It began as our 'wish' book for a new home for our 8 horses and helped us design the right facility for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're rich, don't bother with this one!","review":"All I wanted was some simple instruction on how to build good, strong stalls. Not only did the (very) small section on stalls provide no plans or construction techniques (a pretty important component in any horse-housing structure), this book didn't even tell me what kind of wood I should use. Sure, it's pretty and slick, but unless you're willing to re-mortgage your house to build anything in this book, then don't bother with it. It's OK for a general overview of things, but doesn't get very specific at all.

The players are well-built but they are inherently fragile to bouncing around, drops etc. The case is better than average quality and good looking. It fits the player perfectly and has better padding than many similar cases. There is ample room for the power supply, AV cables and a few disks, especially if you put them in paper sleeves or something smaller than a typical dvd case.

Happiness). It covers a wide range of chapters which include definitions, measurement, clarifications/reactions, recent findings and researches. Its probable drawback is that, to a certain degree, it is somewhat very technical in approach. Not too many readers might easily grasp some contents/materials presented. Nonetheless, it is a great reference material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming book, sure to delight","review":"I highly recommend this book. Unlike many keenly-observed, character-driven novels, this novel has a plot that hooks you in immediately. And unlike many witty writers, this one pokes fun at her characters but treats even the most unsympathetic ones with tenderness. There are countless observations that will make you laugh out loud as well as scenes that are truly touching, but never saccharine. It is very well-written.This is one of those books that make a great gift--with it's multiple perspectives, it would be perfect for almost any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read debut novel","review":"If you are looking for a book that you won't want to put down, one that is beautifully written, clever, funny and smart, then this is it. I predict that it will be one of those books that you'll want all of your friends and family to read.Written from multiple perspectives, the author has an uncanny ability to naturally convey the emotions and thoughts of an entire family. There are few books that you can read over and over--this is one of them and I know it will do incredibly well. I would buy stock in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Profound","review":"I was impressed by the author's piece in The New Yorker this fall and have been waiting patiently for this debut novel.It was well worth the wait. The Dunlap family and their hangers-on are reminiscent of characters previously rendered by Updike and Cheever, yet totally original. The author reveals character depths far beneath the usual surface that is merely glossed in a first novel. Although the plot turns on a fascinating mystery, what I think sets this work apart are its brutally honest yet empathic insights into the inner lives of its characters, and by extension into the complex nature of any family.I highly recommend this book, and suspect that the author's public profile is about to rise considerably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good breeding? very good reading...","review":"Yes, I agree with one reviewer here: I cannot stand typos in books from reputable publishing houses. But this is nonetheless a very good read, but not (I think) in Cheever class as some have suggested... Jack is a sour and dour central character, unattractive and monochromatic but well drawn. The ending is particularly good and the prediction regarding Eliot's future sounds pretty accurate to me. I am so happy to find these talented American debutant novelists, first the wonderful Nancy Clark, now Jessica Shattuck... I hope they all keep writing as I am an impatient reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Read","review":"I found the characters to be wonderfully developed in this novel, and in the end I even came to embrace the curmudgeon Jack, and the often pesky Rock. Oh, but from the very beginning, Eliot simply melted my heart, as did Faith. It was so gratifying when Faith began to laugh again, especially at herself. It was such a relief, as it is with oneself when one can lose that feeling of jittery self-conscious nerves. All of the characters are so well described, physically and psychologically, that I was totally immersed in their storylines. I have to say I'm a bit thrown by the reviews that said they did not enjoy these characters.Upon just finishing a couple of books much touted authors which I struggled to finish, The Hazards of Good Breeding was pure enjoyment from beginning to end. I look forward to reading more by Jessica Shattuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be more patient than I","review":"I was intrigued by the setting and the good reviews but I agree with the reader who was put off by the slow plot development and large number of characters I wasn't very interested in. Everybody seemed to suffer from some nonspecific malaise, and I just didn't have the stamina to stick around and figure out what was getting everyone down -- I tried to stick with it but other books beckoned.I have to admit that, despite being a huge Henry James and Jane Austen fan, I am not a huge Cheever or Updike fan. So maybe it's me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It has been a long time since I read a book by a major publisher so filled with cliches, so obvious in its character and plot development. The heroine of the novel is not given any significant flaws and as a result is unearthly, inhuman, and the rest of the characters are rough-hewn caricatures. Various typos throughout the book--and to say that a character who goes to school in Cambridge, MA wouldn't know Brigham's ice cream is ridiculous (especially from an author who should know better). Sloppy in too many places."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't buy this book but paid (lots) in time spent reading","review":"I had not read any reviews about this work, I admit choosing it as I was attracted by the title. For me this book failed as the author told me things about this world she created and did not show through narrative and character development for me to be able to come to my own conclusions. I felt like she was \\"teaching girls\\" in the very worst way. Giving the answers instead of providing the facts and clues to understand on your own. It was dog-dead boring and slow in parts, and I found the sheer number of typos unacceptable. If the author is to write more I hope her publisher treats her work with the respect any published work deserves. To adhere to my family's admonition, \\"if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all\\" she made me curious and I spent quite a bit of time reading \\"manifold theory\\" and am inspired to register for a higher math class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest","review":"This book was so boring, I forced myself to read half of it before I just could not go on.

Since I am partial to that breed of movie I am willing to forgive a lot. But this movie fails in just about every way a movie can fail. The story is weak, the acting is weak....EVERYTHING is weak. Some movies are so bad (e.g. Plan 9 From Outer Space) that they are entertaining as comedies. Not so here. Just really bad. I found myself thinking about WORK while watching this.

Mostly, they're just too plump--are supplies running low or not? Was there or was there not a nuclear cataclysm so great that it totally destroyed society and blighted agriculture, and if so...?As the other reviewers have said, \\"Post-Apocalyptic\\" nearly requires the adjective \\"bad\\". This is even worse than that. In addition to an absolutely nonsensical plot thread (and associated stock caricatures--insane sisters/adopted daughters of \\"wicked witch\\")we also have actual fairyland style magic with a psycho-mystic twist courtesy of a cheesy Black \\"shaman\\". Imagine Lionel Richie blathering platitudes in Morgan Freeman's very blandest voice.And for all that, Tara Nevins' rendition of \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\" is worth the rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could like it, but I can't!!","review":"Too difficult to explain how bad it is.

The only bright side is that I bought the cheapest used copy I could find."},{"rating":"1","title":"end of the world flop","review":"I should have known better after reading the back of this DVD I rented at Blockbuster than to rent it. My hopes that I would be wrong were dashed when I found out this movie is just another poor attempt by bankrupt movie makers to cash in on popular box office hits. Dedicated end-of-times enthusiasts may take this poorly written prediction of the future to heart but, of course, some people will believe anything. Low budget movies like this have the advantage of being filmed in a junk yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising - Don't Judge this One By It's Cover","review":"I was expecting a bad horror movie but that's not what this movie is at all. It's ultimately a sweet and hopeful movie about people trying to survive in a world that has been ravaged by war and disease. There are a few plot points that didn't make a lot of sense to me but overall the acting and scenery were spot on. The sets were realistic and the scenery was at moments serenely beautiful and at others desolate and lifeless. I also have to comment on the soundtrack. The music was wonderful. If a CD was available, I would definitely buy it. So, don't let the really bad cover scare you away from a real treat of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This movie was a complete dud...can I have my $ and hour of wasted viewing time back?

Alan doesn't just tell you how to fly the maneouvres but also why they need to be flown that way. The amount of information he provides regarding what the aircraft is doing during each maneouvre allows you to fully understand what is going on. This lets you really analyse how you fly the maneouvres yourself and thus how you can improve your own performance. Not just in terms of how to fly more accurate figures but also how to optimise energy use throughout each maneouvre.I've been using the book during the past couple of weeks and it has made quite a difference to my sequences.Its easily the best book out there.

It really doesn't matter either seeing as I've heard most of it from other artists and enjoyed it more then. This guy won't be remembered for sure. There's nothing phenomenal about someone doing covers of other people's materials. Buble isn't the only one that does is it though. You hear an old song, and you want to find out who originally does it, but that's impossible seeing how back in the old days, they all just did each other's songs. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of this sort of music, I think it's quite annoying, but I do enjoy some of the artists. And Michael Buble is not at all making a new generation appreciate the old. How dumb and naive is that?

I'm looking forward to his next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic songs sung by the voice of velvet...","review":"Listen to the ease in which Buble sings the variety of songs he does on this cd and you will discover why he has fast become a worldwide hit.His pitch is perfect, his delivery impeccable and his style about as smooth as butter. Now this is a anomaly in today's world of synthetic music and often foul lyrics. Buble sings with a passion, beautiful words and a respect for how words and music can be used to elevate our spirits. Try listening to Thats All and not feeling moved. When I heard Barry Gibb lending backgrounds to Broken Heart, it broke my heart! What a beautiful collaboration. Moving!!! Fantastic!!!I can't say I'm a Queen fan, but found Crazy Little to be light and clean.If you appreciate star quality and are looking for that special something for someone special or just a treat for yourself, this is the cd that will be treasured. Superb all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerging Superstar!","review":"Behold, the 'birth' of a Superstar! We'll be able to say \\"we saw him when\\" - that's how I know Buble will be remembered years from now when he becomes a legend in the business.Is he that good you ask?? Better, I say. He was first introduced to my husband and I by a mutual friend. We have now (quite obviously) become enamoured with Buble's album, and more recently with Buble and his sizzling live shows (Borgata & Mohegan Sun) and television appearances (Dateline & Larry King)This album has been a staple on our gift giving list and will continue to be until he (and we hope soon) puts out another....Buble has emerged as THE ONE and this album let's you know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice surprise, site unseen...","review":"I bought this CD based totally on an E-card someone sent me with Buble's rendition of \\"That's All\\"...and I must say I am pleasantly surprised. This cat's got chops for one so young!Although I don't agree with the selection of all the cuts (Queen's \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\"...out of place amongst the other more classic Pop standards) the arrangements are solid and slick. Buble's vocals don't drown out the fine instrumental work here nor is it hidden by it. Nice, very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celestial and Dazzling","review":"I am not one to ever comment on singers. With Michael Buble I needed to write in - my first Amazon review in seven years. This young man brought me to tears especially with \\"That's All\\". He is reminiscent of a gentler era - his is classy and has of the voice of an angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"'s wonderful","review":"Michael Buble's buttery smooth voice makes the chestnuts on this collection as fresh as if you're hearing them for the first time.

He is such a fantastic singer. His singing style is very Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin-like, yet he has his own touch. He is even better live! This is a great cd. It's a MUST HAVE for your own cd collection. BUY IT NOW! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"'Enhanced' is an excellent title for this CD. Buble enhances music that cuts across three decades and updates them with a new sound.Michael Buble could be the one who brings back swing and big band and he revives the love song. His voice is clear and fresh. He breathes new life into tunes of yesteryear and even does a better job on many of them compared to the originals.I heard this CD at a friends house, my wife and I love it. This is romantic, lilting music that will inspire you. I would not say that Buble is better than Sinatra, yet there is no comparing Buble's singing talent to anyone else. His rendition of Kissing a Fool was excellent.\\"For Once in My Life,\\" he sings that with full lung capacity and makes it very snappy. \\"Come Fly With Me,\\" is really a kick, upbeat and perky. I really like his rendition to \\"Put Your Head on My Shoulder.\\"This is a tribute to the time when music and America were great. This is going to be a gift I give to many of my friends over the next few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm forever blowing bubles","review":"This is the honest to goodness truth. I had never heard of Michael buble's before 10/11/03.I turned my tv on that sallite music station. There was nothing on tv I wanted to watch,so I switched it on the smooth jazz station.And I heard this song \\"The way you look tonight\\" I said to myself \\"who is that?\\" Its not Sinatra,but it sure sounded good.The next morning I forgot the name of the artist.I tried finding it by the song I heard,but there was several hundred listing for that song. That sunday afternoon I found in the record dept. of a well know store and immediately bought it without giving any thought as to what else was on the CD.That song \\"the way you look tonight\\" was enough for me. When I saw the name Paul Anka and David Foster as having something to do with the CD,I knew it had to be good. And I can truly say I was totally blown away to hear such a refreshing voice.I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves good vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"please listen with your EARS!","review":"I bought this CD impulsively after sampling a few tracks at a listening station at Barnes and Nobles. In the mood for a new CD or singer, I bought it. My first reaction was \\"WOW! How come I never heard of this guy?\\" After listening to the whole thing at home, I thought \\"Hmm not bad\\" Upon a few more listenings my opinion has fallen to \\"YAWN! Another overly hyped wanna-be\\" Truly great singers of standards offer so much more depth than this guy can deliver. You can listen to the truly greats over and over and over and they never grow tired, and most actually improve over the test of time. Trust me, this guy won't be one of them. He is merely mimicking the style, not offering it up with credibility. Diana Krall? THERE is the real thing. Listen to Sinatra right after little Michael and you will hear it- IF that is, you are listening with your EARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"the emperor has no clothes","review":"For those who believe this is the best thing since sliced bread,I have some beach-front property in Nebraska I'd like to sell you.I'm happy for those listeners who love this guy, and get great pleasureout of this recording....but he is definitely NOT the real deal. You can buythe real deal just as easily as you can buy this homogenized, imitation,bad lounge-y, overly-hyped \\"product\\". Personally, I'd rather have a root canalthan to subject my musical sensibilites to this junk. It's less painful.Just read all the one- and two-star reviews, and believe them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinatra would roll over","review":"What is with this guy trying to sound exactly like Frank Sinatra?Lounge, Lounge and more Lounge. David Foster must be getting old.Sinatra kicked, this guy lays down on almost every song. I think it's terrible, trying to launch someone at the expense of a wonderful singer like Sinatra. I think Buble should be titled the new Karaoke King. He would win grammys in that category!This album is terrible. Buy a Sinatra CD and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"The best of the juno's 2004 line-up. He blew everyone away. What carisma, what a voice. He is spectacular. This c.d. is a must have to any music lover at any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buble' Can Fly With Me ANYTIME!","review":"Who Is THAT??? My head turned when I heard this voice, Who is he? All right Foster, you've done it AGAIN. This guy has a penchant for finding the best of the best and he's scored once more with Michael Buble'! This guy swings so high you think you might never come down, as for me, I didn't WANT TO! Great presence, phrasing is perfection, pitch, there's nothing this young man lacks. As a professional Jazz vocalist (A Working One!)I am smitten with this wonderful new talent. Mr. Foster, I MUST thank you for bringing us yet another genious that makes my ears smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this guy","review":"Wow...this guy blows me away. I just can't resist his Sinatra-esque voice. This CD is a jewel. Loving every song...especially \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder.\\" Simply wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected, but refreshing CD","review":"A friend recommended the CD of Michael Buble. I curiously browsed through it on a local CD store. I immediately liked it. It is simple, but very refreshing. The arrangements are nice, technically clean. The selections are quite \\"bubble gum\\" songs, which makes it cute and enjoyable. There is a nice swing also to Michael Buble's voice, a natural jazz singer. I like his version of Fever, Come fly with me, and Put your head on my shoulder. I hope to hear more from this singer, in particular songs from the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN HIDING THIS GUY!","review":"He is one of the sweetest voiced singers around today. If you want smooth velvety vocals this is your guy. Thanks to Liz Smith of the Times, if it hadn't been for her I wonder when I would have heard of him! I also recommend Michael Civisca. These guys are what listening to good music is all about. Singheart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn it, this guy can sing!!!","review":"I do things backwards! I bought his latest release It's Time first and now this although on both counts I win!!!!Fever and Moondance are scathingly hot and That's All appealed to me almost as much as it did to my folks. My daughter loves Kissing a fool and crazy little thing. Really enjoyable!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this be ANY worse?","review":"It's flat and dull and totally uninspiring, which is saying something when one considers the material he uses. How can he NOT be inspired by these songs? Does the man's heart not beat?Who cares, really? Do yourself and us all a favour, don't encourage him by buying this CD and instead look for Johnny Hartman and/or Sammy Davis Jr. Your ears will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible new big band singer has arrived...","review":"Lounge lounge and more lounge, this music might be enjoyed at a smokey bar in Vegas, but on cd, it doesn't sound unique, another Harry Connick(we only need one!!!). And now we have 3 Connick;s with Cincotti!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Yawn","review":"Odd how artists catch on, such an example is Michael Buble. His voice is pleasant, like a lounge singer in an upscale hotel or perhaps Vegas. Yes, Vegas baby! Some of his covers are decent, especially \\"Fever\\", but please Mr. Buble do NOT attempt to cover Van Morrison. As Bob Geldorf said in a tribute to Van, \\"How many murdered \\"Moondances\\" have we heard?\\" We just heard another one. Too much almost Frank, and not quite enough Harry Connick Jr., Mr. Buble's creamy, dreamy, overblown voice is dangerous to your health especially while driving. A yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Seriously, if want to hear songs in the same arrangements as Frank, Dean and Sammy did, then I'd buy a Frank, Dean or Sammy CD. If I wanted to hear Kissing A Fool the way George Michael did it with George Michael's arrangements, then I'm gonna listen to my George Michael CD. Fever was done the same way Peggy Lee did it, only it's a guy's voice. True talent in artistry lies in one's OWN interpretation of a song, not how good he can copy the great ones of the past. I'd recommend Peter Cincotti instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Notes Without Substance","review":"Sure! With enough promotion he will sell some CD's but there ismuch lacking in these performances such as musicality, phrasing,feeling and other nuances that you find in a Nat Cole performance. What's left here is an empty suit or rather, anempty voice. Why waste money on this CD when you can buy thereal thing by Cole or Sinatra that will give you pleaure forever..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about context and expectations....","review":"I'd never heard of Michael Buble until I was wrapping holiday CDs for shoppers at Borders the week before Christmas, so from that standpoint, I'd say his marketing machine is not quite up to snuff.... but because I wrapped it so many times, I figured others must be onto something so I bought this eponymous CD. Upon first review, I was quite pleased. While other reviewers may critique Mr. Buble for not having a 'unique' sound, one has to consider both context and expectations. Mr. Buble does a good job at reinvigorating some of the 'old standards' and adds pretty good production values in the process. It is hard to imagine anyone who is looking for a new twist on some old standard and says \\"Let's put on some good 'mood music'\\" who is unsatisfied upon putting this CD in the machine. It's all about context and expectations. Buble delivers within the context in which he is working; it's somewhat original, but also very familiar...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy lounge lizard","review":"This CD is just plain horrible. If you want to hear real talent listen to the original artists on most of these tracks. Most notable George Michael's \\"Kissing A Fool\\". Buble does not do any of these tracks justice. A travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Sinatra wanna be","review":"Fortunately my Mom purchased the CD for me. After being put to sleep by it I awoke thinking I'll buy Mom Marilyn Manson and see if she gets the hint"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This guy doesn't even have a good voice...and this album is on Warner? No, actually it's not. It's on 143 Records, distributed by Warner Brothers. For some reason, the CD jacket states Buble is 25, and he's 30.When will music speak for itself again, instead of all of this non-sense?The album is a waste of my time, and yours. Anyone of us could have jumped into the studio, and if this guy is the next Sinatra, as his handlers call him, then I'm Sammy Davis.And I'll bet Buble doesn't even know who he is.This album smells of unfounded ego, and after seeing the guy on the TODAY SHOW, it has become increasingly obvious that we all must still await the best of them to come, because this guy isn't it.Maybe I'll catch him at the karaoke bar, because there are far better singers there on a Monday night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please.","review":"I bought the record, and I returned the record.Since when is \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" a Sinatra styled song?Shame on Warner Brothers for milking the legacy of a dead artist to start out the career of someone who couldn't hold Sinatra's cup of coffee.Way out of line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"I just watched this guy on Ellen and he sucks. I don't care for his music at all. Thank goodness I didn't waste my money on his CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ===Stop","review":"I just want to know why would anyone want to listen to a dude whom we know is faking sing like Frank Sinatra. Frank S was horrible and I would rather be beaten then to listen to this c.d.. My roommate had this c.d. and it made me want to drink bleach. I can't understand why people actually go out and buy this .... Michael Buble should be given herpes in his throat for this mess. Michael Buble--Boooooo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"I personally think that you are wasting your time and money if you but this album. The fact that this artist has not written a single word or note by himself tells me that he is all looks and no talent. If I wanted to hear a high quality remake of a 50's or 60's songs I'd rather listen to Harry Connick Jr.Michael is a hack and dosn't deserve to be singing Bentit, Sanatra, or any other artists songs. Mike if you remake a song then make it better...not worse. I'd rather listen to Steve wonder then to this crap.... At least he's a real musician in every sence of the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced music","review":"I was very disappointed at this CD. I had heard Buble on TV only on one or two songs, then I bought the CD. To me it seems quite over-produced or gimick-y. Based on this, I do not see much reason to liken Buble to Sinatra, beyond the obvious similarity of music sung."},{"rating":"2","title":"This kid has stones AND a great voice.","review":"It takes a brave man to tackle two songs (Come Fly With Me and Summer Wind) so closely connected with Sinatra, but Buble acquits himself admirably on both tunes, with only minimal \\"homage\\" in Come Fly With Me. Anyway, he owes as much, if not more, to Mel Torme here, and even a tiny bit to Michael Feinstein and Harry Connick. He does an amazing cover of George Michael's \\"Kissing A Fool\\" (his vocals are much better than Michael's, if that can be believed), and probably the most swoony bossa nova version of \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" I've ever heard. Everybody is touting Peter Cincotti as the New Sinatra, but I think Buble has him beaten. He's a much better singer, and frankly, cuter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Talent In Young Man","review":"With an immense voice and a tremendous band behind him Michael Buble has released this delightful CD with great swing and exemplary songs. He presents some wonderful versions of these songs such as: \\"Fever\\", \\"Moondance\\", \\"Summer Wind\\", and \\"Kissing a Fool.\\" He has brought his own style to these songs and sings sounding as if he has lived them, yet staying true to the original text of the songs. David Foster, the multi-Grammy winning producer, has done a fine job arranging and producing the CD. With this kind of captivating voice within this vigorous young man we may get half a century of swing. It is a fact that Michael Buble can definitely swing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a pleasure to listen to","review":"While in New York recently, a helpful salesperson at Colny Records recormended this recording and he was right on the mark. Michael Buble has Sinatra's flair, William's good looks and Harry Connick Jr's showmanship. It is not often that I praise male vocalists, personally I like the female torch/cabaret singers like Linda Eder, Karen Akers, Connie Champagne and Sharon McNight but Buble's CD is hauntingly beautiful and a must have for your listening pleasure. And get it here on AMAZON.com, I paid $$ more for it at Colony but hey, its Colony Music and it is New Yor City...plus, I never would have gotten the recommendation. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Crooner","review":"This guy is one impressive singer. He's one of the more smooth swinging singers with a voice that easily channels the great Chet Baker. It's a great CD as well. If I have one complaint, it's that there are no dynamics in the song selections. All cuts are slow to mid-tempo. Where's the smokin', in-your-face, swing-out tunes? However, there are a few stand out cuts. I love these versions of \\"Fever\\" and \\"Summer Wind.\\" But it's covers of Morrison's \\"Moondance\\" and especially George Michael's \\"Kissing a Fool\\" that are tops. I can't wait to see how Buble's career evolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Buble [Enhanced]","review":"Michael's style is simple and pure. His voice quality and diction is quite good. His voice maturity is not a Steve Tyrell, it is more a Harry Connick.He comes across large with a big band sound.Our world needs more music like this and it is refreshing that Michael Buble is doing his part."},{"rating":"2","title":"young man with mature taste in music","review":"With the exception of the vastly overrated modern \\"classic\\" Moondance, this CD surprised me by the range of (admittedly pop) selections included. I was particularly pleased with the inclusion of \\"That's All,\\" one of my all-time sentimental favorites and one inexplicably omitted from most such collections. (I don't think Michael Feinstein or Ann Hampton Callaway has included it on any of their CDs yet.)Definitely a man to watch as his voice matures. He already reminds me of Sinatra."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King of The Crooners","review":"The new king has been crowned!!!! What a fantastic voice, it gave me shivers. He is without a doubt the most incredible performer, singer, and entertainer to arrive in 20 years. We all bow to our new king. May he reign forever. This c.d. is worth every penny. I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages. I am only 26 and enjoy every song on this c.d."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Listening","review":"He has a nice voice. I listen to this when I want to unwind. His CDs has given me an interest in the music of the 50s era (I'm a child of the 80s)...I give him 4 stars because of the background singers in track 5; they just don't seem to fit with the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am totally in love with this young man and his voice","review":"I first heard Michael when I went into a music store. This CD was playing and I said to the clerk..\\"wow, who is that\\"? The song \\"sway\\" was playing, and the woman who was behind me in line, was wondering who's fabulous voice that was, also. The clerk took us out of line and showed us the CD. Needless to say, we each bought one. After getting home, I put it in my BOSE and I played it, no LESS, than 6 times. I kept hitting the repeat button. I played it all day until my husband came home and proudly played it, yet again, for the 7th time. I now own 3 of these cd's....one for my car, one for my office and one for my husband's BOSE........I am a very happy listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music for Home or Office","review":"My gosh! What a rich, posh, fun-filled sounding CD. I own a Bikram yoga studio, and for fun, I played it in my reception area as well as in the changing rooms. And I gotta say, all my students loved it! The swinging sound was such a wonderful change from the quieter meditative stuff that I often play (and what most people expect to hear) at my Bikram yoga studio. \\"That's All\\" and \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" are my personal favorites. My students like \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.\\" I even gave a copy to Mom. She loves it too. Grab a copy. You'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buble, Buble You Make My day","review":"I first heard of Michael Bubl&#65533; from a friend of mine and I was immediately hooked and had to go out and buy this CD. His style is at once a throwback and completely new. I enjoy his covers of newer songs the best as it's refreshing to hear them done in such a different style from the originals. \\"Moondance,\\" \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\\" and \\"Kissing A Fool\\" are songs that I listen to regularly. Just are great are \\"Fever\\" which I rarely hear sung by a man and \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\" which is so tender.If you're looking to hear a male vocalist with that doesn't sound like he's been sucking in helium or just looking to hear some one who can really sing and doesn't need to scream at an audience to prove it, you owe it to yourself to check out Michael Bubl&#65533;.

The orchestra arrangements are tinny, the vocals sometimes sound off-key and unimpressive to me, and the artist's scatting is actually quite jarring. The CD sounds like it was thrown together at the last minute rather than meticulously crafted, which is a shock to me considering the high quality David Foster usually gives us. For a better big-band/return to swing album, spend the extra dough and get the import of Robbie William's \\"Swing When You're Winning\\" with its accompanying domestically available DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"Is this a joke? How in the world are we supposed to take this guy seriously? He has absolutely no talent and I find it hard to believe that anyone, outside his family and friends, finds this stuff enjoyable in any way, shape or form.This, along with his other albums, are virtually unlistenable. I am dead serious. He reminds me of a toned down Mark Harris (Mr. Matha Raye), and trust me folks...that ain't a good thing. Yikes!This CD is little more than coaster material at this point. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a review of the album","review":"I cannot review this album as the seller never sent it to me.

I'm a former musician, and I have to say that in LA alone, there are hundreds of folks with voices BETTER than Bubble's.But I DO get it.He's a triumph of marketing, and his handlers, label and marketers clearly know his audience. In that respect, he's no different than any of the other transparently marketed, lukewarm \\"talent\\" out there. Take your pick - I'm sure any of the top 50 (or more) pop artists can \\"carry a tune.\\"Now, I'm watching this kid try and instigate banter on his PBS show, talking to the camera, and it is pathetically forced, and quite frankly, he comes off as canned in the least. Sorry, but Bubble is whitebread and mayo on top of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Sinatra....AVOID!","review":"If big band standards are your bag, then you may well feel that Michael Buble is an artist, you want to explore, well don't. Michael Buble is as camp as a row of tents, and even if you don't mind that, in fact you may well adore Michael Feinstein, who minces the old standards as well as anyone, even though, Buble should still be avoided, for what separates Buble from Feinstein and anyone else who is famous for banging out the big tunes, is the emotion, the sincerity. Buble is devoid of all sincerity. What sticks in my throat on this album is Sinatra's classic \\"Summer Wind\\" which is a story of lost love, yet Buble gives the impression of being on stage at Vegas, clicking his fingers, winking at the audience with a big white smile, and in the process, losing touch with the heart of the music. Bland, tasteless and lacking due respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Buble - Michael Buble","review":"I am glad I purchased the Michael Buble - It's Time CD before this one, because if I had not, I never would have bothered. The difference between the self titled and It's Time is striking. In a word, this CD is tired. The song selections, while classic, have been over covered. Michael's delivery was flat. No, that understates it. It is like a zombie recorded this CD- a total absence of passion. Do yourself a favor and skip this one and go right for It's Time. While it too has some over covered songs, they are far less than on this CD and no one can say the delivery on It's Time is anything but passionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit by Buble","review":"I actually only purchased this CD for the song 'Everything', but found that the entire CD has some really great tracks on it. If your a fan of Mr. Buble, then this needs to be added to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed!!!!!!!!","review":"I have to say that I was very impressed and surprised at the caliber of this young man's voice. For a lad so young he has the sound of someone who has been singing for a decade. He brings to life each and every song with his own special touch.

I only hope that he stays with this wonderful style of music and brings us another c.d. as wonderful of this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gosh what can i say besides, so awsome","review":"Michael Buble is awsomeI love his voice, all of his songs are awsome because of his wonderful singing talents\\"How Can You Mend A Boken Heart\\" takes my breath away, a good slow slong\\"Fever\\" is a good dance song, its cool, gives you a modern sound of the 1930's sound\\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\" is a good love song, I can't stop playing itThis is one of the best albums thats a must ownYou will never get bored of it, its well produced and editedand best of all Michaels voice is basically, the best in the music business"},{"rating":"2","title":"New face of jazz","review":"Michael Buble marks his entrance into the music world with his self-titled freshman album. After only one listen, any listener will know Buble is an up-and-coming singer who has talent to spare.He covers many well-known songs in the album which he performs with the vigor and energy expected of these classics. He does a pretty good good considering he is singing songs of such greats as Sinatra, Bobby Darin and Dean Martin. This is to his credit although it would be nice to see Buble take a bigger risk on his next album and not go with songs that are so widely popular.Overall, a good album but let's hope his next one will be more adventurous in his repetoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"He gives me FEVER!Wow!

Mike hits it with class and cool control. To all of those Frank whiners remember Frank was great, good and pretty bad depending on the time. Same can be said for all of them. No he is not Sanatra, thank God! This kid records these songs with courage, snap and a maturity that belies his years. There has not been a CD I have enjoyed this much in years. I checked on his concert coming up. SOLD OUT! That's all you have to know. Mike is the real deal, plain and simple. He has a great future. And he seems like a nice guy to boot. Lay it on me Mike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Buble-Good Album","review":"Michael Buble's self titled album is a 4 star album. He tries to sing not only standard jazz tunes but also some pop tunes. He has a very good voice, especially for jazz and it seems with this album he is in his element. Most of the album is good, but at points it does loose a bit of excitement when the mood slows down. Overall, good song selection makes this a great album along with Buble's voice. 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album of the year. A fantastic talent!","review":"My wife asked me to look for this album because she heard Buble's version of Sway and loved it. She hasn't been able to listen to the whole album yet because I keep stealing it to play in my car. If you love the Big Band sound and the classic pop standards, this is WITHOUT A DOUBT, a MUST HAVE ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an artist!","review":"This was my first and favorite CD of Michael Buble's and I bought one for each of my sisters!

When young and new artists touch on the very songs that musical legends made famous, they never have intentions tocompare with what 's been recognized as a definitive recording of a song. But when a song has endured the test of time and proven its virtue, it belongs to everyone , including young singers.This album offers a very pleasant listen that goes with any occasions.The new life breathed into such songs as \\"Put Your Head..\\" and \\"You'll Never Find\\" with new arrangements reflect the spirits of the songs, arrangers and the singers. This album is not about the singer alone -but several characteristics combined. Of course, we still enjoy Frank and Louis and Ella but we shouldn't keep the door shut when younger generations want to come in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Repertoire","review":"An easy to love album. Wonderful orchestra arrangements, and great selection of all time songs"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never believe this sound","review":"I've always been a fan of classic swing and big-band, but the \\"fresh face\\" that Buble gives to this genre is fantastic. He manages to take a crooner sound of Sinatra's early days and apply it to other Rock favorites like Van Morrison and (I love this swingish version) Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love.I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys swing music, especially those who liked the brief resurfacing of swing culture in the mid-nineties with Big Bad... and Cherry Poppin, etc. M. Buble's voice has an obvious pop-flare to it, but the soul is still swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"This young man has a smooth voice. If you like Dean Martin, Jazz, Big Band, Harry Connick, Jr., You'll love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"If I was on a desert island with only three cds I can assure you Michael Buble would be one of them. His easy style is reminiscent of the Rat Pack days and am glad this crooner has made his mark! If you enjoy the sounds of Sinatra, Darin, Martin, etc., you will not be disappointed and if you've been living under a rock and have no idea who Sinatra, Darin and Martin are, pick up this cd anyway as an early introduction to the \\"classics\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"imitative and shallow, but promising","review":"I first heard cuts from this album while shopping at a bookstore, specifically \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight.\\" My opinion was and is that he has a good voice, excellent pitch and an obvious affection for the genre, but there was a lack of convicition and style a la Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.I'm disappointed with most of the rest, especially \\"Crazy Little Thing\\" because of the echoplex or reverb. If he's just going to be imitative, why bother? Why not do something different? He's got a good voice and a capable backup band...I think that may be the fault of producer David Foster, who took the group Chicago from innovative to syrupy in a very short time.I'm not happy at spending $20 and getting so little for my money (which I spent based on exposure to two of the best cuts). However, He's got potential, and I look forward to having someone to help erase my memory of Sinatra's pitch problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but...","review":"Once in long while, a great talent emerges in the world of Popular Song. Michael Bubl�� is one of them. For someone so young, he is astonishlingly comfortable with the Jazz-inflected rhythms of the 40s and 50s. Granted the selection of songs is tailored to showcase Bubl��'s range and versatility, something like the rockin' and rollin' Crazy Little Thing Called Love has really no place here. And Barry Gibb's Bee Gees style backing vocals is really too gimmicky for the beautifully lamented How Can You Mend A Broken Heart. For the sake of Bubl��'s Art of Crooning (and my personal collection), I hope he will in future be more critical with his choice of songs. His singing is really a breath of fresh air in today's world of misguided choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"all but two..","review":"This was wonderful listening! I never knew, til he sang it,that \\"How can you mend a broken heart\\" was such a beautiful tender love song.(it used to sound like Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street singing to eachother.) \\"Moondance\\" is pretty good, though Van Morrison does it best. \\"That's All\\" is just exquisite and sweet,and he turns Put Your Head on my shoulder into a gentle serenade. If one is in need of good first dance/kiss songs, this is the way to go.I'd have given this 5 stars except for the syrupy over produced version of \\"you'll never find another love like mine.\\"and the cheesy crazy little thing called love."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a VOICE","review":"My girlfriends have raved about this Michael Bubl�� and his sound. I now will admit, they are right.

I decided I liked his voice, and I liked the songs he sang. Perfect combination! My husband even likes this CD. We both had Moondance in our heads for an entire night. I recommend this CD. It's something everyone will enjoy listening to so you don't have to fight about who gets to pick which CD to listen to in the car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Artist sings Great Songs","review":"Ok folks, you know what you are getting on the cd when you order it...there is a list of all the songs on the cd, so if you are like some reviewers and have some sort of moral objection to new singers singing classic songs, don't get this cd. Duh. That said, Michael Buble has an incredible voice and breathes new life into these pieces. Classics like these were made to be SUNG, and just because someone new comes along to perform it does not mean that they are trying to hitch a ride on someone else's success or talent; just that they recognize good music. Fortunately or unfortunately, great songs are sung by everyone, good and bad (haven't you ever been to a middle school choir pop concert...oh god) but that is the PURPOSE of these songs, to be enjoyed. Not only does Buble do a wonderful interpretation of these pieces; in doing so he is introducing a whole new generation to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buble fan all the way!","review":"If you like old school crooners, you'll love Michael Buble.

He doesnt have his own voice.Nora Jones has her own voice. Dolly Parton has her own voice. Randy Travis has his own voice. Not this guy. These songs have a very schmaltzy feel to them. But, I must say it is relaxing. The guy does have talent. But I would like to hear him try something that is a reflection of his own personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy is this generic.","review":"Does he have a pleasant voice? Sure. But while Mr. Buble can carry a tune, he is completely void of any CHARACTER! What made Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. etc so popular is that they performed these songs with thier own style. Each sounded different from the others without stepping on anybody elses toes. Michael Buble gives sterile, boring renditions of these timelss classics. On \\"Nice and Easy\\" he's anything but. Good lord boy, stop trying to crisply enunciate every single syllable! It's nice and easy, sing it that way. If you've never spent any time listening to these classics, it's an ok starter album, but I would bet that any long tiime Sinatra listener won't give this much of a listen. If the Josh Groban sheep think that this is torch music, that's a sad state of music knowledge these days. Do yourself a favor and buy \\"In the Wee Small Hours\\" and hear a true master at work, one who sings from his heart and not from a production board."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVING IT!!!!!","review":"My husband and I agree that this is our ALL TIME FAVORITE.

Buble is a Sinatra Copy Cat and Eder is a Streisand Copy Cat. Buble has the advantage that Sinatra isn't here anymore, but that's about it. Neither artist can compare with the original Great artists, and shouldn't have tried. Both of these new singers should find their own style.Both could be good recording artists on their own. They should sing something original, and quit trying to copy other artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want swing? Look elsewhere...","review":"It's amazing to me that so many people are ranting and raving about this album. What a bizarre creation it is. Not only is the choice of tunes competely erratic, but the band and singer are so stiff, that it makes you feel tense. Sure, the band is comprised of a bunch of hot shots and fantastic players, but put them all together, and you have a bunch of egos fighting to be heard. As for Mr. Buble, lighten up and swing, man...you and your band need to have a martini or two..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a chance","review":"This guy is another wannabe, and the music sounds like karaoke tracks at best. If you want to hear a real crooner, check out Peter Cincotti or Brian Evans. Those are the guys who you can feel have a passion for it. So let this guy ride the wave a little, because the others will rise to the top. As they say, the best are saved for last, and the overly promoted...well they just end up there.The song \\"Fever\\" on this album is just terrible. I suggest you list to the sound clips and here it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor imitation.......","review":"I was very eager to hear this CD, but was very disappointed. Michael Buble does nothing new for these songs. It was like listening to a karaoke singer in a bar do these songs. I love this style of music, and would really look forward to NEW songs in this style being written and recorded by Michael Buble, but to do nothing more than sing the songs in the same style as the original doesn't warrant shelling out your hard earned bucks. I have my Sinatra, Sammmy, and Dean CD's, and if you have any of their CD's, skip this one. It's nothing more than a poor imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good choice of music but average voice","review":"As avid ballroom dancer I am addicted to old band music.

I bought his CD soon after.Kissing a Fool is the only song on the cd I can say I like and even that wasn't near as good as what I heard on Mrs. O. In my opinion he doesn't do justice to any of the covers on his cd.I was really disappointed with his slow, melancholy, ushy gushy style. What were supposed to be smoldering, smokey ballads were utterly nauseating!If you want to hear Frank Sinatra or George Michael buy the originals.If you get sloppy drunk and want to cry, buy it.I think if it was packaged with a razor blade he could be charged with assisted suicide, cause it made me want to slash my wrists...

However as a bilingual+ household, this is one I will not be playing to my 3 year old again.

The PC version IS NOT! It is basically a series of mind-numbing mini-games and 2-D platforming that tends to frustrate the kids more than anything else. My kids got tired of getting stuck and gave up.The funny part is that most XBOX and PS2 games are originally created with programming tools on the PC - so why create such a simplified uninteresting game for the PC user.

People with installation issues should look at their systems first before assuming it is the game. So many situations are caused not by the game, but by the system it is on. Troubleshoot.

The books methods don't train fast muscle fibers that are needed in jumping, on the contrary, the only thing it trains is your lactic acid endurance. I gained nothing, instead after 5 weeks of that crazy overtraining I had an injury on both of my knees (jumper's knee). The best method to improve your vertical leap is through weight training (low repetitions and heavy weights) and plyometrics (The Science of Jumping, Jumping into plyometrics, etc.). The AirAlert2 could only work for individuals with poor jumping ability (< 20\\"), but for them too this is a bad choise because of the high risk of knee injury. The best vertical program I know of is The Science of Jumping combined with weight training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and energy","review":"Does not work.

The problem is, it requires complete dedication. You won't get the results promised if you only do the workout 3 times a week. I tried that and I gained nothing in 2 weeks. But when I worked out for 2 weeks, 5 days a week, I actually gained 2.5 inches on my vertical. I feel the nutritional instructions could also be improved. If I could do it all over again, I would NOT follow the nutritional instructions. It is not complete information. Because of it, I gained a lot of fat and is still not able to get rid of it. It is advisable that you know your physical limitations and adjust the program so it fits your physical abilities. Otherwise, I believe it is a very helpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hops","review":"My son started this program, but was playing basketball four times a week. His legs were so fatigued that he could not be 100% on the court. The author recommened cutting back to three times a week. Even though he was unable to contiue, after six weeks he gained 3 inches. Now that he has stopped the program he has gained more. After basketball season he will start from week five to completion.

It definitely is inappropriate for anyone under 17. It was inspired by something from Greek mythology, but is set in modern France. It has some very disturbing scenes. Without looking up reviews, I cannot say that I understood what the director was exactly trying to say. It does have some expositions of a part of society that are not talked about openly, so I would say that this lack of exposure probably explains somewhat my lack of understanding of the themes that the director had in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners!","review":"I am extremely dissapointed with this software!

While flashy, the lessons were frustrating because they assumed I already knew vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar. When I tried to find a way to learn the vocabulary directly, I couldn't. I suppose this is the \\"immersion\\" technique. Personally, it felt like an exercise in futility. I would rather learn material, then work with it, instead of working with it on a basis of ignorance.

I found it difficult to start reviewing at the level they describe as beginner. The software is confusing to navigate even if you have a Spanish language background.

Well, its gone much further than that. Listen carefully to this CD and you will hear traces of all the great players --a little Art Tatum, a few bars of what I would swear was James P. Johnson, some Monk, here a little Red Garland, there a trace of Bud Powell (more than a trace, actually), and none of her playing is derivitive - it's all taken further than where it started. And, in addition to a strong sense of time, theres all the melody you might want. This stuff is lyric, a big relief from the very hard bop pianists (know who I mean?) who arn't having fun unless the music is jarring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joanne's Got It All","review":"It takes a high-calibre musician to make a solo piano album and keep it consistently arresting, amusing, exciting and challenging. But, then, Joanne Brackeen is perhaps the finest living jazz pianist of her generation. There is nothing she can't do, and, apparently, nothing she can't imagine. In her familiarity with the whole spectrum of jazz piano history she reminds a bit of Jaki Byard, but she is even more imaginative, more daring and more entertaining than that extraordinarily gifted player. She is indeed a jazz treasure of almost immeasurable worth. The little interview on the last track is a welcome touch too. Joanne is just as cool as you thought she would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks, the company sucks","review":"I ordered a repair manual for my Kia, I have no idea what they sent me but it was not in English and apparently their customer service sucks and Amazon would not step up to the plate either..

The recording is a little bright, but generally this is a very good set that is only in need of a degree more adventure from Lindberg.

This is the first time I ever got gloves in a small that were to small. The length is fine, a little long in the tips even but they are so narrow I can barely get my skinny, bony, wrist in them. I'm skinny and these gloves strangle my wrist and hands. But the gloves are great so I ordered 2 more pairs but in a medium. Unless your hands are the size of an eight year old get mediums.So other than the size issue they deserve a 5 stars for quality. Good grip.

Those of you who find Charlie Munger interesting should find Vandana Shiva right up your alley due to her multi-perspective/disciplinary independent thinking.Also, it gives you glimpses of history that have either been forgotten or glossed over.

However, when I saw this \\"soundtrack\\" was full of Christian pop acts, I was worried. If the creators of this movie want to be true to the spirit of the books, they will score the film with inspirational, yet timeless, instrumental music (like in Lort of the Rings). I realize this is likely not the official soundtrack of the movie -- Disney wants to ensure the big bucks from the Christian community by putting out this \\"inspired by\\" crap. My fear is that it will scare away non-Christians who would otherwise enjoy the films. Let's leave it to the viewer (and listener) to interpret the subtext however they wish. C.S. Lewis said himself that The Chrinicles of Narinia are not Christ allegories, but fairy tales, fantasies. It's MY fantasy that Steven Curtis Chapman and the like are nowhere to be found in the actual film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"When I saw this cd I pick it up without checking out the case thoughly for my 10 year old daughter, who is a big Narnia fan.I thought it was an early release of the sound track because of the art work on the cover is from the film,the same title fonts of the film , the disney name.When I went to play this cd my daughter was sure I had put the wrong disc.

It's also available on Amazon.com from Sparrow records.

I have been listening to the song ever since - in fact the song started playing while I was writing this review.When I found out when the entire album was going to be available I went to my local Christian bookstore that week and bought a copy of the CD. \\"Remembering You\\" still remains as my favorite from the album and still remains about the only song from the CD I have placed onto my computer to listen to.Although I am not really a Jars of Clay or a Rebecca St. James fan I did enjoy their songs. \\"Turkish Delight\\" by David Crowder Band may be my least favorite, but as I listen to it over and over I might enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes the Reader Down a Slippery Slope","review":"Under the guise of promoting \\"civil\\" dialogue, Etzioni takes the reader down a slippery slope whereby \\"community standards\\" are allowed to eclipse the rights of individuals.This is particularly scary if you are a member, as I am, of a minority. When individual rights are abrogated, then those of us in the minority are subject to \\"The Tyranny of the Majority\\" (as the much-reviled Lani Guinier appropriately titled her book).

Otherwise, wait for the upcoming Spielberg remake. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing tones","review":"Thanks Nationwide for using Half Acre in your commercial. I'm still not gonna use your insurance but I do owe you a debt of gratitude for introducing me to this group. This music is incredibly soothing and such a nice change of pace from mainstream radio. Number 12, Polly's Dress, reminds me of the score for While You Were Sleeping which means I totally watch that movie too much to be able to draw similiarities to other music. Having recently rewatched Ken Burns' The Civil War, I've had folk music melodies running through my head and this is the perfect antidote.

The rest of the songs on the CD are great as well, most set a fairly calm mood, but the vocals vary from high to low throughout.

But this is one of the few shows where the lead character is no longer in his own show at the end of it! The stories are hot and steamy and are not for kids, this is a \\"quincy\\" type detective show in a way with forensic pathologists getting involved with crime cases. As the one star reviews have pointed out these characters do drink too much but that has happened in all work fields before so it doesn't hurt this show one bit so I disagree with their star levels. THe stories are good and the acting is good and it's prime 1990's gritty crime stories all the way. This is not for kids though. This one was on for 3 years 1995-98 it could have lasted longer if Hannah hadn't quit. Parker couldn't be expected to save the show without the lead character in it , but that episode is a good one still."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCallum: The Series","review":"The series is over burdened with promiscuous sex, nudity, booze, sex and gore.The plot gets lost in the smart, slurred, unintelligible, angry dialog but that doesn't matter-the program is about shock and gore and more gore. It is sick and I am sorry I wasted money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCallum: The Complete Series","review":"Never heard of this series, but it was a recommended DVD set based on my \\"likes\\" and purchases. Great recommendation. I loved this British version of CSI. I just wish the series was longer. It was more like a mini-series. Again, if you like the CSI series this is a good mystery/suspense DVD set to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The series suffers from an obsession with promiscuous sex and nudity that add nothing to the plots of the episodes. When the characters aren't preoccupied with sex, they are preoccupied with drinking. In the midst of this the writers throw in a murder and the characters take a break from their debauchery just long enough to solve the crime and catch the bad guys. Not worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"My review here is no reflection on Amazon.com. This guy can't act. Nor can he talk. One of my Grandmothers is from Yorkshire, and the other one is from Manchester so I am used to the British accent, but I have to listen very very carefully to understand this guy. He's Scottish isn't he? With the possible exception of the lab Phd. there's not one person in this whole series that can act. I was very disappointed. To say that this was the predecessor of the CSI franchises, is to insult good programming. Even though those CSIs have jumped the shark by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"starts well and goes downhill from there","review":"John Hannah and rest of cast struggle with a common problem...writers who start like an Olympic sprinter and end totally unravelled barely able to get across the finish line. Too much silly business of McCallum acting like a 12 yr old and then audience expected to believe he is a crack intellect full of perception...without sense enough to keep his pants zipped...people are just written out of the series and others grabbed to fill the void..the last show it would seem we are to believe McCallum in living the good life in LA...no other explanation and a new head pathologist and VERY irritating and unprofessional assistant...if they weren't going to meet Hannah's salary just end the program...which is what must have happenned....UNRAVELING and whimpering to an end...too bad...it was a good premise"},{"rating":"2","title":"My views on the McCallum series","review":"The stories were excellent. I was surprised, however, at the amount of full nudity shown and sexual situations. They were totally unnecessary and did not enhance the stories. Also, the last episode did not even have McCallum in it,but was like a pilot for the Lynley series. That was very disappointing, especially after we had gotten to see relationships grow, go through problems, find solutions, and had gotten to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the characters. My wife and I decided if we ever decide to watch the series again, doubtful, we will just skip the last episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and shoddy","review":"I bought the series based on the Amazon reviews as well as the lead actor John Hannah. Both have let me down terribly. Hannah is a much more mannered actor than I had previously realized, taking quick shortcuts to show complex emotions. And the scripts gets sillier as the series progresses. Some might call it gritty and realistic, I just call it cheap and shoddy.To say that this series inspired CSI is like saying the Egg McMuffin inspired Eggs Benedict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"This is one of the finest examples of British police/forensic programmes ever. My only complaint is that they didn't make more episodes - with John Hannah.I disagree with it being a forerunner to CSI though - as I think McCallum is entirely different. McCallum is so much more realistic, and a far far superior drama at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I am a huge John Hannah fan I when I found this was out I just had to get it.

It might be said that Sumera strings themes together to get somewhere rather than to go around in circles. His music seems to grow and progress rather than merely to repeat, and the overall effect is quite robust and satisfying.

I've been a fan of both for years and look out for anything they are in. I enjoyed the movie very much and got a kick out of seeing both actors at different stages in their lives. Its really Bills movie because Mark isn't shown that much, but it was still fun seeing him post Star Wars (loved the beard).

Filmed in Turkey, this visually stunning piece of film making (boasting an impressive cast, including Mark \\"Skywalker\\" Hamill) shows some very impressive flight shots. The plot goes into what it is to be human, and has quite a good AI theme underlying throughout. On a basic level, it is a chase movie, where a fugitive from justice is hi-jacked by a privateer for a profit, but as time goes on, the privateer and his prisoner form a unique bond. However, the film was quite low budget, and some of the directing loses much of its impact because of this. The script also leaves a lot to be desired.

Tuneful progressions of simple instrumentation evoke spots of sunlight amongst the rain. A must-have for fans of peaceful instrumentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm...","review":"I was very excited about this album. I have read a lot of reviews and was pretty sure that this was something that I would enjoy. This assumption was correct to a point, but also very wrong. There are a few compositions on this album that are worth while, and then there are some who make me feel like I have trancended into an soundtrack for an 80's movie.The instrumentals themselves are not anything wonderful either. Very simple and seem to lack any true human emotion. The use of electronics is a little too much for me, I would prefer using acutal instruments... but perhaps that is just my taste.I would recommend this to someone who has a taste for 80's style electronics or someone who is simply willing to take a chance. Like I stated earlier, a few of the songs on this album are very decent, while others fail to provide anything but slow moving monotanous noise.If you do not own any rachels albums, I highly suggest you purchase any one of those before taking a chance on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better live, but still great","review":"Caught them at the Sigur Ros show in Seattle.

Rajen Persaud is a male - not a female. 2.The art on the cover of the book DOES NOT tell you what is in the book. Personally I would feel better if Mr. Persaud would disclose his own ancestry - I suspect from his photo that it plays into his decision to write the book.3. This link [...] will take you to an interview with Persaud so you can hear him discuss what his reasons are for writing the book.4. His primary reason appears to be that he found a subject that would get his sales up higher than his previous books.5. There is little that is back up with empirical evidence or even can be shown to be factual in this book so if you want one (more) man's opinion on this subject spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Poor","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author brings nothing new to the discussion of interracial relationships. There is no consistency to his logic and his \\"humor\\" is mean-spirited, bitter and most importantly, not funny. He has a very fine opinion of himself, which he never hesitates to share with the reader. This is a perfect example of a book being sold by its cover alone. The \\"author\\" is apparently getting people to buy the book based on it's provocative title alone. I guess he did one thing right when putting this trash together. Awesomely awful. One star is one star too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth is the Light","review":"Although sometimes a bit patronizing, Mr.Persaud delves into some truths that are known throughout the African-American community, but are sometimes not spoken of. Additionally, he provides some historical information that may not have been known among African-Americans. His use of language may offend some, but it doesn't distract from the overall logic, truth and vitality of the work. I highly recommend it for any African-Americans who are still struggling or puzzled by our behavior and the effects that PTSS (Post-Traumatic Slave Syndrome) has had on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive racist trash, Boycott Boycott Boycott","review":"I didnt want to give it one star but it forced me to.Double standard time. Blacks can attack the moral character of whites as much as they want, but if the opposite happened it would be racism. I'm sick of this garbage period. I saw booksamillion selling this book today and I will never go to that store again. If Amazon doesn't remove this garbage ASAP I will not be shopping at amazon and I WILL be telling **EVERYONE** I know about the kind of books that amazon carries and condones.

No substance","review":"This book asserts a childish review of why black men are interested in white women. Everything falls back on slavery. That's 130 years ago.

Does every person who loves outside there race suffer some mental condition or is just when a black man marries a white women. If I married a asian women or a Kenyan women would that mean i really loved her. I'm surprised the author is even attracted to black men. she implies their just simple and shiftless as supremecists' always implied. My indian buddy married a thai girl. What does that mean? He does like thai food alot.The best mate for her must definitely be non-black. then she'd know it's real.Most of my male black friends assume white male black women are together for the same genuine, materialistic or superficial reasons all folks marry each other.

However, his opinions are a bit extreme to me and based on reading his book, I've concluded that the question asked cannot be answered, and I honestly think we need to advance enough as a people to not have to ask it.

But a professor that I highly respect recommended the book. I was extremely pleased with the way Persaud wrote of his experiences and observations. I had to agree with him in most aspects. Race is an on going issue in America, Persaud was able to enlighten his readers and opened up a needed discussion on this painfully subject. My book club discussed this book and everyone said they would recommend it to others. This was the first time in over 11 years that we elected to continue our discussion on book for a second meeting. Basically don't let the title turn you off. It is really worth reading and discussing with family, friends and co-workers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism seems to still exist.","review":"This book seemed to tell the African American male to stick with their own kind; i.e., the African American female. I was hoping that this book was dealing with good issues, like how to date as interracial couples. In my family, we were brought up to love everyone. We never taught our children or our children's children about racism; it's something they learned in school. So this book made me upset thinking that the author didn't want black men dating outside their own race. The world lives with sin every day; but we can stop racism if the parents will stop teaching their children to 'hate' but rather, love all people. No matter what race, color, creed, etc...I really wanted to know how to love another race, because in my family we have African American's, Oriental, and Hispanic. We love everyone. I wanted to see what it was like knowing that black men were dating whites; but this is not what it was about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book- Good insight","review":"This is such a good book!!

This book is well written and I feel better now that I understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below par","review":"I stepped into this book knowing VERY little about 3dsmax and 3D modelling in general. The book is very unfocused. It starts to explain something like modifying a spline, but doesn't go into detail when they tell you to lock the vertices to modify them all at once. It's like the author has a severe case of ADD. Then again, it was written by--how many?--eight authors? And at around 1300 pages, it's just TOO big.

Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. Yeah, it has a few grossout moments and some graphic violence, but it's written with such little buildup and suspense, it loses it's intended effect. For such a short novel, I was also surprised at the number of typos the book has. It has a few decent bits here and there -- I enjoyed the diaper scene for some twisted reason -- but I can't recommend this mainly because of the lack of story. Wait, that's not fair, there is a story -- a crazy man has decided that sex and torture are a fast way for overweight women to lose weight so he puts it upon himself to help them shed some pounds. Huh? Yeah. That's the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty gross, but I can say I read it","review":"Hmmmm... this book was recommended to me by Amazon because I enjoy Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho & movies like Audition, Ichi the Killer, Irreverisble, & Natural Born Killers.

In fact, it grosses me out to have it in my house. I keep lending it to friends to keep it out of my house.Was it worth it? Like I said, it's one of those things where you can say \\"Ew, I read that.\\" My friends who borrowed it wonder what the hell is wrong with me.Parts were sickening, parts were kinda a turn on for me, the end was almost unbearable. Some female enpowerment moments at the end. Mostly over the top & not necessary. Am I afraid of the dark now? Nope.Give it a try if you seem to be like me. You can say you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am a professional consulting astrologer, researcher and astrology teacher, and find this book to be among the finest astrology works in my collection. It takes astrology into the world of transpersonal psychology, history, biography, and archetypal mythology -- and yet it's easy, a breeze to read. Richard's writing is clear, excellent, intellectually sound; this book will get you thinking, and get you understanding how to work with the planet Uranus. I also recommend books on Chiron if you are interested in this area of astrology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consciousness Shift","review":"The study of astrology suffers from so much superficiality that most people would never even consider it to hold significant universal truths. Despite all the rather banal treatments in the media, there are just too many people who do not realize what a powerful tool it can be in helping us to evolve a more coherent picture of not only ourselves but of the world we live in. In this treatise of the \\"planet\\" Uranus, Tarnas begins a serious discussion of the appropriate mythologic archetype that is sadly overlooked by the majority of astrology books out there (Rob Hand, Barbara Hand Clow, and even Liz Greene). No cookbook approach here. A brilliant synthesis from one of our greatest philosophers and a suitable start before broaching the subject matter of his recent opus, Cosmos & Psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting","review":"This film is family oriented and keeps you interested in what about to happen great job with all the cast members"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new band","review":"This a super CD from a new band.

They are science lectures delivered by cardboard cutout characters in space suits.The first story, 'Cold Front' is, I swear this is true, a meteorological story where the weather is the main focus. I kid you not. I tried a few more and, finding them the same, returned the book.If you read SF for a science puzzle then this will send you into orbit. I have no doubt his science is correct, but had I wanted to read a science text I would have bought one.If, like me, you prefer your fiction with vivid characters, exciting plot, fresh dialog and most of all...conflict, then avoid this author.Try instead Silverberg, Poul, Triptree or Leiber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible- I couldn't wait to sell it back","review":"This recording does not to justice to these wonderful works by Paul Hindemith. I had already owned the Kashkashian version of these pieces, and I was hoping to hear another interesting version of some music that I loved. This recording did not even present the pieces in a manner in which the compositions sounded like they were of any quality.

Interlaced throughout are great articles on events, competitions, mechanical upgrades, and owner customization.

And the one song in the middle that's kind of a downtempo track just jumps into another upbeat house track and it sounded horrible.

But over all this book is very good!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to force myself to finish it...","review":"This was simply one of the worst ideas that Stephen King has had. It was way to hokey to really grasp the attention of the reader. It is understandable that King came up with this idea. If I were King, I, too, would fear that my dark half would come to life and stalk me. However, I do not think that King's, or anyone else's dark half would come out being a deteriorating wannabe badass. This book would be a wonderful B-Movie. I've not seen the movie, but the quality of this story fits the B rating. Normally I can read King's books in no time flat; it took me a month to finally force myself to finish this book. Perhaps this would be a good horror novel for someone who is just getting ready to break away from R.L. Stine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is awful!","review":"While I was definitely lured by the storyline of this particular King novel, the typos on the Kindle version are too frequent for comfortable reading. I don't know who exactly is in charge of the Kindle versions of some of these novels, but someone really should thoroughly review the conversion to Kindle format."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of King's most Uninspired Works to Date","review":"Being a Stephen King fan for years, I was completely disappointed when I read the first King book I didn't like (I later read Skeleton Crew, which was also quite bad). The charcters were drawn poorly, the horror was of the most generic and expected variety, and the plot was really lacking. For the first time, King writes like an amateur, and it's as if he is writing to overcome his boredom, as a time-filler. Even die-hard King fans can skip this one without remorse"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense/horror story","review":"One of my favorite King books. A solid story about a character a writer has created coming back from the dead and holding the writer to ransom. Easy to read and in the style of the older 50's -70's private eye stories, but with a twist. I thought this book flowed well story wise and was fairly short when compared to some of his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little long-winded at times, but still a great story!","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it 20 years ago and I love it now, too. It's slightly long-winded in parts and the kindle version has a lot of typos, but I still enjoyed it. The story is creepy and so imaginative and complex. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decide to Quit King After This One","review":"A short story made long with endless and cumbersome writing. There may be a good story here but King missed it. Years went by before I was talked into reading King again. That book was Insomnia. Haven't read King since. Shame since I used to read everything he wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling and confusing","review":"The title of the novel tells it all: The Dark Half. Although I don't fully understand the plot, I enjoyed it very much. I think this book was darker-sided than other Stephen King novels. I would've given this book rating five stars if it made better sense. Or maybe I need to read more books. But besides that, it's an excellent first King novel to read, to see how brilliant novels he can write."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FOR KINDLE","review":"Good lord this book is full of typos. I'm not knocking the quality of the story since it was impossible to read through all the mistakes. I'm talking typos in every single paragraph. DON'T BUY THIS KINDLE VERSION!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book !!!","review":"actually i give this book 4 and a half stars . it is at times really scary , the characters are so lifelike and the idea is amazing . keep on rockin , stevie !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Except maybe for The Stand, the BEST KING BOOK!","review":"I reitirate my statement above as I feel that the Dark Half is one of his gretest achievements. He makes the reader get completely involved in the story line and brings each of his characters to life with the utmost of skill. The suspense and fear gradually increases through the plot to a climaxtic BANG right at the end. More of the same please...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced, Creepy","review":"A classic King novel. I enjoyed it, although it's not my favorite. It's fast-paced and creepy. About a novelist who is being harassed and pursued by a killer, one that seems to know him well. The ending was pretty satisfying and the characters were interesting and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Plot","review":"The Dark Half is the first Stephen King novel I bought. For some reason the little paragraph summary on the inside flap of the book caught my attention, and the book undoubtedly carried it through.The plot was very clever and well thought out. I was impressed to say the least. The concept in this book was a great one as well and it gave me a very good idea of Stephen King's style. It's not one of his strongest books, but its brilliant nonetheless. I was amazed by this book and it only made me want to go out and buy more King novels. The only thing lacking is the character development which really shows in King's later novels. This is one of his earliest works, so it lacks in areas where his latest don't. But its always fun to read an author's earlier books, even when they aren't as good as the new ones. It just gives you a nice perspective, Anyways, I highly recommend this book, its well worth your time and I hope you are as dumbfounded by it as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling enthrawling story.","review":"This was the first stephen king novel I have read and i was not disappointed with the context. I was scared stiff. I would recomend this book to any reader not just horror readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale!! A solid effort from King!!","review":"What I really liked about this book was how the reader kept switching from Thad Beaumont's mind into George Stark's mind.I was envisioning King writing the book when Beaumont was the center of the story, and Richard Bachman writing when Starkwas the center of the story. George Stark has to be one of the scariest creatures ever invented by Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"This is the first time I've read a novel by King, and I must say I was impressed. I normally don't go in for Novels where the authors name is printed larger than the title; it reeks of commercialism, of trying to sell a book based on the authors name alone. But damn if King isn't one hell of good writer.I'm one of those \\"literate\\" types who is loathe to succumb to anything as popular as Stephen King. In doing so I think I've forgotten how fun it can be to read a book for pleasure. Sure, there are themes in the book like the duality of man, an artists relationship to his art, etc., probably semi-autobiographical at some points too, but as I read this book I actually found myself having a great deal of fun. It's damned creepy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book you can stop reading","review":"This was the first king book I've read, And at the time, the best book I've had the pleasure of reading, (until I read Green Mile by King), from the minute you find out whats in Thad's head(more way than one) your glued to it, I mean, this book was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too long!!","review":"When I started this book, it was pretty good, but it just dragged on too long. During the second half of the book, I already knew what was going to happen and it got so boring that I didn't even finish it."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-e04f550f"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/44.md","filePath":"sponsor/44.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/44.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
