In this book, Shelley Campbell, a pottery shop owner, and Alan, a Senator and son of Daniel McGregor, meet at a D.C. party. Alan knows from the start Shelley's the one he wants, but Shelley needs some convincing. She's especially fearfully of his presidental ambitions, as her father had them and was assasinated. The rest of the family is incorporated into the story, an ingrained part of Robert's style that adds to the overall warmness and displays the depth of family love. Read about how Alan and Shelley fall in love with each other, all the ins and outs of their characters, and discover the magic of Nora Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel MacGregor Has Met His Match!","review":"ALL THE POSSIBIITIES is part of the MacGregor Series and is a story focusing on Shelby Campbell and Senator Alan MacGregor. If you've read any of Nora Roberts's books regarding the MacGregors, you'll know how enjoyable this family can be.Yes, Alan is a child of Daniel MacGregor, so you know that he's being drilled about marriage and adding to that MacGregor bloodline. But Daniel isn't so sure about a Campbell coming into the family, as they have been enemies from way back. But Shelby can hold her own against this rambunctious old meddler. The question is can she hold her own against her memories of the assassination of her father so she can follow her heart?ALL THE POSSIBIITIES is a very cute story, which is a quick read. Most could probably read it in a day or two at the most. It's a feel good story with great character description. And anything with Daniel MacGregor in it is enjoyable to read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell the publishers to price more appropriately.","review":"Because I am not going to pay twice what I paid initially to re-purchase half the book: I own the paperback Alan/Grant format, and love both stories, but sorry, guys, not going to overpay for the convenience of the digital format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story -- way over priced","review":"I like the story a lot, but the publishers are really stretching things with the way they are pricing what is basically half of a book.

It could have been so wonderful, if only the transfer engineer and producer had listened to what they produced before issuing it! More than half of the songs suffer from what appears to be a botched application of noise reduction technology, with sudden shifts in ambient noise between vocal and non-vocal sections, and distracting whistles and high-frequency noise which most likely have arisen from noise reduction software application gone awry.Such a shame, as the songs, all compositions of dance band-leader extraordinaire Isham Jones, are great, and the original recordings themselves quite good (with emphasis on post-1930 recordings).

That's not to say that Oppenheimer's discursive review of a whole lot of films is not enlightening, it's just that he just never brings it home.More than that, the prose is uneven; sometimes it is quite engaging, other times it is choppy and so obscure as to leave the reader saying \\"say WHAT?!\\"The high point of the book, I think, is his discussion of evil vis a vis language.

It always amazes me that, after having read a book that is very sappy, unbelievable and poorly written, I come to Amazon and read so many gushing reviews. Maybe my expectations are just too high, but I don't think that is the case. I read a lot of differnt books by a lot of different authors. I loved The Horse Whisperer, but this one was plain bad. The imagery and symbolism seemed forced, the characters weak, the dialog even was unbelievable and the whole story was just unrealistic. Yes, the smoke jumper part was interesting, but the rest of the story is so predictable. I just reached the part where Julia is going to go off to Uganda with her 8-year-old daughter.

But this one was a disappointment. It was predictable,(from a romance novel standpoint), and hokey,(two men who are best friends hopelessly in love with the same woman). Please!One thing I loved about the other two books was the realism about real life relationships. The actual smoke jumping part was pretty good, but that occupies only a small part of the novel. About half of it takes place in Africa with the main character, Connor, trying to do good deeds. But the ending was so Lassie-come-homish. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke Jumper's a great read","review":"Smoke Jumper is great because it takes us to places most of us have never been physically, and most likely will never go to, and yet takes us emotionally to places we've all been to. The buddy setup seems the direction of choice as Conner, the cowboy from Montana, and Ed, the rich kid city boy musician, bond when teaming up for the elitist smoke jumping bregade that fight western fires. Everything changes as Ed brings a girlfriend, Julia, into the mix who quickly creates an unsaid closeness to Conner. The story takes on some emotional strands as the close threesome split through tragedy, misfortune, and deep life altering chioces. As his best yet, I challenge Nicholas Evans to top this......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have jumped long before finishing this book.","review":"I have just finished this book and was gravely disappointed (though not surprised at all) at the outcome. Any intelligent reader would have the end figured out after the first section, if not sooner. What a shame that the two most lively characters in the story suffer untimely demises leaving the book dry and cold reading.The author also has a bad habit of running off in many directions leading the reader down a very boring path. This book could have, and most definitely should have, been at least 125 pages shorter.The only reason why I continued to read was because I wanted to prove my original hypothesis correct (and I did). It's such a shame that two characters (Julia & Connor) didn't perish in the many, many occasions they \\"stumbled\\" into together.One could only hope they don't make this into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have I read it before?","review":"I didn't entirely dislike the book, but I kept thinking I'd read it before by Nevada Barr, Elmore Leonard (Pagan Babies), and John Irving (Cider House Rules). The stories weren't exactly alike so there wasn't any plagarism, but the various thoughts were somewhat the same - forest fire fighters, Glacier Nat'l. Park, African atrocities and the love triangle. They all made fairly good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"This was by far the worst book I have ever read. I will never read another of his books and I think he should quit writing.He jumps around so much in the story and it truly isn't about smoke jumpers. It is about a photographer being in Africa.

I probably should have given up sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy pre-teen romance","review":"I started reading this expecting an exciting tale of the Smoke Jumpers, fire fighting tactics, and adventure. What I got was a sappy pre-teen romance soap opera that resembles a Harlequin romance.

I have read all his books and the Loop is the the one I enjoyed the most. I live in Montana and enjoyed reading about places I have been but, the characters were spinless and there was no reason to like them. The writing had no continuity and you wonder if perhaps you are reading a couple of different books. So, save yourself some time and money and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This was one of the most boring, disjointed books I've ever read. One would have thought that a book titled \\"The Smoke Jumper\\" might have been about firefighters or forest fires or something along those lines. Instead it's about every random thought that jumps into the author's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal","review":"Writer's block -- that's one possible explanation for this awful book. The first 1/4 of the book was interesting, concentrating on smokejumping. Then it seems Evans either picked up a plotline for a different book, had writer's block and was inspired by a \\"60 Minutes\\" segment, or faced a publisher's manuscript deadline. After increasingly predictable and syrupy \\"plot\\" turns, the protagonist -- if she can be called that -- moves herself and her adolescent daughter from Montana to a war zone in Uganda. At this point, my ability to suspend my disbelief was shattered and I threw the book against the wall.Equally irritating was Evans' use of page after page describing characters' inner thoughts and feelings. Anyone capable of such complex thoughts should be a nuclear physicist. Any author who uses this technique should stop writing until he has an idea for a real story with real characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I had so looked forward to reading Smoke Jumper based on my enjoyment of Evans' other books...i.e. The Loop and The Horse Whisperer. I was surprised and disappointed when I got into the story. The story line came across so contrived it was hard to imagine Evans putting out such work. The characters were so heroic they were totally unbelievable. I scanned the last 100 pages mainly to see if what I had already figured out would actually happen. And....it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like bad books...","review":"I got this book in hardcover as a gift. I will admit that I had never read this author before, but if this the type of contemporary novel that tops best seller lists, then I fear for the reading public.The novel centers around three young charcters and their fantastic, overly simplified, romantic lives. Each scene seemed ready for translation into film. Every minor character was written as a stereotype. Despite that this book is 400 pages long, it could easily fit into 2 hrs of movie-viewing. And it will.This book made me nauseous. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this book??","review":"What happened to the smoke jumpers? Where did they go? This was a decent beginning with a very poor end. I bought this book after enjoying the Horse Whisperer. I enjoyed the western location and figured it was going to stay there and then read about fires, smoke jumping and romance. How do we get to Africa?

The plot is contrived and predictable. The writing is clear and direct, but there is no complexity or depth. I was very disappointed.

I found the early parts somewhat interesting, particularly about smoke jumping, but then the book began to drag. I hung on because of the ridiculous subplots that followed one after another. Skimming made it easier, but I could still follow the generally boring, superficial characters wherever they went -- from Montana to New York to Bosnia to Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak, weak book","review":"Not to be overly critical, but this is a very poor book from the author of a very good one (Whisperer). There is nothing that could be done with this manuscript because every single sentence is so mediocre. The book starts with a poor decision, opening with a runaway called Skye who is not a very important character in the book. (She should be, but she isn't.) The book should have started with the Ed bar scene, and Julia stealing his parking space. From there, the book only gets worse, empty sentences, half-hearted action -- even the finale, when Julia and Connor see each other, In Africa, they'd be running toward each other, they wouldn't be TALKING. Just a really poor book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Use of Traumatic Events to Develop Plot and Character","review":"This book has everything I love in a story: slightly dangerous occupations (my writing regularly features EMS and military characters). War and chaos. A handsome, brooding male character. A love triangle ... and a happy ending (I'm a sucker for those). Evans did a masterful job of using traumatic events and showing how the characters develop because of (or in spite of) them. The 'voice' of each was authentic and even though there were four points of view (telling their stories) I didn't have any moments of confusion like I have in other books. The only weakness: the purpose of the moose-on-fire imagery was unclear to me, other than a vague notion of significance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading for pleasure","review":"The book arrived in good condition as promised and arrived promptly as well.

Peter Weir directs assuredly this story of a young man whose entire life has been a t.v. show, adored by millions around the world. He has a perfec loving wife (the marvelous Laura Linney), and the best friend he could ever hope for (Noah Emmerich). The series' creator is played wonderfully by Ed Harris, who won an Oscar nomination, and deservedly so. He's like a father in his mind to Carrey, and he'll do anything to keep Carrey in his makebelieve world. Look for Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti in a small role; he's good in this one, too. The movie is poignant, bittersweet and by the time it's over, you'll be cheering for Truman Burbank too. A landmark movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Jim Carrey's performance in this movie was amazing. It certainly showed he can act in a serious role.

As moviegoers and as a society, we are searching for utopic transcendence, or at least the hope that it still exists. We want the life we've been promised, and if we can't have it, we settle for voyeuristic experiences of it. The Truman Show reveals our collective desires of living an idealized life, one which we are willing to give up individual autonomy to achieve. What is important to understand about The Truman Show and Pleasantville, is that we all think we want that life and our hegemonic culture industries are confecting it for us. The New World Order is in a Disney mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"For a some time I have been disappointed with most of Hollywood's big budget, action exhausting films that seem to have very little in the way of a plot. This film supersedes them all. Peter Weir again succeeded in transforming us to a world of interest, imagination, and thought. It was not only entertaining but also left you with a feeling of hope and the power of one man. Imagine my surprise when I found that the last film that I enjoyed this well, Gattaca, had the same screenplay writer, Andrew Niccol. Thumbs up to Jim Carrey who also showed us a little of his dramatic talent in The Mask. For a film connoisseur like myself this was truly a feast. A must for my movie library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"One word -- brilliance -- one name -- Jim Carrey. In his brilliant successful turn from rubber-faced comic to dramatic player, Jim Carrey does a fantastic job in The Truman Show.

Carrey's cartoon persona brilliantly matches Peter Weir's vision of a life permanently on line.

The characters and performances turned me off more than those of any other movie I've seen (with the exception of The English Patient), especially the actress who played Truman's nurse wife (she has a very unnatural, annoying screen presence). Jim Carrey's trademark comedic attributes seemed completely stifled--a huge waste of talent.I think this movie would have worked much better as a black comedy rather than a hokey melodramatic satire that took itself MUCH too seriously.

He would also have to have been the dumbest person ever to walk this earth - only waking up to strange events when he's in his late 30's! Peter Weir is a brilliant director - 'Gallipoli' being a superb movie and 'Dead Poets Society' a true credit to him and Robin Williams. The Truman Show was a complete disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"streaming interrupted","review":"So far, I'm not pleased with Amazon's streaming video. The movie kept stopping and starting. It was very annoying. The movie is great, but I'm not sure about Amazon's streaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truman Show","review":"This copy was so bad I thought I was watching a old real to real movie. Lines and artifacts throughout. Played other DVD's worked fine. Amazon did refund my purchase, but I wanted a good copy.Not sure if this was a Bootleg DVD or not. Oh and it was a Blue Ray, lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I watched this movie for one of my classes. Normally I get really bored with movies I have to watch for class, but this movie ened up being a good movie. If you are into sociology, then I recommend you watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good 15 years later","review":"An awesome movie. Great premise, with good and understated comedic acting by Carrey and another excellent performance by Ed Harris as Cristof. If you've ever wondered about the absurdity of \\"unscripted drama\\", watch this to see how far it could go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great price","review":"I was intrigued about the collector's edition. I used to have a copy of the film on VHS, but now only have a DVD player, and wanted to get the movie again. I have not explored all the features of the collector's edition yet, but I am very satisfied with the DVD copy and the price for which I obtained it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious Fable","review":"I was intrigued by the ingenious premise of this film. The Truman Show represents the ultimate in 'reality' television. Weir manages to pull off a blend of surreal comedy and human drama in a way that a lesser director might not have achieved, managing to keep the two elements in perfect balance without losing the impact of either.The film is a powerful tale that takes the current trend in reality television to the nth extreme, the story of a man whose life IS a TV show (unbeknownst to him). It lampoons the dangerous direction of current television, a journey which only seems to have accelerated since this movie was made. Manipulation, artificiality, the stifling of creativity and imagination, and the scandalous objectifying of human lives are all exposed in this satire. It shows us where the media is going, though its warnings go unheeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have changed my mind about Jim Carrey.","review":"I have never enjoyed Jim Carrey movie in my life. Imagine my surprise to find this movie was original, funny, sad and a movie that had me thinking even days after I saw it. Jim Carrey is exceptional and the movie is an absolute brilliant piece of work. Congratualtions to Jim Carrey, this movie shows what he is capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Wonderful Movie of the Year","review":"The Truman Show was a very strong & ultimate movie which everyone will want to see again & again no matter how many times they have seen it before.

I liked the idea of this movie, but I think that Jim Carrey was a poor choice for the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a big disappointment!!!","review":"What a letdown. This movie could have been so great. All that talent & all we get is a watered down mediocre twilight zone/ silly sitcom morph. There were so many opportunities for Peter Weir to go over the top, to be really imaginative & mind-stretching, but what we get is so totally boring & predictable (by a 5 year old child at that). I'm surprised they didn't cast Tom Arnold as Truman. A total waste of time & talent!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!! Clever premise!! Well-acted!!","review":"I think this movie is great. It's a very clever premise that is well-developed and well-done!! Pay attention to what's going on in the background, especially with newspaper headlines, billboards, radio announcers. Look for the camera lenses everywhere, fence posts, trash cans, jewelry. Look for the product endorsements, too, such as Mococo Hot Chocolate, as well as the Truman merchandise the viewers are clutching (the Truman Pillow!) It's hysterical!! Jim Carrey is great as the poor innocent schlub who slowly realizes he's being followed!! And Harry Shearer is wonderful as the TV interviewer! The music is great, too!! Excellant family movie viewing! I bought the wide-screen VHS version for only $7 at BestBuy, a great and cheap addition to my video collection!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of \`98","review":"I enjoyed this movie more than any other last year. It doesn't have the glaring plot holes of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and it stands up very well to repeat viewings. I also loved the unrequited love story. It was also vastly more original than anything else released last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"forget the actors, try to understand","review":"The Truman Show does not need Hollywood icons. Any critique or praise of the people ACTING the roles misses the intended effect of movies. To the point, movies convey ideas and emotions. After this, they seek an internal reaction in the viewer. Without a person alongside Truman to pound the unseen walls of reality and grasp the scope and profundity of false kinship, this movie crumbles. Perhaps this is the weak point of the movie. However, forgetting the hype and glamour of this movie helps a thoughtful and human viewer to understand. Besides, if this movie seems mundane, it is quite possible that YOUR life is mundane and you fail to cast the equivalent doubt upon yourself. Remember to associate with Truman, no matter how ridiculous it seems, and this movie will be a rewarding, though certainly not life-altering, experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more interesting now than when I first watched it","review":"I am not a big Jim Carrey or Ed Harris fan, but this is not your typical Jim Carrey comedy. Although still very funny, it is a bit more intellectually interesting than typical comedy fare. I would consider it somewhere in between Enemy of the State and The Mask (and wow that is a big difference). So it is even more surprising that I give this a five star rating. There is a lot of depth here that is unusual in 21st Century movies. I completely agree with another reviewer that commented the musical score is amazing. Even if you are not a Jim Carrey fan this is worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story Of A Lifetime","review":"Jim Carrey wanted to prove,like Robin Williams,that he could do drama just as well as comedy. Well he did it in a big way.How funny is it that this film almost shows what the stars of Hollywood go through? Carrey was wonderful as the lead character Truman,showing the world he can do both comedy and drama.I'm still pissed off the that Oscars didn't even give him an nomination he deserved. Another great proformance in the film was by Ed Harris as the creator of the show, showcasing Truman's life 24/7.This is probably my all-time favourite proformances by Carrey (note I haven't seen Spotless Mind yet) and I recommand it to anyone who's a fan of the actor and of the gerne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of its time","review":"Literally it was ahead of common place \\"reality TV shows\\" that pathetically envelopes our television today. The concept at the time was original with a sensational sense of theatre.When I first saw this film on a trip to LA I had an inkling of what genius lurks in Hollywood. This film combines major issues like relationships, romance, scripts, big brother and \\"Middle America\\" at its proverbial finest.Perhaps this is Carey's best film and he plays a sincere guy getting clued up to his true situation when he meets the love of his life, played I understand by an English actress. She was gorgeous.From then, it's about finding her and escape.The humour and lines are so unforgettable. Truman's wife advertising Mococo coffee beans from the mountains of Nicaragua. Shows you what suckers we viewers can be ...Sensational - especially for incurable romantics and those who seek the meaning of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was really good and they need to make another one","review":"this movie was really good jim.. you go and i think you should make another one but better. later got to run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant! Jum Carrey is Oscar worthy!","review":"One of the best movies ever made. a brilliant commentary on the state of our consumersist society that has placed the media at its center. Effective, becuase it criticizes both the Televison industry at the society that helps suppport it by watching anything. I teach a college English course, and I use this movie in my class to help teach the hidden messages of pop culture. Plus, you get to see proof that Jim Carrey is one of the country's finest actors. A breakthrough film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great accomplishment","review":"This movie, was an absolute favorite of mine. I saw it, and it reminded me of some things, and it made me realize how messed up people can be for money. I really enjoyed this one a lot and I'd suggest this movie to anyone and everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The Truman Show is an outstanding movie with an outstanding cast. It ranks as my second favorite movie of all-time (the Star Wars saga being my fave!). After I saw it in the theatre, I was staring at everything and everyone, wondering if this was the actual world or just some big bubble. Peter Weir, you are a genius!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry on Carrey","review":"And I thought Armageddon was unrealistic ! OK , I understand the intended message but I think the movie lacks a little subtlety . Still , looking back at his early movies this is one giant leap for Jim Carrey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Film that deserves an OSCAR","review":"This movie is like one of those great \\"Twilight Zone\\" shows that we all liked. The movie is very original because it takes an idea that has never been used before in movie. Jim Carrey gives a performance that many thought was never possible for a comedian to accomplish. This is a great DVD, and it may not have the extras, but extras are what keep movies from coming out on time. Afterall, the most important part is the movie itself, and whether the quality is excellent. You just can't get better than DVD. Alot of the areas that they used for \\"The Truman Show\\" were located at the college that I go to and others areas that I live near."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a wonderful, heart felt film that everyone should see!","review":"I LOVE this movie!!! I was surprised that they did not release this movie to buy when they released it to rent because I think it would have been a big hit. I just can't believe that Jim Carrey didn't get nominated for Best Actor! Come on! The man deserves an Oscar for putting on a straight face, alone! I'm just glad he beat that old Tom Hanks at the Golden Globes!!! See this movie! Buy this movie - preferably when they release it at a home video price! It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfecta","review":"Una gran pelicula, de las buenas que ha hecho J.Carrey.Recoemendada, una gran historia y una mejor musicalizacion que se ve perfecta en BluRay"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Ed Tv instead because this movie stinks","review":"I didn't expect to see a comedic performance from Jim Carrey when I bought this movie. However, with all the hype that it got, I expected to see a good movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The plot was loosely tied together. I felt that the movie's plot started at the end of Truman's story when the beginning would have been more interesting. With the exception of flashbacks, the audience was never allowed to understand the beginning or the end. What happens after he figures it out? I was also upset by the backhanded comparing of the character Christof and Jesus Christ. Maybe I read that in but I think if it was intentional then it was an insult to the audience. My suggestion to those who want to buy it to see Jim Carrey then they should buy it because he acted fairly well in it. However, if you want to buy it for the plot, then buy ED TV instead. Ed TV is a much better movie and more believeable without insulting the audience. The choice is yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely... Dumb","review":"1. I can intellectually understand the sentiment that many folks have for this film. I also understand that this is a movie, a fantasy and not reality. However, I can \\"believe\\" in the reality of something like... Star Trek compared to this completely odd, unrealistic, and basically dumb plot as outlined in the Truman Show.2. As is the case with most movies, it comes down to the narrative, the story and this story is so unbelievable with so many holes in it, that it really does detract from the enjoyment of the film.3. Bottomline: If you're someone who tends to think (even a little) while watching movies, then skip this amazing dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a dumb movie","review":"I hate this movie. I hate the plot, the concept is really stupid, and the ending is not a suspenseful cliffhanger but a mere cut out of nowhere. The director is obviously trying to suck as much money out of the public as possible because this is definetly a sequel ending. I give it ten thumbs down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Seriously' disappointing!","review":"To be fair, this movie was never meant to be a typical Jim Carrey vehicle like 'Ace Ventura' or 'The Cable Guy', nor was it advertised as such. Yet I was quite amazed at how utterly humourless it was, completely wasteful of Mr Carrey's tremendous talents. The mere mention of being 'snubbed' for an Oscar-nomination is preposterous!There is little to no story in this dull and overlong picture, apart from the original idea of a person's life as a TV show, which as I remember, was barely enough material for an episode of the 'Twilight Zone'. There is also an inept attempt at some kind of social commentary that goes nowhere, especially with Ed Harris' strange role as the god-like producer of the show providing the movie's most embarrassing moments. Beware too, of what must be the worst musical score in movie history."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN NOT BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE THIS MOVIE","review":"This is the most self indulgent movie Hollywood has ever produced. What is so original about this concept? It strikes me as something that was done by Rod Serling over 30 years ago.I can't believe that people are so enthralled with a movie that is predictable, boring and not very well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I have never been more disappointed in a film. I was excited to watch it for i like Jim Carrey and the plot interested me. this movie was a joke. To believe that this guy lives for 30 years without a clue and then one day realizes what is going on insults my intelligence. And are we really supposed to believe a person can live to be that old and never once leave the town he was born in. How ridiculous. Jim Carrey gave a better performance in Liar Liar and those who think he should get an oscar are crazy. The creators of this movie spent no effort to give us a worthwhile movie and it is just another case of the media hyping up a movie just because certain people are involved in it. To say it is a good movie is absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Carey shines in this flacid movie","review":"I had heard what an excellent movie this was. perhaps if I hadn't I would have enjoyed it a little more. The Truman Show was an interesting idea, but if this was the best show of 98, then movies must have really sucked that year. Actually, I saw much better movies in 98 so I know this is actually just a lie. I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't like it either. I have been more excited by the contents of a tissue after blowing my nose, but I threw the tissue away. I would do the same with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truman ain't all that!","review":"When I found out Jim Carrey was devastated upon hearing the news he was not nominated for an oscar for his performance in \\"Truman\\", i wondered what all his fuss was about. Gee Jim, whatcha gonna do now, run off and kill yourself? Get over it and stop pouting, your performance wasn't that great and to make matters worse the entire movie was certainly not worthy of any oscar recognition in my opinion. Fact of the matter is, \\"Truman Show\\" is a mediocre film about a man being watched by millions of onlookers. Well let me tell ya, this onlooker would have changed the channel, okay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining/thoughtprovoking","review":"The title says it all. Very well crafted movie. And a note to a previus reviewer who said that Carrey turns to the camera and says nothing at all - this is not his fault, it is yours for not picking up on it. The reason he does this is for dramatic effect. He can't see the cameras, but he can just sense something.. like something's not right. Sort of like \\"What is the Matrix?\\". Anyhow, Jim at his best here definitely, and the supporting characters fit well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent and thought-provoking","review":"If you're looking for a movie that's just for laughs, then this is maybe not it. Sure, there are a few funny parts, but the overall tone is very serious. Jim Carrey is magnificent in this movie. Not just a funny bloke but a serious one at that. If you're looking for a movie to make you think, then this is the one. The soundtrack is great too, and I suggest you get that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I thought this was a wonderful movie. I have seen it four times now and the last time I watched it, i did so with a friend who said they didn't care for it. they obviously have no taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like these paranoid movies","review":"Ever notice how the people who give a good movie like this one star have absolutely terrible punctuation and syntax? Ever heard of periods, guys? This was a very good, creepy, and visually stunning movie. Some of the subtle things are what makes it great. I definitely recommend many viewings of it, for you can't catch it all the first time. Jim Carrey proves he is a real actor and not just some rubberface. I hope his portrayal of Andy Kauffman is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea for a film","review":"When this came out, it was unique. I'd never seen anything like it. It was basically a film and filming a TV show. It sounded weird and almost Sci-fiish, but it was none of those things. It was actually a really good movie. Jim Carrey is perfect in this. It gives him the chance to really shine as an actor, combining the comedic and the dramatic to get an extrememly likable character. Its his best role, in my opinion. And, honestly, he is the reason to see this film because I don't think it would be as interesting with another actor. I really liked the soundtrack to this film as well, it was very moving at times. The rest of the cast also did a fantastic job. The utopian scenery blends in perfectly into this film and makes it all the more interesting. Its a great and differnt type of film that should be seen by all. It never strays too much in the goofiness arena, and is always endearing and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indignation is the word!","review":"This has got to be one of the greatest films in years. I'm not sure if anyone else has conjectured this, but I believe the film is a beautiful alegory about god. Truman lives his whole life under the control of one man,(who lives in the sky no less!) and by the end of the film, he has had a revealation about his potential; he realizes he has more hope in the \\"real\\" world than in Christof's. I believe Truman leaving the T.V. show at the end of the film is symbolic of a person leaving the protective bubble of god and exploring the possibilty of hope and beauty outside of a bounded life. But don't take my word for it, see the movie, and god forbid you actually think about it after it's over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the \\"collectors\\" edition?","review":"I saw this at the show (in the theatre for you outside the midwest) and loved it - I usually dislike Jim C but here he shines cause he *under* plays his role (hard to believe huh). HOWEVER, it's been said before here - I just wanted to add my vote: except for 2 trailers there is NO additional material - this obviously was *rushed* to DVD (I'm afraid we'll be dealing with this from now on). Also the \\"widescreen\\" isn't 1.85:1 - it's just narrow black bars at the edges of the screen, and there are some obvious cut-offs (half-faces, etc). If you \\"must\\" own this get a pre-viewed VHS and save some $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG BROTHERS AND BIG SISTERS","review":"The screenplay of THE TRUMAN SHOW isn't as original as it seems to be. I personally see three referential sources in it : The Prisoner TV episodes, Orwell's 1984 and Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL. What's truly original is the way Peter Weir has treated this screnplay.We knew, since PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, that this director is able to describe the fantastic side of the most normal situations. And it's really terrific to observe these actors surrounding Jim Carrey trying to act naturally when this actor has the utmost difficult task to play a character who doesn't know that his life is an act. That's really VERTIGO !At last Peter Weir has made an american movie of the quality of his early australian films. It was about time.A DVD to celebrate his resurrection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Truman\\" a huge breakthrough for Carrey!","review":"I saw an actor behind the face of Ace Ventura and Lloyd Christmas. I saw beyond the \\"Mask\\" and passed the \\"Cable Guy\\". I saw Jim Carrey as a very talented actor,not just annoying, and this movie proves that is such a talent. \\"The Truman Show\\" is such a wonderfully, impressive movie that even the Carrey haters of the world (anyone over 45)would have to take a second look. Fun movie that has a great message and is one of the best films of it's year. Wonderful film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"jim carry makes another brilliant movie","review":"Jim Carry is one of the greatest actors iv ever seen act this has to be his best movie he has made in his entire career. Its about time he made a drama movie.The director of this movie had came up with a brilliant and outstanding film if you like dramas and like Jim Carry you must see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I loved it","review":"I have a feeling that everyone except me thought that this wasa wonderful story, certainly more original than any film yet produced(like I said I loved it), but everyone later shoved Saving Private Ryan down my throat and later washed it down with Shakespeare In Love.Quit literally I vomited. It's a shame that the Academy is so predictable in their selections, even in the nominations. As soon as the \\"real best pictures\\" of 1998 came out, what is this \\"Truman Show?\\" Sounds too simple. Everyone saw the other films and shut down their minds, they left them to film critics and Miramax and the Academy and Veterans and women. Not to not sound p.c. or anything. Hell, they didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great metaphor for religion","review":"The Truman show was filmed in beautiful Seaside, Florida. Great place to visit if you get a chance.The movie is a pretty obvious metaphor for religion. A lot of people live their lives believing that their version of \\"God\\" created them, and in a sense watches over their lives the way Christoph (coincidence about the controlling character's name? I think not) does Truman's life.Truman realizes something ain't right several times. In the end, he stands at a door cleverly hidden in what he has always thought is his reality. The door is marked \\"Exit\\".The message is that it's OK to exit your religion. You can still believe in \\"God\\" in your own way, but there's a complete reality waiting for you that isn't defined by your life long religious belief.It's up to Truman (and you) whether to continue in the relatively safe, but maybe fake reality, or find a true reality outside of \\"The Truman show\\" or religion.I suspect \\"hell\\" doesn't lie at the other side of that exit door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is one of the greatest movies ever, mostly because of the brilliant script. It is pretty touching, creative, emotional and it really makes you think about how privilegded you are with your own privacy.Christof tries, or better say he still did, to create a perfect world\\" for Truman. A life, without any real emotions. But the movie shows that a life without any emotions, including sadness, fear or pain, could never exist.But nevertheless, sometimes I was wondering, how realistic und plausible it seems. You begin to ask yourself what if this all happens to you!?I think this movie is open to many interpretations, which is what makes it so interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Picture 1998","review":"Go Truman. The best film of 1998 is, (surprisingly) a Jim Carrey drama!!! Carrey gives an unflinching performance as Truman, the unwitting celebrity who was once an unwanted child. On the outside, Seahaven Island is a normal town. But take a closer look, and you'll see Hollywood working its magic to exploit a human life. You pick up something new every time. Carrey for Best Actor, Truman for Best Picture, and Weir and Niccol for Director and Screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie of the year","review":"The most hyped yet totally worthless thing I have ever seen. Who are these people in the movie? Who are the people that made this movie? I laughed and than cried that we have come to accept totally stupid as meaningful.

Several times he turns to the camera as he usally does in his other films when he's about to say something funny, but instead, with perplexing insanity,and much to my horror, he doesn't say a word. This may give some insight to the mind of Jim Carrey (weird/strange). After watching this movie, I felt I needed Prozac."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE PILE OF HORSE MANURE","review":"THIS IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN, MABEYE THE WORST FILM OF ALL TIME.

The media does hound people to death, and it ain't an ingredient for fun, folks. The callousness of the Truman Show's \\"cast\\" is appalling - (...) - and Truman's \\"something isn't right here\\" is endlessly dragged out. The ending is especially unsatisfying - what does Truman do next, do these jerks get away with what they did, does he have a \\"normal\\" life after this, are all left unanswered. Waaay to long as well. At least twenty minutes of this flick could and should have been left on the cutting room floor. Instead of feeling entertained when it's over, the viewer feels like one of the voyeurs who exploited Truman.

I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is thought-provoking or philosophical, because it goes way beyond Orwell's 1984 to the point of absurdity. I would say that the serious side is more like a mystery or a thriller - you sense that something is very wrong, but you don't know quite what until later. But in a way this movie did presage the growing lack of privacy and even the television phenom of \\"reality\\" shows. I really liked the concept of the artificial city in this film. If we could build such cities on the moon they would be the ultimate vacation destination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it, now hate it","review":"At first I really liked this video, however, after I introduced myself to Kathy Smith's Kickboxing workout tape, Denise Austin fell to the waste side. During the beginning of the video she shows the audience how to do the boxing and kicking moves correctly, but during the exercise portion of the video, she and the other participants continuosly do the moves incorrectly. Second, the people in the video are dancers, so throughout the video they are doing the moves in a manner in which a dancer would do them, not in the manner in which an exerciser or person schooled in cardio kickboxing would do them. Third, the people in the video are uncoordinated, there are too many mistakes, and Denise doesn't do even numbers of the same move on each side of the body. Sometimes she forgets the other side all together. I grew to hate this video. If you want a good, intense, and safe kickboxing video, try Kathy Smith's Kickboxing video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Results!","review":"Maybe I just have really high tolerance of supposed annoying people, but I LOVE Denise Austin. Her chants such as \\"You can do it!\\" and \\"Its worth it!\\" are fun to listen to and create a positive enviroment. This tape, although its hard and makes my calfs burn, is the one that gets me results fast! Within two sessions, I notice a difference. Ive tried the gym, Ive tried dancing at home, Ive tried running and somehow I always resort back to this tape. This one and her Fat Blasting Yoga DVD are incredible. Her cueing isnt the best, but its easy to catch on. I love Denise Austin, she's the only fitness instructor that I like listening to and watching. And Ive got great abs thanks to her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use with Caution","review":"I was never a Denise Austin fan, but I decided to give this video a try because I grew bored with Tae-Bo. Unfortunately, Denise's cuing is very poor and she changes moves on you without warning. I also question how correctly she is doing some of the moves, especially the kicks. I also found her chatter downright annoying. She talks to you like you are a three year-old who just ate all of his veggies. Please! Will some one please tell this woman that we are adults and she is no longer a high school cheerleader. All in all, I would recommend trying Kathy Smith or Tae Bo, and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin","review":"Video arrived in good condition. Happy with purchase!!

There are much better products out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on this one.","review":"I have most of Denise's tapes and was really disappointed by this one. Kickboxing is definately not something she does well. Her techniques are poor and the routines are too. She should stick to what she knows (aerobics) and not try to \\"jump on board\\" a trend. I do have about 20 of Billy Blanks workouts, and love them. If you want a good Denise Austin tape, stick to her \\"hit the spot\\" and \\"gold\\" series. Their definately the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"busy mom of three boys","review":"I love this workout! I am a very busy mom and hardly have time to shower let alone workout. The moves are simple enough to master and effective in getting the heart rate up. I am also a rare case, in that, I find Denise's \\"cheerleading\\" throughout the workout to be inspiring and just the boost I need to keep going when I feel like quitting.I gave the workout four stars because it does seem that the choreography is off at times. I would still highly recommend this workout especially if you need something effective in a short amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Denise Austin star on Saturday Night Live (SNL) or what?","review":"Denise Austin's constant babble, babble, and more babble (i.e., burn that butter! Yeah! Yeah!) and SNL mannerism are similar to a kickboxing parody on a late night show. I did not know when to workout or just sit and laugh. I eventually decided to donate this to my local library because I couldn't concentrate even in the slightest. Also, the fitness crew in the video are a bit annoying to watch. There are too many people in a small area and their performance and effort are disappointing (making them look participatory in this \\"parody\\"). The title could be changed to \\"Denise Austin's Power Jumping Jacks\\" because of the excessive usage of jumping jacks over kicks. I actually went to the market to buy Kathy Smith's Kickboxing tape but it sold out and in desparation I decided to buy this. Pass on this tape and save your money, unless you would like to watch a kickboxing parady then this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"The box says you don't need to have kickboxing experience but what it doesn't say is that it's very difficult unless you are in perfect shape! I have been working out since January and have lost 43 lbs. I love to exercise but I could not keep up! I wish I knew it was that intense. I guess I'll save it for next year - maybe I can do it then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kickin' video, so to speak","review":"You are either a Denise Austin fan or not. She definitely has a special loud raspy voice and certain phrases she likes to use. I have another of her videos, the SIZZLER that I love. It inspired me to buy another of her videos. This one! It is fun, energizing, easy to learn and gives results even after the first session (aching arm and thigh muscles)! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH ENERGY KICK- BUTT KICKBOXING!","review":"Very good tape... MUCH better that Tae Bo! I have a friend who is a beginner to exercise & almost threw out her back doing Tae Bo, but can get through the 1st segment on this tape. Great for beginners and intermediate/advance (2nd segment) who are looking for a tape that is challenging!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic, not Smooth","review":"This tape provides two 20-minute workouts. The first concentrates on the basics and moves, but is a good workout. The second is high-intensity. You will get up a good sweat from them.But... Denise does a lousy job of telling you what move to do next. It takes several workouts before you have ANY idea of what's coming before it comes, so it's easy to miss the first rep. Even after doing the tape a bunch, some bits will still be called too late, resulting in being a bit off.The other \\"downside\\" is that this isn't really kickboxing. It's aerobics with kicking and punching, but kickboxing safety/fundamentals (such as overextension) aren't covered.On the other hand, I do this workout quite a bit because it's a better workout than a real kickboxing workout would be, it's intense, and it's fast. No time for boredom. So if you're willing to learn the order of the moves and occaisionally stutter-step to catch up, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGGG","review":"I like exercise videos and am in generally good shape...I didn't like this video at all. Denise Austin moves too fast and assumes that everyone can keep up. It will give you a workout if you don't throw your back out in the process.

The female lead character comes out with cutsy remarks that don't fit the mood or action. She is actively annoying.Also, this book is not really a Star Trek novel. Kirk and company only occupy a few pages near the end of the book.This is a poor story, poorly executed. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Effort","review":"As a big Trek fan, I was intrigued with the title and premise of this book.Unfortunately, the author spends so much time trying to be cute by weaving other Trek characters and historical events into the book that he forgets to write a really good story.A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"um... no.","review":"These Khan books are just plain bad. Full of cute trekkie references, they are for die-hard trekkies only. And I'm a huge Khan fan, so I was pretty let down. Really, this is not how I imagined the Eugenics wars at all. Did I mention the writing is atrocious? Some of the worst I've come across. Maybe that's because these were the first Trek novels I've read, so I didn't know to lower my expectations...Do yourself a favor and skip this junk. Get some real sci-fi instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trek Writing Meets Great Spy Novel Writing","review":"I love trek, but I am also a great fan of good spy stories as well. when I ordered this book it was because I really enjoyed the Greg Cox Q Trilogy. I had no idea it would involve the Gary Seven character from the original series. Well done. I enjoyed this book very much and have already ordered the second. It reads like a good spy novel and would be well suited for someone that is into that type of story. You don't even need to be a star trek fan to enjoy this book. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a vehicle","review":"This book is little more than a vehicle for Greg Cox to demonstrate his knowledge of political and cultural history of the late 20th century, as well as his knowledge of the Star Trek universe. Khan and Gary Seven (with faithful sidekicks Roberta and Isis) tromp through world history a la Forrest Gump except with an agenda. Allegedly, their agenda is the same, to help humanity survive into the 21st century, although Khan already shows signs of being the anti-hero we know from episode and movie. How he goes from being so idealistic, if ruthless, being exiled on the Botany Bay is a question left to Volume II, which I may find the patience to read one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read !","review":"I must say I really enjoyed reading Greg Cox's book The Eugenics Wars. It follows the story from a classic Star Trek episode Assingment:Earth. If you can, try to watch that episode before reading this book, though it's not necessary. I thought Teri Garr as Roberta, playing Gary Sevens secretary/spy was hilarious. The book continues to build on these roles including Isis the sultry feline. Sure, parts of the book are a bit campy, but so was the original series. Thats part of what made the series great and this book a really good fun read.I look forward to the next book in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"...where credit's due","review":"The book contains the usual Paramount boilerplate, \\"Based on Star Trek created by Gene Roddenberry\\" (and all the spin-off series), and thanks Teri Garr among others, but the author has not seen fit to acknowledge, even in the slightest, writers Carey Wilber and Gene Coon, who created Khan Noonien Singh for the \\"Space Seed\\" episode of Star Trek.Without them this book would not exist. For shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"BULL.... COMPLETE * DECEPTIVE * BULL!!!!","review":"When I saw the title, I was excited. I had seen the TOS \\"Space Seed\\" episode and ST II:Wrath of Khan... so I thought... \\"hey, that would be a cool buy!\\"It's not!This book is not about Khan... but about some laughable character: Gary Seven. I REPEAT!!!... 90+% of this book is ***NOT*** about Khan!!!Bull!IF I would have wanted to read about Gary 7 (laughable, just plain laughable!!!), I would have bought a book about him... but I did not want to know about this j@ck-off! I wanted to read about Khan!... ooops... wrong book, I guess!As a book summary:Page 1-300+ No mention of Khan (0%)Page 300-400 Very Little Khan (10-20%)Page 400+ Some Khan (but VERY campy!)Bull... pure, deceptive bull!TRASH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boarderline believeable","review":"A blend of historic fact, Star Trek history, and imagination create an engrossing and fairly believable storyline. Popular mysteries and noteworthy events of the 70's carry the timeline progression throughout the book as Khan develops through the innocence of youth to the crusader of young adulthood. The door is left wide open for the second installment of this saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhhh","review":"Meshuggah's name and Bury Your Dead shouldn't even be in the same sentence together.

They knew what they were doing with this album, making it heavy, hard and the pace unwavering. They weren't trying to explore new concepts, or trying to create a masterpiece album. If you've ever seen them live, you know immediately that the material on this album alone creates a breath taking live show.

But unlike bands that can pull that off the right way, Bury your Dead comes up short. This is what happens when Frat-core meshes with Fashion-core: a closet-homosexual straight-edge fashion-show.Try to imagine a quintet of Earth Crisis hacks with unimaginative monotone burp-growls and sloppy chud-chud guitar patterns. It's hard to imagine that the drummer was once in a band as good as Between the Buried and Me. Why he would want to jump ships to this project? (It's beyond me.)Also, there is something ambiguously homosexual about the content of this album as well.... Maybe it's all the Tom Cruise movie/song titles.Finally, any band that has anything to do with the egging of the greatest band of all time, Iron Maiden, are total clownshoes.

There has to be some decent bands in this genre that really stand out if you look hard enough, it's just obviously not going to be on MTV2.At best these guys are going to be remembered for disrespecting one of the most influential bands in metal.

I thoroughly enjoy planning my vacation and activities well in advance of the actual trip, but was very much unable to do so with this book.My impression of the book is that it has been slow to be updated, with the 04 version containing little beyond 2000. At the same time it seems to focus on travelers planning to tour Costa Rica staying at a different hotel/lodge/resort/camp each night.

The main character (the guy on the cover) seemed to disappear whenever the real dancing happened which I thought was funny but the dance numbers were off the chain! The dancer that did the robot in the first part of the film was phenomanal. I've never seen someone move just like a robot like that! They also did a dance in water which was just like the second movie but it was a great dance sequence anyway. The final dance number was also outstanding with the lighted suits they were wearing.

Detective lieutenant James Keegan doesn't believe in psychics. So when the chief ordered him to work with India Cook, all he saw was a pretty convincing \\"act\\" by a con artist (that is, a real sexy con artist). India sees her psychic abilities as a curse. Because of them, she sees/feels more than there is to any casual touch. Since she can't seem to control it, she is denied the human contact she so craves. Sparks fly when she meets a very determined Jamie who can't seem to keep his hands off.

Chabrol has always had a tendency towards caricature, and the laughable passionate embraces between Michel Piccoli and Stephane Audran (neither at their best) or the half-dimensional corrupt mayor are indicative of the clumsiness of the whole sorry enterprise, as is the lumbering flashback setting up the murders. Things briefly threaten to get interesting after the second murder, but by then the film is nearly over and the promise remains unfulfilled.Arrow's UK PAL DVD has an acceptable but far from outstanding transfer with optional English subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"WoW this game is horrible.

The scrolling doesn't work correctly and you'll occasionally get stuck on one side of the scene for no apparent reason.

Multi-player is split screen and just awful. The graphics on the game are bad as well...looking like they came straight from a 5-year old's coloring book.I didn't even make it through the first level before I got tired of playing the game.Chicken Shoot has potential for entertaining small children, but for anyone else, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Wii games out there.","review":"This game is like a flash game you find in the web for free pasted on a Wii game with horrible controls and with a $30-40 price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are looking for a game (Wii) for a non-gamer this is it.","review":"I bought this game for my girlfriend who incidentally thinks that MSN Games are the greatest thing to hit the internet besides MySpace.

They didn't seem to mind that it doesn't take forever to complete all the levels. If you have young boys who want the thrill of shooting but you are opposed to overly realistic, bloody RPGs like I am, this is good fun. It is somewhat repetative as mentioned by others, but the graphics are Looney Tunes cute and change with each level.

His accent is so enhanced with his Scottish brogue that one never believes Sean's son is anything but Scottish. This movie is supposedly based on a true incident which occurred in Arizona in 1997. But it's really a dull scifi wanna be, with minimal tension or suspense. A group of five friends encounter alien beings when they wreck their van, and one of their members is seriously injured by falling on a knife. Connery plays a man whose truck broke down and he lends a hand. It's all foolishly contrived and the performances (AJ Cook, George Stults, Ashley Peldon, Geraldine Yeo) pretty ineffectual.

In a display of ignorant cost cutting, Carb counts for grains such as rice are given per cup of RAW not cooked product - same for macaroni whereas the 4th edition gives raw and cooked values. This alone makes it not worth the money but scattered throughout are foods that were there for 4th edition but are now gone.The publisher probably saved money by eliminating pages but I can no longer recommend this book to friends; I advise them to not buy it but get a copy of the 4th edition instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for patrons of fast foods, frozen & canned foods","review":"I was so disappointed with the contents of the food composition section of this book that I sent it back for a refund.

Sort of useful, but more often a near disaster.I was very glad to read the review about the ill fitting lid, perhaps that's my problem too. If I add several extra cups of water more than the recipe calls for then I usually come out OK, but even then sometimes I've come home to black-gooey-I'm-not-sure-what. I wish there was a crockpot fairy out there to give me advice on this one.I would recommend you look at other crockpots before purchasing this one. The feature I do like is that you can remove the crock for washing and refrigeration.I wish I could rate this with more stars, I had high hopes for my crockpot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I have read the first five of the Inspector Lynley series and loved them, but this one was huge disappointment. I found the book very tedious and just couldn't get through it. The plot is overly involved (and somewhat bizarre) and constantly moves back and forth between characters and sub-stories that makes it very difficult to stay engaged. Very unlike the rest of the Inspector Lynley series. The relationship between Helen and Lynley also really began to get on my nerves in this book. Elizabeth George seems intent on dragging out Helen's acceptance of Lynley's proposal and in this book it became truly annoying. Helen was a minor character I quite liked in previous books but in this one she came across as a dazed and empty woman in need of a tight slap. Even worse were the conversations between her and Lynley - use of allusion and metaphors taken to another level altogether. All in all, I'd skip this and hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"I have read all of the authors books in order and this book is not like the first books. It is very difficult to read. It is not a \\"page turner\\". Do not bother to purchase this book it is not worth the price. Skip the book in the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing for Ashes","review":"I usually enjoy Elizabeth George and read her when I want to relax. Maybe I didn't particularly enjoy this book as some of the descriptions just took too long and it was such a depressing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous writing","review":"Elizabeth George is the poetess of detective writers!! This book takes a differenet turn than the previous ones though. Whereas the others are almost puritanical in their expression (A Great Deliverance had only two curse words tha I remember) this one explores a seamy side withstunning effect.E George is the absolute master of integratingdisparate, seemingly unrelated events into a single coherent story while developing the most realistic characters in fiction. The clues arealways present, the motives once again aredeep, psychological, and the conclusion the startling yet perfectly logical wrapup we've cometo expect. This is a dark, brooding tour de force"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, complex, believable","review":"As with all of her books, George not only exhibits her mastery of the mystery genre, she also shows her keen understanding of the human heart, of family dynamics across the social classes, of the power of jealousy and revenge. She also continues to build the relationships between her recurring characters by weaving them into the story in a way that will not confuse readers who haven't read her books before, which is a feat until itself. A great, sad, brilliant, satisfying story, well written and well crafted"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Skip this one if you are an Elizabeth George fan. There is not one sympathetic character in the lot, save Lynley and Havers and Lynley doesn't come off that good. Olivia is despicable and goes on and on for pages that should have disappeared under the editor's red pen. I suppose no one dares edit George now that she is such a huge success. Pity. The rest of the characters are totally without redemption, especially Jimmy, who may have the filthiest mouth yet. A little British slang goes a long way. Every other word about procreation is just too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Elizabeth George mystery.","review":"I love this author's mysteries. This is the first one I read, which made me go to the store and buy all her other books. I find this was the best one. The plotting is flawless and the characters are completely intriguing. I found that in this book she had many levels to the story, many nuances - and that was not necessarily so in her other mysteries (not to say the others aren't excellent). It's just that even after reading all her other works, this one stands out in my mind as the very best & I remember the plot more clearly than her others. By the way Barbara Havers is one of my all-time female characters. I find her to be extremely likeable and realistic. Go Barbara - go Ms. George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a talent!","review":"This is the third George book I have read and I can certainly say that I did not come away disappointed. There are two story lines which, while related slightly, are played out at the same time and that always gets a little confusing to me. And she throws in some \\"in your face\\" smut, not that it's not realistic--it's just a little more than I care for, and also continues the development of Barbara Havers character in a kind of mini story of it's own. I found it a little slow in places and while I don't think it is necessarily better than her other books I've read (\\"Missing Joseph\\", \\"Well Schooled in Murder\\"), her remarkable talent is establishing her as one of the premier mystery writers of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the Best Thus Far?","review":"Having read the previous Lynley/Havers mysteries by Elizabeth George, I have come to expect nothing but the best from her and this book did not disappoint. I am always amazed at Ms. George's ability to weave multiple storylines into a coherent, fascinating, enjoyable story. Another thing that occurred to me while reading this book is that all of George's characters have some redeeming quality(ies), even the murderer, because she understands that nothing and no one is simply good or bad, but rather varying shades of grey. And so it is in this compelling mystery involving a mother/daughter separated for years, a husband/wife also separated and a mother dealing with a verbally abusive teenage son. For each of the characters, you feel empathy, sympathy, dislike (at times bordering on loathing), love, and compassion. I have already bought the remaining books in this series and am now trying to figure a way to stop myself from reading them too quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could barely finish it.....","review":"Elizabeth George has outdone herself in creating totally unlikeable characters and a side story that makes you sick to read about it, that was skipped over by me in the process of trying to get to the end of this monstrosity of a story. The only reason I finished this book was because I had decided to read the entire Inspector Lynley series in the order published. Otherwise, I would have deep-sixed this book when Olivia started telling her story. This book is on the same sub-par as George's \\"What Came Before He Shot Her.\\" I usually love reading Elizabeth George's mysteries, but this tale was too much to handle and I do NOT recommend it to anyone who has any sensitivities to mistreatment of animals or dislike for subhuman behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to this author's usual standards","review":"I love Elizabeth George's Lynley / Havers series, but this particular novel has been a huge disappointment. The characters are so unappealing that you don't care wha happens to them at the end. The plot - or rather, a weird jumble of unconnected bits and pieces that pass for a plot - is very boring. A large chunk of the novel is narrated by a character who is so pompous that it is painful to read her endless musings about nothing.The good news, though, is that this is probably the weakest book in the series. So pick up any other novel by George and you will be in for a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a good read","review":"George reprises her strong characterization and plot lines in this book. The ending is particularly satisfying, suspenseful, and believable. I especially enjoyed the continuing developments between Havers and Lynley. The one drawback: the chapters alternate between narrative and a first-person viewpoint from a major character. It's harder to follow than some of George's previous work, but worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I gather from reading other reviews that Playing For the Ashes is typical of Elizabeth George's work, i.e. it features lengthy (and I mean really lengthy) digressions involving characters who may or may not end up being important in the end. George appears to have an excellent ear for British English. She does what she does very well, but if you prefer a fairly straightforward police procedural, you probably won't enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plot, fascinating characters","review":"This book was a bit of a departure, style-wise, and I liked they way Olivia's story was developed separately from the rest of the story line then woven in. I was a little disappointed not to see Simon and Deborah in this book, and I didn't see the deeply layered themes that I normally find in George's books. That was particularly surprising given the promise of the fire imagery. But this is still an extremely worthwhile read with some interesting plot twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - over long","review":"I read the first 300 pages then gave up completely frustrated at the amount of time I had wasted. I skipped to the last few chapters to find out \\"who dunit\\" and even found the ending frustrating. The author has taken character development to the extreme, or even beyond. I was half expecting to come across a chapter about how Lynley cuts his toe nails, and how Havers reads some sort of class difference into this act. In summary don't waste your time reading this book. I have read other books by the same author and have always felt somewhat unsatisfied at the end, but this is by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another tape!","review":"This video moves too quickly and it is almost impossible to follow some movements. If it was done with more instruction, the video would be much better. The video moves from one exercise to another without clear instruction. This is one of the worst exercise tapes I have seen. I would return it if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I work out religiously, and was in the need for a change from my normal routine. I thought this tape might be the answer to my boredom. Well, I guess I wasn't familiar with Pilates. A workout it is not. They do stretches mostly. I barely got through the ab section before I just rewound the tape. If you have a bad back, or are not a pretzel this tape is definately not for you. They do rolls, where you grab your legs tight into your chest and roll all the way down then all the way back up. Not exactly \\"spine friendly\\" exercise. Sorry, I'd like to keep my vertabre intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"The drums gotta' go......","review":"I found the drums to be most annoying. I just purchased it and wished there was a way of muting the drums. Impossible to mute though as you really need to pay close attention to her quick instruction of moves and her transition from one move to another was too fast and left me with little time to do all the reps or doing them the wrong way.I was disappointed as I thought the whole workout would have been solely pilates but she incorporates ballet, aerobics, etc. which I'm not interested in. When I purchase a Pilate workout, I want a Pilate workout.I absolutely love Denise Austin's Pilates Mat Workout Tape. Her soothing voice and instruction are exactly what I'm looking for. Not someone \\"barking\\" out instruction with the beating of annoying drums in the background.I will take this workout on as a challenge but only because I hate to waste the money I spent on it unless I can sell it to someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast","review":"The drums in the background are too fast for one and she moves from one move to another without really telling you that she's switching. Plus, she goes into the routine and doesn't tell you which way to turn or move, and the routines are pretty long too. It is not for beginners and the cameras shift the focus from jennifer to the background people too much. It's really hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Pilates DVD - and not the full 60 minutes!","review":"I work out a lot, and have a lot of at home DVD's, and I don't think this one is as good of a work out. It's also not a full 60 minutes as it claims - they spend a few minutes for each 15 minute segment doing breathing or stretches, and even with that it's only 55 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, AT ALL","review":"I ABSOLUTELY hated this video. Jennifer flies through the video never concentrating on poise and position, which is MOST important when doing yoga and pilates. The tape is more concerned with \\"looking the part\\" of a yoga tape than giving you a strong base knowledge to take away from it. I would never work out to this tape again. There are a lot of pilates tapes on the market, I would suggest buying any other one but this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kries is into herself, not the workout","review":"I found this entire program annoying. Jennifer Kries is more interested in showing off her range of motion than she is in instructing.Thankfully I was able to resell this on eBay and instead I purchased \\"Pilates for Weight Loss\\" by Gaiam. I'm much happier with this program, which offers a partially- and fully-modified workout in addition to the advanced workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one of the good ones","review":"This is my favorite work-out DVD. I started this when I was a beginner and now still enjoy slipping in the short work-outs or even doing the whole DVD for a long work-out. Its a great introduction to pilates, ballet fitness, training w/light weights, and some yoga. Jennifer Kries is one of the few intructors I don't think is a total cheese ball and she often reminds you of proper position, breathing, etc.The only draw back (yet I still give it 5 stars) is that the work-outs are pretty fast paced and she doesn't have time to really go into the importance of alignment and balance - I would suggest that beginners get a book to go along with it or take a class. I took a pilates class shortly after beginning using the DVD and found that the few sessions with an instructor really enhanced the work I did at home.All in all - a great DVD for your collection. Definitely a must for those interested in this type of exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent video","review":"Time goes by quickly while doing this video for someone who dislikes working out as I do. I find the moves challenging, inspiring, and I feel very refreshed after the workout. I recommend this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video for firming","review":"I recently bought this video and the first time I did it I was feeling sore muscles that I never knew I had. It is working great for firming up and becoming more flexible. Sometimes I bring my VCR to work with me when my boss is out of the office and I can do a 15 minute segment or the whole tape if I have time. Target Stores sells this for 6.99"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners and simply awful drum music","review":"I was disappointed with this video. There is no emphasis on form or Pilates' philosophy. The women in the video are super flexible and are able to contort their bodies in ways that would be impossible for 99.99% of the population. It is fascinating to see, but difficult to follow, since they don't show you what the movements would look like when done by someone with normal flexibility. I would imagine that trying to copy these women (ie, laying your shin flat across your chest) could lead to injury. Also, the music, which consisted of 4 drum beats repeated over and over and over, was like an excruciating torture. Whatever were they thinking of?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense yet Low Imapct on the Body","review":"I exercise about 5 days a week. When I did this slow Pilates DVD, I thought nothing of it, but the next day I was sore and that is a good thing. That means that it works. My abs and arms were sore, and I could tell this was going to become one of my favorite Pilates DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Beginners","review":"I bought this DVD to add some variety to my everyday workouts.If you are short on time the 15 minute workout segments are perfect.The excerises are easy to follow and after a few times you will begin to memorize the positions in their order. Jennifer Kries does 2 to 4 reps not sets of each position, emphasizing on quality not quantity. Doing 4 positions correctly is much more effective than doing 12 and losing your form once you begin to fatigue midway through.I gave this video a 4 star rating because the first 2 15 minute workouts are really for beginners and the last 2 are for intermediate to advanced. The last 2 workouts have positions that are harder and require more strength and flexibility.Other than that this is a good workout video."},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense, excellent for people with busy schedules","review":"The four different 15 minute workouts on this tape are great. They develop flexibility and strength in the usual \\"problem\\" areas and are fun to do. One 15 minute segment is the perfect start for the day and you can alternate them--with four you can't get bored too fast.Jennifer is a good instructor, not cheesy and grinning all the time. I enjoyed the background drums music--they help me concentrate and follow the pace of the exercise.My only somewhat negative comment is that sometimes you feel rushed to get to the next exercise. Of course, that is the trade off of fitting a workout in 15 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to this video time and time again","review":"I absoutly love this dvd. I recieved it as a gift from my mother, after the birth of my first child. I did this DVD in part or whole 3 times a week combined with walking. I lost all 60 pounds of baby weight. I absolutly love this DVD and have noticed changes in my body since I started using it for workouts. That was 3 years ago. Now I teach pilates and often refer back to this DVD for moves to introduce to my class. I have also lent out this DVD for a number of friends to try before they purchase their own. My friends alway rave about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not for beginners","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this is not for beginners. But, if you've already done Precision Pilates Toning, Sculpting or any of the other Precision Mix videos, this is an excellent workout because it's fast paced. I know that during the workout my heart rate goes up & the fast pace keeps me alert. Also, even if this is a fast workout Jennifer's instructions are detailed. Do this tape 3 times a week, you'll get used to the routines & for sure you'll get results! If you want a slower pace & you have a lot of time, try Target Zone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"This video was definitely different for me, since this is my first pilates workout, but I was not really impressed with this tape. First, during the crucial exercises when it would be helpful to see what the instructor is doing, the camera is never panned out enough to see what she is doing. Second, although I realize this is meant to be a short workout, the instructor does not spend enough time on proper technique, and I am often unsure as to whether I am performing the exercise properly. It is also intimidating to see 15 girls stretching their legs above their heads,when I can barely lift mine off the ground, with no encouragement from the instructor.Bottom line: this would probably be a good workout for people who are familiar with pilates, but I would not recommend it to beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Targeted Workout","review":"I bought this a few years ago and had misplaced it and had to get another copy. I love the balanced approach that pulls from ballet, yoga and pilates to give you a good workout. I like her attention to form in each of the exercises and I personally have not found a better workout for my arms. I find that this goes quickly and I also like that she does stretching at the end of each section before moving on. The four sections make it easy to pick and choose your workout, and I usually find myself doing two one day and two the next. It is a very challenging workout, especially the ab section, but you can go your own pace and just do what you can. When I did this before, I really found results after doing this for a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"41yr old restarter","review":"This is perfect for me. I am 41 years old and was a serious dancer into my 20s. With only a few classes of this and that since and the last few years spent raising my little one. This dvd was just right for me. The 15 min sections are easy to fit into my tight schedule and are as hard or as easy as I make them. I am looking forward to the beach this year knowing Jennifer has helped me shape up, and maybe I'll have the confidence to join a class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Dancers","review":"A lot of her stuff is repetative. 2nd, She takes at least 2 -3 minutes of the beginning of all 15 min with breathing and explanation. 3rd, the HIPS and THIGHS works outs are almost exaclty the same.And also the excercises in these 2 are almost ALL Ballet.A lot of ballet.This video is from 2001 too. I'd try something more up to date.I didnt feel the abs work out did much, i felt like i was doing an 80's jazzercise class. The only good thing is the ARMS routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not beginner level","review":"I bought this dvd after deciding to try something new, I had been doing the crunch pick your spot pilates workout and after buying this one, was completely lost. I found myself trying to catch up and missing excersizes. This dvd assumes you are already flexible and can keep up with the poistions at an extremely fast pace. i only suggest this for advanced workout students."},{"rating":"1","title":"good moves but not enough workout","review":"The instructor does a good job of showing how the moves are done, but as far as a true work out is concerned, it doesn't do the the job. This is great for BEGINNERS but after 2 weeks you will need something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite pilates tape","review":"This is one of my favorite workouts. It's a lot faster paced than a lot of pilates videos--so, if you are familiar with the positions, you won't be spending half your time lying on your back waiting for things to be explained in detail.

Tillie the \\"peasant girl\\" minces around in a Shirley Temple-style party dress and mary janes, looking like an also-ran from one of those tot beauty pageants. Herman the dragon's voice, appearance, and personality are so irksome that you will root for him to get skewered through the heart -- but of course, you'll have no such luck.The best thing I can say about Tillie's Dragon is that it really makes you appreciate the accomplishment of a beautifully animated film like The Iron Giant or most of the Disneys.

This incredibly detailed book revisits many of the key moments in Sun's history, leading up to the recent excitement over the Java programming language. The author shows how Scott McNealy's unique personal style played an instrumental part in Sun's direction. Despite McNealy's prominence in the book, this is really a saga about Sun Microsystems and the technology economy. While she makes some effort to provide McNealy's biography, the author is clearly more interested in the strategic corporate moves Sun made to position itself for the future. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book as essential reading for anyone in the early stages of a technology start-up, and fascinating reading for anyone even slightly interested in business."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"For an editor of Upside and Forbes, the writing in this book is surpisingly amateurish and predictable.

It provides a good, albeit Pollyanna-ish introduction to Sun's history and to McNealy...up until 1999. Did I learn anything? Yes, for example, I hadn't known that Gosling architected NeWS. But the level of this book isn't that much deeper than a Reader's Digest article.If you don't know much about Sun's pre-2000 past and want a quick survey, \\"High Noon\\" may help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chronological review of Sun and Scott McNealy.","review":"You could feel the fast pace of Sun in Southwick's writing.

If this is the first Jimmy Dawkins album your looking to buy do yourself a favor and buy Fast Fingers first (it's a better album and cheaper). If your looking for your next step after Fast Fingers pick up this album because even though it was not the next one Dawkins recorded it is the next one where his presence is strongly felt (this is due to the fact that he only sings on a few of the songs on his 2nd album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!!

Someone who appreciates the way things 'use to be'. Mr Astaire executes with effortless elegance, grace and 100% charm.A Youthful Leslie Caron almost flawlessly mirrors Mr. Astaire's natural effortlessness and makes you wish that you had enough talent to look so relaxed partnering a legendary entertainer.If you enjoy the innocent/natural charisma of a bygone era with its genteel elegance....you cannot go past this classic!On the downside [purely personal taste] I think that Miss Caron's 'fade to dream dance sequences' are too long and too numerous to hold my attention and don't add enough 'value' to the overall storyline.Ultimately, Uncle Jervis is everyone woman's dream man [fully loaded, without the traditional 'drop dead/georgeous' skin deep covering...but what he lacks in 'looks' is outweighed by his endless charm, charisma and downright Godgiven talent!

It's really more of a showcase for Leslie Caron, who was sort of a French Annette Funicello -- although she's likeable enough, her personality and talents seem singularly underwhelming, especially when you've got Astaire waiting in the wings, twiddling his thumbs. The film starts out great, with a scene of Fred banging away on the drums, keeping time to a jazz record and talking hep lingo... But it loses oompf midway through, and Astaire recedes into the background for far too long. It's an okay movie, but there are many, many better films to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astaire tried to do the best he could with this script","review":"It's just that the script was really flimsy to begin with. A college-bound orphan, even one from Paris, would be a little more street-wise. Instead, we get an overgrown child who spends an inordinate time writing to her benefactor. She is angry that she has not heard from him during much of her college enrollment.Frankly, I don't find that a plausible development at all.Instead of getting involved on campus, or seriously attending to her studies to make attending college academically worthwhile--she's pouting. Really, she should be grateful that she's even getting to attend college and won't have to worry about how it's being paid for.This film made me feel sorry for Fred Astaire--who obviously has awesome dance moves.I can't believe an agent actually encouraged him to take this part. Sure it was a showcase for his dancing, but some of the lines which he had to utter besides were pure camp. The guy deserved better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FOX HITS SOME RATHER WEAK NOTES","review":"In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda, The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going.

The book is a grab bag of mysticism, backing up its claims with astrology, poorly-sourced history and homilies, while any mention of characters in film of TV boils down to \\"Character X represents Chakra Y.\\" -- none of which provides any actual insight into crafting compelling characters, and works counter to understanding character by obscuring simple ideas through this mystical mumbo-jumbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent system for creating characters.

So, I have no clue what to expect... and I end up loving it! GO SEE THIS PLAY! I cried at the ending when they sang \\"Self Portrait\\".

Basically - the singers are awesome, the songs are clever, and the show is touching. The lyrics speak out to you and grab hold of you. The music is innovative and twists and turns in unexpected ways.

The songs on this CD sound dull, generic and dated; I find myself asking, \\"What was it we all heard back then, and why isn't it there anymore??\\" There's no answer to that; art is elusive and is effects can be fleeting.

The mouse is a comfortable shape, and tracks well on any surface I've tried. Bluetooth works smoothly and easily. Battery life is decent (about 3 weeks of daily use.)Cons: it's incredibly fragile. After only a month of use, the scroll ball can go in any direction but down, and there's no apparent way to clean it out. The right-click button is very fussy; about two times out of three when I try to right click it actually left-clicks instead. And the side squeeze buttons require too much force to use. You can understand why they did that: if they hadn't, the side buttons would trigger every time you picked up the mouse -- but as it is they're kind of useless: Too hard to use on purpose, too easy to use by accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right click is tricky","review":"After two weeks of use, I returned the mouse because 3 out of 4 times I tried to make a right click, it would not work. I eventually got frustrated and decided to return it.I'm sure it has to do with the way I use the mouse but I'm not planning on changing my angle or whatever it is that makes it fail. I think a regular 2 button mouse is just perfect.I wish this mouse had a real mechanical right button because it would be perfect.I LOVED the scroll wheel and will miss it greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse with caveats","review":"Well there are lots of things to like about this mouse. Easy bluetooth connectivity, great looks. The negatives are that it is not that comfortable for large hands and the software is minimal. Try using some software called \\"Steer mouse\\" for much greater control over every aspect of the mighty mouse. Hopefully Apple is listening and will improve the software so you don't have to buy third party software to get the best use. The side bttons are poorly placed and hard to operate although not as bad as some people say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scamed a kid jerks","review":"When my mouse came i was so happy.

I loved it at first, but now have scroll ball that only works in the up direction. Back to logitech for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst thing Apple ever did","review":"This is by far the worst mouse I've ever owned and it's unbelievable that Apple is still producing it. The scroll ball dies on you after a couple of months and there is no way to clean the dirt that gets accumulated inside since this mouse is sealed and impossible to open without breaking it and gluing it together afterwards (and then breaking it yet again a couple of months after that to clean the new dirt). Seriously, this is an offense to Apple consumers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I can't believe this product is still on the market. It is heavy, tracks like a car through mud and the scroll wheel problem is unbelievable. Apple should know better than to release something like this. I pretty much purchased it relying on Apple's reputation and boy did I learn my lesson. Have had macs for 20 years and never have I been this disappointed with one of their products. But like others said, I got addicted to horizontal scrolling before it got too sticky, and would no longer scroll down--went back to my Kensington wheel mouse. But truth be told, it was never very accurate when doing any kind of graphics or text insertion--always very sluggish and heavy like you were moving a can of tuna across your desk.Can't wait till we have some more choices with horizontal scrolling--sure miss it with Excel."},{"rating":"1","title":"scroll wheel is not durable, but otherwise a nice mouse","review":"I'm unfortunately on my 3rd wireless Mighty Mouse in under 2 years. The problem with the first two was the scroll wheel stopped working. Both had the same issue - it would stop scrolling in one direction, then shortly after it would stop scrolling in both directions. Luckily I did get the extended warranty with my iMac so the replacements have been free.Otherwise the mouse is really nice, and I like the double side button feature so you can pull up all open windows and choose the one you want to be active.The wireless work great, so that's another positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it. Don't use it.","review":"I'd go 1 star but for the fact that it is beautiful and the bluetooth works flawlessly.What's frustrating to me is the software, or I *guess* that's the problem. I simply have to move the darn thing too far for the movement I want on the screen and I have it adjusted to the maximum for that dimension. I would think a decent software upgrade could fix the problem and I don't know what Apple is waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse, Great Support (was: Weak Range)","review":"I bought this mouse as an upgrade from an Apple Wireless mouse (one button, LED, bluetooth).This mouse is infinitely superior in terms of functionality. Awesome tracking, \\"three\\" buttons, integrated Expose. Nice. The scroll ball is absolutely brilliant.The problem with this mouse is that the range and sensitivity to interference are terrible. It stutters when it is ten feet from the Mac. It won't really work at all if it's near any other wireless device. I used the old wireless in the exact same configuration as the Mighty, and it had none of the problems.Highly recommended if it's going to be within arms reach of your Mac and you don't use any other wireless gear in this band.UPDATE: I ended up taking it to the Apple Store, and they replaced it because they couldn't get it to pair with any Mac in the store. The replacement (the new rev with the white semi-circles on the sides) works perfectly! I'd change the rating to 5-stars if Amazon would let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scroll=Junk","review":"I have had an apple imac for nearly 5 months now, and everything has worked in perfect order, except for the mouse. i have read many other complaints by people who say that the scroll stopped working, which is exactly what happened to mine. at first it could not go down, now it can neither scroll down nor up.It sucks.Don't buy it unless you only need it for 3-4 months. make apple fix this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple Mighty Mouse","review":"This wireless mouse was a replacement for the one that came with my iMac system. The track ball on the mouse that was shipped with the system went bad in less than 2 years. I do not expect this mouse to last any longer as Apple has steadfastly refused to redesign the Mighty Mouse to make it more robust thus more reliable. As far as it goes, there is nothing wrong with the mouse that I purchased, I just don't hold much hope that will be any more reliable than the one it replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"The wireless mouse that I purchased is remarkably unreliable - one hour it works and the next it does not. A very frustrating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucky second hand mouse","review":"I am not satisfied with my order at all. The mouse that I recieved, was a little dirty and not completely functional. I should have expected worst for the product being a second hand item. The roller doesn't work well. It only goes down but rarely goes up. Even when it does move down I have a hard time with it. I would not buy from this person again. I would also not recommend getting a second hand mouse since I had this awful experience with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back to wired mouse","review":"This mouse COULD be great. But after having it for almost a year, I am so sick of changing out the batteries too often, having the scroll ball get dirty WAY too often, and occasionally it simply doesn't work when clicked even when it is still visibly mobile onscreen. The idea was great but the function doesn't measure up enough to put up with this any longer. Unless you own stock in a battery company and don't mind continuously cleaning out the scroll ball, I'd advise you to look elsewhere. What a shame, I am a diehard Mac lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely serves it's purpose.","review":"The scroll ball works very well but the tracking is a little off. That's the only con, though. It's very convenient and easy to connect. I use it with a 13\\" MacBook Pro and I can use it anywhere. It works on the laptop, my leg, the arm rest...anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Button Errors","review":"I owned this mouse for a few days. I purchased this mouse for the number of buttons, the scrollball, and the beautiful design. Occasionally triggering the squeeze function accidentally I could live with, but it would regularly misread a right click as a left click. Not once or twice, here and there, but about half the time, a right click would register as a left click.I really appreciate the design aesthetic, I really do. I like having the single plastic shell, but it hampers the functionality to such an extent that I returned it. For the premium price, I'd expect to get a device that does everything it advertises and does it well. Maybe in the next generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst mouse I've ever used","review":"Horrible mouse, the wheel/ball in particular is not precise at all. Get a decent Logitech with a real scroll wheel for a lot less money -- you'll be a lot more satisfied. This was given to me at work with a new Mac Book Pro. I gave the mouse back after a week and bought a Logitech MX mouse out of my own pocket, that's how bad this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to a real mouse","review":"I got this mouse with my new Mac. It's uncomfortable, and it seems quite a bit larger than the Logitech mouse I normally use. Right-clicking is a matter of luck with this mouse, about 25% of the time it won't recogize a right-click no matter how you position your finger.The squeeze feature is awkward, and the side buttons require quite a bit of force to activate. You won't be just clicking one with your thumb alone as might seem natural, you *must* have a finger on the other side of the mouse to counteract the pressure.The battery door on the wireless version is pretty flimsy and will pop open just about anytime you try to turn the mouse off.It's not the worst mouse in the world, but it certainly isn't a great one. Mostly it's just gimmick-y."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing product from Apple","review":"This mouse is great. The one I got was shipped without a manual, startup disk, or anything else. It was just the mouse in a shipping box. It was so easy to use I didn't even need any of those things. I put the batteries in and my powerbook found the mouse via bluetooth and I was up and running. Amazing. A must have for anyone using a laptop that gets annoyed using the trackpad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mouse is the worst thing apple has ever made","review":"Now, I've been an apple fan for several years now. I love them. When this mouse came out, I was so excited, and ran out to buy one.That was a mistake.After having it for about a week, the little scroll ball stopped scrolling down. It still scrolled up fine, and side to side, but would not scroll down, no matter how much I cleaned the ball or anything.One day, I replaced the batteries because they were almost dead. BAM! I could scroll again!I finally realized that once the battery level gets lower than about 65%, the scroll down stops working. Why? No one knows. Not even apple. Because I had the mouse for so long before I figured out what the problem was, Apple was unwilling to help me.After having this mouse for about a year and a half, I just destroyed it. It works almost as good now as before I ripped it apart! ;)Please save yourselves a lot of trouble and avoid this product!

It disconnects at least once per session. After about a month the ball started scrolling down but not up, and the claimed battery life of 3 months is a lie - try 3 weeks.

Everyone remembers the Hockeypuck mouse design on the original imac and this on is not much better. It's about as erconomic as a bar of soap, and the one piece body design makes it very easy to accidentally click when you don't want to. The pea sized scroll ball is pretty much worthless.

Not super stealth but pretty inconspicuous.-Fairly large front pouch for accessories.-Easy to get to camera.-Roomy.Cons:-Too easy to get to camera/equipment. Even when shut as tight as possible, you can easily reach in from the side and grab your camera. This was the deal breaker for me. I can just see water/dust making it's way into the main compartment.-Almost no padding on the top cover (where your LCD is facing up).-Kinda cheap build quality. OK for the price but the materials definitely seemed kinda cheap to me.-Loud velcro closure on for main compartment. A negative if you want to open this bag in a quiet area.I would not recommend this bag and am surprised that it has so many good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good looking bag at great price","review":"I was looking for a lighter weight bag for days I don't want to carry my entire backpack. I first purchased the Lowepro Nova 170AW, and while the features and size were great, I couldn't help but feel like I had an insulated lunch cooler around my shoulder. The Tamrac looks inconspicous and is a great size for comfortably carrying my big Canon 50D with lens on, a couple of additional lenses, flash, filters, etc.CONS: Wish the strap attached via swivels instead of being sewed directly to the bag as I foresee the strap twisting getting annoying (and it DOES twist). The top flap attached by one buckle is the only thing keeping the gear in the bag. This is great for easy access, but it would be nice if there was an option to zip the compartment shut for added safety. Also, I wouldn't feel overly comfortable if I was caught in the rain with this bag, as the sides of the flap are somewhat exposed.Overall, a good looking bag that will see plenty of use from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed Bag","review":"I had a Tamrac bag for many years that I loved and needed to replace. This was the closet to my old bag, but after buying it I returned it. Several reasons. First and most important, the inside is poorly designed because the top velcro strips are too high on the inside of the bag. This forces the camera to sit up too high. Second, the dividers themselves do not allow enough flexibility. In my old bag, I could keep my camera with lens sideways, whereas this bag forces you to put the camera with the lens down. Third, the material is stiffer than it needs to be. There is enough padding to allow for a little smoother material. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"It's a good item. I used it for my new D300+17-55/2.8, and it still have space for another lens(ex. 85/1.4).

Denver was already resorting to the same old show; note how the crowd yells far out and thanks grandma and you know that he used the same lines in every show.

Lee Holdridge's brilliant orchestration made this concert experience a true event.

Today, on a lark, I thought I'd check Amazon for it, and lo and behold, it's been added to this re-release. Yay.

With his early band, before he got electric and Elvis's old crew joined him, this is pure 1970s JD. The songs stand up very well live. The concert includes a lot from Back Home Again, which is not surprising as he had just had such a hit with it. What is surprising is that they come across even more vibrant than the studio album - \\"Matthew\\" is a stand out and \\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\\" just did not get better outings than this.However - there is one draw back. My two favourites on the LP when it came out were \\"Farewell Andromeda\\", here in all it's glory, and \\"Today\\" which is missing from the single CD along with one other track. I assume this is for time reasons - if you can afford a little more seek out and buy the double CD version - as that song is worth the effort !Nontheless, this is great John Denver how we all want to remember him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Model","review":"30 cannons, 12 crew, 14 sails, all incredibly detailed, requiring glue and paint, as well as an experienced eye for models.

I'm not sure why I plodded through this interminable book; probably because I was hoping for some revelatory advice that would justify my investment. No such luck. In addition to being poorly edited (I caught a few errors), the book is poorly organized and sooooo repetitive. I easily could reduce the entirety of the plodding narrative to a magazine article very suitable for O! magazine: rely on good friendships and family relationships, take a hot bath, get a manicure or massage, eat well, get enough sleep, use cognitive reasoning, set healthy boundaries, do yoga, ask for help, take deep breaths to relax...this is news?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sense","review":"It's hard to argue with much in this book, since it's mostly common sense.

Part of this is the spread: while Slouching sticks to a few themes related to the sixties, and certain points about Didion's life, The White Album is far broader ranging, both in the time span written and the topics handled.The pieces cover ground like the (then) contemporary scene in California, the Woman's Movement, Georgia O'Keefe, various travels across the US and the world, and meta-visions of the death of the sixties. Throughout, many similar and related topics are treated side by side. This gives the collection a somewhat fractured feel.But what unites them all is Didion's liquid prose, her sterling observations, and her almost supernatural ability to synthesis her observations and work into a single, unified whole. In the end that is what makes this collection a great success and a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid and ridiculous","review":"I can't remember what I did with my copy of this book. I either gave it to a friend or threw it in the garbage. Didion is a whiner - she comes across as the poor little rich girl, complaining about being in the studio when Paul McCartney recorded Why don't we do it in the road. Sorry Joan, I wish you could have been there when the Beatles recorded Ob la di, ob la da if the other track wasn't significant enough! Her other noteworthy tidbit is being in the recording studio with the Doors when Jim Morrison showed up late and either too high or too mental to record. Joan should know that life is full of disappointments. However, I know lots of people who would have felt it was exciting to see Morrison in person, even at his crazy worst.

This solution proved to be pretty good for it - it keeps water fresh, and it does not create any smell (so you don't have clorine smell in your water). Usually I will use the water in the tank in 3-4 month so don't know whether it will really work for 5 years as claimed, but for 3-6 month it proved to work pretty well.I wish the solution to be a bit cheaper, but even with the current price you get good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product but...","review":"I love that this product permits long term emergency water storage of 5 years (as opposed to 6-12 months for bleach treated water).The idea of having to dump, refill & retreat large amounts that frequently is daunting at best, not to mention the hassle of hauling it all out of,& back into,its storage spots.To me this does make it worth the price, which admittedly seems pretty high for such a tiny bottle.However I was rather disappointed that when it arrived a significant amount had leaked out into the plastic bag (saturating the instruction pamphlet)even though the \\"collar\\" seal around the cap was intact.(This same problem was also posted by another reviewer who had this issue with 2 out of 3 orders.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to prepare your earthquake water reserve.","review":"Great to prepare your earthquake water reserve.Added to my 30 Gallon barrel in earthquake shack.Hope I will never need it, but also hope if I need itthe water will still be good.Have tankless water heater.

I do applaud the originality of the premise of the book, but while the historical component is interesting (though underdeveloped at the expense of trite and silly dialogue), the fiction component leaves a lot to be desired. While this could have been a much more engaging and sophisticated work, it seems that Martin allowed this book to drop off to the level of a \\"beach read.\\" My expectations of this writer were clearly not met as I would expect much loftier output from a Harvard graduate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin's Very Best","review":"Harvard Yard is William Martin's very best in a pantheon of excellent novels. The fortunes of Harvard, the people who brought the college into being and the four hundred years of history, with all the pathos, ethos and Thanatos found in the very best historical novels. Martin goes for the double story here, as he had in Back Bay and Cape Cod: the historical story moving forward through time told through the eyes of a cast of facinating characters who went to Harvard and built this nation - and the current story in which the main character and the woman he loves discover a dark secret at Harvard that could change the fortunes of the world. I read it straight through, wanting more. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful novel!","review":"What a great read, and what a wonderful history instructional all in one!

Although similar in its blend of past history with present day mystery, in 'Yard, too much time was spent developing the historical characters to the detriment of the central plot. at times i found myself counting pages and wondering when I'd get back to the real story!another complaint i have is sloppy editting. too much repetition; \\"a man is known by his books\\" was quoted at least a thousand times...and the inability to do simple computation: Fallon's age wasn't figured correctly for the time period in which the story took place. although some might find these minor points, errors like that color my opinion of the finished product.overall, Harvard Yard was too long, only mildly interesting, and not cohesive enough for me to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save me from this dialogue!","review":"I wanted to like this book. I love historical fiction and mysteries. But finally, after just a few chapters, I had to stop. The Puritan-era English dialogue Martin writes is just junk--he actually just uses non-conjugated \\"be\\" over and over to indicate Early Modern English, and that's just laziness. Speakers of English did not suddenly begin saying \\"I am\\" instead of \\"I be\\" only in the last few hundred years. It's not even necessary to indicate period language, but if you're going to do it, why not make it at least slightly accurate.When a wealthy noblewoman said \\"I be impressed,\\" I'd had enough.

Even then the sound is extremely poor. Any sharp noises like clapping or drums comes out as static. I have to fiddle with the tuning constantly to keep the static down, and that's without moving around. If you position yourself just right, have the tuning just right, they are almost usable. Don't even think about using these for music as that experince would be painful with these headphones.

I had to position myself to get the signal and stay in one spot. The frequency selection is the real problem. The tiny dial is way too sensitive to accurately tune in and stay there. The interesting part was that I could listen in on other peoples phone conversations even though I'm at least 500 meters from the nearest house. Bargain basement electronic quality at best.

He is all of these things in Crumbled Receipts and Pizza Boxes, a collection of poetry that captures this young poet's voice in trying times (as a son of an alcoholic, as a child during divorce, as college student reluctant to grow up).

After setting it up and testing it a few days before, I was a little worried because it froze up quite often. Sure enough, when the big moment rolled around, the camera locked up and my family was unable to view the wedding. Thanks, Panasonic. $160 down the drain.**************************** AMENDED ***********************************Ok, not so disappointed now... I feel compelled to amend my previous review/comment about this camera and apologize to Panasonic.

The features are great--other reviews cover them in detail, but the camera has a critical flaw that has also been mentioned many times in other reviews: it locks up every 24 hours or so and becomes unreachable over the Internet. It must be manually power-cycled before it will work again.I am really disappointed in Panasonic for releasing this product with such a serious flaw that goes to the heart of the product's functionality. What good is an Internet camera if it constantly locks up and has to be reset in person before it will work?I wish I could get my money back for this one. If a major product like a car was designed this poorly, regulators would be all over it. Somehow Panasonic got away with releasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!

When I do have the chance on seeing it work, it is not too bad. No where near 30fps. This is what Panasonic did. They took a cheap color camera and stuck it in a fairly cool and useful housing that moves and has a bugged firmware.

When I heard about this thing called a digital comb filter, I talked to a guy in sears and asked him if it was a joke like the simulated surround sound. He said no, but try as hard as you can, you cant get rid of dot crawl on an anolog tv without HDTV, and that the digital conb filter only helps to minize dot crawl. To be quite honest, I dont see any differance in the picture of this tv and my upstairs unit which is a sony but not a flat screen.

All the actors were great, especially Lilo who was imported from France. The story was completely changed to give Frank Sinatra a big part. The sub plot that had Hans Conreid and Gwen Verdon in it was omitted. That sub plot was very funny, and I remember it to this day although I saw the show in 1953. This version had way too much talking and not enough music. I like Cole Porter, but preferred to have the CAN CAN songs in CAN CAN. If you like Frank Sinatra a lot, you might enjoy this. If you like Louis Jordan and Maurice Chevalier, get GIGI. Shirley McClaine has been in many better movies such as SWEET CHARITY. If you are interested in CAN CAN, get the recording of the original broadway show.

I guarantee that you will not find a single well-designed scientific study that shows even an ounce of proof that this works. While you're at it, search for papers that prove that glasses and contacts harm your vision.Optometrists and ophthalmologists are not just trying to make money off of you by prescribing glasses and contacts.

After reading several of the reviews I decided to get the book and give it a try. I just began the eye exercises today 04/06/09. I will update you my progress next month. I don't have anything to lose for trying; at least I will get information on how to relax my eyes. And if this method works I will improve my vision, which is simply priceless. The current power of my lens is 1.75. I am aiming higher which is to dump my glasses altogether. During the month I will use my glasses only when absolutely necessary, such as driving. I will keep you posted on my progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of the book is useless marginal information","review":"As I said in the title, about 70% of the book just pumps you up, by either telling you that this book is awesome and hyping up the exercises, or repeating the same useless info relative to improving eyesight, it seems like the book was originally 10 pages and they had to come up with 90 something pages of empty talk.Most of the exercises they teach are related to stretching the muscles of your eyes, these exercises can be found free of charge online. feels like the authors just gave a brand name to a set of exercises that consist of eye rolling and alternating looking at your nose and far away.if you really want something ground breaking and that has been around for a long time, get dr. bates classical work, I myself bought \\"relearning to see\\" by Thomas Quackenbush, which is a remastered classical Dr. Bates, I do recommend instead of this one for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improve your vision without glasses or contact lenses","review":"It requires living without corrective lenses and multiple eye exercises, which would severely limit your current daily life.

A lot of time at least for the first month. I don't doubt that their tactics truly work and maybe it's just laziness on my part, but I just could not find the time to do them all. I started doing the main exercises for a couple of weeks with no noticeable improvement. I plan on getting back on track again, but performing them all truly takes time and patience. My eyesight is not very poor so my motivation was low, too. But I searched books on this topics and this one seems to be the best deal. If you're interested in a natural solution, I would buy this book. Just keep in mind that it is going to take some dedication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some good things to say, but it's not the Bates Method.","review":"First I applaud the authors of this book for having the courage to deviate from the traditional thinking of their peers in the field of eye care. That said, I feel that the authors are still too ensconced in some of these old ways of thinking. For example, they state that becoming nearsighted after 40 is virtually inevatable. I am in my mid-40s and have had no indication of this even beginning to occur. In addition, how can this be so when many using the Bates Method have never had this condition, or have reversed it well after the age of 40?The book has some good things to say and some of the drills are worth while. It is certainly worth a look. However, my first recommendation is for the books by Bates and Quackenbush. My eyesight in each eye was worse than 20/200 when I started the Bates Method about a month ago, and now I can read the 20/70 line on the Snellen Chart most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's more out there","review":"Just discarding glasses and actually beginning to use your vision a little differently can be enough to improve your vision a little, but I believe that complete relief of blurred vision will be obtained only rarely by just the methods described in this book. And the descriptions of the methods are very brief, leaving much open to guesswork and luck.This book is a component of the See Clearly Method, which includes aspects of the Bates method but this book is more mechanical and physically-oriented than the Bates method. The See Clearly Method has been advertised heavily and attracted a relatively large amount of attention compared to the Bates method, and this book has become popular as well, but there is a great deal more information about vision improvement out there than is contained in this book, and I invite you to research the subject further.I am an advocate of the Bates method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic understanding of how to improve eyesight","review":"Although I just got the book, the concepts are easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not work, it makes your vision even poorer","review":"I started doing the exercises on the 14th October 2010, from -3.0 it got worse to -4.0 in 2 months!

I have been doing the booster sequences for a couple weeks and I can already see improvement. I have stable myopia and just thought it would get worse as time went on.

A better representation from it's first format since it's now on Dolby Digital; in terms of picture and sound quality. Take note of the title track sang by Deborah as well. All in all, it's a light, fun movie about relationships. The actors did a great job; Although, because of it's gay-themed undertones; it's suitable for mature audiences only. Great DVD quality but no added features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful choice for movie night","review":"This is a sweet, very charming and funny bit of fluff that's great for when you want to just watch something entertaining and not too serious. Think along the lines of \\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\" with a smaller budget and less well known stars, but that same kind of script. Lots of witty lines and slapstick humor. Speaking of the actors, the entire cast is appealing. You've just got to love the poor straight guy, who is SO nice to all these lunatics who keep taking advantage of him.

Rent it from Blockbuster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series is a big disappointment.","review":"This series of DVDs seemed to have great promise when announced ... a re-release of out-of-print material previously released by Pioneer and Geneon, with the mention of improved sound quality. This series may have slightly better sound but is painfully lacking due to having been ruthlessly edited. Why they would do this seems incredible ... whole chunks of the shows are missing and the promised extra material is minimal. Searching out used copies of the previous releases would be much more satisfying, if you want my advice. I bought Volume 1 but was unhappy with it. Volume 2 just arrived today and is equally poorly done. I am returning it for refund.

The liner notes state that Liza sings \\"You Are For Loving\\" from her off B'way show \\"Best Foot Forward\\". This has been cut and in it's place is an inept 'Lone Ranger' skit with the very untalented Jerry Van Dyke. The liner notes also state that there are outtakes, which is also not true.

It has a rubber rail around for when it gets dropped and the battery cover does not fly off when it hits the floor. Using the learning feature lets you customize exactly what you want every button to do for that device, and with 8 sets of possible devices, you could even use it for two rooms with two different AV systems.The battery life is long, I have only changed them a couple times in the last few years of use. When the battery starts getting weak the remote will tend to revert back to the first device (TV) after you swich it to the device you want to want to control."},{"rating":"2","title":"great remote, if you can find it anymore","review":"i was so happy with this remove for my home theater that i purchased 5 of them so my little kids can drop them and eventuall kill them. clean design, not too bulky, lighted keypads, fully programmable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... for 2 weeks","review":"This remote was simply to program and worked great, better than great.

I was able to program it to use 99% of all of my systems, but the main problem I have is that the remote defaults to the TV setting after almost every use! This drives me nuts! I'll be using the AMP feature [which I use 90% of the time as all of my components DVD, VCR, etc all go into my AMP] and two seconds later it defaults back to the TV. This is enough to give it only two stars. I'm very disappointed that I spent on this remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Well...For a While","review":"I bought this Sony remote in July 2003.

I am very disappointed in this product-for $50+, and being Sony, you expect reliability.The only replacement Universal Remote I can recommend is the Home Theater Master MX-500, which I've had for 2 years now.

Reading through other reader's responses on this novel I was truly shocked that anyone in their right mind would give this book five stars--I didn't even want to give it a whole star... Hornburg's thinly-veiled autobiography was dull, dull and dull...along with horribly developed characters, the storyline is weak and there is no plot to speak of. It is a book filled with stereotypical hip-kids and urbanites---the stripper with the heart of gold; the aspiring, somewhat tormented filmaker whom no one understands; the ex-roomate who is secretly in love with David (aka Michael Hornburg)...

Only good thing is that this was loaned to me, so I don't have to feel I wasted any money (other than my valuable time)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Gen-x for its own good","review":"Although the book held my interest, it seems that Hornberg was more interested in trying to shock us with his characters' outlandish behaviors and attitudes than anything. I am squarely in the age group of the characters in the book, and consider myself pretty in touch with what's going on, but I don't relate to these characters at all. They are essentially stereotypes of the slacker gen-x generation, which is much more fable than reality. In short - the story is too far out there to be realistic, and not far enough to allow me to suspend my disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great book that captures the essence of the late 90's","review":"I really liked this book. Even though *I* found it a little hard to relate to the charaters,being much younger then anyone in the story,some of the characters remind me of people i know.

But it made me really sad. I read it in one night, and was grateful that was all the time I spent on it. Somehow the interaction of the characters was unfulfilling and their motives--and dialogue--completely unbelievable. No one seemed to have an inner life, much less a past, or even satisfying sex. Perhaps the writer was trying to subvert a typical first, coming-of-age novel, and so none of the main characters had an epiphany or even any apparent growth. Reading this made me happy about all the conventional, good novels, where someone changes, goes through adversity, figures something out. There is some style here, though, and perhaps Hornberg's next effort will be better.

I don't know if other translations also don't include them, but I wanted them, and now must purchase another book!I can't speak for accuracy of the translations from Latin, but the resultant English is easy to read and understand and the diagrams and drawings in the book help a lot to visualize what Vegetius is talking about.The introduction helps put the work in perspective to the date, purpose, biases, and ramifications of the publication of De Re Militari (The Military Institutions of the Romans).A good purchase, if you're not after Books IV and V."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Luck to Good Luck","review":"This was definitely my favorite childhood book.

She has a beautiful voice, and sings perfectly with the tunes, working with the melodies and beat patterns incredibly well. Doing what she does- rhyming and singing (often freestyling) to live music running at over 170bpm, and doing it all so effortlessly- this is true vocal talent.

His thesis is summed up on page 31, \\"The awful truth is that we are making very little impact on culture because we are shallow. And we are shallow because we have separated salvation from discipleship.\\" Hull defines discipleship as a five step process wherein one submits to a mentor, learns of the words, ministry and life of Jesus and then finds others and makes disciples of Jesus. Hull says that the first and last steps are often neglected with the result that genuine discipleship is rare.The last half of the book, where the life of discipleship is discussed in the context of the mind, relationships, submission and leadership is outstanding. I could quote in this review dozens of sentences I highlighted in these chapters. Choose the Life is a book I will be revisiting often as I seek to follow Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raising the Bar","review":"Bill Hull raises the bar for those who claim to be Christians. This book clearly supports his thesis that discipleship is not optional, and is not reserved for some elite segment of the church. He presents discipleship for what it should be - a lifelong multifaceted transformation of our character, our mind, our heart, our service and our leadership - instead of the all-too typical depiction of discipleship as a limited duration study of biblical facts leading to some type of \\"certificate of discipleship.\\" One strength of the book is the degree to which Hull is willing to be transparent about his own life struggles, and the degree to which he himself is willing to model vulnerability. Fans of Richard Foster, Dallas Willard and Dietrich Bonhoeffer will enjoy, be enlightened, and experience tremendous challenge in their faith by reading and re-reading this book. I have bought and distributed no less than 30 copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose the Life","review":"I heartily recommend this book. I am studying this book with a group of men from my church. Bill Hull challenges us to put into action the teachings of the Bible. Intellectual accent to the truths taught in the Bible is not the faith taught in the Bible. Bill is refreshingly direct. He provides a method to help us grow in Christ. He identifies the bearers to moving forward in discipleship both within the church and each of us individually. He shares his experience of dealing with his church environment as well as his own bearers. His honesty and humility resulted in him be broken before God and allowed God's Spirit to use him to help others embrace the life of discipleship.

You MUST have a NVidia GEForce card or an ATI Radeon 9000 card for the game to work at all! NO Other video configurations will work. Square Enix only programmed the PC version to run on this limited set of hardward. The game will stop and give the error that the hardware is not supported if you try to run using a different video. There is NO workaround. Note that you cannot install an NVidia or ATI card without an AGP slot which is only provided on the more expensive computers.Gameplay on any but the most expensive, fast, computer is SLOW and cumbersome. The sound breaks up and the keyboard does NOT react quickly which is what is needed when you are fighting. This was on a Pentium 4, 1.5 GHz system with and NVidia GEForce II card.The game does run OK on a 2.5 GHz machine with a GEFOrce 4 card.

I had tried other salmon oils but they didn't make too much of a change in his scratching. After about 5 weeks of using this brand he hardly ever scratches and his fur is much softer & shinny. I will continue to use the Alaskin Bear Treats Salmon Oil to keep his coat healthy.A note to new users - When you first start using salmon oil, you should give your dog less than what it says you need so their system gets used to it & increase it to the amount they need over a week or so.

The froth is pretty remarkable, and it works best with soy milk or nonfat milk (as recommended).

It is just amazing the way it froths any kind of milk. It is great if you have more than one guest to serve. For myself I use one of the many steam wands I have on different machines. No Espresso machine steam wand at any price can beat this baby. The froth is so thick it can stand far above the rims of the serving cup. It is like thick wet paint with more standing power. I do not find it hard to clean as some claim. Make sure you rinse it in cold water before use. I bought recently the Nespresso Aeroccino Automatic Milk Frother. It is great too, good for one serving only. The problem with it is the milk does not get hot enough like Froth Au Lait and costs twice as much. One more important problem the Nespresso Aerocdino is not going to keep working for a long time, see other reviews. I ended up in returning it. My advise to everyone is to do the same. The Au lait is very dependable so you'll keep for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best froth out there, but...","review":"Great froth. Hands down, the best I've experienced, either at a coffee bar, or at home with my aeroccino from Nespresso. BUT, the machine is a pain to clean, and the version I have needs too much milk to run on; way too much for one cappuccino.

My son got a different frother a while back that cost about $45 more and now he prefers my Froth Au Lait to his. It also makes more at a time than his, it is larger than I expected.One thing--make sure to rinse the milk out of everything as soon as you finish because if it dries it will be very hard to clean and the dried milk can start to build and will be a problem.

At my expense, I mailed it back to the company. They charged a $10 restocking fee. So, $10 to ship it to me originally, $12 to ship it back, and $10 restocking fee on a $49 item that has a much larger footprint than the picture would suggest, and nothing in the company literature about the restocking fee, adds up to a bad experience with this company, in my view. You may want to factor my experience into buying this product online."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is such a thing as too much froth...","review":"I bought this because I was tired of heating up milk on the stove or in the microwave, and I was under the assumption that this machine would give a good amount of steamed milk and a head of thick froth. What I ended up with was mostly froth and teensy amount of steamed milk. Maybe the machine I got was set too high or something, because no one needs this much froth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Silk Soy Milk","review":"I am addicted to foam. I've been looking for a foam machine that will give me that nice thick foam similar to what one would get at that green bucks place.

She is happy, so I am happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milk Frother in Black","review":"This frother does not create thick froth for my drinks as advertised. I used various types of milk and still got the same results. I purchased this item because I wanted to save on having to purchase whip cream, and I thought this machine would help save me money, but it does not. First the milk is not thick at all and the froth does not last for an extended period of time. It only lasts about 5 minutes. You can't even use this machine with soy milk products. You always have to clean this machine immediately after using it, because you cannot immerse it into water. So it's not convenient to use if you are in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this a few months ago and loved it until this morning.

This product should last longer than a few months.Purchase with caution unless you want to buy a new one every few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious design flaw","review":"The Good:This unit does what its suppose to do, froth milk.The Bad:The removable center whipping mechanism can't be cleaned on the inside shaft. The milk touches this part every time. That part of the shaft sinks in the milk and bacteria could build up. I suppose you could try to clean it with some Q-Tips as it is too narrow to fit anything else in there. I would return it but I bought it as a package with a Nespresso machine. I've used it 3 times now before I realized this. Needless to say, I won't be using it again.Edit:I now have an Aerocinno frother. A lot easier to clean up and it looks good on the counter, unlike this thing where you have to hide it. It's hideous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Froth Au Lait, Better than Nespresso","review":"This machine is wonderful! It makes thick, warm froth as it heats the milk and then shuts off automatically. I use it to make Starbuck-style Vanilla Steamed Milk, or to add to coffee.For the Vanilla Steamer, I pour a couple of ounces of Torino Vanilla Flavoring through the hole in the top, and it is a complete drink once it shuts off---in about two minutes. Delicious! Everyone loves the mounds of froth in their coffee, along with the nice warm milk. The big difference between Nespresso and Froth au Lait is capacity. Nespresso only holds a couple of ounces of milk and Froth au Lait holds one and one half cups. One batch will make a big mug of steamed milk for me and plenty of warm milk and froth for my husband's coffee. Or you can pass the pitcher around to four or five coffee drinkers and there is plenty for everyone. Additionally, it is very easy to clean. A great new appliance for my kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great frother","review":"received item in timely fashion. ok price. works great but you have to keep your eye on it so you dont over foam the milk or else it pours out. only downfall i would prefer the milk to get hotter"},{"rating":"2","title":"milk frother","review":"I like this milk frother I just wish it was a little smaller and didn't make quite so much.

Incredibly simple to use, turns itself off when the froth is ready.

Would only recommend this book as an example of what notto do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too subjective, aiming to shock, and little more","review":"The author approaches an interesting subject, but the book contains fatal flaws.

All in all, it is a book I really did not enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid narration of children malnutrition in Mali.","review":"Dancing Skeletons is perhaps one of the most interesting ethnographies I've come across. It's narrative style aid the reader in becoming more interested by the contents of the book. It's a charismatic narration; the reader gets a sense of the darker and lighter aspects of Malian society. It's weakness as an ethnography is the prevalence of an etic point of view.

So much of the genre is lit-lite stuff, without a \\"voice,\\" and Ware defies the norm with a demonstration of true talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazingly honest and personal account of the Vicorian era","review":"William H. White (Mark Rutherford) presents a completely honest account of his life in Victorian England. He reveals his struggle to find spiritual security in a world of doubt. At first glance, Rutherford may seem pessimistic, but only at first glance. He endeavors to take a spiritual journey comparable to John Bunyan (who, in fact, shared the same home town as Wm. H. White). Very apt for the modern reader who may find himself struggling with faith in a world of doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rustie's not rusty","review":"\\"Chip chip\\" is a good, energetic, high-spirited album. Rustie is a spunky singer. The music overall has a traditional flavor, but still has appeal for those who are not hard-core traditional county fans. With 15 tracks, the album has decent length, the listener's not short-changed. Good effort, Rustie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this film made?","review":"I can only assume the producers had some spare film left over, thought they might as well use it up, squeeze a few extra coins out of the franchise. This is quite the worst excuse for a dinosaur film I can remember seeing. The early scenes, involving a lump of rubber which is supposed to be an armoured dinosaur, should be enough to put anyone off. If it isn't, then prepare to be bored. Though the plot starts off interestingly enough, combining Conan Doyle's characters with eco-awareness, it soon descends into a tedious copy of its predecessor, with a far-too-large cast stranded in the lost world. Virtually nothing happens for most of the film. The dinosaurs are barely seen, but as the special effects are so lamentably bad, maybe that's for the best. Once again, a well-cast Challenger and Summerlee are completely wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinosaurs? Where?","review":"What on earth is this? Sequels should only be attempted if the makers of the original have something new to say. It starts off promisingly, with a ruthless organisation threatening the well-being of the lost world, but in no time everybody's stranded and we're left with something that's just a dull, plodding copy of the previous film. And where are the dinosaurs? There are hardly any, and the ones which do appear are so fake-looking and ridiculous you wonder if Frank Searle had a hand in their construction. Utter trash. Why they bothered to make this overblown bore is a mystery. Why anyone should want to sit through it more than once (if even that) is even more of an enigma."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a great as Jurassic Park!... minus 1 million","review":"If anyone rates this movie 5 stars they must have a mental problem. These dinosaurs looked like they were just triangles and squares put together. Where have these people been latley everyone knows a T Rex doesn't look like a Lizard! Infact probably the only reason dinosaurs are in here is so that an oil company can kill them. Come on. The story line also has a serious problem. A group of explorers come to what is known as \\"The lost world\\" even though half the planet knows about it. Then the oil company disturbs a volcano and then some people die and a village gets saveed by the lava. BIG WHOOP! If just one building got burned that would be enough to get this up to 2 stars. So if you rent this video do the video store a favour and put it ina garbage despencer and through it in a fire pit. Infact they should have a \\"Take at your own risk\\" sign just for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Special Effects and Masterful Performances.","review":"Indeed, you probably have not heard of this movie before, but I must say it was definitely the most thrilling and entertaining I've seen my whole life. The acting by that guy in the blue is great and the dinosaurs are so real looking you will jump out of your chair ... in fright.Despite it being made a few years before Jurrassic Park, I still think the quality is far superior. The plot is about two rival scientists set out for the Lost World and find it threatened with destruction by sinister oil prospectors. If you liked, or didn't liked, or even hated the Lost World or any movies about dinosaurs, you will no matter love this one! You will change your perspective on the cinematography of past movies, and will think that \\"Lord of The Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\\" was a graphically mediocre and suspenseless movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood disaster","review":"Bloody eggs! Bloody eggs! EEEEEKKKK! So scary, you can hardly stand to look at the bloody eggs. And this movie is a bloody mess. Where to begin; plot, acting, music, fashion, editing and cinematography all leave much to be desired. I must confess that I have a passion for bad filmmaking. I have viewed this film repeatedly, for the sheer hilarity of all the \`scary' parts. It's fun to watch with your friends to laugh at all the awfulness. Mark Hamill does look fine in his BLUE undies, and is shirtless throughout most of the movie. And he's not at the beach. Still, he cannot save this wretched film. Watch only if you're prepared to be scared by a dead rooster, three (not two) digits, and some lovely 80's fashions. You'll have a blast. I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the perfect gift item.","review":"The vase arrived to me well packed and absolutely beautiful.

I was looking for the King James version of the Bible and one of the reviews said this was the King James version, so when they arrived, like I said I was a little disappointed. There are some really great things about this version. I love the size, 7\\" x 5\\". I love the Soldier's Additional Material: The Pledge of Allegiance, The Star Spangled Banner (although it only has the first and fourth verses), Washington's Prayer, the Where to Turn section, George W. Bush Inaugural Address, President Bush Prayer Breakfast, George S. Patton's Prayer, and more, but those are my favorites. I am not in the military, but thought it would be nice to get a smaller version for 72 hour kits in case of an emergency. I would sure love to have a Bible with me if I had to leave my home. I bought one for everyone in my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bible for Soldiers","review":"This is the second Soldiers' Bible I have purchased (the first was the New Testament only) and this is ideal for me as a Soldier in Iraq. The design of the Bible allows it to easily fit into a cargo pocket, the side closure helps to protect the pages, and if you slip it into a plastic bag its almost indestructible.In addition to the complete Bible (Holman Bible, which I feel is easier to understand than other translations) this Bible includes a topical index, the Code of Conduct, and testimonials from historically significant military leaders.This bible is a great utilitarian reference for those in uniform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Resource - Great Remembrance","review":"I am a retired soldier, and wish something like this would have been available when I was on active duty. This is a modern up-to-date translation, which is very readable. It is small enough to be easy to carry along anywhere. My only critique is that the printing is of inconsistent darkness. The print is small, which is understood with a pocket-sized version of any Bible. Some pages are nice and dark and others are a little gray or washed out. It can make it a little hard to read. Great pick for a gift for a soldier or a retired one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best...","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it's about Darkover. Other than that I found it over-long -- ponderous, in fact -- overloaded with explanation upon explanation about Darkover society that should be telegraphed by now as it is in the other Darkover books. Obvious in plot, syrupy, peopled with characters that take sudden questionable leaps of logic and emotion... It comes out as a bad romance novel that quits in mid-plot. Perhaps MZB is just so famous that her editors don't dare make suggestions any more? She can do much, much better than this. Go get The Shattered Chain or The Bloody Sun instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I started with this book and was hooked.","review":"This was the first MZB novel I ever read. After finishing it, I wanted to know more about Darkover. I was hooked. Because I had never read any of her books before I didn't notice any of the inconsistancies that everyone says are throughout the novel. It was great as a first book because it encompases everything about Darkover. It made me want to go out and buy all the other books in the series, just to learn about all the families of Darkover. I give the book an 8. It was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I eagerly await each Darkover novel and am rarelydissapointed. Although this particular book seemed like two shorter stories combined into one, still I was ecstatic to read it.There were sufficient things left unresolved by the end, that I checked to see if there was a sequel coming out soon. There are two books forthcoming. This was a wonderful read, but total resolution is not to be found yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book -- Continues the Darkover tradition.","review":"This story continues the storyline started in The Heritage of Hastur.

There is not a single original plot or thought in this book. It seems to be a mishmash of events in other darkover books, and even characters seem to be the same people over and over. I am done with the darkover books for good now- they are nothing but a disappointment. I can't comprehend how MZB could take something with such amazing possibilities and trash it! I wanted to tell the heroine of this book to shut up and stop complaining only a few chapters in. The only good parts contain Lew Alton, whom it seems the author can still write about in a quality manner. In general- yuk."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Good Things End","review":"Sadly a lot of these \\"after her death\\" books were rough outlines and basically written by other authors notice the MZB and..such and such.

The thing that upset me the most was that the whole Regis & Danilo relationship that was so carefully built before was shattered.

It is a great introduction to the planet and its unique Gifts and people. The heroine, Margaret, is strong and feisty. The culture clash between Terra and Darkover is well thought out, the characters vibrant. Everyone I have lent this book to, including my husband, read it and want more Darkover, besides the two sequels. A trip to Darkover is always worthwhile.

Great! More Darkover after all!\\". I was disappointed. The only interesting element in this is the presence of the shadow matrix. Everything else was just rehashing the Ashara Is Revealed As An Amoral Manipulator plotline from \\"Sharra's Exile\\". Plus, I was really annoyed with the threshold sickness thing. How many times do we have to have this described? Although it's true that the characters don't know about threshold sickness, it would be nice to fans to give some variety to the disease. This nasty form was well done in \\"heritage\\" already. Let's have something new, for once: how about a terran who comes to darkover and is (gasp) NOT telepathic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starlight express","review":"Mmm. When this CD arrived I was a little disappointed. It wasn't the double CD (original cast) recording I was expecting, but the smaller, single version. Oh well.The composition of the cd is a little sparse, it doesn't have the races which is a real blow and some of the songs seem a little cut, however what's there is good, and definately worth the money. AC/DC and the 'Parade' are probably the best numbers, Electra is brilliantly sung, whilst Du Allien (only you) and Rolling Stock come in close second.Overall it's a fantastic cd (probably even better if you speak german and can understand what they're actually saying), every fan of the other productions should have a copy of what is probably the greatest version ever.

Combine them with some good whole wheat crackers and a little spicy mustard and enjoy. They are nice and smoky flavored, de-boned, and packed in their own juices.Chances are if you're shopping for these things in bulk online, you've already had them before so writing too detailed a review is sort of pointless. They're a bit of an acquired taste, very strong in flavor, and not for everyone. Shipping was fast and efficient and best of all, free.

Wasn't there one woman who had anything good to say? I think that this movie tried too hard to make people cry by making the stories so tragic and heartbreaking. Talk about sissy stuff. Some of the lines said by the mothers were incredibly cheesy, I can't recall them, but I know that they are a little bit overly done. In general I just don't like it.

It's disturbing to see how Asian men in the movie are portrayed as unredeemable jerks, rapists, and misogynists, while the cheating white husband of one of the daughters is portrayed as a temporarily wayward little boy, to be returned to the arms of the virtuous Asian wife.It seems quite evident that Amy Tan has a strong dislike of Asian men. It's perhaps no surprise that she is married to a white man. Unfortunately, this pattern of aiding and abetting of self stereotype seems to be a way for some Asian Americans to distance themselves from their own ethnicity, ingratiate themselves with the white majority, and gain acceptance of their works by the mainstream.It is sad, but perhaps understandable, that while their cousins in the Far East are turning out movie classics, Asian Americans still have to find success by self-deprecation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asian women good, Asian men bad","review":"This movie can be summed up in six words: Asian women good, Asian men bad.The positive portrayal of Asian American women in this movie comes mostly at the expense of their male counterparts, which is extremely disappointing. There is no Asian male the same age as the main characters who is portrayed in a positive light - instead they appear prominently as rapists, wife beaters, and simply dorky. And there is also a blatant double standard - in the happy ending one main character divorces her Asian-American husband for his concern for splitting their bills 50/50, whereas another main character stays with her caucasian husband after he openly admits to cheating on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies of all time!","review":"I just love this movie!...

Parents, for many of us, remain an enigma. Their lives, before we came into the world, are all to often shrouded in a mist does not rise while they are alive. A mist that all to often becomes permanantly impenatrable after they have left this world. For the young women in this movie this is not to be the case. Because of the circumstances of thier lives these mothers will reveal thier secrets to thier daughters. The daughters will learn the wisdom of thier mothers and find that they learn much about themselves in the process. This movie will pull every emotion out of you and leave you feeling tired, but better for the journey. It will leave you with wisdom by which to judge, and perhaps change, your lives.

It didn't even have the hokey charm of the old timer accents of past Wayne Wang indie endeavors about San Francisco Chinese. Plus everyone is using giant plastic chopsticks which are really slippery and unattractive. The whole movie doesn't sound right, isn't dressed right.

He was bald, wore glasses and was so cheap that he pays his wife 7 times less than himself, and makes her buy ice-cream that she doesn't eat.I don't know what she has against Asian men. Maybe it's because she resents her father and brother for dying from brain cancer during her youth.This movie is even worse to Asian men then the Color Purple was to Black American men.By the way, Asian culture protrayed by Amy Tan is NOT typical of Chinese Americans.

People won't go see either.So why should you see the Joy Luck Club? Because the acting is wonderful. Really top notch. If the current affection for having asian women in films lasts then maybe we could see more of these fine actresses. Too bad that so many wonderful actors can get typecast because of race but there is hope. I'd absolutely love some more films like this.Wayne Wang's direction is great.

In reality, I see more women trying to use men's hoping to be a gentleman to make him pay for this and that, and to get away with things she did that was bad.Another thing is that the movie depicted Asian men as bad guys. But in reality, I found that Asian men tend to be the \\"nice guys\\". And in fact, too nice that it became \\"nice guys finish last\\".So this movie just uglify Asian Men. The truth is, if you want to uglify anything, you can successfully do it. If you uglify with humor, at least people know it is just for making fun of somebody. If you uglify and make it look like a reality, then it is not so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Please Smile!","review":"I am under the impression that many people find this movie uplifting. I wanted to stick my head in the oven. The cast is impressive, but this movie is one long downer. Everyone seems to have a great deal of money, all the characters are beautiful, but all the women are soulful and in a great deal of pain and all the men are cardboard cutouts full of malice and stupidity.

Truly great stories from the diaries of the mothers and daughters of Amy Tan's first novel. Last year in the tenth grade, Miss Keifer, our english teacher read us the novel and showed us the movie. Since then, I have read The Kitchen God's wife, and am now reading The Hundred Secret Senses, both of which are by Amy Tan. I wish someone would make a movie out of The Kitchen God's wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but her other books are better","review":"This is a good Jackie Collins read. It is nice to see old character from other books included, like Montana Gray, Michael Scorsinni, etc. But it is predictable. I mean, how many stories can you write about a psychopath looking to get revenge on a big star that has done him wrong? Or a beautiful, rich star who has made it big, but some kind of secret, terrible past that she or he can't get over? Hollywood Wives, Hollwood Kids, and American Star are much better books. Those three books are 10 times better than Hollywood Wives The New Generation. I love Jackie Collins books though. I know that ever since I read my first Jackie Collins book, I will read whatever she writes, but I think her older books are much better and am trying to read every one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say?","review":"There are just no words to describe how great Jackie Collins. She just can't write fast enough, but Hollywood Wives: the new generation was worth the wait. Guess who makes an appearance? Montana from the first Hollywood Wives. I loved Lissa Roman. The whole movie star and the detective thing was great. Buy this book! You have to read it. It's unbelievable! One of her best novels yet......... After this book, Deadly Embrace will be released. It is another Madison Castelli book (she was in L.A. Connections and Lethal Seduction). After that, Jackie promises another Lucky book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book, yet no surprise!","review":"Unlike \\"Hollywood Wives; The New Generation,\\" the other books by Jackie Collins I found interesting and fun. Yet this book was very dull and shows the true awful writer in Ms. Collins. The entire time I was reading this book I was travling by plane or by train. I thought it would be a nice read for a long trip. The book only frustrated me with its obvious ignorance and I simply returned the book to the airport shop I bought it at. I also noticed very sloppy grammar and spelling in the book. It was a true flop of a book that I would reccommend to not even my worst enemie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Jackie Capable Of Writing Anything Else?","review":"I read one of her earlier books and then decided to get this one at the library. I am glad I didn't waste my money buying it. Her books are all the same. Beautiful people, beautiful people having affairs, beautiful people in danger, beautiful people living happily ever after. She seriously needs to get out of Hollywood. I couldn't even finish this book it was putting me asleep. I don't think she can write any other type of book, she uses the same formula in all her books. At least other writers change locations and occupations of people. Does she think the rest of America and the world is so wrapped up in Hollywood and what goes on there like she is? If you must read this book get it at the library. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie Collins- Hollywood Wives- The Next Generation","review":"My first Jackie book since the Lucky Series. What a great beach read! And in true form, I was not able to put it down! I want to go back and read the first Hollywood Wives now! Definitely worth a perusal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jackie Collins Reading","review":"If you like Collins, you'll like her latest. She's in form and the entertainment is consistent throughout in the new generation of Hollywood Wives. Collins is to that thing called \\"Hollywood,\\" what Jane Austin was to early 19th century English country life: a witty, satirical, social commentator. You can visit, but you don't have to live there. (Is it possible for the same person who enjoys Austin to also enjoy Collins? Certainly. Both are brilliant at taking you into their world. Your choice if you want to go there.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glamorous and Glossy!","review":"It may of been trashy, brainless, tawdry melodrama but I loved this book! Jackie takes all the stereotypes of Hollywood celebrities and throws them together into a glamor-packed soup of gossip and subplots! Like a 500-page tabloid! The characters are all true-to-form spoiled, self-obsessed divas. The goings on are appropriately scandalous. The many talents and many husbands, the wild rich kids, the gay followers, it's all here!The perfect Hollywood novel it may not have much substance but since that's what's expected of its subjects it's just perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"This book is great! There's never a dull moment in this one. I loved the characters and the plot. I wasn't all that impressed with the last few books she wrote, but this one is an exception.

A great summer read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My fall into nostalgia","review":"When I was in 8th grade, I picked up Jackie Collin's Lucky and devoured it in 2 sittings. It was fast paced, sexy, and fun. 25 years later, I thought it might be fun to read her again for some summer fun. Sadly, I have to report that this is one of the WORST novels I have ever read. The plot is entirely silly. Despite being English, the author's command of the English language is dubious at best. But the worst part of all is that this novel is not FUN. And that's what it should be. Her characters are so one dimensional/stereotypical that I have more compassion for Dick... in the See Dick Run series. Even the sex scenes, of which there are few, are boring. The only bright side which is why I've rated the novel a star over 1 is the blind items she scatters throughout the novel. For a light, sexy, fun summer read look elsewhere... and if you like blind items, try the online gossip columns. But leave this novel on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read!","review":"One of the reasons I've found Jackie Collins to be such an enjoyable author is that she creates memorable characters. Her novels, usually are loaded with characters that you'd like to know and those that you'd like to take down a few pegs.Not so the case with HOLLYWOOD WIVES-THE NEXT GENERATION. The characters are boring, predictable, shallow, and totally not Jackie Collins.Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose ends left untied","review":"This book wasn't the least bit as entertaning as the first \\"Hollywood Wives.\\" This time around the psychopath who's out to get the protagonist, Lissa Roman, lacks a motive. The horrific and terrible event from Lissa's past that is briefly mentioned is never once confirmed or brought up again. The characters aren't likable. But this book is an easy read. Die hard fans of J.C. will love it regardless of the obvious flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sizzling Summer Read","review":"If you thought the summer was hot enough for you then you better read Jackie Collins new book. It will put you on fire!!Great Storyline and an amazing assortment of people that you can identify with. Once again youll enjoy every word of this book. A word of warning make sure you read this book in front of a high powered fan or else you'll burnup.A real page turner!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This guy's good...","review":"Yeah, I know, it's totally out of character for me to like something like this, but I really like it a lot. I picked up a free promo copy of this at work and listened to it on the subway the next day...it's a terrific collection! I knew a couple of Jerry's songs from a while back, and am really impressed with his guitar playing and his songwriting skills. He also has an easygoing sense of humor that always puts a smile on my face.

They are noticebly shorter in length than any of my older steel toed gibsons, and the toe box is smaller.

After 6 months of walking in them and thinking \\"gosh, I thought they'd be more comfortable, but I guess I just don't know\\", and countless blisters on the back from the relatively thin material with no padding in the back, I decided to go for a pair of RedWings.Wow, I'll never go back. The RedWings look nearly as good but boyyyyyyyyyyy are they more comfortable. Not even in the same ballpark.

I needed a pair of steel toe shoes for work so I decided to give them a try they were the worst pair of shoes I've ever had. They blistered my feet and they didnt even last a year. I don't know if Doc Martin just went to a lower quality or what but please don't waste your time on these shoes. Check some of the other shoes with better ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK fan, but squeaks really bad.","review":"The fan is not bad, it blows cool enough if you have it sitting right next to you, and the noise from the motor and blades doesn't seem too much more than other fans. But why I can't honestly recommend it and the reason it gets 2 stars is because of the squeaking. I've already tried WD-40 and the fan still makes terrible squeaking sounds when its on oscillation. No matter how long I leave it on, the sound only gets worse. I'm able to sleep through it because I'm a very heavy sleeper, but its when I'm awake that's the problem. It could just be a defective one, but if you get one like this it may drive you insane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"This is a powerful fan for your desk or a small room (say, no more than 11x11 ft). It has a wide turn radius, though it does not capture a wide area outside of the direct area of the fan blade (it is a small fan after all). It's fairly durable though it's a little worse for the wear after a recent move; It got banged around/dropped just a bit and now it catches slightly on both ends of it's oscillation range. This does not affect it's effectiveness but is something I noticed. On the whole it's a good value for what you pay and will definitely be a life saver on hot days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert heat be damned","review":"This fan is great. It came shipped from Amazon very well packaged. This fan is not that big or bulky. Good length power cord.Ok so this item is great. This thing BLOWS its unreal. Most fans of this size dont move air like this fan does. I can tell you that desert heat in May to September is unbearable, specially with bills so high. This thing has 3 setting, low, high and off. On low this thing will after 20min make you shiver, no exaggeration. On high you will need to turn it off or freeze. This while its small and a desk fan moves air like a full size fan.Pros:Moves ton of airSmallQuiet (noise you hear is the air, and all fans will do this. as for the air flow isnt that loud.Not heavyCons:None really.

It does move a surprising amount of air for such a small fan - but it's also noisy for its size.

And I have to say, scandalous is the appropriate term. Due to the time period there isn't any nudity nor any love scenes. But that's about all it lacked. The plot centers around a girl in Washington D.C. who rents out half of her apartment to help ease the housing shortage in D.C. Well an eccentric millionaire moves in and decides to play match maker. What we end up with then is a very long and prolonged movie focusing on scenes where Connie and Joe almost get together, but then don't. The overtones of intimacy are rather strong throughout the film. And it seems like the writers were fascinated with their ability to get in a swear word by using Admiral Farragut's quote of \\"D--- the torpedoes full steam ahead.\\" over and over and over again. In short, the movie comes across as a test for Hollywood to see how far they could go given the sensibilities of the time period.

I am surprised that no one else should notice this. Furthermore this film is not at all funny in the least and contains a poor script plus poor actingperformances from every member of the cast. Personally, I also feel that compared to the other great comedians of time-Claudette Colbert, Carole Lombard, Lucille Ball,Greta Garbo, Irenne Dunne-Jean Arthur was just plain unattractive. Add to this the leading man-Joel MCcrea has no screen charisma and appears dull and wooden. I had to stop the film halfway through and throw away the videotape.

Seagate support was great and I arranged an RMA online and new one was delivered from Singapore within 2 weeks (probably closer to one)...that was a year ago. I was using the drive about a month ago to copy files off my PVR and everything went swimmingly! I tried backing up a laptop yesterday as the lappy was heading in for repair and exactly the same symptoms as last time. I have another RMA arranged and fingers crossed I get a good one next time.

Sitting dead and plugged in, it would turn itself on sometimes after an hour or two. I had trusted Seagate, but not now.Also it does not have an on/off switch.

Seagate sent me a used replacement drive, and it has the same problems! This product seems unreliable, which is the problem you buy an external drive to avoid. Reliable backup is key.

I recognize that is a lot to ask when the subject of investigation sports a secretive history. Still, it seems to be a question sadly neglected by professional historians and left for those with an axe to grind one way or the other to write about.If another reader knows of a book that has focused on objectively investigating the history of Freemasonry in England during the 1600s, I would be grateful if he or she would mention its author and title in a review of this book.Thanks in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"proof that he is right","review":"After reading Ed Decker's material, I have proof that he is right. I have my grandfather's 1910 2-volume edition of the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry published by the Masons themselves--everything he says is confirmed in there.

In fact, go all the way back to Shamanism as a preview for evil spirits and investigate throught time til you get to Freemasons. Now it starts to make more sense.

Stevenson's book provided exactly the solid, thoroughly researched history I was looking for, in exactly the century that concerned me.

By this I mean he adds a note at the end saying, more or less, \\"screw you\\" to anyone that wants to follow his work.If one is looking for a good read on the French and Indian War checkout Fowler's \\"Empires at War\\". In the end Schama's book is perfectly titled \\"Unwarranted Speculations\\" indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compfy cushion","review":"I am really comfortable using this cushion for my meditation practice.

Other popular authors (at least to me) like Michael Connolly or Ken Follet are available in extremely limited selections. Also, the pricing on available books does not always reflect the fact that they may currently be purchased in paperback-and are priced much higher than a typical paperback.

First, the machine simply stopped working after 5 months. Second, to send it in for warranty repair, Sony wants $92.00 for labor, upfront, plus I have to pay for the cost to ship the item. They don't assess the problem and then give you an estimate, permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through with a repair. Third, when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine, their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is, buy a more reliable product, not a Sony. Check out what the warranty, when you purchase. Select a product with 1 year parts and labor. Otherwise, find out what the manufacturer charges for warranty service.Watch out for deceptive warranty policies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Method to his madness","review":"This book provides a short but insightful biography of Ted Turner, the southern businessman known for his business acquisitions, media influence, sports franchises, and Jane Fonda.

Major financial and business ventures are covered in detail, with analysis of both legal and money aspects.

The many control settings are barely explained.2) CD sound is biased toward high treble, and Sony recommends an external equalizer as the only answer.3) Technical support is by email only with slow responses and incomplete answers.We will not buy another Sony audio product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Highly Effective","review":"-Mallee's credentials as a professional coach are impressive, but a major league understanding of the game does not autmatically make one a good teacher or provide a quality video.In this case it does!First, John Mallee is an excellent teacher.

Unfortunately the mouse had to be ordered separately.

I was surprised at what a quick and enjoyable read it was, full of important lessons.

As one of the other reviews says with the tragic death earlier in the year of Russell Peck this disc devoted to his music is likely to stand as one of his enduring memorials. The titles of the works say it all - \\"The Upward Stream\\" is characterised as swimming against the flow and this sense of struggle to a triumphant conclusion is brilliantly realised. \\"The Glory and the Grandeur\\" is another spectacular work brilliantly performed and well recorded too. Hopefully this is the kind of music that should be re-recorded & released on the Naxos American Classics series - there is an intriguing concerto for 4 cellos listed as well as a timpani concerto.

The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews: When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting.

Problems? The systems would not read/play CDR - CDRW discs as well as several newer manufactured CDs. The \\"scanning - all discs\\" feature played unreliably - stopping after 20 minutes before all tracks were played. Coming from an era where you put a record on a turntable or a tape in a tapedeck and music plays - this selective playing is NOT acceptable.

The sound quality is fine, but when any number of disks is loaded and the shuffle mode is selected, it almost always quits playing with several of the selections from each disk remaining unplayed. In addition, the Repeat function does not work. I was thinking of exchanging the one I have for another Sony, because perhaps this one is just a lemon, but after reading several customer reviews describing the same problem of not playing all of the tracks on all of the disks, I'm going to look for another brand.

I have to take the cd out and put it back in (sometimes three or four times) before it finally gets it right.Other times it will play a brand new cd and suddenly start skipping. Again, I take the disc out and put it back in, and it will play it correctly (unless it has the previously mentioned mishap of not realizing there is a cd in there).DO NOT buy this machine!

I purchased it based on bang for the buck. The player has similar/identical specs to the more costly similar players from other manufacturers. Sony has been manufacturing and selling this exact player for almost 10 years so it must be reliable. The player performs flawlessly when playing CD and CD-R and exchanging discs. I think people have problems because they don't follow the directions or don't understand that the mechanicals inside a changer will make noise when changing discs. A cd changer is a mechanical piece of equipment that must be used carefully when exchanging and loading discs. My only complaints are that 1. no coaxial output but there is an optical output and 2. the remote can't power up/power down the player. I can live with these flaws since it only cost $115 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"SONY 5-CD CHANGER","review":"Our new Sony CDP-CE375 changer produces great music.

I am sure you would be better served buying a DVD/CD changer for a similar price. Atleast that was the advice I gave my friend.UPDATE: The problem was the receiver, so the cd player may actually be OK. I am still quite disappointed with the remote.

It is also far more than just a couple of mascarading crooks who concoct a story of the kidnapping of a high church official as a means of bilking a naive gentleman of his money. Gide has written a marvelously twisty-even slightly twisted-and often hillariously funny crime novel. What places _Lafcadio's Adventures_ far above that genre is its emphasis on the meaning of friendship, loyalty, genuine caring and a real sense of responsibility for another human being that can and often does transform people. Gide takes an interesting look at a social outsider in a fresh and humane way. The result is a truer and far more complex and sympathetic picture of such an individual. Even if I could not quite make out his motivations there is still much to think about in Gide's brilliant study of saints and sinners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not panning the book, just the edition","review":"A warning to those who want to buy this book: It is laid out as if one were reading it on-line, with each block paragraph separated by a full line.

Besides the two massive hits, the dramatic Ma Baker and the hypnotic Belfast, it also contains other gems like the beautiful Plantation Boy with its wistful lyrics and compelling reggae beat, a good enough version of CCR's Have You Ever Seen The Rain? and the title track Love For Sale. Eurodisco was the sound ruling the airwaves and the dancefloors in 1977 and 1978. Although it gathered a lot of flack from music critics back then, Love For Sale's not a bad album at all whether you look at it from a pop or dance perspective.

Nothing in the Belkin spec sheet or user manual indicates that this unit will not automatically associate with Linksys Wireless-G routers. There is nothing at Belkin online support or in the PDF user manual about the issue.

Such was my case for the past month until I got this.It does work right off the bat (like after it searches and locates your wireless router), but you still may be getting a weak signal because your SSID's for your wireless router and the range extender are the same (which it should be if you used the autoconnect button on the back of the range extender). And that would mean your computer/laptop may still be utilizing your wireless router rather than your range extender. For that, I suggest you follow Leo Piyush's directions which can be found in one of the reviews here.Anyways, its a great product and I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a solution to weak signals from their wireless router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"When I take my Laptop to the location of the range extender I get good reception, but this the range extender dosn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Vista supported","review":"Belkin has made the decision not to upgrade this with Vista drivers or support.

As out of date as this unit is the price should be much lower.I know that some of the reviewers say they don't have secured networks, but even so, I wouldn't invest in something that wasn't more forward compatible. I'm pretty sure you will eventually want to secure your network, which is pretty easy to do, and there's always the unavoidable upgrades and since this unit lacks MIMO you won't get the full throughput from the 801.11n antennas (increases the maximum raw data rate from 54 Mbit/s to a maximum of 600 Mbit/s)in your new laptop or router.Just my opinion, of course, but it seems like a lot of work for something you're just going to want to replace relatively quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality problem with AC adapter---defective","review":"I ordered the product and it was defective....would now power-up.

The auto-configure function? Functional, but if it loses power (which it must in order to move it to its intended location after configuration) it forgets how to talk to the Dlink. Using the web browser interface is a losing proposition as well. The unit was completely schizoid regarding the result you might get from one moment to the next during the ultimately unsuccessful struggle to configure it.You might be okay if your intent is to get this device to talk to another Belkin device; otherwise I suspect you're asking to suffer if you intend for it to talk to a non-Belkin device."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little frustrating at first","review":"It took some experimentation I but I finally got this thing to work the way I wanted and it performs well.

Of course you'll spend a half hour trying to understand the instructions. They could be written much better. Even so, the device works very well once configured and I am pleased I made the purchase.However, be aware of this: The setup software is NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE.

I typically have no problems setting up equipment even when others say they have had a hard time. I am a licensed electrical engineer with a lot of computer experience and the only reason I didn't send this thing back is because i was not going to admit to defeat. This extender is impossible to set up on a secured network if you use the included instructions or the web site. You need to search the web to find useable set-up instructions.

After having this for a few days my friends told me that even though nobody lives near me i should encrypt my wireless. Unfortunately, this repeater does not automatically configure itself for an encrypted network, so i tried for 10 minutes to fix the problem without using the instructions. after that i got out the instructions, followed them(which was surprisingly very easy) and within 5 minutes it was up and running.All in all, if your network is unsecured this will set up in seconds and work perfectly. If it is secured, follow the instructions, very simple, and it will work perfectly.Another nice feature is that if you lose power you do not have to reconfigure it, unlike many others my friends have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant extension to Belkin router","review":"It works great for the purpose I bought it ... extend signal from a Belkin 54G router.As an experiment, I tried the extender with a 2WIRE router from SBC.

It was easy to set up, and records a nice clear picture in EP, which was the most important feature to me. HOWEVER, I had problems from the moment I unpacked it. It makes an unpleasant plastic-on-plastic squeak whenever I record or play, loud enough to notice during quiet parts of whatever I'm watching. And some tapes that I've recorded on this VCR do not play well on other VCRs, which makes it unreliable for sharing tapes with friends or making permanent recordings of movies. Getting Sony to service the unit requires mailing it in at my own expense, another big hassle.

This VCR was a lemon right from the start, but I had originally attributed its problems to the fact that I was watching rental videos; I know now the problems were actually my VCR.

The audio went out completely, the picture was snowy on every tape, and it even started chewing up tapes. I got a huge hassle from Sony Customer Service. They tried everything possible to avoid honoring the warranty. When I finally received a replacement (ten weeks later), it didn't last any longer than the first one.

I played HOW THE WEST WAS WON, SPARTACUS and Disney's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. The animated HUNCHBACK looked best. If you watch animated movies I suppose it did not look all that bad.

There is so much left I was left wondering why?There is a quote at the end of the film that is almost comical basically saying the producers did not want to glorify drug dealing. If you do not want to glorify drug dealing try showing all the bad that came out of all the drugs in D.C. at the time.I read that Kirk Fraser the maker of this film dropped out of film school at Howard University after watching this I think he should have stayed in school.

It took me back to many years ago, approximately 1999, to the days of making tapes for friends. I had to sit by the machine and hit a pause or stop button to end the recording. It also would not allow the fast recording of single tracks. This was in contrast to being able to select a track for recording, walking away, and returning to find the recorder waiting for my next track selection that I had with a Phillips that unfortunately broke within months of my purchase, leading me to buy this model. So, for those who want control, to make compilation disks, this is definately not the machine. I find it hard to believe a basic recorder like this costs this much money.

In 'Elemental,' she displays a spare simplicity of musical line, without the sometimes frenetic and distracting orchestrations of her later albums. The songs are also pitched to take advantage of her rich voice, whereas in later albums she has focused more on her upper register--lovely and ethereal and a joy to listen to, but lacking the strength of her lower voice. 'To Drive the Cold Winter Away' is a wonderful, relaxing holiday album, full of quiet strength and the hope of renewal after the bleakness of November. I found that it helped create islands of serenity one terribly depressing winter.

AS near as I can tell, his portrayal of Doc Holiday fits what the real outlaw was like - surly, laconic, and short tempered.I have no complaints at all, except maybe it doesn't explain enough soon enough, however, patience has never been my strong suit.The best part about this movie is that you can watch it with literally anyone (wife, girlfriend, friend, preacher, grandmother, etc.). It gets your attention and keeps it.Some religionists may be put off by the idea that one's afterlife may be decided after death rather than before it. That's another thing I like about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"I'm a huge Eric Roberts fan but this movie didn't deliver.It was all around weird and I didn't find it intersting.I'm not a big fan of westerns either.I enjoy Eric Roberts in many different type of roles but I just didn't care for him here.I say skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated B movie","review":"I am a big fan of Westerns. I like old and new and I am always eager to watch something different. This was a TNT original movie and as such my rating would be 4 stars which is to say better than most TV movies. However, by comparison to theatrical releases this movie pales and I can only give it 2 stars which is being kind.I loved the cast, but the acting was surprisingly bland. The script was not bad, but neither was it engaging. The action was weak, especially the shootout at the end which was edited poorly. The only thing I found that the movie had going for it was an insteresting premise which halfway through the movie had already grown old.When I see 4 and 5 star ratings and I think of all the great classic westerns, this just doesn't measure up. Open Range, a Kevin Costner Western that is just a few years old shoots circles around this one.

I would definately suggest watching it.It arrived to me very quickly and in excellant condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacrafice, Redemption, and All That Good Stuff","review":"I have been a Sam Shepard fan ever since that marvelous film:\\"Days of Heaven\\", so when I saw \\"Purgatory\\" in the TV listings I decided to have a look (especially considering the unusual story-line.) I must say I at first had some trepidation about tuning in, because films with similar scenarios are filled today with such graphic horror devices. (I've seen enough real horror, thank you.)I was pleasantly suprised! A beautiful film about love, honor, and redemtive sacrifice; very well acted and filmed. I would higly recommend it to western buffs, and devotes of the mystical, alike. Purgatory could provide endless hours of discussion in literature, philosophy and theology classes. But don't be put off by that. The film never takes itself so seriously that it becomes boring or preachy. Having seen this now on TV, I am definitely buying a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"what VCR","review":"The only reason I came here today, was to purchase this movie. However, all I use is DVDs. I don't understand why a movie of this caliber, made in 1999, was not released on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing idea","review":"When a few outlaws (led by Eric Roberts and Peter Stormare) enter upon a mysterious town, they get more than they bargained for in Purgatory: an intriguing allegory made for cable channel TNT. All the legendary names of the Wild West, including Billy the Kid (Donnie Wahlberg), Wild Bill (Sam Shepard), and Doc Holiday (Randy Quaid); all of whom attempting to redeem their souls for the acts committed while they were alive. Naturally, a conflict ensues, with the townsfolk reluctantly resorting to the violent means they have been trying to erase. Purgatory packs enough action for western enthusiasts, even though it may come off as too preachy for some, and while it wears thin towards the end, it still manages to be solid entertainment with an intriguing idea. If you dig westerns with a twist on redemption, check out Purgatory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purgatory","review":"As you can see from the past reviews, nobody has scored it less than 5 stars. What an amazing movie! It's too bad this didn't go to theatres first so it could be enjoyed on the big screen. It definately deserves a transfer to DVD with all the extras so hopefully that will be coming soon. I'm very picky about the westerns that I'll watch since a good one so rarely comes along these days. But Purgatory is great! Like others have said, it's a western with twists and surprises like no other before it. And for \\"Hollywood\\" or TNT as the case may be, to put out a movie with a moral or faith based message, well that's just very incredible and very welcome considering the messages that are conveyed in most movies today. Purgatory is 5 stars and then some. And at this price, you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well the title says it all","review":"Without giving out the story line, it is purgatory.

Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodness in the heart can ALWAYS prevail","review":"I have always despised just about every western made except for less than a handful. \\"Purgatory\\" and \\"The Quick And The Dead\\" are just about the only ones that I enjoy. \\"Purgatory\\" has such a deep underlying meaning to me...it's very hard for me to put it into words. But I can say that this movie shows to its viewers that through one's own personal convictions, no matter how rough life's road may get...salvation and peace of mind can and will be one of the eternal rewards. Sam Shepherd does a GREAT JOB as Sheriff and even though I love Eric Roberts, I thought that he was a \\"real S.O.B.!!!!!\\". I mean...whatever happened to \\"love thy brother\\" especially your own blood? My own brother is a real ass and even though I don't like him 90% of the time...I STILL LOVE HIM.

The second time we got our unit back they threw away our original packaging that we had saved (just in case)and did not send the remote back with the unit.We call to complain and they really could not be bothered with our complaints.All in all, buy a PVR but avoid Sony--they seem to think that they have the corner on the electronics market so they do not have to worry about customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"SVR-2000 A Big Disappointment for this Sony Fan","review":"Every TV and component in my home is from Sony so I was both surprised and disappointed by the poor quality of the SVR-2000. After just five weeks the unit locked up and would not function. When I called Sony for assistance the support representative basically said to bad and I have since had to pay to ship the unit to their repair center. When the unit was functioning I enjoyed the TiVO service but the Sony SVR-2000 was slow to react to the remote control and I found the lack of a 30 Sec commercial skip feature to be a real pain as you must fast forward to skip often missing the re-start.

I can't count how many times the sound has sporadically cut-out or how often the message \\"TiVo can't display Live TV\\" has popped up. Every time this happens, the shows it taped are basically worthless: Either the first few seconds were recorded or the entire program was recorded w/out sound. It worked great for the first 5.5 months, but it doesn't look like this problem is going away. I'll have to do some yelling to the people at Sony.

So, if the unit breaks, you can't replace with the same \\"lifetime\\" service paid. The lifetime is based on the lifetime of the receiver/unit.

Its menus suck, there is no \\"favorites\\" capability so you have to troll through menu after menu if you do not remember the exact station number. You cant set up short cuts, in fact you cannot navigate as easily as you can with the basic units. You rarely if ever know if a pay per view is in letterbox on the TIVO/Sony, always on the Basic box. The unit randomly freezes, and loses the signal monthly. The basic boxes, never.And SONY has the absolute worst warranty & worst customer service on the Planet. If you anticipate speaking with a SONY or TIVO rep, plan an afternoon or evening.

I finally called Sony Technical Support, and was directed to use my IR Blaster and one of the channel settings. This resulted in better performance, but there are still times when the Tivo does not change the channel on the AT&T; digital box and I miss a show. Also, the placement of the IR blasters is kind of ugly and awkward. I have also run out of space lots of times, so if you can afford it go for the higher models with more disk space.

There was only one choice for service - pay almost $100 for a complete referb. It worked for 5 more years and died when we had a power failure. I will not fix it again.

I think the first edition was published in 1904 and at the time it represented just about all that was known about the subject. A serious student today could rightly ask why he/she should read such a old book ? Well the answer to that question is a not an esay one : however whilst I would never say it is an simple book it repays careful study. Anyone taking more modern courses based on Arnold or Abraham and Marsden would do well to have a copy of this book by their side.The problems are taken mainly from Cambridge Maths Tripos examinations and they form a useful adjunct to the main body of the text.All the major topics are coverd including the 2 and 3 body problem, small oscillations, stability,etc. Well worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is good the print out is terrible","review":"I am writing to alert buyers that the quality of the printout is very poor.

The Gilbert more overtly American than the Chadwick, but both are absolutely worthwhile. In Gilbert we can hear the predecessor of Ives, in that he takes American folk music and fashions it to his own idiom.The Chadwick is more influenced by the Germanic tradition, although here too we can find the seeds of American classical music.Both pieces, however, suffer from a far from ideal performance. Both are taken from a live concerts, with problems of ensemble, intonation and background noises quite apparent.But the Chadwick really suffers from tempi that are almost consistently too slow. The opening Allegro grazioso is and Allegretto at best, the Andante goes towards and Adagio and the third movement is hardly a minuet (even though it starts out fine!). Only the last movement really takes of immediately and makes for a fine close of this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know what you're thinking.","review":"Emo? EMO?

No mathematical methods are discussed other than in passing. Rather it is wide ranging, unfocused and occasionally comical.

Schena (or his publisher) even claims to be the \\"Father of Microarray Technology\\": a bold title that properly is shared between Patrick Brown and Steve Fodor. Schena digresses into such irrelevancies as defining the Internet and the value of Venture Capital. The book is quite uneven, it goes in depth on the specific chemical issues relevent to cDNA arrays and is very shallow on normalization clustering and stat. level analysis.

Otherwise, the upconvert DVD player worked well, the sound for movies, XM radio, and CDs was solid, but there was not much in the way of changing the audio settings and controlling the subwoofer.

We decided to put the $160 toward a more reliable product like Sony. This is the first and last time we ever buy Samsung. They are aware of the faulty design and are not willing to stand behind their product. I bought a anwering phone/cordless phone system from Panasonic 2 years ago and I no longer had a receipt. I called them up because it was not working. They paid for me to ship it back and they gave me a refurbished answering machine. No questions asked!

I switched the rear speakers so I could put the tower speakers in the back which was more effective for me. I used the Optical Audio in as the HDMI in pass-through mode didn't work.

I would have sent them back but I had an immediate need for backup. Very disappoining for a lifelong Seagate fan to feel this ripped off.

Don't buy it if you expect to use it as an eSATA drive. That's why I bought it, and it was hanging my Vista PC, taking seconds to minutes to wake up from sleep mode, and even after disabling the sleep mode it was starting and stopping during file transfers! Since the utilities only work in USB mode (why?), I assume Seagate didn't pay too much attention to eSATA users, and their tech support wasn't very helpful when I reported my issues.Not a good solution for eSATA users."},{"rating":"2","title":"everybody love it","review":"i love it. works great, very fast. everybody love it. some people asked me to recommend where to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away, far away. 2 drives, neither lasted a year. eSATA didn't work.","review":"I bought two of these about a year ago.

I had hoped the Firewire transfer rates would be faster, but this is not a really big problem.I use the drive to archive my various media files and when it comes time to burn any data, I take the extra precaution and temp. copy the files involved to an internal drive, and burn from this temp directory.I have this drive connected to a WinXP PC P4 3.2ghz system using an Intel 865 based chipset (on board Firewire,etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"It trips over with the slightest pull on the cables.

A 12% charge to exercise a warranty isn't my idea of customer service, especially when I have no confidence I won't be doing this again.I first started encountering Windows inpage errors, the solution to which Seagate support said was to format the drive and start over. After a half dozen of these I started getting Windows delayed write errors. When I ran the FreeAgent diagnostics they returned a diagnostic error 9DE8C943 with text indicating the drive was bad.

It also gave me greater peace that God has a plan for me even in the midst of this trial. I thank God and Rick for this book. I still have bad days when I dwell on unknown answers but this book and its insights have helped me see my life going forward. I highly recommend this book.WDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Rick Warren has written another common sense book for all to benefit from.

At the time, no one but Peters was talking about self promotion in this way, unless they were citing Peters! Nowadays, with the advent of social media, we're all used to hearing these ideas. But Peters ushered in these concepts and made them what they are. It's worth a read for that reason alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, OK stuff, but not WOW!","review":"Well, I read it in 4 hours... It's interesting, it does good to your self-esteem and contains fairly practical advice. However, I wouldn't consider it too seriously for crafting a new life course on the basis of its advice. It also needs significant updates where it refers to new media and the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rah Rah, not How-to","review":"Professor Peters is/was a Harvard professor of business who concentrated on researching and teaching competitiveness. I liked his serious books and text books. He's a really high energy speaker and has a quite lucrative business in coaching. Therefore, I should not be surprised that this little book is full of gimicky fonts, colors, buzz words... and is closely associated to the sales-oriented web site of the same name. Maybe there's good content there, but the presentation screams: motivational, not content-rich. And that's what I think the book is good for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for on the go...","review":"If you like Tom Peters you'll find nothing new, but I liked this book. I am reading on the 'project 50' now, what I like is the small size. If your on the go you can easily take this book along, either on the metro, or on a cross country flight. A good reminder to leave it out on your desk to keep a fresh outlook on the daily drudge or rather to prevent it from becoming a drudge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the Pump Up!","review":"This is an easy read with straighforward thoughts on how to stay marketable into the twenty-first century. A great read, and I found myself reading chapters (albeit short ones) to my wife in the kitchen, I was so pumped up after some of the chapters (nubs & TTD's). Anyone looking for direction and purpose in their obsession, look no further than this book.

He correctly projects the most forward moving managerial trends and thinking. The presentation, though, is sorely lacking. The book's partial sentences, choppy writing, random capitalization,and arbitrary use of bold type, different size types and indents were so distracting it was hard to remember what the heck I was reading about. I also wonder about writers that feel the need to promote their message with the use of four letter words--is the content not enough to sell the work and make the point? For those that haven't heard this message before this book is probably worth reading. If you can handle a more comprehensive (and longer) book I think there are probably other, better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonable Thesis, HYSTERICAL PRESENTATION","review":"The point of this book is that you are a brand. The possibility of having a very long term job with one company that defines you career is very small. For this reason you need to evaluate what your skils and interests are and market them, network, and promote yourself as the brand behind the 'WOW' projects you've worked on.This strikes me as resonable though it's pretty generic.Reading the book seems like it'd be a lot like seeing Peters in person on stage. It's got an evangelist style, catchphrases like 'WOW' project, BRAND YOU!, etc.Here's a representative quote, 'Set up a Freak Collection section in your Rolodex. Add to it. Consciously. Constantly. Nurture it. Concsiously. Constantly.' The book is about 200 pages of that. (IMHO: BRAND YOU 50 = CAPITALIZATION + REPETITION + GENERIC OBSERVATION.) If you need a shot of enthusiasm about branding yourself, this book might be for you.

I was really interested in hearing about brand and the new economy the author envisioned, but the book is just too distracting to read. I \\"read\\" about 1/2 of it, and I'm not sure if there were more than three full sentences that I had found up until that point. Text changes color, size, boldness throughout. Liberal and nonsensical use of punctuation is infuriating after the first page.The book reads like a spoken seminar, and squanders the opportunity of actually being a book, which could have afforded a more in-depth look at the authors ideas.I would highly discourage anyone serious about this topic from buying this book. It is more of a super-happy high school cheerleader dialog than any type of meaningful discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not think twice! Buy this book (and the Project50)","review":"This set of 3 books by Peters (Brand You50, Project50, ProfessionalServices Firm50) has changed the way I think about my work, job, and career for ever.

Second, several of the tables in the book are not visible, replaced by \\"Text not available due to copyright restrictions.\\" These are tables integral to the text.

The kindle version excludes all tables, which are extremely essential to grasping the overal theories and models presented.

From the content, one can easily see that Waugh was disposed favorably towards Fascist Italy and was constantly annoyed that Ethiopians did not treat him the way he was used to be treated in other colonized countries.He himself says that he is irritated by the average Ethiopian person who thinks he is equal to anyone in the world. Even if one considers that this was written during World War II, I find it difficult to forgive this guy for thinking so blatantly in a racist manner. The book is just a reflection of his frustration. I find it difficult that European readers continue to admire this guy.Frankly, I consider the money I spent on the book as a total waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvalous","review":"great book on all mishnahs, very very compeling to learn the idempt meaning of the oral laws"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO HARD TO DO","review":"This was the number one toy my 5.5 yr old daughter wanted for Easter.

Lizzie is about five. I did not like seeing the child pooping on the potty. (Yucky!) The clown was what our family liked the most. There really was no potty training!

My only criticism is that \\"the act\\" is omitted (although I don't know how one could tastefully and legally include this). Thus, the child sees all the steps up to and after elimination.

This video has a special vignette in it which addresses this. My 2 1/2 year old sings the songs and I truly believe it has helped her. The main story line centers around 4 year olds who are already potty trained. This helps take the pressure off of toddlers by focusing on *big kids*, instead of precocious 2 year olds who use it like pros :). We prefer this video to \\"Once Upon a Potty\\", and my 2 year old asks for it frequently (although \\"Once Upon\\" should be part of your toddler video library)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates confusion in potty training girls","review":"My daughter liked the video well enough to watch it but she was and continues to be confused by the ways boys stand up to potty. It seems to focus way too much on training a boy and very little on training a girl - perhaps there should be a version for girls and boys....

For some bizarre reason, this video centers around a 4 year-old's birthday party and how his friends are able to go to the potty by themselves. Only one child was my daughter's age and the segment focusing on the young child was very brief. This video also includes an excerpt on a Raggedy Ann book for no particular reason. My daughter always grows bored and walks away at that point. I kept waiting for some useful information to be presented and found myself slapping my forehead at the end of the credits. This video is NOT worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic...everyone makes it to the potty?","review":"The \\"Bear\\" tape held my daughters interest to the point that she asks to watch and knows new vocabulary.

Don't let the accolades fool you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this video. My son is 23 months old. He enjoys watching the other children in the video as the theme is a birthday party. The video is about 25 minutes long and spends about 5 total minutes showing the \\"potty\\". Heavy focus on an upcoming birthday party and being a \\"big boy\\". The majority of the children in the video are age 4. Only one scene shows a child in diapers. All other children are in underwear and can undress and dress themselves. All \\"potty\\" actions are shown on a big toilet, not a small potty chair. If your child is 3 1/2 or 4 and needs some reinforcement, it's okay, but the limited potty focus makes it not worth the money as a training video. Do not buy this video if your child is a beginner. Duke Family could have done a better job by focusing on children in various stages of training and decreased the birthday party focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for late learners!","review":"This videa was perfect for my 3 1/2 year old son who was totally not interested in going on the potty.

On his 4th bday he took off the diaper and never went back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Loved it, but didn't seem to learn much","review":"My kids both enjoyed watching this video over and over - my daughter, out of diapers for almost a year, still requests it. However, neither of them seemed to make any connection between this video, and any behaviour change on their part. My personal opinion is that potty training is going to happen when your kids are ready, and no amount of Education, discussion or demonstrations are going to speed that point along much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Old Fashioned","review":"I think that the tape was probably a very good idea, but is geared towards older children. My son is two years old, and will uset the potif you put him on the pot, but he just won't tell you when he has to go to the pot. The video was so old fashioned, that it didn't even keep his interest. The clown didn't even interest him, mind you this is from a child that looks foward to looking at Zyboo at 6:30 in the morning. Needless to say, he only watched the viedeo maybe twice, and didn't even see it all the way. I am going to get him another potty video, because this was a waste for my two year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL STINKER!","review":"We were loaned this video from a friend to try with our 2 yr. old twins. Her kids were terrified of the clown, (as many children are). They wouldn't even watch it because of that. My twins were bored and got nothing from it. The video is very dated, with bad acting. Too dumbed down for our tastes. Glad we didn't pay money for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I waited a month after purchase to look at this with my son. What a waste of money! The tape is bad quality with many breaks of static. The story line is stupid. It should be titled, \\"Lets go to a party\\" which is what it is about. They do not show going on the potty. It reminds me of sitcoms of the 50's where married couples slept in twin beds - you know what's going on, so we do not need to show you. My son was totally disinterested. He got up and walked away half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"I thought it was going to be better then it was , to many weird songs .

The video contains what I think is a member of Insane Clown Posse along with music that was probably written in the same amount of time it usually takes to use the potty. The production probably cost about a buck fifty and I would consider it an insult if given this tape as a gift. Thankfully our library had a copy (static and all) so I didn't have to waste any money on it.... let the buyer BEWARE. The Bear in the Big Blue House tape is much better and was actually produced by professionals, I highly recommend it. \\"It's Potty Time\\" reminds me of the films we were shown in grade school back in the 60's and is about as entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and out-dated","review":"This tape was a total waste of time.

There aren't many videos that do that. The songs are cute, and my son sings it while he potty.I don't understand about the fuss with the clown and the \\"little guy\\" from the other reviews. They're just there to remind kids what to do. Who's to say that the clown was not one of the parent? My point is, the tape is about going to potty, not about child molesting. Lighten up folks!I gave it 4 stars because it's very good but not great, and quite cheesy, but kids like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the best video!","review":"We bought this video for my daughter when she was about 18 months old. The music really got her attention. By the time she was 2.5 she was potty trained. Her baby brother loved it also and now that he is slightly over two he seems to be paying even more attention to it. The only draw back is that it is not gender specific so at one point we did have to discuss the fact with my daughter that boys do stand up.No, the video will not take the place of parental potty training...but it will help.

Two minutes of toilet time and twenty three minutes of nonsense - a drawn out birthday party, a child reading a dull, black and white book waiting to go, parents singing \\"she's our best pooper\\" - gimme a break. My two year-old was bored and all she remembered was the teddy bear sitting on the potty who, at one point, gets his head put in the play toilet bowl by the girl wiping him.

It was more focused on the 4-yr old's bday party. YAWN~~I wouldnt recommend it to parents who really want to show their child how to use the potty. The rest of the story line is distracting and boring to the child watching it. My daughter was bored-so I had to keep talking about the potty things during the story of the bday party."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me.","review":"I hated this video so much it made me nauseous.

Like a lot of indie sorta-rock bands out there, their strength is in not standing out, being another pretty good band.And they're certainly that, don't get me wrong.

One Rescue Hero can ride on the trike and, while there is no slot for their backs, they do fit securely onto the trike by holding onto the handle bars.

I have been really happy with its performance overall. This CLIE does everything a PALM would do, and it adds a much better display, (color, very sharp), and an MP3 player. I travel one to two times a month and this CLIE goes with me everyhwhere. Not only does it keep my schedule but I slap on a Targus keyboard and I easily compose word documents. This is also handy for graduate school as a laptop is cumbersome to have in class, the CLIE simply makes taking notes easier, and takes up less space. This CLIE is visually pleasing in appearance, and performs at a high level.Another great part of this CLIE is that it has the memory stick technology. Part of the travel I do requires working with a digital camera, I can take pictures, and view them on the clie simply by transfering them via the memory stick.

So when I was shopping for his 7th birthday I saw it on sale at Toys R Us for $40. I was VERY hesitant to purchase it, but I thought that maybe the Jr version would work and that the K'nex pieces themselves were worth the $40.First my husband put together the Jr. version and it worked just fine. So my son took it down and built the big version. He put together the whole thing himself and it works great. Every so often the balls get stuck, but it by far exceeded my expectations.

It took me 8 hours and I didn't have enough pieces and it didn't work properly and was destroyed in under an hour. I do not recommend this toy to anyone - any parent - who plans on building this for their child. If you have a child with lots of experiece w/ Knex, they might like it, but overall...its really bad. Don't buy it. It's not good. And i'm not bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Flimsey and Not Worth The Money","review":"I bought this for my son, who is almost 12 years old. He has many other K'Nex sets (roller coasters, space station, dragster...) and this one, for how much it costs, its not worth the money. When you finally build it, (it took him about a day) it wants to fall over. It doesn't do what it says, with the balls falling where they are supposed to. We are actually contacting K'Nex corporate to see if they would be willing to trade it in for another set. I would NOT recommend buying this.

When I called the company to inform them of this, I discovered that they actually had a seperate line for missing pieces. Once I reached that operator she informed me that my son would receive those missing pieces at the earliest by the end of this week.

None of the paths worked consistently. The balls shot out of the top of the unit and onto the floor half the time. The balls would not travel through the ladder assembly. The box was missing parts but we were able to piecemeal things together. Not a precision toy. There is no play value in the game when it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to enjoy this visual splendor!","review":"Our 7 year old built this himself in 3 afternoons, some of which he had to complete standing on a small stepstool. He did have to take some pieces that were missing out of his other knex sets. It is absolutely amazing when the shoots work, but so flimsy that the sheer force of one ball going through the hoops sets the entire tower into misaligmnent and you have to readjust everything. This is only a toy for the patient child, with a scientific mind, like my son is. My 4 year old was disgusted and called it a stupid toy, his father agrees. Their grandfather who paid $100 is also disgusted. By the way, it takes up six square feet and when someone walks across the hard wood floor the tower misaligns. OH, and whoever designed this should realize that sending only 1 ball with a guy in it causes huge fights to get the \\"special\\" ball. Obviously a numbskull with no children designed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nightmare","review":"This thing took about 6 hours to build. The directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow, but I figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool. Unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor, on fresh batteries, didn't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently. We spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it. Ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside. He looks really cool, but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot. I love KNEX, but this set is a DUD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible gift","review":"My children received this toy from their grandfather this Christmas. I spent 1 entire day trying to put it together and found I had made an error somewhere. The next day the kids and I tore the tower down, counted all the pieces and bagged them individually. We had all the pieces listed in the direction booklet. I spent the next day rebuilding the tower and still ran out of pieces. Once the tower was finally built, it wouldn't work as described. We could get one or two parts of it to work but the rest wouldn't. We left the toy alone for the day and planned to tweak it the next day. However, the tower fell over and I took it apart and put the pieces back in the box. Hopefully never to come out of the box again. The boys received the roller coaster last year for Christmas. It also was a pain to put together but at least it worked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Toy","review":"My 11 year old son has put together several Knex products with no problem.

What I am left with is perfectly functional clock that keeps great time, but nothing else. Save your money and don't get sucked in by the design the way I did. They clearly need to make some MAJOR improvements on the function before I will EVER buy another one of these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Display","review":"I bought this alarm clock for my husband for Christmas and it was a huge mistake! The display screen is so bright we couldn't go to sleep and in the dark you couldn't read the numbers! The only thing you could see was the bright blue light and that was on dim. Thinks twice before buying this clock unless you need a night light and it is an inch from your head so you can see the numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the price fool you!","review":"For less than $10 I would have thought...it has to be junk. It isn't! It is very sturdy and heavier than it looks. Plus I didn't realize that it has a line in so you can plug your mp3 player into it. The blue back light was unexpected when playing CD's but it looks cool. GREAT VALUE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go buy a one at Walmart","review":"I thought I was getting a good deal and avoiding going into a store to get what I wanted...but in this case the whole reason that I made this specific purchase (good price for a CD alarm clock) BUT when it arrived (it was like Christmas, I was so excited) the CD player didn't work. I sent it back and got my $ back, and went to Walmart this weekend. It's possible the CD component broke during shipment, but still disappointing nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"For 9.97, this is a good buy for my family!","review":"I bought 3 of these. 1 for my 6 yr old and 1 for my 4 year old. They have somehow broken the other 3 that we had in the house. I am very pleased. They have the repeat all feature which I use to play their cds all night. On 1 of them, the repeat all feature does not work so I am sending that one back for a replacement. All-in-all this is a great by for $9.97."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright lights and big cities","review":"This item is easy to set (time and both alarms) and has fairly good quality sound although the reception is poorer than my previous radio. The main complaint I have about this product is that -- having an alarm as one of the features -- it would seem to me that most people would keep this by their bedside, like me. The problem is that the light eminating from the clock is a bright blue and illuminates the bedroom. I have to physically cover the part of the radio where the light resonates from at night or face away from the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"First, the instructions for this clock radio/CD player are terrible! I know two highly educated people who bought this--neither could figure out how to wake up to CD. Also, the digital display is way too bright and the numbers are unreadable. This is the worst designed product I have ever experienced--the designers need to go back to the drawing board. I gave this to my husband as a gift. He didn't want to hurt my feelings, but finally had to speak up and admit he doesn't want it by his bedside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bright","review":"This clock looks cool, but thats about it. The LCD screen is too bright at night. Even though there are two settings for it, the low setting is still too bright.

CD player works terribly and has skipping problems with original cd's and burnt cd's. Sound quality is D at best. Ability to set 2 alarms it a good feature, however don't buy for only that feature. Radio stations will not come in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot see time","review":"What is a clock without being able to see the time??? You have to be within 3 feet of this clock to see the time. I guess if it's right by your bedside and you only look to it for the time when you are getting up it would be okay, but I bought mine for the baby's room and needed to see it from across the room in the middle of the night. Other than that, it functioned properly. The sound is not great, but wasn't expecting much for the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this at a department store and that should have been my first clue that it would not be the greatest in quality. I should have just gone to a store that only sells electronics, but now I am stuck with this piece of junk. Don't do what I did!! The radio NEVER picks up any of the stations I used to get on my other radio, which I am now having to use again. My cds constantly skipped, and forget about playing a burned cd, that will never happen. It's just junk, that's all. Don't waste your time or energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE PURCHASE","review":"This unit certainly ranks among the worst alarm clocks I've ever purchased. It was purchased for my daughter as a Xmas gift. It is now seven months later and the unit is totally dead. Of course, it is out of warranty now. Even prior to this event, this was a poor purchase. The adjustments and controls are so poorly layed out and non-intuitive that I couldn't always figure out how to set the alarms or the correct time without the users guide nearby. Even something as simple minded as figuring out which button controlled the radio or cdrom became a chore. In short, poor design, poor engineering, poor quality. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Months Old","review":"The clock light lights up the room... forget trying to have the cd player on at night... and after 3 months of use i guess you wont be able to anyway!The cd player stopped working"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute clock; doesn't work great","review":"I love the design and looks of this clock and it's upright CD design. However, I think that because of the vertical playing position, it tends to skip more than a horizontal player, even with brand new CDs. Also, the blue backlight is EXTREMELY bright. I have to cover it at night, which pretty much defeats the purposse of a backlit clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice","review":"The alarms works great. The radio and CD has a decent sound. Unfortunately, I needed a clock. The display can only be read when you are looking at it dead on. If you look at it from any angle, the display is washed in blue and cannot be read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super difficult to use, not user friendly","review":"We bought this for our daughter and my wife and I even have problems working it. It is verry un-user friendly. Hard to turn off when alarm is going and way to many confusing buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way, way, better than I expected!","review":"I can't believe all the 1 star reviews. Maybe it's just because the 3 I bought all work great. I actually LOVE the bright blue light. It doubles as a perfect nightlight for my son's room. The CD and radio both work great (the tuner is merely ok, but for 9.97 people!)Taking into consideration the price, quality, utility, style, etc it is a 5 star value!!!! I would be happy paying 19.99 for the unit (but I am glad I got them for 10 bucks each!)I bought one for my room, my daughter's room and the baby's room! I will update this if any of the ones I bought break down, but I sure hope not!Happy Holidays!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"The only reason I purchased this was because it was a cd/am/fm/weatherband. It actually doesn't have the weatherband capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice appreance/price but not very pleased","review":"I purchased this product and returned it. A couple of the buttons were stuck down and there wasn't any place to plug headphones in. The overall appreance was very nice and it was easy to use. I bought this to use at work, but without the option of headphone use the product instatnly became useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no","review":"I got this as a gift and hated it. I got it to replace a alarm clock cd player that I had but this one was no where near the quality I had before. The cd player always skips and the clock is useless. I set the thing and in the next day it was already 12 minutes off. Thinking I just set it wrong I tried again. NO it speeds up... My advice get something else... this is not worth it. Instead of having an antenna this radio alarm clock has a long wire sticking out the back that flip flops around. I had to move it over and over and tape it so it would get my signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this!","review":"I bought several of these 1 year ago when they were selling for $5.99 each. It was a waste of money then. I can't beleive this thing is actually selling for over $100.00. RUN AWAY from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I wanted this clock for my son so he could wake up and go to sleep listening to his CDs. First the clock doesn't keep time too well. It some how ends up being 30min fast. Then you cannot go to sleep listening to the CD if he wants to wake up to it. It is very confusing to figure out and I have always needed the directions on hand to figure out how to program it. The light is very bright too."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspired and WAY over priced","review":"This book's \\"blessing\\" is just a standard little diddy that's too long for a hallmark card. The pictures are a collection of 'antiques,' and while some of them are quite nice, together they lack any unity and instead form a jumble of illustrations. I could see paying $5.99 or even $7.99 for such a book... even then a bit pricey, but since it's a 'good fit' for a house warming gift... No way is it worth $15!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Backswing, but no Follow Through","review":"The author starts well but doesn't finish as he jumps from the course, to the town to the townspeople, but with no real insights into the main subject: the golf course and the tournament itself. His one-sided portrayal of Cliff Roberts doesn't help the reader truly understand why Roberts spent much of his life devoted to Augusta National.

I was also surprised that tylenol was recommended for anything.Overall an excellent addition to one's medical library and I believe Dr. Wallach's message is definitely important-M.D.'s certainly are not \\"invincible gods\\" and the average American needs to become aware of the undue influence the drug industry has on standard medical practice in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELP YOURSELF","review":"THIS BOOK HAS ALOT OF IDEAS ON DIFFERENT WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SELF AND HOW TO KNOW IF SOMEONE ELSE IS TAKING CARE OF YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable if outdated","review":"This book reads not unlike Chuck Klosterman's offerings....being a sort of diary-journalistic approach to a topic.

The young actors do a remarkable job at portraying that nostalgic and rebellious time when BMX and skateboarding began to blow up. The story depicts how youth from different backgrounds can turn their talents into greatness, and how easy it is to fall down into despair if your priorities are not in tact. From beginning to end the story kept me entertained, and once again, the young actors were incredible. It took me back to the 70's for the duration of the movie, and that Tony Hawk cameo was hilarious.

I guess they did to my grandson as well because, although he talks frequently about skatboarding when he gets a little older, he lost interest in the movie barely a third of the way through it. I felt the same about it - it was intensely boring to me to watch what looked like a bunch of immature guys doing their thing.

How about a movie with this simple message: \\"get a freaking job, loser, and quit skateboarding the rest of your life away.\\" Here's another idea, how about a movie that glorifies homelessness? How about watching some crusty bum urinate in the back of a garbage container and then climbing on top of a skateboard and riding off into the sunset shaking an alms cup?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"I really like the story. I was a skater so it is interesting to see from a historical standpoint. The script may have not been that bad. The problem is the characters seem like they are overacting.

The system offers a few pre set sound options but you can't customize any of them. The next is the HDMI inputs. There is only one so it came down to my cable box or my Xbox. The obvious choice would be the cable box as I watch it more than I play Xbox but I couldn't get it to pick up the signal, so the Xbox won by default.

Can anyone help me figure out how to get the speakers to work when watching standard cable? I have a cable box so would I need to link it to that instead of the TV as some of the inputs are filled with High Def cable wires. Do I need to purchase a HDMI cable wire?

Manilow's songs aren't that memorable and there's too many of them. The story, as thin as spring ice, focuses on Hubie, a stuttering penguin overdone by Martin Short, who has fallen for Marina, a doe eyed penguin whom he wants to present with his pebble on mating day. Of course, Marina is eyed by the loutish brute Drake (Tim Curry) who will do anything to secure her bliss. Hubie is mistakenly thought dead courtesy of the deadly leopard seal but he has merely been whisked away by penguin hunters who want to sell him to the zoo.

The evil leopard seals, which eat the penguins, are huge. The penguins are smaller than their mouths. Then cut to a scene in the ship Misery where the penguins are one third the size of a human. Which basically means that compared to humans these sea lions are the size of an 8 story building. Fast forward to the scene with the submarine and the leopard seals are normal size. Another stupid thing about this movie is that Rocco the penguin flies. Yeah it's a kids movie, and yeah it was his dream to want to fly, but when he flies to catch hubey and marina he doesn't move his wings. He does this quasi-superman move because he catches them with his hands as they fall off a cliff and then ascends into the sky on will alone. It was very melo-dramatic. I can't think of a worse movie at this time.

First, it's usually a bit more expensive than non-ECC RAM. Second, it's still a fairly high-end feature and some motherboards don't support ECC RAM. My motherboard will accept either type so at first I had the cheapo non-ECC memory and had MANY random crashes, but when I switched to all ECC memory I have a crash maybe once every week or so (that's probably due to Win NT or a buggy video driver).

White's ultimate design for his saga was to bring things full circle. The final book takes Arthur underground to meet with Merlyn, and some animals for a grand debate about the nature of humankind. This is a pretty tedious read...long on ideas and short on action. This certainly doesn't come across as a final version of the text. Things that White normally nails, like characterization, aren't always on the mark here.Of course, there are some chunks of prose that are absolutely brilliant. We're talking T.H. White, after all. Things are enlivened by Arthur's trip to the worlds of the ants and the geese. (However, I feel these episodes functioned better in Book 1.)Editorially, I found this edition tantalizing but unsatisfying. A highly personal introduction provides details about White, but fails to explain some basics -- how did the goose and ant segments ultimately ended up in Book 1? How and why was the text \\"lost?\\" Frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning for fantasy lovers","review":"If you loved Once and Future King especially for the humor and whimsy of Sword in the Stone, you need to know that Book of Merlyn is a very different beast. The T.H. White who wrote this revisiting of the Arthur matter is not at all interested in story. He even seems to be using Merlyn merely as an excuse; what he wants is to vent on some pet philosophical ideas. And White had become seriously embittered and misanthropic by that time. The book was very disappointing to me and left a bad taste in my mouth. I choose to consider it NOT a valid part of the Once and Future King canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment....","review":"T. H.

The main characters are King Arthur, who depends on other people, and Merlyn the great magician. I think that the book was very boring. It dragged on and on with unnecessary detail. \\"The Book of Merlyn\\" had small events like King Arthur turning into an ant, but it didn't have any major events throughout the whole story. This book had unrealistic characters, such as animals with human characteristics. This was not an enjoyable book to read because of the reasons I have listed above."},{"rating":"2","title":"White's political views abound in this fantasy gem","review":"Professor/author T.H. White wrote a powerful work that provokes inquiries from the reader. The complex characters serve as backboards for the major themes that vary from war to humanity resorting to primitive ways. White constructs a simple plot and adds layer upon layer of wordplay, philosophies, political views, and much more to transform the basic premise into something magical. The most warped character of all, the bumbling eccentric Merlyn, serves as White's voice throughout. The weary Arthur's gripes seem so genuine that the reader may empathize with the lonely soul. White's work contains some of the only material that can be compared with that of fantasy master J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien and White both utilized dead Anglo-Saxon languages' roots and base words to the maximum, mixing Old English prefixes with Norse suffixes. This is a brilliant work, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product at a good price","review":"I bought these for my Dakota. They were easy to install and look good.

Deutscher weaves together character study, drama, and historical narrative to give an authoritative account of Trotsky's tragic final years, as the great leader waged a rearguard ideological struggle in the face of an avalanche of Stalinist harassment, slander, repression and murder. Simultaneously, Deutscher lays bare the blunders and disasters of the Communist International under Stalin's leadership, making clear how inexorably these failures followed from Stalin's deadened bureaucratic-centralist socialism.Deutscher's deft handling of the facts, personalities, ideas, and situations of the time is simply unparallelled, and makes for a tremendously enjoyable and informative read. His account of Trotsky's last hours left me in awed tears.Essential material for anyone exploring the question of where socialism went wrong in the 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment.","review":"I actually ordered this set from another provider, and was so disappointed that the advertised \\"anamorphic widescreens\\" were not.

The MAIN BOX and EACH INDIVIDUAL BOX are marked as ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN (Enhanced for 16x9), but True Lies and Commando are not. The WORST is that Predator is PAN AND SCAN... not any form of widescreen! I already own these movies in the old style widescreen. I can't figure out how this could occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Lies indeed - a total ripoff","review":"The other review is intirely correct. I wish I had kept the receipt for this.Not only are none of them anamorphic, Predator is indeed pan-and-scan.

It then goes in to be one of the worst looking DVD transfers I've seen.there should seriously be a class action lawsuit for this release, because all of the DVD packaging says \\"Anamorphic Widescreen\\" on each disc.

I even wrote Fox directly and they simply said \\"we aren't aware of any widespread problems with these titles\\"...which means they've pretty well washed their hands of fixing this rather glaring error.

Now they are all marked \\"WIDESCREEN\\" and the aspect ratio with no anamorphic designation even if they are!

In fact, Ms. Hayek is the only redeeming value in this trash flick. The movie was shot in South Africa on a really fake set of 1930's Los Angeles. The set has one street, one trolley car and a bunch of antique autos, with a bunch of equally phony extras looking like they should be cleaning the street of horses**t! That's right, horses pulling wagons! WTF! I'm not getting into the acting because there wasn't any! How this piece of a bombastic screenplay made to film (a waste of celluloid!) is a mystery to me!

Bad stereotypes, bad performances, bad actors. Some pretty images, but at a very high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bites the Dust","review":"The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is nice looking. The cinematography, production design and of course the actors are all very easy on the eyes. It is unfortunate then that the story is uninvolving and actually very ridiculous in parts. I think Colin Farrell is a bit miscast also. It was hard for me to buy him as being inexperienced with women. Donald Sutherland is totally wasted as an alcoholic neighbor. Why he even appears in this movie is a mystery to me. Another character, a woman who shows up out of nowhere, is also less than convincing.

Although, the author must be given 2 snaps for being able to use \\"gabradine fabric\\" in the description of a body part. Smell that sarcasm? Anyway, with a main character whose name I kept forgetting, in a story I wish I could forget, I'm hoping for better things as this writer matures.

O'Reilly is a great success and should have had enough connections to pull this off, or at least be warned off of trying this disappointing idea.Trying to slog through this book was just painful.

In fact, the book conveys respect and concern for kids. Two of my granddaughters asked me to buy them a copy of the book, saying their friends like it a lot.

O'Reilly has a heavy-handed writing style and this certainly won't translate well to a book geared towards youngsters. The book is a summary of his beliefs which have been elucidated at length to adults.Rather than try to poison a youngster's mind with rigid political beliefs, people like Bill O'Reilly should let youngsters enjoy their youth before they reach adulthood and have to deal with O'Reilly's ilk."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was terrible!","review":"This book was terrible, I tried to give it a chance but I was not happy with my purchase, i thew the book away.

That way he wouldn't have to worry about anti-american children who think that killing is wrong, coming on his show and making him look like the monster that he is.Shortly after the release of this book, O'Rilley further stated his love for children by slandering this child again.

I also liked his emphasis on self reliance. Why if more kids took O'Reilly's advice and took care of their own needs like he does, there'd be a lot less teen pregnancies and STDs, right?

What in-depth insight or advice could anyone expect to get from a man who has no experience or education regarding such an area? Moreover, Bill O'reilly has an incredibly simplistic outlook on life in general, and tends to see everything in black-and-white and with little profundity.

I'm not going to sit here and bash O'Reilly. If you're thinking about buying the book in the first place, it's too late for you. But maybe not for your kids. There still might be hope. The bottom line is, you wouldn't buy a children's book written by SATAN himself. Look at that face again. Think \\"SATAN\\". Do it again.

Furthermore, this whole literary concept of reducing the world into us-against-them is not only childish, it teaches you to block out of peoples' points-of-view. It also encourages creating a straw-man approach to everyone who does not agree with you, rather than finding out what they ACTUALLY think."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Mr. O'Reilly writes for children as though he hasn't the faintest recollection as to what it was like to be one.

His advice here is just as much based on informed opinions (NOT) as the op/ed advice that he gives to adults in those few misled households which actually welcome his TV show.

For people like Bill O'Reilly, the things THEY do wrong are ok because they are Republicans. When Democrats do the same thing, it's a different story.O'Reilly's parents' generation saluted the flag, kept their noses clean, worked hard and went off obediently when Uncle Sam called. That all made sense then. Bill in this book evokes that simpler, straighter time in his admonitions to the young. Problem is, he talks the talk and doesn't walk the walk.

Does any child ask Santa for a Bill Oreilly book? Is anyone's last wish to meet you? Of course not. You're a pig headed facist aristocrat.

A multitude of haphazardly developed characters centered around a double murder, a kidnapping and a treasure hunt can't disguise the lack of a coherent or entertaining plot in this book.

Elderly couple killed discovering treasure hunters and the story and characters twist around in circles from that point.I must say that there are obviously previous novels to feature local JP Whit and his chums and I have not read them and that may be a reason that I did not enjoy this.

I couldn't stay awake for the third and fifth stories. The radio story was almost scary, but only made me groan. As far as I'm concerned, you would do well to stay as far away from this garbage as possible.

The stories are badly written, hard to follow, and just poorly made all around from the acting to the directing and everything in between. Really, words fail me how bad this movie really is.

The five stories are good and if you like to see blood then you will love the one with the one with the two guys and the professors wife! The movie is fun and entertaining.

I just had to laugh at that and feel a little sorry for the guy.

BIG MISTAKE.This film is atrocious. The acting is horrid and the stories are nonsensical. Being the masochist that I am, I actually sat through the whole thing. I almost turned it off when the story started with the doctor who was haunted by the street vagrant because he gave him, wait for it, a bad hot dog(I wish I was making this up).

And the whole blending the stories together doesn't work at all. Shows that tarentino actually has some talent when you see it done so bad.So heres the worst news.

Any serious romance fan will find this a fascinting read. I was continually impressed by the profound insights in this book. Not only is it a compelling response to the many unenlightened critics of the genre, but it is also a thoughtful consideration of how romance novels reflect the changing face of women's issues in this country.

In a time when cultural studies is turning its attention on sit-coms and daytime television, should we ignore what romance writing has to teach us about our selves and our culture? I think not. I didn't find definitave answers here--no gospel of women's fiction--but there are a plethora of perspectives. I was challenged to evaluate how and why I read to see if my experience matched up with the authors'. It is a bit of an apologetic...I guess many of the people who read and write romance novels (like myself) are well-adjusted and well-educated people, and we wonder why we're so attracted to books commonly described as \\"trashy.\\" It probably won't convince any \\"outsiders\\" (as the earlier review said) of the value of romance writing, but if you love romance and you don't know why, give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"It is an amazing book, it is the best if not the only explanation I have found about the psychology behind the romance nobels."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"I've had this phone/clock for about a year.

Some time it includes what are barely hot springs... like owl creek on the salmon river and ones on Panther creek in Idaho off the main salmon. A good starter guide for some hot springs, some good descriptions... a little bit to generous about how \\"great\\" they really are- I found that most of the hot springs tend to be crowded with naked pot-smokers, drunk and smelling foul.

First I must give credit where credit is due. Don't let the CD titles fool you: both shows were actually held across the river in a sound-enhancing amphitheater in Camden, NJ. That said, this night marginally beats out the second night. For me, its the heavier content of TEN material that pushes this show ahead. Sure, you won't hear Alive on the US leg of the tour due to the European tragedy, but you have solid renditions of Black, Even Flow, Jeremy, Once and Porch to remind you why the band's debut remains so groundbreaking--a decade later. Other highlights: Crazy Mary and Yellow Ledbetter as the finale. One final comment: the first thing I noticed when I played this CD is its superior sound quality over the European bootlegs.

I will recommend this one to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry story","review":"I bought this book because I was interested to read a story set in modern Shanghai. In this respect I was not disappointed. The Red Thread does provide some interesting and evocative descriptions of the city and its surrounds. However, as a love story it is impossible. The main characters are wooden and superficially developed; in fact, some of the minor characters are more interesting. The technique of telling the story in parallell with the story of the old manuscript might have worked, had the old story been more intriguing, and the new one alive with believable passion. As it is, it is as dry as the paper of the old manuscript."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Wood, Bad Manufacturing","review":"It took me 2 hours to build the most simple thing- why? Because the holes were drilled on the wrong side of the bottom part of the headboard. I had to borrow my neighbors drill to avoid sending the whole thing back to the manufacturer. After drilling the holes, the headboard pieces almost fit right but it was good enough to build. The bed is sturdy and great. Should only take 30 minutes to build, make sure the holes are drilled on the backside of the bottom headboard crossbar, not on the same side as where the mid-bar goes into.

I noticed that other reviewers seem to prefer one over the other and that's fine. Remember though, that without one or the other they wouldn't have been ABBA to begin with.

This is a book for a noble cause...popularizing important ideas in difficult areas of human thought. However, Goldstein does not have what it takes to maintain a coherent narrative over 200-odd pages. The book is fragmented and, worse, Goldstein comes across as a woman trying to impress.I powered through the book in search of references and bits of concentrated useful information (which exists). The experience, however, was distinctly unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"In its account of logical matters, and matters pertaining to the history of logic, the book is sadly deficient. The psychologizing about Gödel and Einstein, and the generally romantic approach of the book, is something that a reader may or may not appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story heavily obscured by author's style","review":"The author, Rebecca Goldstein, appears to be one of those authors who feels it necessary to use obscure words, phrasing, and technical language to impress her readers. Although I am a well-read professional person, I found it necessary to refer to my dictionary far more than I ever have before, to the point that it was difficult to maintain a smooth flow of understanding. I was struck not only by the topical tangents used to fill space, but by the incredible overuse of fabricated terminology, much of it based on the prefix \\"meta-\\".Unfortunately the book's style obscures the story of Godel and his theorems. Perhaps time will heal my wounds and I'll be able to find a more coherent, lucid treatment of this mathematical icon's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this review: don't buy this book!","review":"I bought this book in the naive supposition that it explains incompleteness theory. It does not. It is a mix of some Gödel biography and a lot of philosophy. Philosophy not about Gödel only. If you like philosopy, OK. But from this book you will learn no formula, no math, no explanation of any scientific value of incompleteness theory. This book is a dud. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Boring As It Gets","review":"This book doesn't get any more boring. Its pointless, difficult to follow, and too historical. Rather than accounting the actual discoveries, theorems, and mathematics of Kurt Godel, this book goes into great detail about the philisophical and historical aspects surrounding the genius and his times, as well as his contemporaries. Nonetheless, it is extremely dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"little light on the subject","review":"I was dissapointed that the book was a soap opera covering of Godel's life. The book delt with Godel's and others ego trips and people preferences not the subject of his life. There was no light on the subject of the incompleteness theory or its impact. This book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than accurate, incomplete to say the least","review":"Goldstein is a good writer, and her novels are recommended. She is also a philosopher. However, bringing her novelistic talents to bear on on this arcane topic does not lead to an accurate portrayal of Godel's motivations. Likewise the philosophical implications of these famous theorems are not nearly as well-established as the \\"good story\\" implies. For the review of the book in the London Times by a working expert in mathematical logic, history, and philosophy, see Solomon Feferman's review. All of the talk about the limits of rationality might be beside the point, as other reviewers have pointed out.Feferman concludes his review with these words: \\"Those who are fascinated by Gödel's theorems--and the general idea of limits to what we can know--may still hunger for a more universal view of their possible significance. But they should not be satisfied with Goldstein's \`vast and messy' goulash, hers is not a recipe for true understanding.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Both technically and philosophically confused.","review":"As a student of logic and the philosophy of mathematics I found this book seriously confusing. The book contains a number of technical, biographical and philosophical errors. Interested students should try and get hold of reviews of \\"Incompleteness\\" by Sol Feferman and Juilette Kennedy, logicians who explain the book's flaws better than I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle introduction to Godel","review":"This book sets out to understand the incompleteness theorem through Godel's nature and intellectual relationships. In doing so, we get some excellent philosophical insights situating Godel's theorem with Einstein's relativity theory, Hilbert's formalism, Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and Turing's decidability theorems. The proof itself takes one chapter midway through the book. It's a general self-contained introduction that just gives a concise overview. The last chapter is pretty light and concerns the times of Godel in Princeton. Overall, this book is quite a tour de force to tie up all the loose ends to understand this very important theorem."},{"rating":"2","title":"great homeschool resource","review":"I got this book for our homeschool.

A superb character.In fact, all Sandford's characters are real people with many sides, some not so admirable. You know, like real people.Great series. Great writing. Great wit and down to earth grittiness without all of today's PC BS.I still love DeMille. No one tells a story like he does. BUT, I think Davenport is the best character I've run across.

It's fast and furious !!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Prey","review":"Mind Prey like most of the John Sandford stories are suspenseful and it keeps you wondering what he will come up with next. The search for the family keeps you rivited. It shows you the twists and turns of Chief Davenport and his team in their efforts to save people in the hunt for various freaks. I look forward to the Davenport stories. I am currently purchasing Kindle versions to go with my hardcovers for sometime they never are returned when loaned out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and quick read","review":"I've read most of the Prey series and have been going back looking for ones I'd missed for one reason or another. I found this one and even knowing how it ends many years later didn't change how enjoyable it was.This is one of my favorite villains so far - intelligent and crazy in a slightly more understandable way. While he was crazy and violent you saw a different sort of potential for non-crazy than you normally do. There was something there that made you feel like he could've gone either way.I thought the second villain was far too obvious and not all that interesting even though that was the actual \\"mystery\\"... in so far as the villain is usually known to the reader so we can watch his/her mind work... here one was kept hidden but it was so obvious which one it was it sort of didn't matter to the story.All in all you could pick this up in the middle or as your first Prey book and enjoy it thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK","review":"The writer made no attempt to hide the fact that he never ever talked with Metallica people. The book is entirely based on quotes from the band's member on rock magazines, fanzines and MTV interviews. He did a good job linking this interviews, nothing more than that. He also made a ridiculous short introduction to rock scenario at the time of Metallica's beginning. The overall result is a weird kind biography, even knowing that is unauthorized. He has a good writing style, no doubt about that. But all the facts are well known (of ourse, theyu were taken from magazines! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS NO GREAT DEPTH HERE !","review":"I'm a huge Metallica fan, so I bought this book hoping to read a great unauthorized biography.

Poorly written and Crocker's use of switching word spellings to coincide with Metallica songs was nauseating to say the least. The layout is especially hideous (who thought two black vertical borders was a good idea?). The following day I returned it.If you want a good book about Metallica look no further than Joel McIver's 'Justice For All: The Truth About Metallica'. Funnily enough one of the metontour videos showed a confused Lars signing a copy for a fan.I would have given it a 1/2 star if amazon.com would let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say cliche?","review":"If you remove all of the insipid cliches from this book you would be left with about 2 pages of text.

I've owned and used mine for nearly a full year now, and I've got to say that it is an enormous waste of time and patience. It's hard to assemble, harder to clean out and maintain, it's construction is cheap and it twists and contorts with the slightest movement, and it is incapable of holding temperature. Today was the last straw. The first cook of the year and a gorgeous cut of meat will end up in either the oven or the garbage because this monstrosity can't get up to a little as 150 degrees without constant stoking and stroking. When I bought it, I wasn't told to also order the full-time babysitter required to keep the coals from going cold every half hour.

I didn't attach the front holder because I didn't think I'd need it. I tried it out this past weekend and I must admit that I'm hooked. This thing handled a large pork shoulder and 2 large racks of pork spareribs with plenty of room to spare.The only problem I had was keeping the temperature past 200 degrees for an extended period of time. I was using lump charcoal exclusively in the side fire box. I don't know if that was the problem or not. I ended up having to finish the shoulder in the oven for a couple of hours but it was well worth the wait. Next time, I guess I'll just keep heaping the charcoal on throughout the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"the grillenator","review":"This thing is the bomb. The recent improvements over their earlier models add even more to this smokin pro. The folks involved in the manufacturing of this char-griller should be commended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Amazon","review":"While I'm sure the actual product performs just fine, the product that I received in the mail was a used product that had been poorly packaged and arrived in damaged condition. Despite the claim that Amazon placed on the site that it was NEW, the body of the smoker had food grease staining the inside and, when assembled, the top of the body was dented so nothing fit together properly (which is one of the most important things to have in a smoker!) There was also a huge and deep scratch on the front of the side fire box.The most disappointing thing about the entire process is that when I called Amazon to complain, the only thing they could give me was a 15% discount. The box that the smoker came in was barely holding together as it was, and so it would be almost impossible to ship it back in the same box. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When the product arrived the box was badly damaged and so was the grill. The lid did not align properly and we had to bang it with a hammer in several places to get it close. The Char-Griller symbol was missing for the lid. The paint cracked off the top of the smoker attachment the first time we used it. Definetly looked like someone had returned this grill and they didn't inspect the product before shipping it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I replaced a large Weber grill and now I'm going back. I prefer indirect cooking. This may be fine for direct.With the attached firebox, the grill consumes an immense amount of fuel. Buy your wood by the cord. The heat is very uneven, much hotter near the firebox than away from it. You have to move meat several times to cook evenly. I did try the fire bricks but this only helped marginally.The grill itself is rusting badly and I live in the desert where most metal does not rust. The grill leaks a lot of air, and I suspect that is why you need so much fuel to maintain a reasonable temperature. I bought on the basis of the reviews here, and I really do not understand the generally positive feelings about this grill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"It is sad to say but the days of a solid American made product is dead! The smokers made by Char Griller boast that they are American made, and covered by a warranty...then in the small print it says 'the paint may peel off your smoker upon first use (it should say WILL peel off upon first use!), the paint is not covered by the warranty.' if you are unfortunate enough to own one of these then you know what I am talking about, both my grill and side smoker are all but devoid of paint. I called Char Griller and told them that I was appalled by their underhandedness, they didn't seem to care. well the best (or worst) advertising is word of mouth. and I have nothing good to say about this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Multitasker, just missing a reliable thermometer","review":"I've been using this model for three years now, and I've really enjoyed using it as both a grill and a smoker. The large surface, cast iron grates, easy adjustment and the ability to grill over the small surface in the smoke chamber make this a very good investment. I did replace the included thermometer with an Old Smokey after overcooking ribs that were supposed to be slow-cooked (the included thermometer was terribly cleap/low quality and read about 100 off.) I would reccomend that step to anyone. As I grill year round in the midwest, I've taken the time every spring and fall to brush the rust and coorosion off of the outside and touch-up with some high-heat paint, but I don't consider it a design flaw - my grill sees all four seasons, and the high-guage steel still has plenty of integrity to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product packaging is insufficient... cannot get one undamaged","review":"truthfully cannot rate product becuase I have never been able to receive product undamage. As a result I have never had a chance to assemble and cook. Packaging is insufficient for weight of product so every order I have made (a few) it always ends up damaged during shipping process. Then it just becomes another job to send back, get new one, send back..... I am ready to cook, not manage returns... I would not order until they develope a solution to shipping issue because I think there is very small likelyhood of receiving undamaged (UPS delivery guys agress). Too bad because I had high hopes for this unit. My mother found a smaller version at a local store and I have enjoyed cooking with it. My guess is that this company makes good products and hope to some day try out the BBQ with a side fire box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality and it RUSTS","review":"We received this as a gift and already it is starting to RUST out in the bottom. It grills ok but don't count on having this grill for long due to the rust issue. It is a lot of money to put into a grill to have this happen. Luckily we didn't pay for it.

I purchased my Stiletto and Car Kit from Circuit City. I had them install it. They direct wired the Car Kit to my 2002 Subraru. After I got the car home - a three hour drive, the next day the Car Kit would not power on. Then in the afternoon it would power up. Then in the morning would not power up. It had a mind of its own. It seems that the kit only powers up when the interior of the car is warm? Not a good thing for Colorado.I called Sirius to no avail. - Take it back to Circuit City thay said. I ask them if I could have them ship me a cig lighter adaptor - no - have to buy a new car kit to get that.Called Circut City - The problem is they of course have to see it. I wanted to see if I could resolve this issue w/o driving back up to Denver just for that. No Luck - The best advise I got from both Circuit City and Sirius was to buy another Car Kit and have some one local install it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy unless you will connect it though the audio output","review":"I recently purchased the car kit (as the Stiletto does not have an FM transmitter). The FM transmitter works, but not well. The signal it emits is not strong at all, and as a result, you can barely hear Siruis from my car stereo (irrespective of what channel you select). The problem is not acquiring the signal from the satellite to the Stiletto (that is very good); the problem is the car kit emitting the single to the car stereo. I assume, but have not yet tried, that connecting the car kit via the audio output will solve this problem, but if you intend to use the car kit without an audio output line, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It will result in nothing more than frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need FM direct adapter","review":"Yes it does allow you to listen to your stilleto in your vehicle, however, you still need to purchase the FM direct adapter separately. The FM transmitter it comes with is useless. They need to repackage it so it comes with the direct adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better attachment method:","review":"---I was disappointed that the only attachment method was a large circular \\"sticky back'--it severely limited where it could be placed and did not hold up to the sun on the dashboard. It is already falling off only a few weeks after the initial setup--at least if there was a suction cup, I could try reattaching--my stiletto looks like it will be falling off the dashboard within the week, and at this point I need to find a glue that will not damage my dashboard or try to duct-tape it on temporarily, which will probably permanently mar my dashboard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you drive something smaller than a minivan, don't bother.","review":"I am generally unsatisfied with the Sirius Stiletto, but especially with the car kit. I drive a Buick Century, a good, solid mid-sized car, and the car adapter is so big and bulky that I can't use it. In a Buick Century. We are not talking about a tiny Nissan or Kia. We are talikng about a Buick! The adhesive for the dashboard mount is too weak to support the weight of the unit with the radio. I LOVE Sirius radio, I may eventually pay to have the internal satellite antenna put into my car. But the Stiletto is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad connection","review":"I purchased the Stilleto 2 and the vehicle docking kit thru Amazon. I hooked up the docking kit in my truck without any problems, but when I went to put the radio in the docking unit, it didn't fit. Seems that the connectors don't line up. I called Sirius and they said I had to contact where I bought it (Amazon). It fit without the battery and backing, but didn't line up when it was completely together, so I ground down some of the case to get things to line up. It now works properly, but when you spend this amount of money for a product it should work properly and Sirius should handle problems with their products. I'll never buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Necessity","review":"A must have for this unit. My #4 key sticks a little, but it's a necessity I can deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"I purchased this item and once I attempted to use it the quality was horrible.

I wouldn't recomend waisting the time and money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really frustrated with Sirius","review":"To be fair to the product. There is nothing wrong with the docking kit. I'm 'reviewing' it because I thought everyone out there who owns a Sirius 10 or 100, or are thinking of purchasing one, should know that the vehicle kit is no longer being made and that the home docking station has become almost impossible to find for a 'fair' price. I wrote Sirius and their responses to my complaint regarding their lack of accessory support for the model 10 or 100 were laughable. Buyers of these two radios beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and useless","review":"Like the other reviewers, the FM transmitter isn't strong enough so I have static on every channel I try to use. It's like the old days of radio...if I hold the thing in my hand it's fine...if I set it down it's full of static. I know I don't have a bad one because I bought a second and it does exactly the same thing.

Some of the other tapes and CD's leave a lot to be desired in the quality of the recording. This is easy to understand as many were recorded 40 or more years ago. However, this CD is digitally remastered and is as clear as if they were on stage in front of you. The only drawback to this CD is that it only has 8 songs.

It's a great workout and I love doing it...Now I rated this DVD as a 4 star and not a 5 star for a couple of reasons:1. during the intro there was some weird colour affect thing going on, thank god it didn't last the whole DVD.. at first I thought there was something wrong with the colour setting of my TV2. the production value didn't seem as high as some of their other DVD here why: at the beginning in the first exercise segment Ana is wearing this pink \\"speedo\\" shirt and white shorts and it really looks like she's standing in front of a green screen.3. the music is good but! it often time was too loud compared to the voice cues, and for those of you who know the previous DVD you know they always set the music to match the pace of each exercise but that is not the case here.But overall it's good and those are all thing I can look passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG AMAZING!","review":"I did this again today and I feel awesome! The Body Bliss set is so amazing I think I am becoming addicted to it! It gets me in the zone big time!!! I really break a sweat (nothing like a good yoga sweat!). It feels tough, then it feels like I can go on forever, then its tough again, and then effortless, than tough then - another breakthrough and bliss! It's bringing out my inner athlete lol! Full cardio session on the floor! Why didn't anyone ever think of this before! Thank you Ravi and Ana for bringing one of the lesser known but very amzing Kundalini Yoga sets to us! As someone said in one of the reviews below (or somewhere else), there are so many valuable Kundalini Yoga sets that you could literally do a different one every day for at least a year and never repeat and all lead to the same place - BLISS - by a different route!I have been doing Ana & Ravis DVDs for some time now.

I just finished doing this dvd and I absolutely loved it!I was looking for something challenging, true to Kundalini yoga, with good fun and engaging sequences and meditation, etc. and this is it!The Body Bliss Segment is a fun Kriya that is also delightfully challenging! I mean, power to you if you make it through the whole way the first few times! You may have to stop and start and Ana & Ravi give you that concession if necessary, of course all the while they are encouraging you to do your best. This set actually gives you a great cardio workout even though you are on the floor the whole time - talk about no-impact aerobics - genius! This set is to \\"Master your Domain\\" or, to make life suck less. Whatever! It works and it feels great! I loved every challenging minute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't know if it's me or the DVD but I'm definitely having a hard time getting into this one. The poses don't flow naturally for me and I don't enjoy the music. I LOVED Ravi and Ana's Solar Power, Transformer, and Meditation DVDs'; Body Electric and Boot Camp aren't giving the same immediate feelings of breakthrough. On the other hand, maybe they are making me work through some major negativity blocks. I will try them a couple more times, and if this changes I will update this review; otherwise I think I will put them to rest and go back to the older DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Addiction!","review":"This DVD is the perfect yoga session for me. I also love the way that the first part (after warm-ups) entails holding poses with deep breathing. Great for strength building. Works all muscle groups. Then there is a great ab sequence and an ingenious cardio sequence done on your hands and knees. The music is amazing. I love the mantra which Ana sings. It stays in my head all day and keeps me in a good mood. There is so much amazing material on this new one. It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed and well documented","review":"Virginia has done a superb job of exposing the disturbing well orchestrated attack as part of an anti-communist plot that very likely did not exist and only played on stirring up hysteria. Polititions could take a lesson from reading the history. If their goal is to provide integrity, then this will be a lesson of what can happen. Unfortunately, most politicians have no such goal but rather are in the game for themselves, which is a horrible shame.Virginia clearly depicts what can happen when politicians engage in a program to stir up hostility using a post of responsibility to benefit themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"1) disects issue into multiple parts2) goes through background of issues3) goes through a comparison"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly down-to-earth, but also aristocratic","review":"Christa Ludwig is inarguably one of the greatest singers and musicians of this or any time. A mezzo-soprano who also made at least one classic recording of a great soprano role (Beethoven's Leonora in FIDELIO), Mme. Ludwig was, in addition, a probing and insightful recital and concert artist. Mme. Ludwig's memoir, expertly translated by Regina Domeraski, reveals a deeply committed artist who is also a human being who has lived a full life, and has no reservations when it comes to talking about either. If you have read any of Mme. Ludwigs's numerous interviews, you will know that she is a frank, uninhibited, witty and no-nonsense person. She is as comfortable talking about Harry Belafonte in Carmen Jones as she is talking about Schubert and Brahms lieder. Very few autobiographies by celebrated opera singers tell you as much about their subject as this one does. If you've read this far, you'll want to have it. Trust me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for Non-Sociology Majors","review":"I have Jennifer Friedman as my professor this semester, and she talks just how she writes in her book.

Titanic and focuses on the efforts of Senator William Alden Smith (R-Mich.), who chaired the investigative subcommittee. The book describes the thoroughness and determination of Senator Smith as he conducted the investigation and goes to great lengths to demonstrate that the United States investigation was equal to or better than the one conducted in the United Kingdom.The major flaw in the book is its attempt to do double duty as a biography of Senator Smith. The book also contains minor factual errors that could have been weeded out by more careful proof-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIND THE ORIGINAL","review":"Editing continues to take Joel's original works and change them unnecessarily.

Of course, nobody can ever solve their problems HERE. They gotta go to the other side of the planet.Oh wait. Eddings already wrote this story. Its called the Belgariad. Oh, and the Mallorean, there was an original.Ok sarcasm aside... the series did introduce a new \\"world\\" to Eddings' fans, but unfortunately his characters were so predictably like his old that I was getting a profound sense of deja vu.Sephrenia = Polgara (in all but appearances)Sparhawk = Belgarion/BelgarathFlute = ErrandBelliom = Orb of Aldur (yes, identical even to the blue color).C'mon Mr & Mrs Eddings. Use some imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start for the Elenium series!","review":"As always at the beginning of a longer series, you need time to get to know protagonists and settings.

I've never read a book with such depth in to the characters. The characters seem too real, because I miss every one of them.

I can't get enough, and I truly hope Eddings writes more."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Audiobook Listeners","review":"I suggest that you pass on the audible download and try the written book itself.I enjoyed both the Belgariad and Mallorean series, but the reader of the first book of Elenium uses a method that detracts from the story. Usually professional audiobook readers add to a novel, by the way they interpret the character voices and do vocal adjustments that heighten the mood and keep you enthralled while the story progresses.The reader of the Elenium series uses p-r-e-c-i-s-e enunciation, provides no realistic vocal adjustments to help you keep the characters separate, and has vocal mannerisms that keep intruding into the story. I've listened to many, many audiobooks and like in every other profession, some readers are masters while others fall into the range of good through gosh awful.I'm on the first book of Elenium and it's a chore to keep listening. I might just try reading the book, as I can't really make a fair assessment of the novel itself on the audible version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book, but lacking in action.","review":"This book is a good book, yet lacks the action you would expect.

It had all the characteristics I would expect of a good fantasy novel. The characters were well realised and easily related to. The dialogue is natural, and the plot is excellent. The one problem I had was the fact that the author continually kept referring to previous events without allowing the reader to understand what has happened, but other than that, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappionting bore","review":"As an avid reader of fantasy I must say I was very disappointed by this book. The characters are pathetically shallow and the dialogue is extremely trite. You could read the first and last chapters, skip the middle and not miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here....","review":"Although David Eddings has written some great books, this trilogy is definitely not among them.I am more than a little disappointed with David Eddings. It seems to me that after developing a certain style for instance in the Belgariad series, he is now trying to sell the same story again, and again, and again... All who has read a number of fantasy books (and especially Eddings') are familiar with the plot here. A great evil god is threatening the world, and a great warrior, a thief, some magic deity or other gathers together to thwart the evil plans. I recognised a lot of the Belgariad in this trilogy, and I think its about time David Eddings came up with something new.By all means, if you loved the Belgariad, and don't mind reading something wery similar, you probably will enjoy this. But if you're looking for a creative addition to the fantasy genre, you're gonna be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CANNOT READ ANY FURTHER","review":"i've read this series all the way up to Domes of Fire... and i just want to say that the characters and plot get very, very boring! although the characters are very unlike the ones from the Belgarion and Mallorean series' they just seem like they become more and more oppisate... for example Ce'Nedra and Queen Ehlana are just oppisates from each other, and you can see that in EVERY thing they do! but in addition to that, it would like to say this would be a good series if you don't read the other works by david eddings....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edding's Diamond Throne alltogether uninspiring","review":"David Eddings, you've disappointed. The Diamond Throne has all the feel of an author pounding out a book just for the sake of pounding out a book. It's slow-moving, more than a hair cliche, and just plain dull.But the worst thing about The Diamond Throne is its selfish ending. Anyone who suffers through this drab plot deserves a conclusion. It's one thing to write a trilogy. But each book should be a book. Each book should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Eddings gives us a beginning and way too much middle. Nothing close to an end though.Undriven and lacking imagination. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree","review":"Unfortunately I cannot share the common appraising view of thisseries for several reasons. Firstly though I have to say that I Liked the humorous touch and can understand the point of view that this trilogy is not intended to be taken totally seriously. Unfortunately this is soured by the monotony of moving from one place to another again and again - after starting the third book every new locale seems to echo the others in the format of walk, fight talk and walk abit more with a few anticlimactic moments thrown in to lengthen the piece. Also the near total lack of character development leaves the reader feeling slightly ripped off at the end of the piece- this is what annoyed me most about this book, it contains minimum emotional involvement, a tired plot(magic gems and evil gods sound familiar to anybody out there?), and it gives the reader the impression of having wasted their time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and banal","review":"This book was a major disappointment. The characters lack depth and the plot is very simplistic and rather disjoint. For example, the major character just happens to overhear the villians detail a neferious plot. Not at all comperable to the BelGariad series(which was excellent). I gave up reading after suffering thru most of this book. The characters are excellent but there is little character development. And the so called plot is extremely childish. This book is more suitable for a 13-14 year old.If your a big fan of the Eddings, then get this series thru the library. If definitely isn't worth you bookshelf space."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why u do not begin a new series while writing anothe","review":"There was absolutely no point in even writing this book. The reader gains no information except that the queens sick and who the characters are, which could easily be dealt with as a backgroud in another book. The one star I gave it goes to the exceptional prologue, which is the only thing that did not make me throw the book. Pointless, absolutely pointless. Over 400 pages of pointlessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddings is an awesome writer!","review":"I've read and collected these books in hardback and paperback. Of all the different author's works I've read, Eddings is one I will always buy. His stories are incredible and his characters easy to imagine. Well written, exciting, even humorous. David Eddings is to fantasy what Shakespeare was to theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read, but lacking in substance","review":"If you're going to a family reunion or on a long plane trip, the Elenium is for you. It's a fun series, but beyond that not much more.

Not profound or unforgettable, but definetly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"David Eddings has written a great series. I have never been so captivated.

Take all the ideas from the Belgariad, mix them around, and presto...this book and series. Take a bunch of characters and send them running all over a map. Very new idea.And this first book is all scene setting...from the prologue it was clear we were after this wondrous jewel...it took a whole book to get to this point.Sparhawk has been described as a great character by some people - his temperament is identical to Belgarath - a grumpy old man.The only action from this awesome hero is against weak opposition, and poorly described. Conversation between the characters is repetitive and tiring from the constant sniping...There are many examples of fantasy out there. Don't waste your time on an author with no new thoughts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Overview of a Complex Topic","review":"Mr. Brady's book is a laudable approach to a subject that has been rarely documented. For a new public sector property manager it provides an overview of lifecycle activities, but little explanation or depth of discussion on any topic. For example, physical inventories are covered in a little over 4 pages and reporting and performance measurements are glossed over.The National Property Management Association (NPMA) published a book in 1999 called The Standard Property Book that provides much more information about the life cycle of property management. It is not limited to the public sector, but genericly is appropriate for anyone who manages personal property.

I sent it back the way I got it. And it was well within 30 days if not 15 days from the day I purchased it. Amazon has done nothing to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fold-N-Go","review":"It's a great desk for saving space. Great invention! I love it. Though, I've got mine with a broken piece of plastic that has the V shape hold the side up so it wouldn't wabble. They let me exchange for a new one. I'm getting another for my store, because it's so easy to fold up and put away when I need a space to do something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"very convenient, slightly small","review":"I like this desk a lot. The only drawback that I had was that it was slightly small. I'm not that tall (5'11\\"), but still I wound up getting a shorter chair to go with the desk. It's worked out very well and I guess that the height is a trade off that I was willing to to make for convenience and saving space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Badly Damaged","review":"I can't review this item and tell you how comfortable it was to work at, how easily it fit into the small space it was intended for, or advise you as to how conveniently it folded and unfolded as needed. I can't do this because it arrived BROKEN...a complete disaster...a hot mess!!. I don't mean a missing screw hear or there...2 of the 3 shelves were not connected to the unit. There as a \\"bite\\" taken out of one side of it, it was so broken that I was unable to even open it up to sample how it would look in my house. I'm very disappointed.

When we took it out of the box and turned it on and pressed its hand, all it does is say over and over \\"can you help Elmo up please.\\" It doesn't do anything it's supposed to. My daughter was very disappointed, and the store won't let us take it back since it's already opened, so now I'm stuck with this toy that doesn't work, and I'm afraid to buy another one for fear it might do the same thing. It was a very bad buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATCH OUT FOR THE LIMBO STICK!!!","review":"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday. The next day she was playing with the limbo stick...each end pulls out from it. When she shut the stick, it shut quickly and pinched her leg in it. I really had to work to get it open to free her leg. She has a good size spot and bruise. The doll is fine but, the stick is a hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall over Elmo is a better name","review":"The instructions say to put Elmo on a hard floor to ensure it works, but that doesn't make much of a difference. It falls over and the music doesn't last long enough. I liked the Rock'n Roll Elmo best because he had a guitar and played music while rockin'. That was more entertaining for this age group. This is more frustrating -- even me, a grown up, is frustrated with this toy. The limbo stick can get lost easily in the piles of toys not attached to anything. Too much effort between Elmo and the stick. Chicken Dance or Hokey Pokey Elmo look like better choices, but I have not tried them."},{"rating":"2","title":"my one year old tiwn boys love him!","review":"My one year old twin boys love him- but only for about a minute. he sings the limbo song, and then they go over and knock him down, because when you do, Elmo says, \\"OOPS!! elmo limbo'ed too far- can you help him up please?\\" and then when you pick him up, he says, \\"THANK YOU!!\\" Too cute! the limbo stick is useless, but they now know who elmo is and when he comes on the tv screen, they go nuts! Plus, he teaches them that when you help someone, you say thank you.very cute toy. I would buy chicken dance elmo if it's as cute. All that really matters is that he makes my boys laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm torn","review":"On the one hand, this book is an undisputed page turner, and I couldn't wait to finish it. On the other hand, I didn't like the characters. I can't honestly say that I liked this book, but Dickey does a good job of developing his characters. My problem with this book is that these women are a little too over the top. Even meek and mild Valerie somehow morphs into a character you might expect to see on The Jerry Springer Show.The 3 perspective scheme of this book (Valerie, Chiquita, Inda) didn't work for me at all. I also had a hard time accepting the relationship between Inda and Chiquita.I think the book overall could have used more depth. By trying to detail the lives of all three women, I don't think the writer did justice to any of them. This is a promising first effort though, and I'd be willing to read another of Dickey's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUUNNNNNYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Excellent read. Please bring Inda's character back she is so real and so funny!!!! Her character had me hysterically laughing on the subway and anywhere else I read it. The book as a whole is so (like the other books) so realistic & funny and a great read. It was hard to put down! I'm going out today to buy Milk in My Coffee and can't wait 'til Cheaters is on sale. Eric is awesome! It amazes me the way he captures a woman's inner thoughts, feelings and emotions so well!

Dickey stepped on the scene, and has made quite a name for himself. His first entry into the world of literature is funny, concise, and thoroughly entertaining. Dickey writes about issues everyone can relate to - lost loves, jilted lovers, and sadistic acts of revenge (or at least the thoughts of).This book is easy to read with everyday dialogue. The story enthralls you with the first chapter and you are compelled to read until you get to the last page. Trust me, I stayed up until 2 in the morning just to finish this one.If you don't have it, add it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister, Sister","review":"I thought that the book Sister,Sister was a very good book.

GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey truly has a gift. These women felt like my personal friends a few pages into the book, and it's one of my favorites. I loved this book, and have loved every other book I've read from him. He's an excellent writer, and those who have not read him, should! You honestly do not know what you are missing. I'm making all my friends true fans like me... try it. You'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, good interpretation of relationships in the 90's.","review":"This book told a very real view of how men and women interact in today's society. How women get caught up in the thought of a good relationship and never see beyond the good points and some men take advantage of that fact. This book also address the issue of relationships when they fall apart and how each individual sees the end very differently. I recommend this book to all my brothers and sisters out there because each gender has been in all of the characters shoes. But especially to my sisters, I think this book can make them see themselves more clearly. Reading this book I think the reader can place themselves in the character's shoes and sympathize with their actions throughout the book. Well done!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This is one of the best books I've read. This book made me laugh out loud and and cry way down deep. I couldn't put it down and was saddened when it finished I wanted it to keep going. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever had men trouble, sibling headaches and good hearted friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's My 2 Cents.","review":"I really liked this book. My only complaint was that, when I read a book written by a male author, I like to hear the author gives a male's perspective in the male characters, this was not present in this book. We as the readers only went into the minds of the females and not the males. I am currently reading \\"Friends and Lovers\\" and it seems as if my wish was granted, because the book starts out with the male twin's character speaking. I'll tell you how it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening!!!","review":"This was the first novel I read written by Mr. Dickey. I must say that I wasn't disappointed. The characters in this novel were indeed lifelike. I couldn't believe the way the men treated these women. Especially that Raymond brother!! I bet you he was a Pisces!!! The women in this book were so needy and unhappy it was awful. However, the plot kept me interested all the way until the end. I felt like I was reading a supense novel, I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Overall, Mr. Dickey did a superb job and I can't wait to snatch up a copy of Friends and Lovers. Keep up the good work, or should I say YOU GO BOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellenttttt, this book was hard to put down at night.","review":"This book kept me awake, it was hard to put down and do something else. It was written very well. Some parts were emotional this book had me in tears and no other book has ever done that to me before. I loved it and will purchase a copy for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What a waste of time. I thought that this book was going to be good. It had its good parts but turned out to be a flop. Im sorry Jerome I only finished the book because I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, Silly, Silly","review":"This book started off OK, but took a turn for the worse and got very silly and unrealistic when one of the female characters climbs a building to get on a balcony, goes into the already opened balcony door, pulls out her gun, and catches her husband with another woman. Then with the gun still out, she asks for something to eat. She then just leaves the apartment while eating.Some people think this is funny, but I think it is plain silly and a waste of my time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"A tale well written and fun to read.

I thought the characters were well developed and the story flowed to me. Decent plot. Funny, easy, and light. Loved the different points of views used for different characters. Read like it came from inside a woman's head. For me, it was an engaging pageturner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Book for Sisters Everywhere","review":"This book was so funny and very true to life. Eric Jerome Dickey does it again with this one. It has real like situations with decisions that a lot of us Sisters have made. This time, he shows what those decisions look like from the outside. I became so engrossed in this book that I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down! It had a lot of flavor and it's very easy to relate to. You can see yourself or someone you know in all of the characters. A wonderful book for a teen or a young woman who may need to see how their choices affect others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"This book started off slow so the first time i started to read it I put it down. After a few months and nothing else to read, I decided to try again. I'm glad i did becuse it turned out to be a really good book. I love the way EJD bring back characters from his other books and how the three main characters' lives in this book tie together."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE'S NO ONE ELSE LIKE ERIC JEROME DICKEY","review":"While reading the book \\"Sister, Sister\\" it was like reading about the life of someone I knew. I laughed, gasped, and found myself turning page after page to see what happened next. \\"Sister, Sister\\" to me is a classic. And Dickey's ability to flesh out his characters, and his imaginative and creative flair, makes him a standout novelist. Contrary to popular belief, he is NOT the male Terry McMillan; he is ERIC JEROME DICKEY period."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a good read","review":"I really liked this book. It showed the ups and downs of three women and their relationships to one another, friends, and family. When Valerie finally stood up to her man I was proud of her even though she went a little psycho for a second there. Um but I kinda lost her after that. I couldnt' really understand what kind of relationship she had with Daniel. Inda, I really liked her. She reminded me of so many women I know. Chiquita was cool. She pissed me off for a second but she was back right after a while. Over all it was a great read. And for once EJD didn't give you detail after detail about the interworkings of the LA highway system. Thanks EJD. I really appreciated that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Im hooked","review":"This is my first time reading a novel by E.J.D. And i thought it was great. I read it in about 2 and a half weeks, which is pretty fast considering all my school work. Anyway, I most enjoyed the individuality of each character. They were their own but blended well to make the story unfold. On of my favorite parts was Black's crazy rampage. It reminded me of Madea, a character from Tyler Perry's plays. Overall i enjoyed reading this. I told one of my best girlfriends about it, she read it and loved it as well. So pretty much now were both hooked and just bought Cheaters, so when in finished I'll be back for more"},{"rating":"2","title":"once again, EJD is off the chains","review":"i read this book so many times the words fell off the pages. He is so good at writing in the felmae voice, better than most females! now is there really an EJD or is this come sort of hoax?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a waste of money!!!!!!!","review":"I have read a significant amount of novels in my life and I was compelled to show certain passages to my close friends. It was truly some of the most trite, and condescending written work ever published about Black Women. As a black women, I am astonished that this book is so completely devoid of any insight into today's black women. The characters in the book behave nothing like real women but more like a collection of black exploitation film characters that made there way to the printed page. This book is so stupid that I must alert all other AMAZON readers to save their money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad to the Bone","review":"This book inspired me to read more books by Black authors. Eric Jerome Dickey knows how to bring a story to life. Excellent choice to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book! I couldn't put it down!","review":"I've been trying to read Eric Jerome Dickey's books for sometime and just started last month. It took me a week to read and that was because I had to make myself put it down so I could go to work and do other things that needed to be done. The characters were very real and I laughed a lot. I started \\"Friends and Lovers\\" as soon as I finished \\"Sister, Sister\\" and I loved every bit of it too. I'm an Eric Jerome Dickey fan now and I hate that it took me so long. Good work Eric!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book to pass on!!!","review":"I picked up this book, Sister Sister, based on the title and the curiosity of it having a male writer. I was so engulfed in the book that I read it in one day. I was so thrilled with the book that I felt it would only be right to pass it on! After passing on this wonderful book, I felt bad because I wanted to keep it for myself. Only to realize that Sister Sister must be so wanted that I had to be put on a waiting list in the stores. Your work speaks for yourself. You are an excellent writer. Can you conduct a seminar for black men and teach them how to truly be a man and how to treat a woman right?

The main reason that I find Robards books to be so intriguing is the chemistry and love hate relationships that develop between the two main characters. And Ghost Moon is simply not it. The entire novel seems to just go on and on without ever really going anywhere. The supernatural usage is getting old. The \\"Bad Guy\\" is just TOO bad. It seems as though Robards is just trying to incorporate too many ideas into one book and it just doesn't work. What a sheer disappointment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"This book was packed with suspense and plenty of it. The romance between the two characters sizzled. Olivia goes home after leaving nine years before. She had a heated battle with her cousin and her Uncle about leaving home to elope with a roaming cowboy. She and her daughter are invited by her \\"Aunt Callie\\". \\"Aunt Callie\\" has cancer and wants to get her unfinished business in order. Seth, Olivia's \\"cousin\\" by marriage and Olivia have strong feelings for one another that were pushed aside until now. The couple remain forever in my heart and the book goes on my Keeper Shelf. The only reason I gave this book 4.5 stars instead of the five is because of the suspense portion of the novel. It was a tad too grusome for my tastes. The end did suprise me. The chemistry between Seth and Oliva was fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISTURBING","review":"This is a bad read. I am usually a great fan of Robards but lately, her books have taken a sick turn. They all seem to revolve around men preying on little girls, which leaves me wondering what has been going on in Robards life. I don't understand this new trend of romance writers writing contemporary pseudo-romances that focus a little too much on gruesome crimes against women/little girls. Don't read this book. I am all for romance and mystery but draw the line at supporting books (and movies) who's main focus is brutalizing women."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! I loved it, beginning to end.","review":"This is the first book by Karen Robards that I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it beginning to end. The sleeve synopsis didn't do \\"Ghost Moon\\" justice; there was mystery, romance, supsense, and it envoked every emotion while reading. Little did I know, I would get a whole lot more than I was expecting. When I finished the book, I wanted to flip back and start reading from page one. Karen Robards shocked and terrified me, her descriptive of the killers simple manner carried the suspense to the shocking bitter end. The relationship between Olivia and Seth, her \\"cousin\\" by marriage, was definitely memorable. Sheer entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"Not up to Ms. Robards usual quality. I found the characters superficial and the descriptions of the serial killers antics not really frightening. And there was no real connection or explanation as to how he got away with his murders for so long.Sorry to write such a downer when everyone else's comment were so glowing, but there just wasn't enough depth to the characters to make me really care about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book i ever read","review":"This book Ghost moon was the best book i ever read in my entire life and i have read alot of books.

It would have been a good romance without it, enough conflict and people to have supported plenty of interesting story. I felt resentful everytime the author switched to one of the stalking scenes and that it was unnecessarily brutal to include them. Does she feel the only way to sell books is to capitalize on sick titillation? Bleh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisly romance","review":"As a blending of romance and suspense it doesn't quite make it. Human taxidermy on little girls is just too gruesome to work in a romance. A relationship between quasi cousins would be ok except that there was more of a sense of adoptive siblings between them which is just a little too close to incest for comfort. I would just as soon not have the villain of this particular profession not that this is particularly unusual. Finally, the relationship between the main characters is neglected in favor of the suspense. While I'm usually a Robards fan, not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time reader of Ms. Robards","review":"This is my first book by this author. I felt that it was fairly easy reading. I thought it was going to be a little scarier than it really was.Her two main characters (Olivia and Seth)and their relationships were very well developed. I liked the idea of them all becoming a family again. I liked the lesson Seth taught his daughter Chloe about how everyone is different and it is not nice to tease others.Her development of the secondary characters was not as well done. In the first 30 pages or so you are introduced to an entire family ( a entire step-family that the main character has no real relation to) by name and then they dont appear to be mentioned again until later. I struggled to remember what the relation was. The poor grandfather remains in a semi-coma state the entire book. I thought that it was annoying that he was mentioned constantly but never had a real converstaion with anyone even at the end after they found out he would recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have read all of Karen Robards books and usually enjoy them. However, this one had a cast of too many characters - it was confusing to keep track of them all. I didn't like the story content or the way it was written. There were so many characters being introduced at first and then nothing more about them, I wondered how they would all be tied into the story.What's with all these \\"romance\\" authors writing murder mysteries now?

Did he survive?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, thoughtful book","review":"If you want a thorough exposition on all of the issues you will need to consider when thinking about Egptian Gods, or God in general, this is an excellent work. Honing is admirable in discussing and critiquing many perspectives, and the last sections of summary are worth it alone. However I sense at times he is a bit sneaky in how he presents evidence so as to favor his views. For example, he excludes pantheism, and never links ntr and nature, both of which are strongly implied by the characteristics of the Egyptin Gods and Goddesses. Nonetheless the points he does make are strong and refreshingly critical- it is clear he has thought more extensively than average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent discussion of Ancient Egyptian religious philosoph","review":"Most of us think of Ancient Egyptian religion as being polytheistic. After meeting a missionary to the Zulus in Africa who wrote a PhD thesis on their religion proving that the Zulu had 20 names for God, but only one God, I was not surprised to find a similar study done on Ancient Egyptian religion. The work is well documented from original and secondary sources (papyri and their translations), and is a convincing argument that there is really one great mysterious creator God that was known at least to the priests.

I wonder if anyone will question Senator Byrd about this.

Other headphones of inferior quality might be capable of \\"more bass,\\" but the EH2270's bass is punchy and far from muddled. A great asset for the all-around music listener.The $200 price tag seems a bit high, since I paid around $70.

The sound seems to me to be quite neutral from low to high and their efficiency is pretty good so my computer sound card drives them easily to good volumes. I was concerned about this because of the 64ohm load they present but they are better than my old Sennheiser 580s (32ohm but lower sensitivity) in this regard.I was also concerned about their fit since I had read many people found the hd280s to be too tight. However, they fit me well and I wear them for hours at a time while working on my computer. For me, they are a good compromise of performance, comfort, and price. I rate them highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones, but lack value","review":"These headphones are wonderful. They have excellent sound quality and clarity.

There are a ton of fast, loud, hot-licks, no-originality, SRV-clone blues players out there but Kearney is not one of them. His electric slide work is reminiscent of Warren Haynes and he clearly grew up on classic ABB records, but he also mixes in intricate acoustic picking and nimble dobro work and can write a memorable hook. His voice is decent white-boy blues, similar in range and tone to Clapton's but a bit more soulful. To me, the acoustic stuff works the best, and gives a nod to Taj Mahal among others. He duets with a couple more authentic blues singers and does well. The backing band is tasteful and creative with some unusual touches including mandolin and accordion.

They did not disappoint. Their music is a fusion of pop, jazz and country, and they are very accomplished musicians. Furthermore, their recording is outstanding; the details of all the instruments are there and the imaging is first-rate. The only reason I did not give this album 5 stars is that some of the tracks seemed repetitious and in several of the songs, the \\"na nas\\" seemed inane and detracted from the songs.

You've got it - the same tape contact problem that occurred with the first sample occurred with the second. This time the problem was even worse - the recorder failed to record adequately, so that nothing but noise was on the tape.

In addition, the seller had changed their name (as I was told by Amazom) and was now selling the exact same product for twice what I paid for it.

Unlike their first album which really wasn't bad, Fequency is that much better simply because it's more memorable and lasting. With an almost underground status, and practically unknown in the States, Tram is a very slow-mood Brit-Pop band. If you enjoy bands like Coldplay or even Travis, Tram is definately something you might enjoy. Tram does in fact seem to have a more eerie pace than Coldplay, none of the tracks on the album have anything close to something I would consider fast. It is definately something you would listen to while in a mellow mood or while laying in bed.

It is not deep though--it's just a very sticky novel and you would get more out of your life by painting happy-faces on your toenails than by reading this schock."},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody please help me!","review":"i chose this one because it was the thinest one from what i was supposed to choose for i.s.u rough copy is due next monday! someone please tell me any ideas about this novel. i didn't get any...what shall i write about this one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and concise -- Perfect for professional use.","review":"This is a very easy-to-read synopsis of postpartum mood disorder. I highly recommend it to other care providers that work with new mothers (OB-GYN, midwives, doulas, pediatricians). It is cheap enough that a practice can buy several hundred a year so they can give out a copy to mothers who look like they are in need.I am a childbirth educator that gives the Beyond the Birth booklet to my clients before they give birth. I make sure that partners, especially, are aware of its content, and give them all \\"homework\\" to read it and watch for mom's symptoms after the baby is born. With giving out this booklet, I feel that I am more effectively preparing the new parents for the inevitable hormone drop, relationship differences and social changes that accompany the birth of their baby.Highly recommended. Easy to read, easy to give, full of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pageant of Europe","review":"I used this book as a text in college, 50 plus years ago. The author was our lecturer.

I am happy to have it to read at my leisure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dwarf RULES!","review":"This Show is soooo funny! :) It was nice to have the DVD versions finally. The bonus tracks are awesome and full of good info. The second season on the bonus disc has the full version of the \\"tongue tied\\" ensamble. There's even some good trivia info!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the smeg you need!","review":"Red dwarf never gets old it's just as funny to this day and with the DVD's you get a few extras, the extras just add to the smeg value of red dwarf and to be honest these DVD's couldnt be much better for content, when you look back on some of the first episodes you cant really remember some with it been that long since it was on tv but they are still just as funny as with Kryton when he was discovered looking after some dead people assuming that they where alive, you cant really help but love the robot that looks like a condoms been placed on his squareish head. So it's worth getting although if you can find it cheaper it would be better as it's pretty expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early seasons mostly for die-hard fans, but still enjoyable","review":"If you're a die-hard Red Dwarf fan (and I am), you'll want to own this (and I do). If you have any doubts about whether you'll enjoy the show, skip ahead to season 3. These first two seasons are really all about establishing the characters and the premise, and some of the acting feels a little wooden and \\"stage-y.\\"In other words, if I were introducing a Red Dwarf newbie to the series (assuming they'd agree to a marathon viewing session of something they know nothing about), I'd probably show excerpts of episodes from season 1, a few episodes from season 2, and start right in on season 3. And in my view, the REALLY fun, whacked-out stuff doesn't get rolling until season 4.Anyway, all of that said, it's still an incredibly original and fun premise, and even these faltering early seasons beat the socks off of just about anything you can watch on TV right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dwarf... with all the bonuses you could want.","review":"I'm sure there are already adequite desciptions of the episode plots posted on Amazon, so I'll simply add a few details. There are 12 episodes, with optional commentaries, deleted scenes, smeg-ups, one uncut music video, the Red Dwarf A to Z documentary with Patrick Stewart and Terry Pratchett, full chapters of the illuminating Red Dwarf audio books that are read aloud by Rimmer (the books have much better character development), special effects raw footage, weblinks, photogalleries, trailers, music cues, collectors booklets, hidden easter eggs, interviews with Doug Naylor, the Japanese version of The End. So, these four DVD's contain everything you could want from the first two seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dwarf is not for everyone","review":"Red Dwarf is for people who will appreciate the following statement. This show is simply the best \\"smart dumb Brit humor show\\" in the history of the world. Well written episodes combined with the most engaging characters ever make for the funniest adventrue/comedy series yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Red Dwarf Fans","review":"The commentaries are hilarious, although sometimes hard to understand. (There is no closed captioning for the cast's comments.) There is, however, closed captioning for the regular episodes, which I really appreciate. Sometimes the studio audience is laughing so hard, you can't understand what the characters are saying. If you have seen the Smeg-Ups or Smeg-Out tapes, you have already seen the outtakes that are on the DVD. The booklets in the DVD's are not very detailed, just some info on what to look for in each episode. I would have liked more background material. They also should have provided cast bios on the DVD. The picture quality is excellent. A must buy for any Red Dwarf Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Extras........Not enough Episodes","review":"I love the show and have enjoyed watching it. However this page does not list how many episodes are on each series, there are only 6 in each. Although I probably should have investigated them individually I was really exited about the prospect of getting 2 full seasons (atleast from an American viewpoint) and when they arrived they were packaged together with the fronts facing out opposite each other, needless to say once I got the package opened and scanned the backs I realized I only had 12 episodes total on two discs, the other two are full of extras. At discovering this I wanted to return them but could not because I had to open the package to find out that there were only 6 episodes to a series. I have since discovered that they sell a copy of Just the Episodes that have Series 1,2,3,and 4, which I would have bought had I seen it before I had purchased this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea!","review":"This is a great book for those who seem to have very little time for prayer and mediation.

I keep this book at bedside and often refer to it in notes to friends. I enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must ask....","review":"Um....just wondering and have to ask.....why the need to designate \\"For AFRICAN AMERICANS\\"? Does the color of one's skin have anything to do with praying or being in God's presence? Does the soul have a color? If man looks at the outside and God looks at the heart....shouldn't all hearts be the same color?

From start to finish, this is just horrible. I couldn't tell if it's supposed to be a satire, black comedy, or just misguided. At the end of the film, the hero chants, \\"Namiho renge kyou,\\" over and over. If they just bothered to ask someone, they could have found out what the real chant is supposed to sound like. The pacing is so flat, \\"Pink Flamingos\\" is like \\"Road Warriors\\" in comparison.Don't soil your brain with this.

At 6\\" in diameter and 25\\" in length, it packs small enough to fit in checked luggage so it is perfect for driving or flying.Our son has been using it since 2.5, but never had any of the issues we saw mentioned in other reviews here. The mattress stayed inflated for the week-long vacation at the beach. We never zipped him in completely, giving him room to roll over without stressing the fabric or causing it to roll over on him. I certainly agree with the reviewer who said don't dry it in the dryer--the high poly content just can't take the heat, so we always air dry. That may cause some trouble if you have an overnight accident while on vacation.When you compare the cost of this system to a roll-away, it will pay for itself in three nights. We've recommended it to other parents who have had similar success. Bottom line: We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately doesn't deserve 5 stars","review":"I thought this would be more raw and hardcore, but I was disappointed. Being that RZA is in it I figured it'd be somewhat like Wu, with the style, but it definately sounded nothin like them. It had some alright flows and OK beats, but a lot of it just seemed cheezy to me. I just wasn't feelin it. You can tell a couple members had potential, but it just didn't come together right on this. It seems like they're off beat a lot too. If you're lookin for that raw new york sound, stick to wu-tang or nas... definately not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"DO not buy this album. This is one of the worst that ive bought and i got it ten years later thinking it was good from all these reviews.

Good music, strong lyrics...just the right combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop Your Cream...Get This CD!!","review":"6 Feet Deep is one of my all time favorite rap albums. I was banging my head to this joint before I was listening to Wu Tang. This album is just how I like it, hard-hitting, wound opening, solid lyrics from the basement. I love the image these guys created for themselves. It's gangsta rap meets the morgue. Grim Reaper's voice is nothing short of hypnotic, gatekeeper and undertaker keep it real, and of course Rza laces some of the best beats to date. These guys have been around awhile, long before Gravediggaz was even formed, their expertise shows throughout these wonderfully diverse, but equally slammin' album.... Bang Your Head! Bang Your Mutha F*&*&*G Head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School","review":"1-800-suicide was on the spawn soundtrack. I heard this cd back in 97, and this cd is still dope.

Back in the spring/summer of '94 we were banging \\"Diary of a Madman\\" all over S.I. If there ever was a category for \\"scariest\\" hip-hop track, \\"Diary\\" takes it (one of the best Rza tracks of all time, it still gives me chills) It's like the soundtrack to a murder spree. Also worth noting about \\"Diary\\", it's the first appearance of the Killah Priest, the most underrated lyricist ever. Oh yeah, the rest of the album ain't too bad either. If you're reading this and don't own this album, DO WHAT YA GOTTA DO TO GET IT.......NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight! Great Lyrics!","review":"I just bought this CD yesterday, and I must say it is tight!

I LOVED IT !This album when it came out in \\"94\\" shocked alot of people bye its Twisted , Insane outlook on life , Which made alot of people stop and think... The 4 Rappers on this album were \\"RZArectah AKA The RZA\\" , \\"Gatekeeper AKA Frukwan\\", \\"Prince Paul AKA Undertaker\\" And \\"Too Poetic AKA Grym Reaper\\".These 4 MC's Take you on a Journey thru the Dark , Sick and Twisted world we live in. There Insane styles , Grimmey metaphors is what made this album so Dark and Scary. The production is Darkly perfect , The Rhymes are Goulishly Insane , and the Style is like no other Average rappers. All jokes a side They basically bring you to Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"unappreciated classic","review":"As a huge hip-hop fan, i can easily say that this is one of the five best rap albums ever. Initially dismissed as a gimmick, this album is a result of the frustration at the time of the four members. The meaning of many of the lyrics becomes clearer after multiple listens, and the production is among Prince Paul's best. The album is similar to Prince Paul's other recent work at the time, De La's \\"Buhloone Mindstate\\", which is also dark, humorous, and basically brilliant, in that few people bought the albums but no one who has heard them can dislike them. My two roommates, who both hated rap when i met them, now consider 6 Feet Deep as one of their favorite albums. Anyway, just buy the damn disc and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful sound quality","review":"This movie may actually be interesting... if it was possible to understand what the actors are saying...

Recently I decided to try Herbatint because I thought it would be better for my hair, as it makes natural claims. Three days and more than 5 washes later, it was still bleeding out onto my towels and my pillow cases at night- permanently staining them. The rinse water would run clear, but somehow it was still rubbing off onto everything. I had to go to a salon to have them use some kind of \\"exfoliating\\" shampoo to get rid of the problem. Worst of all, I contacted the company to offer them the opportunity to respond to my compaint, and heard nothing. Terrible product, terrible customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Colors","review":"So, I tried Herbatint back in 2009 right before I was supposed to go to court. I used 4M, hoping for a nice reddish-brown color on my naturally dark brown hair. Well, I had eggplant purple hair! It was really shiny, but also freakishly purple. Not wanting to totally write the product off, I tried it again a few months ago as I normally use Naturcolor and could not find 3N Burdock, my normal color. I tried 2N Brown in Herbatint and had Elvira black hair. Additionally, it dried out my ends something terrible. I really like the exrta shine that this product imparts on the hair, but the colors are soooo whacky. Check out Naturcolor as it is a much gentler product and the colors are more predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic reaction","review":"I tried this product for the first time thinking that it has natural ingredients boy was I wrong.

Placing the words \\"special needs\\" in the title implies that it would provide specific pointers for helping children with all sorts and degrees of disabilities like CP, visual impairments, hearing impairments, deafblindness, mental retardation, etc. and might at least have a section on augmentative communications. It offers VERY LITTLE on these topics. As for the dialogues, I found them to be of poor quality and contrary to other stuff I have read. Some of the dialogues for a child who hasn't begun to talk have tons of words and lots of adjectives yet later the same book suggests that teaching the concepts of 'up' and 'down' in the same play session might be too confusing for the child. I don't know what the author's Ph.D. is in but I hope it isn't in speech and language pathology."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"This book has lots of great examples of dialogs to have with your child to help them develope language at every stage of development.

Though I'm not sure that this book would be especially useful for teachers, I DO think it is an excellent resource for new parents on appropriate developmental stages. The charts for Language, Physical and Cognative milestones are worth the price of the book!

I plan to buy a copy for each of my four daughters when they start their family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your copy carefully","review":"The book is merely a list of toys, generally commercially available, that might stimulate or help a child communicate. My biggest complaint is with the printing. I wondered why young children (3 - 18 months) had so few notations, and discovered why yesterday... My copy jumps from page 50 to page 83. The pages didn't fall out of the binding - they were not included when the book was bound. So check yours when you buy. I am not sure if this a problem unique to me or not.

Marold's comments that this book is a must have for Italian-American cuisine, although I think this book and \\"The Rao's Cookbook\\" complements each other quite nicely. From a glance I notice there are not as many overlapping recipes between the two books that others imply - a few more \\"home\\" recipes here while \\"The Rao's Cookbook\\" tends to offer more traditional \\"red sauce\\" fares, and perhaps more recipes that are served in restaurant settings. For example, this book does not offer veal permingino while two Italian-American bread recipes are covered that do not appear on \\"The Rao's Cookbook\\".I have read Lidia Bastianich's \\"Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen\\", but given that I myself already own The Rao's two cookbooks and a few works at the extreme other end of Italian cuisine such as Mario Batali's works and Giorgio Loctaelli's \\"Made In Italy\\" and a couple of others, I think they have pretty much covered the grounds of Bastianich's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rao's Recipes from the Neighborhood","review":"If you love Italian food and love to cook, nothing beats theRao's cook books.

I think maybe I liked #1 Star of the Sea about the best, it is done with Mediaeval English and Latin. #2 Trovommi Amor is done in 15C (15th century?)

I guess that is just wear and tear so that isn't probably a big problem. The crib I didn't really play with but I remember this hole in Krissy's back and a stick thing in the crib to make her stay in.

Looking great, sounds good, till today, less than a year old. Both locking screws on the bridge broke one after another, due to metal fatigue I guess - or poor material used for such an important piece of the instrument. Never happened to any other guitar I played in the past 30 years. This has to be the worst! I only played this guitar a handful times during the year. Just checked on the web, replacements cost $50!

Just a big piece of rock crystal. May be hard to believe that something like this is very effective until you try it. Too different from conventional deodorants. You may have to moisten the surface a bit before application.Pros:- It really works.- Natural. Made from a certain type of mineral salts- Very inexpensive. It will last for years to come.- Absolutely no scent- Non-staining- Practically Invisible- Not sticky at all.Cons:- Remember, this is a deodorant not an anti-perspirant- Just one big piece of crystal rock. May have some rough edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well as a deodorant.","review":"I use this instead of regular deodorant now. I have been using it for about a month, so far it has worked well but you need to scratch the rock a bit first so the salt will rub off onto your armpit. If you just rub it, the surface is too smooth and it doesn't really get on your skin. I wear this and then go work out and I smell fine.

Beyond that, it's earth-friendly because it lasts and lasts, and there's minimal packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensitive Skin Beware; Worked Well But Rash Developed After 6 Months Use","review":"I wanted a deodorant without the aluminum and decided on this product. I also used the roll on version. It worked well for about 6 months but then I developed an underarm rash. I think it may have been because I shave daily and the skin is broken and this product contains salt. My husband also developed a rash but not as bad as mine. We had to switch products. Once we stopped using it the rash went away but when I tried it again it came back. Needless to say I am never using this again.

No chemicals and it lasts for up to a year. In stores I've only been able to buy it in the plastic \\"screw out\\" containers which are expensive and inefficient.This 5 oz. block has no container so it air dries after each use and includes a tray for it to rest in on the counter.I'm happy that I've found it again in rock form. The price and delivery were all good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must haves","review":"After using this spray and the regular crystal deoderant I can never go back to regular sticks. It takes about a week for your body to get used to it but don't give up. After a week your body stops having any odor where you spray this. It's like magic. Best of all these products do not have the cancer causing ingreadients that all other standard deodorants have. Plus you'll never again have a painful blocked sweat pore. These all natural products rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific For All sorts of BO","review":"I stopped using deodorant 2 years ago when i learned about the cancer risk associated with its use. I use the crystal stick under my arm and it works great so i bought this product to try.I love it ... this spray is great for holding down embarassing BO all over your body. Spray it anywhere you have an odor problem. I use it before going to the gym on the areas of my body that sweat the most. No need to use gallons of perfume to hide the sweaty smell anymore ... just use this stuff! Even works great between and under the breast for those of us with large breasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok for short periods.","review":"Crystal spray would need to be re-sprayed every 1-2 hours to prevent underarm odor (& I'm not so sure this would even work).

He probably was better at being the latter. I'm sure a lot of managers, led by Baltimore's Earl Weaver, would agree with that.....but Luciano knew his baseball, was a decent ump and brought entertainment to the sport like nobody before or since. Name one other umpire who brought laughs and fun to the park like Luciano?

She pokes marvelous fun at the staid British virtues of bad food, bad weather and cold country houses. Usually I am very unamused at some Brit writing in a condescending manner about us colonists other wise known as American citizens.

Most times folks want to know what it is (my brother made me stop at a Sam Goody and get a copy immediately) but the occasional \\"person\\" is a bit ambiguous.I will have to admit that the last track is pretty unexplainable, and if I get to the flip on the disc I usually just skip past it and go back to track 1.

Frankly I was bored.I can't really tell what is so wrong with it. The story just dragged on and on. I know my history well and this film added nothing to the experience.I watched it with a good friend equally interested in foreign war movies but for us it was quite a disappointment.Compared to such brilliant films as Der Untergang (Downfall), Ji jie hao (Assembly) and Tmavomodr svet (Dark Blue World) this film has very little to offer. My recommendation is you watch those instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"full share of sorrows","review":"Seen through the life of a family, one follows the ordeal of Poles caught between Nazi Germany and the Russia of the Soviets.

Deeply moving and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katyn DVD","review":"Best accounting of the tragic happening at Katyn I have found so far. Very little trouble finding subtitles.

Most of the plot is covered by other reviewers but I will add that the moving of the actual murders to the end of the film was very effective. The last scene of the hand holding a crucifix as the Russians plow dirt over the graves is reminiscent of the end of the film \\"Joyeux Noel\\".

Nothing watered down nor convoluted but rather a comprehensive lecture on the topic done with conviction and excitement.

The author uses the form of letters written to friends to describe many aspects of life in the eighteenth century. From fabrics and sewing techniques to food preparation and period beverage preparation. A really interesting jaunt back in time. Just remember that the womens clothing patterns in this book seem to be very small. You will need to enlarge the patterns for anyone over size 7.

The same drum patterns throughout as well as a very overused and tired 'pan flute sampled' keyboard sound, make for a boring listening for me. Vocals should also be pushed back in the mix with this type of music, not to the front. I haven't heard any other releases by this band but this was not a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music for Power Yoga","review":"I found this to be a great album with many distinctive sounds (drums, flutes, harp, systhesizer, and melodies). Most importantly, most of the trac's have an incredible base line beat. I teach Power Yoga (a westernized version of Asthanga Yoga). This album keeps the students focused and moving without beig intrusive. The few songs that do have lyrics don't use language or pharases that would offend anyone's religion, ethnic background or other social beliefs. If you're looking for lively background music to play in a public forum, this would be a good pick. I think Dagda has produced a very creative album and I plan to buy more of thier releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average micro fiber cloth","review":"Just another average micro fiber cloth.

A major section of Highway 85 that was completed over five years ago is not shown on the map.A close inspection of the product packaging does refer to \\"static\\" maps (maybe they mean static in time as well -- locked in at 1997!); however, I feel that the packaging is deliberately misleading so that the buyer can easily get the impression that these maps are interactive on a PDA. In any event, the fact that such old and obsolete maps were used is inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, only creates fixed images on Palm","review":"This product uses a simple interface on the PC to outline an area for which a map is to be generated. An image, and nothing else, is downloaded to the Palm. There is no searching by street, zooming, or anything else on the Palm.Worse still, the image capture on the PC won't display individual streets except at the few highest zooms and then the area is quite small. So, either the map on the Palm is uselessly small (a square mile or so) or it doesn't actually contain city streets. Either way, as a map, it's useless.In fairness to the product, it tries to be a trip planner more than a map. In that role, it's not quite as bad. The result is a sequence of maps, each at an appropriate zoom level. Even so, it's awkward to create and download separate maps for one trip.Okay, it's cheap. I don't expect full features. But, this product just isn't usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This software seems like it was designed more for your desktop than your palm. On your desktop, it is a fully interactive map of the U.S. But you can only load a single still picture on to your palm. No zooming, no address finder, nothing!!!

But not bad for your desktop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Desktop, poor PDA","review":"This product is okay when used as a reference tool on your desktop computer. However, to reiterate and reinforce other reviews it is misleading and a poor tool for your PDA. You are only allowed to save static maps to your PDA. Once the map is on your PDA you can not zoom or view street names, which makes the product highly useless on your portable device. I give the product one star only because it is usefull when used on the desktop computer. Since it's target audience seems to be the PDA user the company misrepresents the usefullness of the product on the PDA. I am very displeased. I highly recommend not purchasing this product if you intend to use it on you PDA as it is purely junk in that respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless","review":"This software would have been a marvel twenty-five years ago.

I had to force the barrel to fit on the frame; it was off by about 1/2\\". Not surprisingly, nothing fits snugly.

I still love it now in 2005 and can honestly say that the album sounds just as good now as it did back in 1988!. The originality of the songs and sounds on this awesome record make it so unique and I do not think any other band will come along in my life time and make such an impression as did the nephilim.

It contains lots of great information. It also contains some errors, most of which are little. Also, the rendition of the Chinese character for \\"raku\\" is ugly and missing a stroke. The title says this is a dictionary of materials and techniques - but it's more than that. It can serve as a jargon glossary, too. Also, some articles seem more concerned about meaning and interpretation and make practically no mention of materials or technique, and in the case of the \\"Teapots\\" entry, I thought it culturally-biased and incomplete. That said, get it anyway, this book is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extensive, Exhaustive, Excellent","review":"The Potter's Dictionary offers details and facts about everything ceramic.

Instead, I struggled with finding patience as the plot(?) meandered along for nearly two hundred pages before the title of the book even gets addressed. I'm not sure why the author chose to use Claudia (Pilate's wife) as his narrator for the story either, since he gives her no viewpoint to offer on the crucifixion. The notion that Jesus made so little an impression on Pilate that he could not even recall the event is really boring. Furthermore, the author's sense of relationship between Claudia and Pilate verges on imbecility, and his attempt to characterize these historical figures into believable subjects was clearly beyond his skill as well.The one positive of the book comes from the news bulletins about the Christian movement sweeping into Rome, and how it was reacted to by Romans of that era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrum down","review":"This is a classical piece of sports writing combined with the personal life of a Rugby League star playing in the North of England, when a fiver in the boots was a bonus and not today's silly money.

The authors appear as bitterly resentful and ill-willed in broadly condemning all conservative talk-show hosts such as Rush Limbaugh in attempting to indict truly extremist and dangerous right-wing voices. I heard Michael Keith on the Michael Medved talk-show add Dr. Laura Schlesinger to the conservatives he does not like. I doubt the authors even listen enough to Dr. Laura, much less to Limbaugh or Medved, to be experts on conservative talk-show programs. They have gone too far with their broad-brush \\"paint job\\" and have made the same mistake that Hillary Rodham Clinton made in her infamous comment about the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\". I strongly recommend the book as an example of the \\"fascism\\" of the current anti-democratic left-wing intellectuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that attacks the Right but ignores the Left Extremist","review":"The book gives an adequate view of Right Wing Radicals and rightly warns us about some views not consistent in a Freedom System of free speech. However, it ignores its own bias and failure to research where much of the disinformation and racial tensions and even bombings came from leftists extremists as outline in a book that details KGB Files in The Sword and the Shield. In the end, I have concluded that this book is nothing more than an attempt to counter conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans agenda meant for a responsible and reliable middle americans. The extremes seldom are right anytime and this books only attacks one side so the book itself is an extreme attack exactly what they are trying to stop, prevent or make people think.

It has been confirmed by the National Archives that Thomas Lowry modified an April 1864 pardon written by President Abraham Lincoln to read April 1865. He did this to bring credit and praise to himself for finding a document that would have been the President's last offical act before being assassinated later that night. However, the National Archives discovered that Lowry modified the document, and he admitted to changing it to glorify himself as a Civil War historian. I am sorry, but people should not support him or provide him money by purchasing this book, regardless of the value of the content.

The statute of limitations have passed and Mr. Lowry will not be charged for desicrating and national document; however, this now puts everything Mr. Lowry has written under a microscope of suspicion.

This movie will upset you, and pehaps the plot is a little manipulative (getting you too \\"pick\\" a side early on) but it is also true.

The development of the story did not develop and I kept thinking that she wrote this to make a quick buck or to appease the publisher the entire way through. Luckily I bought this in paperback, if I had bought it in hard back I would want some of my money back. Johanna what is up with your writing lately?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WILL THE REAL JOHANNA LINDSEY PLEASE STAND UP?!?!?","review":"... What happened? What is really going on? I have read all of Johanna Lindsey's book and I have not been this disappointed since \\"The Pursuit\\". This book was so slow and when it got to the end, I was left hanging. On an average if the book is good I can read it in under four hours. This book took me 3 days and the only reason i keep reading it is because I paid [$$$] for it. Johanna Lindsey is a great writer, I just think her publishing company is hold her back from the same writing style as the Johanna of old.To see her earlier more creative work? Read Fires of Winters. This book is a Johanna classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INSIGHTFUL READING","review":"Talented voice performer Laural Merlington gives a splendid reading as she effortlessly inhabits the personalities and voices of two very different sisters.Set in the Southwest during the 1870s this is the story of twins, Amanda and Marian Laton. They are identical physically but otherwise poles apart. To put it in Western terms one should be wearing a white hat, and the other a black. When their father unexpectedly dies the young women are sent to live on a ranch as big as a Texas ranch is supposed to be.Of course, there's a handsome young cowboy in the picture - Chad is the son of a cattle baron. One man, two women; obviously, a triangle and not the kind sometimes played in the Lone Star state.More than sparks fly when Amanda and Marian both go after \\"A Man to Call My Own.\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"Just so-so characters in a blah storyline.Someone fill out a missing persons report for Johanna Lindsey."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a good book!!","review":"This book was definitley a good read. Not my favorite and not typical Johanna Lindsey, but good. Chad was incredible!!!! What a man!!!! And I really liked Marian's character, although I wish that she had had more guts where Amanda was concerned. I would have given her a run for her money!!!!! All in all, a really good book, that is worth the read!!! I would say to anyone who is interested to give it a try!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"This book is full of repetition, repetition, repetition! OK we get it ........one twin is bad one is good..... The book lacked Lindsey's witty dialogue and strong characters... Not up to par with the Mallory series at all.......I wish the real Johanna would come back to writing because the last few books have really been awful and I am a big fan of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have been written by a Ghost writer for Lindsey","review":"I have read all of the Mallory Novels except two, I have read many other Johanna Lindsey novels, and I swear, this is not her writing. This book had to have been written by a ghost writer or the editorial staff tore apart all of the dialogue, because there is not much dialogue in this book. The whole thing is a monologue inside each character's head, in order to \\"hurry up the story\\". I am so disappointed that I wasted my valuable time on this book. I liked the premise of the book about identical twins of different tempermant, I like that they were wealthy and had to leave the East and travel out West, and I liked the hero's background. The many twists and turns in the story were very interesting but the book needed to be longer to develop the storyline better. The conflicts were OK, but as I said, too much in too short a time. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"If you are interested in a female with no self esteem, insecurity, and the ability to let doubt control all of her decisions this is the book for you.

There have been times that I read reviews and then read the book and wondered if they read the same thing I did. But this time I have to agree with others. I did finish the book but it was just ok. The characters aren't well developed. I got tired of the twin Amanda being so hateful and whinny. Why couldn't the other characters see past Marian wearing the thick glasses for disquise and being bullied by Amanda. There was too much repetition in phrases through out the book. The story was slow moving- I skipped pages really bad just to get through it and when I did I didn't miss anything. Sorry, but I won't recommend reading it- too many other good ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's \\"I couldn't care less!\\"","review":"This book was dissapointing on so many levels. First of all, the editing. JL used the phrase \\"I could care less\\" at least 15 times. The correct phrase is \\"I couldn't care less\\"It drove me nuts. That along with the slowest moving story. There was no real conflict. I agree with the other reviewers, how did the barn scene happen? Where was the tension, the emotion? Why not show Amanda's pain? Obviously she had some, she mentioned it twice to Chad.I thought the end was awful too. Where did that come from? Everyone just took the information and moved on.I loved JL, she wrote with feeling. I am not sure who wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money!!","review":"This book was terrible! I bought the book based on Ms. Lindsey's name-- I have sooooo many of her other books so I was excited to see this one on the bookshelf at the bookstore. By the end of the first chapter, I was bored. The characters have no redeeming qualities except for Chad and I think he's an idiot for hanging in there for two women who are petty, stupid, short sighted and FLAT! I will definitely be selling this book at my next garage sale!! and 25 cents will be asking too much for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this 0 stars","review":"This was the worst Johanna Lindsay book I have ever read. Both the \\"evil\\" twin and the \\"good\\" twin were annoying. The evil twin because Lindsay spent the first few chapters telling us all the reasons we should hate her, the good twin because she was unnecessarily mean to the hero for no good reason. The hero was easily manipulated and not too smart.The worst part of this book was the fact that after spending so much time convincing the reader to hate the evil twin, by the middle of the book Lindsay has this character do a complete turnaround. POOF!!! She's married and slowly but surely she's turning into a nice girl while the good twin is getting meaner and nastier. At this point I disliked most characters in the book and I couldn't give a hoot what happened next.The humor and emotion that are usually the main ingredients in Lindsay's books are woefully absent in this horrid story. Don't waste your time or money on this pathetic tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"where did our johanna go???!!!","review":"What happen to johanna? Her earlier books were so wonderful you could'nt put them down. The last few years her books-- dull, dull, dull. I say pass on this book. Come on Johanna you can do SO much better. I will still read anything you write but from now on i get them at the library or wait for paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time and Money!","review":"I never thought I would ever give a Johanna Lindsey book so low a rating; however, this book is garbage. How many times do we have to read about a good twin and a bad twin? This book is full of flat, undeveloped characters, and the most predictable storylines. Quite honestly, I haven't liked much of Johanna Lindsey's books since the 90's. I can't help but think that she needs to focus on the quality of her writing rather than the quantity. Her latest books appear to be rushed out in a manufactured style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"I installed the product and within 2 weeks the rope and only 10' of chain cut through it!! I do NOT recommend this, try and find a better manufactured roller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste. Weak. Worthless. Save your money!","review":"Thought it would be nice to have... it is not. Too weak to hold up a heavy camera. Too difficult to adjust. Too flimsy to trust your camera too. Might as well use a real monopod or tripod instead. This was a waste of my money. Maybe it will work for you, but it is not working out for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit but pivoting is crude","review":"This is a nicely made unit that holds both my camera and camcorder securely. However it doesn't get five stars because the ball that forms the ball-and-socket joint (that allows the camera to rotate and tilt) is not round. It is oblate. So if you want to move the camera a little bit, you have to do more adjusting because you have to loosen the system more than you should have to in order to get it to rotate. It makes fine adjustments just a little more difficult than they should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Tiny A Tripod For Me!","review":"I really wouldn't recommend using this tripod with anything other than the smallest and lightest of digital cameras! It is just so small a thing! Too small for me!Also, pulling out the leg extensions (on mine) is dreadfully difficult! Too tight! It is difficult for me to get good enough a grip on them with my fingertips!Conclusion:If you have a tiny lightweight camera to use with this tiny tripod, it 'might' be acceptable to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk -- literally broke 1 minute after taking from the package.","review":"I bought three of these sight unseen, on speculation. While they are nice and small and relatively inexpensive they are also unbelievable cheaply made. One of the units had a leg snap off the very first time I tried to twist/deploy the leg, seconds after pulling it from the package. The \\"axel\\" around which the leg pivots is only a tapered screw (like a wood screw) screwed from the opposite side and into the plastic of leg. Thankfully the price was too inexpensive to really bother returning it. Ya gets what ya pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Tripod!","review":"It's perfect for buttressing against a pillar, wall, or tree for sharper low light pics (see my uploaded photos under customer images).The legs can telescope out for tallness and the head can rotate for flexible picture taking (again, look at my uploaded photos).The compactness is perfect for travel and for those low light night scene moments where a tripod is absolutely mandatory with a compact camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"Maybe OK if you have a small camera, but it's too flimsy to support an SLR. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing (it's small after all), butVanguard VS41 Flexible MiniTripodis at least as cheap and is sturdy enough to do the job (plus, it's better looking in my opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, great size.","review":"This little tripod was even smaller than I expected - it fits easily into our rather small camera bag. I mount a Canon A630 (medium size digital) and it works well. So far, the funtionality has been excellent. Really nothing negative to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor with D70","review":"If you like to take pictures of the ground with your Nikon D70, including possibly the tips of the tripod if you are in wide angle, this is the tripod for you. With a 24-120 zoom lens, it is almost impossible to tighten the ball up to the point that it will hold. At the point you think it might hold, you are sure you'll break the tightening knob (using a Leatherman). I think I got it; I think I got it; Don't got it. Probably fine for a point and shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Tripod","review":"I mistakenly ordered this because I thought I could extend the length of the legs. This tripod is a loser, any camera with a little weight to it makes it top-heavy and it falls over. If you're going to buy a mini tripod make sure the legs extend to a full foot in length. I have one of those and thats what I had meant to buy for my second camera setup. I made a $10 mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Company","review":"Ordered 2 Mini-Tripods.Great product. Excellent and very quick delivery. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap innit","review":"If you are a typical sheeple who loves senseless violence, the type of obvious coolness that can only be had by wearing crisp clothing with the latest ridiculous label on, racism, objectification of women, intolerable narcissism, weak plots and inane dialogue, this book is for you! If you are a sensible and ethical person, you might be so offended by this piece of crap that you actually rip it into pieces and recycle it (which is against all of your instincts as a lover of books) instead of dropping it off at Goodwill so that no young minds might become polluted by it. If you are a person of true moral conscience you will probably be incensed enough to drive back to the bookstore and buy all of the copies from the dollar bin to insure that these meet the same fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but negated by an embarassing ending","review":"Londonstani starts out great, with a realistic (realistic-feeling to an outsider, anyway) look at a newly-affluent youth culture getting in trouble in London, along the lines of Quadrophenia or Absolute Beginners (the baddie is a desi Vendice Partners). The first half is great and original, with dialogue reminiscent of The Committments, and the plot thickens nicely, but by the end it dissolves into Scarface cliches and a crying-in-a-rainy-cemetery scene. In the last couple chapters, the plot gets less and less realistic (a typical situation where anyone but a fictional character would just leave town, commit suicide, or go to the police) but still holds together well, and the book would get four stars if it wasn't completely ruined by a cheap, irrelevant M. Night Shamalayn surprise-ending in the last couple pages that negates the signifigance of the rest of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a difficult read because it is written the way modern urban youth speak, or rather text message. Substantively, this book is akin to A Clockwork Orange. However, this book will never achieve the imaginative and literary heights of Burgess' creation. The conclusion will disappoint most readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult read","review":"I found the dialect difficult to understand, and most of the book is dialect without much in the way of background.

This has applications for people who want 'miracles' in their lives.

The layout makes it easily readable and easy to review. This is a profound book explained so clearly it can quickly help anyone attain their 'miracles.' It is very spiritual, but practical, too. I believe it is applicable to followers of most spiritual practices.

This is a profoundly powerful book that teaches the mechanics of how miracles occur.

However, the title track still stands above the pack as a modern-day classic.Still, it's a must-have for your Christmas collection...after all, it IS Percy Faith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT","review":"I HAVE PLAYED THIS, AND IT PLAYS GREAT, SOUND IS GOOD. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS. EVEN THOUGH IT;S CHRISTMAS MUSIC, I PLAY ALL YEAR ROUND. DEE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, saccharine","review":"Take a cue from the album cover illustration -- this is not a traditional, reverential choral Christmas album. I didn't like it, and I don't think it's one of Percy Faith's best at all. Even in the category of more jaunty Christmas albums from that era, it's not even half as good as Ray Conniff's \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" album.I'm just saying, know what you are buying when you order this. Preview the music, note the illustration, and make your decisions accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings the Christmas Spirit to Life","review":"I'm an avid fan of instrumental Christmas music, and it's getting increasingly difficult to find CDs that have just the right blend of cheerful and bright Christmas music. \\"Christmas Is\\" is a well done combination of the types of songs that keep the warm Christmas memories alive and never fails to cheer me up during the holiday season. The verses to the song \\"Christmas Is\\" are superb and the song reminds me of those snow covered, postcard settings of PA during Christmas. \\"Silver Bells\\" is a beautiful rendition, almost has a sort of Oriental background. Told my wife if I'm ever in a coma to play me that song!! And \\"We Need A Little Christmas\\" is also a great song that oughta be just as popular as Jingle Bells. Again, if you like cheerful instrumental Christmas music, I'm almost certain you'll truly enjoy this CD. Another good one is the David Rose Christmas Album. I could only find that available in a cassette, though. Ho Ho Ho!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the all time favorites","review":"This classic Christmas album is in the top three favorites ever. I purchased several as gifts for family who also love to get a jump start on the season with great music, and everyone of them loves it. A must have for anyone's Christmas collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chairs! Great value!","review":"I felt like I was taking a chance on ordering a whole set of 6 chairs but now I'm glad I did. These chairs were a little bit of a challenge to assemble but not impossible. It took a little time, but after figuring it out it went a little faster. The chairs are very nice for the money. My wife and I are completely satisfied with them. They seem very solid and are comfortable. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK product and horrible customer service","review":"The product was defective (2 front chair legs came with no thread) cannot be attached. Contacted Moshya Home Furnishings. I had to send them pictures and waited for 2 weeks for a replacement. They sent a metal leg instead of a wooden leg (from another chair). Contacted them again and waited for 2 weeks and they sent me just 1 leg. Contacted them again and received no Reponses. The chair quality is OK but the service does not exist. I would not recommend any products from Moshya Home Furnishings based on their customer service"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality Chairs","review":"I feel cheated after I received the chairs.The wood that use on these chairs are low quality, you can see the woods are broken when you install the chairs.I am not sure what they put under the seat but it feels wrong, you can feel something cheap under the leather.It said the original price is $499, and I swear these chairs should not worth more than $120 ($60 per piece)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful-but has formaldehyde warning","review":"I wanted to give this 5 STARS, but there is a formaldehyde warning label underneathe the chair cushions. I researched it online and there are a bunch of websites on the subject, which can be something to be careful of. I'm not that concerned because there is minimal wood exposure, in the legs. And, apparently, a lot of furniture has formaldeyde in it and there are no warning labels,Otherwise, these chairs are really beautiful, great quality, easy to put together, and VERY COMFORTABLE for both my and husband and myself. The price is incredible for what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value / Great Product","review":"The chairs are an excellent value. The price was ridiculous (about $60/chair) yet they look rich and way more expensive and better yet, COMFY! They're extremely easy to assemble (hubby had each chair put together in less than 10 mins). We're extremely happy with the product and highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assembly stinks","review":"Product is very nice, shipping great, but assembly is difficult had to ream out one hole to get bolt to align with internal threads"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of details about an obscure but nearly pivotal figure.","review":"A well-done biography of the last Austrian Emperor and Hungarian King. The most illuminating parts of the book are after Emperor Charles leaves the thrones in 1918, where most history books forget about him. The nearly unknown story of how he almost regained the Hungarian throne in 1921, and might thereby have changed history, as well as how he was thwarted in this through treachery (something else the history books fail to properly report) makes for suspenseful reading. The sad story of how he died, poverty stricken and a prisoner of the countries who feared his influence as King of Hungary might overturn the World War I territorial settlement, is heart-rending. A quick, easy and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for inspiration and found it!!","review":"This book is such a wonderful combination of a heartfelt story of the author's journies to Peru and the ancient incan rituals that can enrich and enhance our lives. As a story the book was captivating and as a \\"how to\\" the book was inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mickey Mouse Book About Walt Disney World","review":"I'm surprised to read that the \\"scholarly\\" Fjellman doesn't perpetuate the old chestnut about Walt being cryogenically frozen. As it is, he has his readers believing this ridiculous story about Walt making a series of films to be shown after his death to guide the company after he's gone.This is a respected author? My God, where are his sources? Hopefully if he comes out with a second edition, he'll correct such glaring errors as these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever analysis of the 'American Mecca'","review":"For the reader who is interested in Disney World as a part of American culture, this book puts forth some provocative concepts. It is not necessarily easy reading, and it won't be the first place to come if the reader is looking to dish about Disney trivia. It does, however, present some challenging ideas about Disney's effect on America in as objective a manner as possible, I think. If you want to stretch your mind, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine on my 28-135","review":"Have used these since my film days and love them. sure beats losing the lens cap. Sometimes the glue lets go and needs to be redone, but hey, there cheap. Buying a new set now to have sa spares. Some of mine are over 10 years old and still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stick, too short...","review":"This item is very poor quality. I cleaned my lens cap very thoroughly before attaching the sticky part. I also held it in place for a few minutes to allow a good adhesion. However, after a week of very light use, it just fell off. So I had to super glue it back on. Also, the leash is very short. Overall I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Lose your Lens Cap again","review":"I have bought another one of these since receiving the first one. I feel confident that I will never lose the lens cap. Attached it to a 72MM lens cap and it holds it on well. I have attached the elastic part on the barrel of my 18-200 lens and after 2 weeks of shooting and walking around Paris, I found this worked quite well in keeping the lens cap with the camera. I'll buy another when I get a different size lens cap.Only gave it 4 stars since I think it is still a little pricey around $4. It is just an elastic with a plastic piece with double sided tape. I would buy it again anyway if I needed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have item for SLR camera users!","review":"I lost the cap for my lens while out with family. Bought this as soon as I got home. Can't live without it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanging onto my lens cap","review":"I bought a new camera and the lens cap--with no attachment-- was destined to be lost. I found these sweet little \\"attachments\\" and now I don't have to keep up with the lens cap! Nice find."},{"rating":"1","title":"digital camara user","review":"The attachment onto the lens cap broke on the first day I used it. The lens on my SLR is too large for other style attachments that connect from the cap to the camara. There must be a better way to attach a lens caps to a camara! Thankfully, I didn't loose the lens cap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going somewhere hot...beware!","review":"What a great idea, unless you are going somewhere hot, like Africa. Once you get somewhere where there is heat, the adhesive softens and the product fails. I bought this to use on lense caps while on safari in Africa and only by extreme luck, I didn't lose my lense cap. I realized the string was dangling where my lense cap should have been and stood up in the safari landcruiser and my lense cap just happened to still be sitting on the top of the vehicle. Would I purchase these again, probably not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 For Price","review":"I am pleased how quickly the capkeeper arrived. I just placed my order a few days ago, and it is already here.The capkeeper is just as promised. However, I do see a flaw in the design - the string attached is much shorter than I thought it would be.Also, I thought that 2 capkeepers were included, but I was wrong. I think that the title is a little misleading. You only get 1 for this price.*****UPDATE***** Since writing this review I have decided to no longer use capkeepers. Once the temperature rose above 70F, the adhesive consistantly moved around. Eventually it fell off. It's not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sima Capkeeper","review":"Delivery was quick---to those that never used one of these before, try this inexpensive deal to keep from losing a lens cap--myself, I knew what I was buying from a purchase for my Canon Rebel many years ago. As another purchaser had commented, thread it through the camera strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, I trust it with my lens cap.","review":"It's just a cheap little $2 product, but very handy for an SLR camera. Lens caps are a pain to deal with, it's so much easier to have it attached to the camera and let it dangle down, instead of having to put it on your pocket or set it down nearby, probably to be forgotten about and lost forever. This also makes it much easier to remember to put the cap back on once you are done shooting. The sticky on this guy seems to be pretty good, I feel confident that it will hold long enough to get a useful life out of the product. The elastic bit that goes around the lens seems to be good quality as well, and is likely not to stretch and come loose over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but over priced on Amazon","review":"It is keeping my lens cap from getting lost, but I found it at Calumet for 1/3 the price after I had purchased it on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a couple weeks of light use","review":"I've kept a Sima Capkeeper 2 on each of my lenses for the past 6 years. Buy a lens...buy a Capkeeper 2 with it. Never had a failure until now. A couple of weeks ago I stuck a Capkeeper 2 on a new lens cap, used it lightly and, regardless of the lack of abuse, the black plastic around the adhesive separated from the adhesive. It was a bit of a pain removing the adhesive and then cleaning the residue from the lens cap (took about 5 minutes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elastic snapped within seconds","review":"I received this item, keen to have it placed on the camera and lens cap. Once I placed the elastic band on the lens and after adjusting it a little to ensure it is in a good place, the elastic snapped. Very bad quality. Avoid buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be good, except...","review":"This was an excellent product until the shoddy string that connects to the elastic band broke. I've tried reconnecting them, but it keeps coming loose. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell off after 3 weeks of use","review":"I had high hopes for the capkeeper, based on the reviews. However, after only three weeks of light use, the little \\"button\\" became detached from the foam and adhesive on the lens cap. I'll be buying another one from a different manufacturer and spending a little more, hopefully I'll get one of better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elastic broke installing first time","review":"Total junk. The elastic broke while slipping it over the lens for the first time. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this","review":"One of my worst purchases from Amazon, Before I could use it the first time,the elastic came off the strap rendering it useless!. I would not buy from Sima ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"No SLR or DSLR user should be without this product","review":"This is pretty much a no-brainer - if you don't have your cap somehow attached to the camera it's going to get lost in a pretty short period of time. This slips on the lens with a piece of elastic to prevent it from being lost and is cheaper than the cost of replacing the lens cap. Effective and inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get this for ALL my lenses","review":"I shoot video with my 60D and 5D and I cannot imagine how many lens caps I would have misplaced without this capkeeper. It's relatively simple with an elastic loop on one side connected to an adhesive \\"button\\" on the other. The elastic loops goes around the lens itself and the adhesive \\"button\\" sticks to the lens cap so your cap is always near your lens. I don't have to stick each lens cap into my pockets or my bags any more; I can just reach for the cap and stick it back on the end of the lens without taking my eye off my monitor. The elastic is quite stretchy too so I can fit it around my largest lens (70-200mm F2.8L II IS USM) easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Crazy!","review":"Don't Be Crazy! I just bought this EXACT same item today for $2.69 at my local camera store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"It was a total waste of money. The length is too short especially for a 28-135mm zoom lens on my Canon 20D.As a result of its short length, I didn't have anything to use to protect my lens cap. A week after receiving the cap keeper and not being able to use it, the lens cap on my lens fell off somewhere in never-neverland. Guess what, not only did I throw my money away on the lens cap keeper, I now have to buy a new lens cap for my lens. What a bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"works for about three weeks","review":"Not a good value since the gummy part that holds the keeper to the cap is only good for about three weeks. If you own a Nikon you know this won't work since the lens caps for this camera can behave like they belong in a space program. If you do not get them right on the camera they can pop off and launch themselves into the stratosphere. I almost took out a friends eye with one of the lens caps. Please NIkon put a little hole someplace on the lens so we can attach our leashes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I ordered 3 of the Sima cap keepers since I have used them in the past and they were good quality. What i was sent was not the Sima cap keepers but a no brand knock off. Hopefully they will work ok and not break right away. I throughly despise companies who use these bait and switch tactics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The elastic came apart and the string came loose when I tried to place it on the body of the lens. The attachment to the lens worked ok and seemed durable. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is a clever idea but poor quality defeats its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I was excited to receive this item as I have lost two lens caps in the past. As soon as I took it out of the package I immediately attached it following the instructions to the letter. There is no problem with the sticky part staying put on the lens cap. The problem is with the little string that is attached to the elastic band. The second time I removed the lens cap from the camera, the little string disconnected from the elastic. So now I have a little string hanging from the lens cap that isn't attached to anything. This is a cheap piece of junk! Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tend to fall apart but at least Amazon replaces them..","review":"I have one for my 18-55mm and one for my my 55-300mm. They've only been on a few weeks, but so far they're working as I would expect it to!EDIT: A little over a month after I wrote this review one of them completely fell apart. Yeah, I only paid $2, but even for $2 I expect a product to last more than a few weeks. I'm going to see about returning it.UPDATE: Amazon credited me the $1.99 I paid so I could just purchase a new one as a replacement. I just ordered the replacement and another one as well for my new lens...we'll see how these go!EDIT: And yet another one fell apart. The string detached from the band that goes around the lens. Going to request a credit to replace that one as well. They may be only two dollars but I still expect it to work for more than a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"*WASTE* of money","review":"Gosh darn but these things are cheap. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem getting it to stick on my lens cap. I cleaned the cap with alcohol prior to sticking it on, maybe that did it.My problem is that they fall apart too easily. I'm gentle with my camera, simply unsnap the cap & let it dangle. One fell apart the first week I used it - the lanyard came off of the elastic strap. I tied it back on. Another one broke within three months of purchase - I tied that one back on, too. Recently, about a year after purchase, one of the ones that I tied back together broke a *second* time.I really don't like trying to clean dust out of the cap when it gets dropped in the dirt. I give up. Tossing them all out & finding a different solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I ordered 4 of these and the elastic broke on two of the four.

Since it is a two-ply product, the folds seem to have stretched the film. Therefore, application was difficult and not uniformly smooth. It really does not look professional. The vendor should provide the product in a tube, not folded. Until it is re-packaged, it is my suggestion that you do not purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for convex surface","review":"This film did not work for my skylight.

I could tell and have seen no difference at all since using this. Very disappointed,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth the price","review":"I bought this because my truck came with a Roll-N-Lock tonneau cover pre-installed on it and this is the protectant the manufacturer says to use. After using it, I wish I'd just gone with one of the vinyl protectants I've used before like Armor All or Meguiars. It doesn't seem to leave anything on the cover to protect it. There's no slightly greasy/slick feeling, and it doesn't even make the cover look better. It's not any darker than if I had just wiped it clean with soap and water.Roll-N-Lock says that the only lubricant you're supposed to use on the tracks is this, but if it doesn't leave any kind of grease/slickness behind, how can this possibly lube the tracks? It certainly didn't make my cover any easier to close. WD-40 doesn't last very long, but at least it lubes the tracks for a little while.I'm giving this 2 stars because it does clean the cover approximately like soap and water would, but you'd definitely be better off buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly paired with 14 Ginsu knifes","review":"We got this for ourGinsu 4846 20-Piece Stainless-Steel Knife Setand it fits every single knife (14 of them), including the Cleaver (in the center space intended for a sharpening steel).

But around half-way through I realized the following:1. A lot of the output was in something like DOS-boxes! Can you believe that. With such a powerful system as VB.NET, they're outputing to DOS-boxes!2. The rest of the time output was to MessageBox.Show(), which is just a very simple standard IO dialog box. I finally got disgusted when the book got to geometric output and, instead of drawing circles, I was still just printing out the values of the radius and diameter in dialog boxes. I thought to myself \\"What the hell is the purpose of this? I'm not learning anything!\\"3. I took a cursory examination of subsequent chapters and throughout the whole book the authors use those stinking MessageBox.Show() functions.Now the book does cover a lot of territory, but I can't believe the authors couldn't do a better job.

This book assumes that you have no knowledge of a language at all and literally walks you through step by step to become an expert in this new and exciting language. Every example shown actually works unlike most modern Wrox books that have gone down the drain in quality and completeness. Don't be disappointed by the flashy cover of this book - it does exactly what it says: i.e. teaches you ins and outs of this language.

The message of this book is that it is best to fear everyone that does not look like you.Jane Yolen projects current attitudes back into the past.While there is no doubt that European contact with the New World was disastrous for the people who lived here, this book doesn't tell that story. Instead, this book demonstrates that people who look different should be considered sub-human.Beautiful illustrations make the prejudiced message even more pernicious.Try reading it one time through as if it shows a group of white suburban people greeting the first mixed-race or non-white family to move into their neighborhood.

Unfortunately, this book seems to mark the downward slope of Nadine Miller's work - I've rated her subsequent books at one star.The problem is not so much the lead characters: these were interesting enough to keep me reading. But some of her secondary characters are too incredible for words, and - as in later books - there are plot twists which left me shaking my head in disbelief. There is the hero's other suitor, who seems at the beginning to be a decent enough person, if over-persistent; near the end of the book he turns out to be a near-villain! And the scene in the Viscount's grandfather's house at the end is too farcical for words. Absolutely incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikely plot, becomes ridiculous at the end","review":"Am I destined to hate books Lee Emory loves? At least it might help me recognise which books to avoid in future! <g>. Since Miller is the author of 'The Duke's Dilemma,' an excellent book and one which I notice Ms Emory hasn't reviewed, I thought this one was worth a try. It wasn't.Yes, Miller tries to bring some social concern into a Regency, which when done well does tend to appeal to me. But for some reason the characters just did not appear either particularly credible or sympathetic. The heroine's friend almost undergoes a personality transplant close to the end, and as for the final scene in the hero's grandfather's house, 'farcical' springs to mind.Since the later book of Miller's I've read is even worse, I really wonder what happened to that talent she showed in her first book.

Never before has such a grab-bag of Irish clichès (from abusive priests through drunken fathers to small-minded villagers) been so lauded for originality and profundity. Does any Irish person really need to be reminded all over again of how awful life in rural Ireland supposedly was?There is not an interesting observation nor a clever turn of phrase in the whole text. The entire novel seems both plotless and pointless - if there were no Manson-like murder at the end, there would be no readership for this novel and no attempts to project profundity onto it. Like the even worse American Psycho, it seems to require Grand Guignol elements and vulgarity to galvanize its readers into thinking that it must be deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"boring, the \\"adventures\\" of a stark raving mad looney bin candadate. the end is two dragded out which makes for the boring part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunatic rantings should be avoided","review":"What a load of hog slop.

Although I felt sorry for him, I could not identify with or like him as I could, say, Huck Finn, because he lacks Huck's wit, charm and innocent likeability. It might have been better as a short story, but as a novel it seemed to go on and on with a disappointing sameness. I saw no real \\"descent into madness\\", as Francie seemed half insane to begin with. All that having been said, the book gives a fairly good picture of what can happen to a child racked by guilt and shame, without friends of loving parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous","review":"Written in stream of consciousness, this book just takes you away into a little boy's life and fantasies.

I found this film extremely disappointing, in concept and execution. The fact that this is basically \\"air-band\\" -- actors mouthing lines to a tape of the music -- is quite obvious throughout. Hearing a mature heldentenor's voice coming out of the mouth of a slender snipet of a young boy is bizarre to say the least! The staging makes this static opera even more so.

I have seen it in Beyreuth (98 degrees Fahrenheit and in something that approached the back row which was incredibly uncomfortable) I am wedded to Parsifal I love it. That is until I put this DVD in the drive. The swooning overture put puppets (yes, puppets)on the screen. Not long afterwards we got Wagner's death mask, and then some idiocy when all the puppets had Wagner's head ( and with Wagner,although I'm a fan, you always have to take a peep to see if he might be getting the joke, and he usually does not.) This is serious music. The theme - durch Mitleid wissend/der reine Tor however can be reduced to babbling by any bad production. But if any Wagner opera did not need a puppet or two, Parsifal would score. The music is good but the production is Noddy in Walkure-land and should not be shown to any adult - ever. As it is two discs and not cheap, I should have liked someone to have stopped me from buying this bad set of disks."},{"rating":"1","title":"deception","review":"En voulant retrouver l'écoute que j'avais eue en 1982 dans un cinéma des Champs Elysées j'ai découvert que ce DVD ne permettait pas de sous titres en Franais!de plus la qualité de l'image est très médiocre.Je ne le conseille à personne.Jean-Pierre"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GOLDEN TURKEY AWARD FOR WORST OPERA MOVIE GOES TO.....","review":"Ok.....as you see by the title of this review, i didn't like it.

The daughter, Nore, and her father move to live with their new family in Shadow Grove, an old plantation. The stepmother, Lisette, is a beautiful woman who looks extremely young. Her two children, Josie and Gabe, are also very good looking. Josie, 13, wears a lot of makeup and wishes that she was older. Gabe is a tan and very cute guy who developes a crush on Nore. Nore, who does not like the idea of her father remarrying right after her mother's death, is somewhat upset by it all. She soon meets a carpenter who comes to work on the house with his father, Dave, who also developes a slight crush. Nore soon gets used to everything and loosens up a bit. But, as soon as she thought it was safe.... she learned the family's old and terrifying secret.... This book is for teens who like suspense and mystery. The book is somewhat confusing if you havn't raead about voo-doo and magic, though. But, above all, this book is a sure-fire 4 star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the review","review":"I thought this book was full of suspense, which was really great. On the otherhand, the end was pretty twisted, and that dissapointed me a little bit. I would have liked things to have turned out differently. The characters were intriguing as well as the plot of the story. I wanted nores dad to believe her about the Berge's internal youth so much and it was hard whenever he would shun her off. Some interesting history was tought about voodoo and Louisiana's swamps. Nore's stepmother is aware that she is a huge threat because of her sense of time. This also creates tension between Nore and her new stepfamily. It is as though she has an internal clock in her body. This has some romanticism intertwined because there are two guys who like nore, as well as one becoming a \\"hero\\" unexpectedly in the end. The science fiction was a great touch to make the story a little more fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I Read All Year","review":"Wow, when I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to everyone in the world. I read this book and my imagination went wild. The book was very interesting and full of suspense. In the book Lois Duncan wants you to put your full imagination torward it. Thats why I recommend this book. The main character is Nore. Her Mother dies and her dad re-marries. Nore thinks the woman is hiding something through the whole novel. In the end Nore finds out that she has been alive for more than a hundred years. Because of a potion. You see that Nore's father doesn't believe her at all in the whole story but in the end he finds out she wasn't lieing when she said Lisette was hiding everything from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read book!!!!!","review":"This was a really good book for teens and adults.

It has a VERY predictable ending. It's a B- letter grade book. Okay if you are really tired or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a lot of garbage","review":"This book was simply a waste of time. I don't even know why it was included in our 8th grade english curriculum. A book about a mystical evil woman who becomes immortal and eternally youthful through voodoo(?), as well her never-aging children. In addition, their charcters never evolve or will evolve (the evil mother, Lin or something, telling her daughter that she'll never mature) equally stupid. Thus, they are 'Locked in time' forever, and she keeps ensaring unsuspecting rich men into her trap until finally a dashing heroine has the guts to escape and put and end to these nefarious, but completely unoriginal, schemes. Interpersed are steamy romances and hysterics. The whole thing might have been taken from 'Arabian Nights' with a few modifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy...","review":"If you like creepy stories, this one is for you!

This book is about a 17 year old girl named Nore, whose mother died last year. That trajedy changed Nores life forever. Over the Summer Nore, had to visit her dad and his new family. However the new family, is not what Nore expected. The family struggles to get everyone to like each other. Nores father is a famous book writer, and the the step mom stays home. Nore and her new step family struggles, but Nore catches on. Nore found out very interresting information what her step family are trying to do to her and her father.

The ability to produce images and meaning in the way Kinnell does, denotes a certain amount of power I hope to possess.

The sources for tools and slate listed in the reference section alone is worth the price of the book.

Joe Jenkins covers all aspects of maintenance and repair in a manner that even the most novice slater... with the correct tools and a little skill... can correctly (and safely) repair his or her own roof. The reading is kept interesting by his use of anecdotes from his own experience. An excellent reference, right down to what size nails to use.

Such tidbits may seem odd in a construction book if you don't read the book, but when you do read it you'll see how everything said connects and helps you understand the topic better. Such pensmanship is rare, and I never thought I'd see it in a book about roofing.

Comments made by pregnant women on babycenter's website were put into the book, so expecting moms get tips from other pregnant women as well as from the professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent excerpts and Essays","review":"I greatly enjoyed the essays in this book, especially the ones by Emma Goldman, Carl Sagan, and Charles Darwin. Goldman is one of my favorite writers and her excerpt on Atheism is the best, in my opinion. Most are very good, and the essays by themself are 5 stars. However, like the other reviewers, I did not particularly like the intoruction, as it was poorly written and did made him seem ignorant as hell. Anyway, the essays are quite good, and you should look into the authors and read their whole work. While there are better books on Atheism out there, any Atheist, Agnostic, or especially any person of faith who wants to actually examine their faith, should read these essays (or better said the complete works of the writers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album Review","review":"This toy is nice and colorful..but there are not enough slots for photos!It was a little expensive, not the best value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover Is The Best Part About This Album....","review":"... as the music is not as good as you may want or wish it to be.

It has terrible gloss retention and you can't even touch it without putting finger prints in it for at least a week...now who wants to tye up a shop that long. If you're painting outside it attracts bugs and just because of the very poor drying time a lot of bugs have time to land. Bottom line...avoid this paint like the plague, unless you like a lousy job or having to do it over again.

The major problem is that with only one tea drinker in the house, the plastic mechanism in the handle that opens the spout cover broke after only nine months. Seems like a durable body with flimsier plastic in handles. Revere kettle 20 years, Copco less than one. Have email into manufacturer to ask about warranty.

What my rating is for is Artisan's (terrible) decision to put it in PAN AND SCAN not full frame. FULL FRAME refers to movie that were shot in 1.33:2 ratio like many of Stanley Kubrick's movie. In full frame you will see more on the top and bottom. In pan and scan you lose picture on the sides, like in this one. These ppl(Artisan) are complete idiots and they did the same thing with ginger snaps. i'm boycotting artisan. If Fartisan won't respect the integrity of a film's composition that they are releasing then they shouldn't be in the business of producing DVD's. It's the year 2002 and pan and scan dvd's should not be tolerated just because some idiots at blockbuster think they are \\"losing the picture\\" in widescreen. If they don't want widescreen then they shoul go back to VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened and ordered from England","review":"A fine performance from von Sydow, some dazzling setups by Argento, great music by Goblin, all to no effect because Artisan has chosen not to take original composition ratio seriously. A lousy pan-and-scan. Great movie, lousy edition. A waste of my money. Better than nothing? Maybe that's what the second star is for."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DON'T I READ THE REVIEWS!!?!??!","review":"No Widescreen? Golfball sized grain? Editing that looks like it was done with a meatcleaver held in the pudgy fist of Emeril? YES! It is ALL HERE! Artisan does it again as they prove they are to great horror films what Madacy is to public domain! Please film producers, we implore you--DO NOT LICENSE YOUR FILMS TO ARTISAN! They'll only be returned like the full screen atrocity I purchased and no one will be pleased. License your films to Anchor Bay, heck, even Synapse, at least Argento, one of the last of our beloved Italian giallo manufacturers, will get the respect--and releases--he deserves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Argento's style saves the film from being a complete disaster","review":"An old case from the 80's brings back ex-cop Max von Sydow (Minority Report) who was on the case at the time. The killer was suspected to be a dwarf back then and now as well, so he thinks. Helping Sydow is Giacamo, played by Stefano Dionisi and the two of them are on their own investiagation. While on the investigation, Sydow finally realizes that the killer is using an old childs nursery ryhme in which the killer leaves paper animals and the animals represent the people the killer kills. This thriller's only fuel is Argento's style of direction, although there are a couple unexpected moments and when they reveal the killer but the acting is really bad and some times annoying. The scene where Argento strolls the camera down a carpet, I was waiting for someone to trip and fall in front of the camera. For those Die Hard Argento junkies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artisan leave Argento Alone!","review":"Will Argento's work ever be given the justice it deserves. Sleepless as a film is a classic. An interesting story, plot twists, inventive murders all the things that made Argentos earlier work great. Then Artisan has the nerve to butcher his art by cropping the film into a full frame version. Everyone who is familiar with Argento's work knows that his films must be shown in widescreen. How this passed over Artisan ,who claims they are some big new indie film company, is any ones guess. And why can't we have English subtitles? Mirimax, Artisan, New Line and all the others need to quite releasing foriegn films. Leave it to companies like Anchor Bay and Image."},{"rating":"1","title":"US version total rip off!","review":"I have seen the US version of this film and I feel betrayed! They seriously cut so much out of the Rated-R version and I'm sure the one amazon is selling is censored also even if it does say unrated. Get the dvd elsewhere, perhaps even on ebay. I could not enjoy the video properly. They could of shown this on regular television since it was cut drastically, no gore at all. Murder scenes cut so quickly you did not know what happened to the victims or a even seen a shot of blood until the very end when you see blood dripping from a window when the credits start rolling! So once again, do NOT support the US Rated R version, get an uncut version of this film because you will be missing out on so much!! Do not rent at Hollywood video nor block buster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Widescreen????","review":"Dario Argento's stylish and ultra-gory giallo is a return to form for the maestro and will definitely please his long-time fans. Unfortunately, it looks like Artisan's upcoming DVD will be FULL-FRAME only and not widescreen as previously announced(...). So buyer beware. If you really want to see \\"NONHOSONNO\\" in it's correct aspect ratio, pick up the Italian DVD instead (if you have a region-free player) because it is uncut, letterboxed and has an english track. Obviously Artisan is just releasing their \\"Sleepless\\" version as just another cheap horror title to fill up Blockbuster shelves. Unbelievable that even in 2001 Argento is still treated this way in the US. No wonder he stays in Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"Is this the beginning of some sort of trend? I've been collecting DVDs since the format debuted, and I've been quite happy to see that even smaller titles have been available in widescreen. Now that the format is becoming incredibly popular, there seems to be a trend to go with P&S on some titles (family, horror, etc.) DVD is not just another video format, it's a way to preserve films as they should be seen, and as such should always represent the most complete version of the film. There's just no excuse for cropping and chopping the movie to fit a soon-to-be-obsolete tv format."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLEEPLESS gets 5 stars..This Edit gets only ONE","review":"Damn you Artisan Entertainment!I've been waiting months and months to get my hands on the new Argento classic and Artisan not only delivers a weak Pan And Scan copy of the film, they edit out 90% of the violence. The elaborate and dark murder scenes are a trademark of Argento's films and without them, the film is still great but to us Argento fans, it feels like something is missing. It just goes to show that after over 30 years of making great films, Dario Argento still doesn't get half the respect in America he deserves. Anchor Bay should have gotten their hands on this film first, atleast they are respectful to the film and the fans and are not raping good cinema like Artisan. I say rent this movie for now and wait and pray that a director's cut is released in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Sleeping Pills...Sleepless will make you sleepy","review":"After getting hooked on Dario Argento films such as Suspiria and Opera... I was looking forward to seeing his most recent film, Sleepless...particularly because \\"GOBLIN\\" was supplying the soundtrack again (Goblin played the soundtrack on Suspiria which actually helped make that film so good)Unfortunately, Sleepless just drones on and on. The plot is not as suspenseful and the acting is horrible! Wheras Suspiria would kept me on the edge of my seat with uncertainty as to what would happen next, Sleepless bored me to sleep...not once, not twice...but actually 3 times during playback! The Goblin soundtrack rather than heightening the feeling of suspense...is actually quite tame and helps intensify the sleepy feeling...I was very disappointed with this effort by Dario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, pity about the DVD","review":"As has been mentioned by those before, Artisan has thoughtlessly given us a full-screen disc which, quite honestly, looks cheap. I've seen better-looking VHS-images.NOTE that the version I saw WAS UNCUT, but I do not know which version Amazon is selling. The disc itself SAYS UNCUT right on it, and obviously this is the one you want (should you want to bother buying it at all). The film itself is rather graphic, and while not a total return-to-form for Argento, it's certainly a step in the right direction after his last few mis-fires. I'd give the film itself four out of five stars, but this horrid transfer gets only one (yeah yeah, I know, I rounded-off my rating to two stars.... I just can't bear to give an Argento film only one star, even with a transfer this poor...!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"I can't believe that in this day and age any company would put something out this badly. WHY BOTHER? Who did they think would buy it?I just realized that people could take this to mean the movie itself is bad. I LOVED this movie when I finally saw it on my all region player WIDE SCREEN.

I liked more a previous edition that contents only the maps. The tourist information is scarce but since it's added to all states, the atlas becomes too thick and heavy.

This becomes evident during the intro as it builds into Eagles fly free. The music (in my mind) creates a battle set in a fantasy world. I think that this album captures what so many other bands fail to do when creating a more fantasy based album. IT achieves this without taking itself too seriously which becomes evident in Dr. Stein.The musicianship is excellent, with a twin guitar attack that is highly utilized, that does not just double the same riff, and easily identifiable as European.This album is what would happen if Iron Maiden had a sense of humor. If your tired of hearing tuned down metal bands talking about how bad life is,this might be what you need to get away. Recommended to fantasy lovers and Iron Maiden fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"When I read the reviews of this album on Amazon, I rushed down to the music store expecting to purchase an truly epic metal album.
