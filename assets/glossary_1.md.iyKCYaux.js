Our son complained that the seat hurt and we saw that it left red marks whenever he sat down. The splash guard in the front isn't hallow so when he did pee it went all over the place. My son freaked out because he didn't like getting his feet and chest covered with pee and we had a hard time getting him to sit on it again. We ended up getting rid of it because it was making potty training harder rather than easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daught likes it.","review":"She's still being potty trained, but she likes to sit on the chair.

My first was the fisher price fun to learn potty, which costs about $5 more and is shaped like a regular toilet with the pretend flush handle. My son thought it was a toy and constantly \\"flushed\\" to hear the music instead of sitting on it. When this potty arrived and I took it out the box, he grabbed it and said \\"mine\\" and immediately sat down on it. He started using it the very next day and it's been a success so far. I don't know if it's the potty or if he's just ready to be potty trained (he just turned 3) but I do know that he loves his potty. I highly recommend getting this and forget about the bells and whistles of the fisher price model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Clean","review":"We had bought a potty chair when our son turned 2, when he started using it a few months later I was greatly disappointed, I spent so much time trying to keep it clean, it had lots of little cracks and crevices and it was not really big enough. After reading reviews on this potty I decided to buy it. ..boy am I glad I did, this potty is larger than most of the ones I have seen and it is so easy to keep clean. My son is not a large 2 year old and he had trouble with the one we originally bought. We have no more messes on the floor and this simple two piece design makes keeping it cleaned a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right!","review":"And he sat on the weee little chair, and it fit him just right. I purchased this potty along with the Once Upon a Potty DVD, which at 22 months my son wasn't too excited about, but at 25 months and just today infact, he woke up dry and was ready to use the potty for the first time. I chose white to match with our Big Potty and love how all the curves are soft on it. It also has a back rest so they are encouraged to sit all the way back. Also, the seat just lends itself to pinch-free comfort. The little cup is easy to pour, clean and put back for little hands. We bought two, one for upstairs and one for the downstairs. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints as of yet","review":"I picked this potty up 2 days ago and I really can't complain. My daughter is 9 months old and seems to have no problem with it. I do understand some of the concerns with pee coming out because it happened to us yesterday. I didn't make a big deal about it and it didn't seem to bother her. I happened to have it sitting on a waterproof pad, just incase, so nothing got on my carpet. But she seems very comfortable on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I definitely would recommend it","review":"This was the second potty that we tried, and we finally found it. Definately great for boys!

I looked at all the potty chairs possible and read reviews and this one sounded perfect. So I got my boy excited about this one and let him pick the color out. He was so excited when it came and wanted to sit on it right away (this is what I was hoping for when I bought it) he probably wasn't on it more then 10 seconds and said it hurt his bum. We tried several more times and same thing. He is an average size toddler so I am not sure what size of kid this would be comfortable for. I ended up getting next the babybjorn toilet trainer and it is awesome. He loves it, it doesn't hurt him and the splash guard is great for a little boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you have a girl","review":"I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I bought this potty chair for my 11 months old.

Order fulfillment weird.","review":"I've owned one of the Baby Bjorn potties before, but must have lost it during a move or maybe even given away? This is a replacement for a potty I already had and was greatly looking forward to using again with my toddler son. As others have said, easy to clean and sterilize due to simple design, and comfortable to sit in.I did want to say, though, that the packaging was weird. The potty arrived very quickly thanks to my Prime membership, but upon opening the box I found just some paper filler, and the potty in a plastic bag. No baby bjorn box. I'm sure it's new - I examined the pieces closely and found nothing suspect. I'd just feel more confident with this had it arrived packaged in an original box. This is not the sort of item you'd want to buy if you knew it had been returned already used. Amazon's description does say they don't accept this on returns, so okay, but still...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean","review":"We have this potty in green. I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $12!! If I would have known how much I would love this potty, I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child. I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts. It makes cleaning much easier. No one enjoys cleaning out a potty, but it's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean. Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices. I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I'm done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love","review":"My daughter is 6 months old and I decided to start potty training her:) best idea ever! the back support of this particular potty is great, since she cannot sit by herself all that good.

A book or the favorite toy also helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for my son's bottom","review":"I bought this after reading many reviews for different products. I am disappointed because my son cannot sit on it for more than a few minutes without complaining that his bottom hurts. When he gets up his bottom is completely red.

I am now looking for a softer seat to set on the bathroom toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Boys that Stand Up","review":"Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk.

I had bought my daughter one when she began potty training my 2 year old grandson, but not one for my home. I was using a potty insert and a stool and found little Ben was having trouble getting on. I asked how the BabyBjorn was working and she told me he uses it only. She was so right, I am so happy to have purchased this; mine is blue and her's is red. He loves it; it is sturdy, easy to clean, and does not move when he sits down or gets up.Wonderful item and I highly recommend for the daunting task of potty training! I plan on this being my number #1 baby shower gift from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty Chair","review":"I got this potty chair for my daughter when she started potty training at 19 months. She never complained about sitting on it and I loved how high it sat because she is extremely tall for her age. She is able to pull the little bucket out and dump it herself now without making a mess. We recently started toilet training with the baby bjorn toilet seat and it was a good transition for her and she still likes to use her little green potty for her #2's because she doesn't like people helping her in that area. It is a great chair and worth the extra few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mini-toilet for your toddler","review":"This is a child sized toilet. It is attractive looking. We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house. Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it. I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse. My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that. I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet. We are big fans of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great basic potty","review":"This is working just fine, no regrets, in fact I purchased two.

So ofcourse grammy bought her one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best potty chair","review":"I have boy/girl twins and we tried 2 or 3 different potty chairs before I found the Baby Bjorn. It is the only one I tried that does not leak. The built in splash guard at the front is great. The other chairs had a splash guard that was removable my kids immediately removed it and lost it. The Baby Bjorn chair is sturdy and all edges are smooth. The insert goes in from the top and is easily removed. The other potty chairs with the inserts underneath were very difficult to get postitioned correctly and remove without spilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splash Guard for Girls?","review":"I LOVED the design of this potty when I saw it at the store. It only has 2 parts which would make it easy to clean. I loved the solid color because I thought we could decorate it with stickers when we used the potty correctly. It seemed perfect until I brought it home and showed it to my daughter. This potty has a built in splash guard that is not removable. My daughter has a difficult time sitting on this potty because of the splash guard. She tries to sit to the side to avoid sitting on the bump in the middle. We've been practicing sitting on it for several weeks now and she just doesn't seem comfortable with it. I'm so disappointed because this potty seemed perfect but I think we're going to have to find something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loves it","review":"Our three year old son immediately loved this chair (we ordered it in his \\"favowit\\" color green). He is fairly tall for his age but can still sit in it comfortably and it looks like shorter children could as well. My only complaint is that when he stands to tinkle, the urine inevitably hits the back of the seat and the design is such that it leaks underneath. It's easy for us to clean because we have mostly hardwood or tile floors but I can wouldn't recommend this for homes with mostly carpeting. I know our son likes to have his potty chair in various rooms in the house so it could make quite a mess. Other than that, though, it's lightweight, easy to transport if needed, easy to clean/dump in the toilet and my son loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this potty!","review":"I bought this potty based on the reviews and absolutely love it! I thought I would try out potty training with my 8 month old son and its been a breeze so far. No messy clean up and he sits on it with no problem. He's a little taller than most 8 month olds. I am definately satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chair","review":"I have this for my almost 3 year old son who is around 30lbs and very tall. He loves this seat. He fits in it just fine, we have had no trouble with leaks, and he finds it very easy to use on his own. The potty is very easy to clean, and we have never had a problem with pee getting everywhere. The one thing I would change is that sometimes the removable seat does get stuck to his thighs when he stands, but he's learned to be careful, and we've never had an accident due to that. Otherwise, great potty training seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too small,not good for boys","review":"we bought this one for my son who is 3. it is too small for him. the pee comes right over the pee guard. they should have made the pee guard a little bigger and the seat bigger too. my son weighs about 39 lbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made for boys","review":"BabyBjörn Potty Chair - BlueMy baby is 12 months and 24lbs.

My son loves this potty and the color. He feels that it's his \\"special potty\\" and has taken to it very easily. The fact that it's \\"his own\\" has made potty training a breeze, as he loves the experience of going completely on his own on a poty that's his favorite cover.

He's 19 months now and still very comfortable using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable for my daughter","review":"I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews. My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer! She'll sit on it, but it's so small. The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her. She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her. When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love the simplicity of this potty. It doesn't have a bunch of distractions, or anything to 'scare' a toddler. My only issue is that my little girl always wants to pull the little bowl part out and wear it as a 'hat'. She has yet to potty in the chair, but I'm nervous that when she does, she will still pull it out, and make a huge mess. I didn't consider that before I bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrating, but a great size","review":"My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38\\" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable...","review":"While this chair works fine, it's just not comfortable. My son's little bottom is so red after just sitting on it for a short time! He ends up either standing for some relief or moving around the chair in an attempt to find a comfortable position. If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with a cushy seat. Wouldn't buy this one again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, easy potty-training","review":"This is a great potty for potty training. I use this for my 2 year old, and it's a good size for him to sit on. It also has a pee-pee guard (I'm sure there's a technical name for it), so he doesn't spray all over when sitting down. It's very easy to pull the white part out and clean it with each use. It's also very, very light, so I can carry it up and down the stairs to different bathrooms. Good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty","review":"My daughter loves this potty. She actually thinks using it is fun. My wife and I have bought a few other potties that just didn't work that well. This one is perfect. We are so happy we bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty","review":"I love this potty. Because it only has two pieces to it, its easy to clean. The high pee-guard means no need to supervise when my son is using it. We don't ever have any splashing incidents.

My two children (ages 3 and 2) loved their chairs and were potty trained in no time using the Baby Bjorn potty chairs. I previously purchased one that played songs when they went potty, but I quickly found it was very difficult to clean and to move around the house (too many parts). I loved the fact that is was so very easy to clean - no cracks or grooves or lids to worry about! And I loved the portability of the chair. It is lightweight and easy to move around the house (I would use it in the children's playroom when they could not make it to the bathroom). The Baby Bjorn could easily be used in your vehicle as well. Great simple design and very comfortable for the children to use as well. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Potty","review":"This is a great potty. The biggest issue to me was cleaning. This chair has no seems or corners to trap things. The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth. The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they won't hurt themselves while getting on. The base is very solid and sturdy and doesn't move at all. It also looks comfortable with the arm rests. My son isn't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it. He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book. Does what it should and doesn't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty","review":"My little girls likes using this over the other potty that we got, personally i think it works better than other, cheaper ones, i like the hard seat so she doesnt want to sit there forever, and it forces her to get in the proper \\"position\\" which she doesnt always achieve the other potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good seat so far","review":"My daughter is 18 months and used this potty chair for the first time this evening.

I would love a solution that works for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short time but so far i'm impressed","review":"Okay so I ordered this potty from amazon based on the reviews. I have 16 month old boy and figured why not get this started. I looked at many potty chairs and spent days reading reviews before deciding on this one. I just received it today and my son has made tinkles on it 4 times in 6 hours. He absolutely loves it, the last two times he sat there for about 10 minutes waiting to tinkle a second time. It was super easy to clean and at first impression I'm really happy!!!One week later and nothing but success I love the simple design it is so easy to keep clean and the splash guard works great!!!

We moved and gave it back to them, as they had another younger boy and needed it. It is SO GOOD for boys especially, b/c the splash guard is HIGH and pee doesn't wiz everywhere. Also, it is SO SIMPLE to clean (just two parts) from an adult perspective. So, I bought this for my younger son (now 2.5 yrs and potty training) BUT, my younger son isn't really that into it. He sort of likes the other (cheaper and actually more annoying & more messy) potty. So, long story short, it's a good potty, especially for boys, but every kid is different and (as my older son says, \\"Mom, kids like what they like...\\") each has their own opinion (especially 2 yr olds!), so you never know if this will be \\"the one\\" they want to use and get trained on! GOOD LUCK with potty training!"},{"rating":"1","title":"much clean up","review":"This potty is good if your child sits still and doesn't move and if its a boy can aim perfectly.

The Baby Bjorn only has one removable piece, and everything is always in the bowl. I love how simplistic it is. The sizable \\"horn\\" on the front of the bowl keeps the firing zone covered for little boys which is a major bonus.My son is on medication which causes difficulty going. I decided that he may have success (and better health) if he were able to sit on a potty and relax. My concern before I ordered the chair was that it would not fit him properly since he is only 14 months old. Needless to say, we now are proud owners of a Baby Bjorn potty, and my baby puts a proud \\"poo poo\\" in it every day. The design is perfect for any little person to straddle, and their feet can rest on the floor so that they are confident and not afraid to fall off. This also gives them leverage for a \\"good push\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid potty seat","review":"I am getting ready to potty train my 2 year old girl. I've owned two other potty chairs for my 4 year son, but wanted to try this particular chair. It looked more durable, simple, and I love the colors. I have no need for the bells and whistles of the new chairs.Also, I have been a fan of Bjorn for their infant carriers and their AWESOME plastic bibs. So far, the chair seems stable and sturdy. My girl sometimes has a hard time getting her leg over the 'splash guard' - which I think would be great if Bjorn made the bowl versitle, with the splash guard on one end for boys and one without on the other end for girls. I've tried to turn it but it doesn't fit in the chair right. But otherwise, so far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this hasn't been recalled","review":"I bought this potty mainly due to all the positive reviews. It's a good size, sleek, and simple. Unfortunately, my daughter became so excited to use it that she ran to the potty and sat down on the splash guard, which is hard plastic. We ended up at the doctor with a laceration, and weeks of screaming every time she needed to urinate. She's never used ANY potty ever again, and she's 2 1/2. This product is okay for very small children whose parents can seat them. For older children that will seat themselves, choose one without a splash guard. They will splash regardless. A little pee on the floor is better than a traumatized child and stitches. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"mother of tiny girls","review":"If you are looking for a smaller sized potty LOOK NO FURTHER! My girls are consider very small for their ages. My 21 month old daughter (She is the one the seat is for) weights about 19lbs and wears a size 3 diaper with room to grow.this seat is PERFECT for her. she doesn't fall in. I love Graco and i have the training rewards potty from my other daughter but the little one slides through the seat w/ a diaper.I find it easy to clean too. She has only went #1 once so far but that's another story LOL.I give it a 4 only because I don't think it would be good for older kids or babies big for their age trying to train. I'm thinking from the looks of it, it can hold a child up to 25 lbs give or take. Nor can i say how good or bad it is for boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great potty","review":"This is a great potty. It seems very comfortable for my little guy. He's only 9 months old, but we started potty training at 6.5 months. He loves it and stays put there. Easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST potty chair-ever!","review":"Even though it's on the expensive side, we now always by this chair for boy baby showers! It's absolutely the easiest to clean chair out there, and the one that gives the boys the room they need! Boys have a very hard time finding potty chairs that are deep enough for their parts to avoid squishing and touching the guard (yuck!). My son was able to dump the potty himself from about 18 months old (we didn't encourage it, it just happened), with no spilling. The high back is great for those long waits; my son likes to use the back and arms for leverage when going #2. The firmness of the chair has NEVER bothered any of the kids that have used it here.I was really worried about spending my money on it... but it's one of the best baby items we have every had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems expensive, but the simplicity is worth it.","review":"How can the simplest of potty seats be the most expensive? In this case, you must pay for the simplicity and functionality of this design. We looked at many other potty seats with music, lights, lids, and countless other useless bells and whistles. You would have to clean those things at a car wash to get in all the crevices and moving parts. This seat is stable, simple, and easy to clean - just like the one I had when I was 2. I guess no one but Baby Bjorn thinks simple functionality is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"I let my 24-month old son choose the color (RED!) of his new potty chair. When it got here I let him sit on it before and after his bath and he went potty that first night! Since then he has gone 5 nights in a row--he loves this potty chair! It is so easy to dump the potty in the toilet and rinse out the basin (I do it in the tub)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for big kids","review":"I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3\\" & 30 pounds. (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes. It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said \\"oh mommy my legs!\\" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience. He is now afraid of it.I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now. I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard seat","review":"I just bought this potty seat and my son will not sit in it more than 5 minutes. He complains that it hurts his back and bum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Potty","review":"This is exactly what I expected. This chair is a good height for our daughter. The molded chair doesn't have any seams, which makes it very easy to keep clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect potty chair","review":"This potty is stable even on slick surfaces due to the rubber rim on the bottom. It is SO nice to be able to simply lift the bowl out to clean. We use this with our daughters ages (almost) 2 and (almost) 3. They both love it and often race to see who gets to use it first! The backrest and roomy feel seem like a great design, and my kids must agree, as I have never noticed them to care much about other potties. The colors are great too! I like the splash guard as it helps the girls to sit in a more natural position to go potty (legs apart). Also, being solid plastic is a plus for me as our last seat had the \\"soft-seat\\" style top and would literally absorb urine. This seat will ensure you a clean, odor-free potty for your little one. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good potty for boys..","review":"Although many people have given this high reviews, I simply do noy like this potty. Everytime my son sits down to pee it sprays everywhere, even when he \\"aims\\" it down.

I guess nothing is perfect..."},{"rating":"2","title":"my 23 months went potty on this by himself","review":"My 23 months went potty on this by himself.I couldn't be happier with this product.Works well for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Potty Seat","review":"This chair is so easy to use and comfortable for my tall two year old son. It was hard to find a potty that is tall enough for him, so he didn't feel like he was sitting on the floor. The base is really wide and I have no fear of it slipping or tipping over. It was a little more on the pricey side, but the quality is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your son STANDS up to potty...","review":"This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up. Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it. I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart potty better","review":"I like it but like the Smart potty by BabyBjorn better. Its smaller and more easily stored away. Other than that this one is easy to use as well, inside comes out and outside easy to clean as well. it's just so big and my son seems to prefer the smart potty as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"super for your pooper","review":"It's silly how much though effort and research went into our purchase of a potty chair for my daughter, nonetheless it paid off. Is she trained yet? No. But, that doesn't make this any less of a good purchase. We have the full size Baby Bjorn chair in the bathroom and this is our travel option. My daughter likes this chair, however it isn't comfortable to sit on for long periods of time. It's one piece construction makes it easy to clean and prevents the child from getting it on them too. Baby Bjorn has done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty","review":"Baby Bjorn Potty Chair - GreenI went through two pottys for my son before i came across this one. it fits him perfect, and he just loves it. would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great for my boy","review":"I love this potty chair. My son is very tall for his age and was too small for the other chairs. When he would sit on them his little hoo-ha would hang over the edge and he would end up peeing all over the floor. This potty is such a great chair. The oval shape allows plenty of room for boy's parts. He can even swirm around on the chair and I don't have to worry about pee on the floor. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Doc!","review":"While I don't feel this series was as strong as the first four, I wouldn't have missed it and can't wait for Series 6 which I guess has been given the \\"green light\\". Just feel the writing and character development was better in the earlier series. Don't feel Louisa's mother added much to the story and too much time was wasted on her. It would be great if Doc Martin got a smart, savvy receptionist for a change to give him a run for his money. I do think if you've enjoyed 1-4 you won't want to go without this,and here's hoping Series 6 will be back to their old, wonderful standards.

I have never been fond of British humor. A tad dry, that is until I accidentally ran into Doc Martin. The writing is above average as well as the acting, with Doc Martian being the focal point around the series, watching a person from the city deal with country people with different values is one thing, but these people are all comedians without coming across as a comedian, but simple country people.I have all five of the seasons and everyone is simply the cheapest investment in anything I have ever made. In fact the series has been good enough to watch 3 and 4 times, always leaving you with wanting more and wondering what life would be like without our Doc Martin. I hope I will never have to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumps shark in series 5","review":"Doc Martin was one of our favorite British TV shows...until Series 5. With Series 5 something has gone horribly wrong. The situations aren't funny, the characters are extremely irritating. Auntie Joan has disappeared and been replaced by a Martin's cold obnoxious mother. Louisa has had her baby and in almost every scene we have to see the baby drooling in his high chair. I suppose some people consider this to be cute, but it's very distracting. The humor of the first 4 seasons came from the rather compulsive and superior Doc interacting with quirky but good natured locals. Now, with Series 5, the locals are much more unlikable than before. Therefore there is very little humor. Doc Martin has just become another rather tedious soap opera. The dialog is no longer witty, the conflicts are dramatic, but unenlightening. As a soap opera it's just sub-par."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doc knows all!","review":"We didn't begin watching the Doc during the first season but have rapidly caught up with him.

Hope for a season 6. Continues to offer quirky characters, unique situations and excellent acting. Martin Clunes has become my favorite actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING 5TH SEASON","review":"I have to agree with many reviewers that the 5th season is disappointing. We got to know Dr. Martin as uptight, rude and cold man and still accepted him as such, because he is also a brilliant devoted doctor and a hero at times.But what's hard to accept is the fact that the birth of his love child with Louisa, a cute baby boy, did not change him one bit. In fact it doesn't make sense that he seems even more pissed off than ever in the 5th season, and there are no moments of emotional connection between him and Louisa or him and the baby what so ever.On top of that, the 3 new characters in the 5th season; the new female doctor, Martin aunt Ruth and Louisa's mother are all rather unpleasant problematic women. And the new receptionist Morwenna is just a bore.I am still looking forward to the 6th season in 2013, but really hope that Dr. Martin will loosen up and change for the better and enjoy his life with the lovely Louisa and their son."},{"rating":"1","title":"grumpy to nasty","review":"I am a fan of Clunes, but I am very disappointed in the series five. I was hoping he was slowly going to become more like William (William and Mary), but instead he becomes an even nastier Doc Martin and oh so cold. It's hard to laugh when he treats his wife so poorly, and what a father! I am just so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed in Series 5 of Doc Martin","review":"Loved Series 1-4. Watched them all. Some more than once. Series 5 is a total disappointment. What has happened to the writers? Miss Aunt Joan...and Pauline...and the relationship between Al and Pauline.

Martin Clunes is marvelous at portraying the Doc who is a major grump with no social skills or beside manner, yet is super competent and totally dedicated to delivering the best health care to the host community. It is a joy to watch him interact with the quirky residents of small Portwenn, a fishing village dramatically carved into the coast line of Cornwall, UK.The Doc's romantic interest Louisa, the headmistress of the local elementary school, is played by the lovely Catherine Catz, who's personality is the complete opposite to the Doc's.

The whole thing is great fun, so let yourself become one the Doc's addicts where the only cure is to watch all 5 series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lousy bedside manors...","review":"This Doc Martin series has its moments when you want to strangle him and others where your heart goes out to him.

It doesn't match up against the original cast, with the exception of \\"Molasses to Rum to Slaves\\", which is done VERY well. But no matter how you slice it, it is the ESSENCE of the show that matters most, and this show has more substance, more essence and more meaning that just about anything else out there. Check the entire script out from your local library if it doesn't happen to be playing anywhere near you and you'll be DOUBLY impressed with the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor to the great original.","review":"The recording of the revival cast of the musical 1776 is almost but not quite as good as the William Daniels-Rex Everhart original. I did appreciate the addition of some extra music and lyrics from the show (my first copy of the original cast album was on 8-track, which dates me pretty effectively!) although the \\"Time's Running Out\\" sequence is still sadly missing. Still, this recording is still well-worth getting for fans of the show and movie. My biggest reservation has nothing to do with the show or the recording, but is due to the fact that this is only the second CD I have ever run across that nowhere, either on the CD cover or in the liner notes, identifies the numbering of the musical selections (although they are numbered on the actual disc.) This means that if you want to listen to a particular track you either have to have a good memory or skip around the disc to locate it. A pointless flaw in an otherwise fine recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"This music will inspire you to love American history. It will take you on a journey so that you feel as though you are in Phillie.

I am sure you will find that the talent Brent Spiner displays in this musical can not even be described with words. I saw this show on Broadway. And I must tell you that listening to this soundtrack puts me back in the Gershwin every time. Every member of the cast shows tremendous talent and there is no weak link.

I wish it was the original!","review":"I have been a huge fan of the original cast of 1776 and have all the tracks memeorized.....ok I'm a geek. I bought the original cast recording a long time ago and played it non-stop. I did notice it had some flaws like echoes in the recording. I found the 1997 version and wondered how it sounded. I read people's reviews and thought wow this sounds like it would be a huge success! I do admit the songs sounded decent right up until \\"The Lees of Old Virginia\\" which is my favorite song in the musical. I loved the original (Ron Holgate)'s version and his character better. I heard this version and wanted to laugh. No offense, but the guy sounds like he has a clothes-pin clamped on his nose and he is on the toilet! I'm a public vocal performer myself so I know how tough it is, but come on, you're on Broadway now. He may have the advantage of better recording equipment, but he can't project with the same resonance at all! Ronald Holgate all the way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one great CD!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this!!!! There is such a variety of songs and it makes you see the signing of the declaration in a totally different way. Brent Spiner is amazing as John Adams, and his songs with Linda Emond (Abigail Adams) like \\"Yours, yours, yours\\" and his finale \\"Is anybody there?\\" are both quite heart-wrenching, you can feel his energy even if you can't see him!! Merwin Foard as Richard Henry Lee gives an energetic performance of \\"The Lees of Old Virginia\\" which makes for a nice light-hearted number, contrasting greatly witht the more solemn \\"Molasses to Rum\\" sung by Greg Edelman, addressing the heated issue of slavery. This is one of my all time favs and I really recommend you buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Skeptic to Fan in one listen","review":"I was surprised at how much I liked \\"1776.\\" The concept (a musical about the signing of the Declaration of Independence) seems so ludicrous at first, that I was sure it must be a bad musical. I was wrong, wrong, wrong.The CD hooked me first, with the musicals elegant tunes and poignant lyrics. The excitement of this period is fully captured in the characters and story. \\"1776\\" manages that rare blend of comedy, drama and romance. Historical characters that I had never thought much of come alive, without mockery.I have no particular attachment to Brent Spiner or Pat Hingle, and I have never heard the original recording. I felt that both men sang proudly and well. Their voices did justice to the songs and the story.After loving the CD so much, I had the chance to see \\"1776\\" performed. Wow! It's a great musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"can i give it no stars? no? darn. . .","review":"Okay, I saw this musical with my school, at Ford's Theater of all places. A review I read there said that the reviewer was \\"enraptured\\" and \\"could hardly breathe.\\" Me, I could hardly breathe for laughing so hard at the sheer stupidity of the songs. As for being enraptured, i DID have to stare hard at the stage a lot, simply because i forgot my glasses. . . Anyway, this music is pathetic, though it was fun to imitate afterwards. It's not worth seeing or listening to. It IS hard to write a musical about the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Why did they bother? In more simple terms, IT SUCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MUSICAL IN SEARCH OF BETTER VOICES","review":"This recording really lacks the one necessary ingredient - great voices - that made the original recording so wonderful. When this first came out, the music as both incredibly singable and memorable for the very reason that the voices were so good and it stuck with you.I would skip this latest release and get the original cast recording. It's just so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Broadway Revolution","review":"This show has revolutionized Broadway in it's own way. It is a fantastic display of intense emotions on stage. All you have to do is listen to the music, and you know that this is true. There is no better show that can be offered.1776 proves to be witty, powerful, and interesting and all will shine through with this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education REALLY made fun!","review":"Excellent, excellent,excellent! I am only 10 years old and I loved this musical on broadway and when I got this music I began listening to it 24 hours a day. It taught me loads about the Declaration of Independence! I now have memorized all the songs. Though some of the lyrics are a bit corny the songs are still entertaining, educational, and fun! I highly reccomend this product! Don't sit there piddling, twiddling, and resolving, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The history lesson we want to stay up for.","review":"It seemed to me a strange thing to make a musical about the declaration of independence's signing. But when I first veiwed the film version which knocked me for a loop. And obviously I wanted to get the soundtrack. It's too bad I missed this revival I would've loved to catch this one. I was happy to hear the fun and catchy tunes by Sherman Edwards ranging from the delightfully conceited \\"Lees of Old Virginia\\" and the hilarious purility of \\"But Mr. Adams\\" and the snobbily rhytmatic \\"Cool, Coll, Considerate Men.\\" but then turns around to become and emotional powerhouse in the song \\"Momma Look Sharp.\\" Brent Spiner's performance is a tad less serious as William Daniels from the original production and movie, but ends up making it up in his singing voice which dwarves Daniels and shows it in \\"Is Anybody There.\\" The music in this film make you hum them continuously over and over. I just bought this recording and I've already listened to it 10 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cathe Friedrich's Rhythmic Step & Interval Max & MIC DVD","review":"I have been doing step for many years and even though it's on a DVD it is the best step class I've ever taken.

A good solid one. A little easier, as another reviewer wrote, than IMAX 2 or 3. Still definitely very intense and will kick your butt.I finally got around to doing Rhymthic Step. What fun! Not as difficult but full of fun choreography (just like her newer \\"Step Moves\\" dvd).The last one (Maximum Intensity Cardio), I started and turned it off in about two minutes. To me, that kind of \\"little short jerky bouncing movements in place with no step\\" reminds me of when I was 9 and did Jane Fonda videotapes with my mom in the 80s... :) It's hard to work out very hard (in my opinion) when you're not moving up and down. All that bouncing puts strain on the Achilles and hip flexors. Maybe I'll try it again later. I did only run it for two minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, A lot better than stock","review":"I put these in my 2003 Neon SXT about 2-3 years ago and what a difference. They are way better than stock lights and, not as much glare. I finally had 1 burn out and just the 1 bulb puts more light on the road than my stock lights did with both working. Now I'm going to try the SilverStar Ultra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words - it died","review":"It was quite an opportune time for Amazon to ask me to review this item, because it just died on me :)After a few weeks of great use, one day on plugging in I got a \\"device not recognized\\" error on plugging in, and that's where it has stayed. Luckily the hard disk is fine, I tested it in another enclosure.I don't see any obvious problems (like burnt circuitry), so have no idea what happened.

It's a wonderful blend of punk energy mixed with the odd instrument that gives it a folky touch, such as the penny whistle and didgeridoo. \\"Anchor Tattoo\\" is the stand out track, with an incredible bass line and infectious chorus that can stand with the best of Celtic rock bands. Other tracks such as \\"Serenity\\", \\"Coming Home\\", and the instrumental \\"Pishi\\" are refreshingly unique and give the album weight that only gets better and better with each listen. I hope these guys start to get the recognition soon that they've been deserving for so many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Waldo Book","review":"\\"Where's Waldo\\" books are one of those gems that can be appreciated by both adults and children. When I was a child, I received this book and found it fun to search for Waldo, the Wizard, and the scroll (and even the various other items that are hidden in each picture). The most infamous part of the book is finding Waldo in a page full of Waldo clones (your only hint is that he's missing a shoe).I would rate this book as challenging to the novice, but of medium difficulty to the more experienced searcher.A genuine concern for a potential owner of this book is \\"Will this book be worthless after finding Waldo in each picture?\\" I would answer that as long as you do not write in this book, it will last forever. Your memory will forget the location of Waldo and the items after a few years and the book becomes challenging a second, third, or even twentieth time around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great set","review":"This is a great my little pony bedroom set - it comes with fun accessories and I especially like the bed, it really is made for a princess. thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get real","review":"The thing that bothers me about books like this is, disco gets ALL the blame for the demise of \\"black music\\" but rap/hiphop always gets a free pass.No I don't like it that disco seemed to take over & knock the superior Funk genre out of the way but at least in disco, people were still playing INSTRUMENTS.What is considered R&B;,since the mid 90s is basically just beats & nothing more.There is nothing in this book expressing dismay at the thought of DJs & sampling replacing LIVE BANDS,which is the true death of R&B;."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine piece of Detroit Electro","review":"This album is a must if you like Detroit Electro.

But Cortez is more of just a stopping point, the zenith of this civilization that was so rapidly maturing, becoming increasingly ever-finer, more dignified, literate, majestic, on its path to somewhere we'll now never know, with with rules of honorable behavior and thought that made them so unfortunately ill-prepared for the coming of The Aliens!

The smell is horrible and it is very thin. Then I looked on the packaging and compared it to REAL Johnson and Johnson Baby Lotion and the ingredients were different and also this Imposter lotion states that it is Made in Italy!!

If you can do something with regard to this delay, I would be extremely greatful to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book, nothing quite like it","review":"This was one of the strangest and most engaging fictional works I have ever read. An autobiographical narrative consisting of novel excerpts, social commentary, reviews and short stories. Brutally honest and at times hilarious, I find myself regularly rereading many parts of the book and I'm always stunned by ,above all else, Mailer's humor and the vivid and unforgettable stories and characterers that he creates.One reviewer remarked that Mailer's reputation in somewhat up in the air. Certainly Over the years Mailer has suffered much harsh criticism, from charges that he is misogynist to claims that he never fulfilled his own potential.Nonetheless, Ancient Evenings and this book are his best works and I'm sure they will survive the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mailer promised so much more than he ever delivered","review":"All during the 1960s, when authors still appeared on The Tonight Show, The Dick Cavett Show, etc, the two authors who had the most exposure and most proclaimed their \\"genius\\" were Norman Mailer and Truman Capote. Both fizzled miserably. Their dwindling fame will be filed under \\"Celebrity\\" rather than \\"Literature.\\" Mailer is the better of the two, but he has not worn well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Book Edition","review":"The editors at Penny Press took liberties to modify Tarkington's original text, as expressed at the beginning of the book.

Not the cliched love of two youngsters stuggling to prove to the rest of the world that they deserve to be together, but the enduring and unbreakable love of mother and son. Spoiled brat George Amberson Minafer slips from the opulent heir to the Amberson fortune to the impoverished protector of the Amberson name. Though young George makes numerous mistakes leading to much heartache for those he encounters inside and outside of his family, he ultimately finds redemption, buoyed by the undying and unyielding love of his mother. A beautiful story and a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this CREATE SPACE Edition!","review":"THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is one of my favorite novels of all time. I was in search of a reasonably-priced paperback edition to order for a class I'm planning to teach, so I selected the only one currently available on Amazon. I strongly urge anyone reading this review to find a good used copy of the novel, printed by a publisher who recognizes what a well-printed book looks like. This version by Create Space (ISBN 9781460984673) is utterly unreadable. The single-spaced type is as small as you will find in the fine-print sections of credit card declarations.

I never wanted it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer? REALLY??","review":"I just can't believe a book of this caliber won a Pulitzer. I do admit to being pulled into the story at times, but the writing is deeply flawed. The protagonist is unlikeable, the characters often react inconsistently, and finally, the last 20 pages of the novel are jaw-droppingly bad--the deux ex machina ending was beyond belief. Also, I should note that the edition I have is full of typos.I'm going to rent the movie to see Welles' interpretation. While this novel has redeeming qualities . . . good grief--a PULITZER??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition stinks","review":"Typos galore. It completely ruins the experience. If Amazon wants to sell people on the Kindle, they need to do better than this. There are comma splices, missing and misspelled words, periods that appear out of nowhere, etc. The story itself is great, but I feel like I'm missing out reading it on the Kindle and that's a terrible thing. I know this is a free edition. Hey Amazon, I'd gladly pay for a premium Kindle copy of The Magnificent Ambersons that isn't riddled with errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book. From its imagery to its characters, Tarkington's writing shines in every respect. As the city grew, so did my empathy and my disdain, pulling me in different directions- a sign that the author indeed did his job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, problem kindle edition.","review":"I enjoyed the novel very much. I am reading the Pulitzer Prize winners and picked this up as the second on the list. The story centers around young George Amberson Minafer who is a spoiled, selfish, wealthy young man who only cares about himself. As a child, the townspeople wish for his comeuppance, which he finally gets, but not until he has wreaked havoc in the lives of some people who love him in spite of his arrogance.I had a problem, however, with my Kindle edition. It was poorly edited with a lot of typos and errors of punctuation, making the reading of it somewhat annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"This is Tarkington's tightly structured comment on a changing society, family and what's wrong with all of it. With one main character representing old-money tradition and another representing new-money industry and technology, the conflict grinds down a family and makes another surge, Tarkington's family drama personifies what was happening as our world industrialized and became dirty with new money. I also recommend for anyone with problem adult stepchildren. The best of this book: the loathsome character, George Amberson Minafer, who is so real, you feel as if you've met him somewhere along the line. A great read. Next I'll try the other two books in this three-book series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Overblown","review":"One cannot deny the delight of the prose in this book. Here is my favorite quote: \\"Mrs. Johnson came in, breathing noticeably: and her round head, smoothly but economically decorated with the hair of an honest woman, seemed to be lingering far in the background of the Alpine Bosom which took precedence of the rest of her everywhere.\\"But excellent use of the English language can only go so far and at the end of the day I found this novel to be woefully dated. The crux of the action in the story really centers on the manners and norms of the day and I was unable to muster any sympathy for two adults who forego their own happiness to appease a spoiled youngster.If you, like me, are keen to work your way through Pulitzer prize winning novels, then do put this on the list, otherwise, take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus","review":"This is trash.

The characterization is the key in this book; no one is so good they're beyond belief, and no one is so bad that you can't feel for their plight. I wish for more from this enigmatic world of Mr. Stewart's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Watch","review":"A post-magical apocalypse political thriller and story about succession and inheritance in several senses.Stewart writes beautifully and creates original, well-detailed worlds. There were two aspects of this book that didn't work so well for me: first, the political thriller plot became incoherent, and second, the Chinatown culture seemed stereotypical (martial arts, empty cups of tea, whatever). On the other hand, I loved his evocation of the North Coast forest, and the way the elegance of his descriptions is grounded by down-to-earth characters and moments of humor.I'd recommend this, but not as strongly as GALVESTON or CLOUDS END."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major dud. It put me to sleep over and over again.","review":"I was not at all impressed with this book. In fact, I was not able to get very far into it.

I bought this book to train for the marathon, and found it helpful. One thing I did not like was the recommendation to run for minutes rather than miles. I guess I'm enough of a mileage junkie and not good enough at judging pace that I found it disconcerting to have to guess how far I went. Also, that way you have no idea what kind of pace you are on for the marathon itself.

Easy to put on, take off, and clean. I always tell my son to push his little man down into the toilet, so we haven't had problems with the splashguard like some have. It would be nice if the seat was a little bit squishy (like the weePods) so it would be just a little more comfortable to encourage him to stay on it longer. But for the price, yeah, this is the best we've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"fits elongated toilet, easy to clean, splashguard useless","review":"this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fit for slow close seat with inward grade","review":"Just getting close to the potty training time...I have two bathrooms, with a round and elongated seat, both slow close and slightly inward angled seats. This Baby Bjorn seat would not fit either of my slow close seats. However, it might still come in handy for travel.

With the cheaper seats w/ Disney designs, etc, the pee was always getting everywhere but the potty. This is perfect for my son. The bump between the thighs keeps his legs apart so pee gets IN the potty instead of on it and it is deep enough so that even if the pee does not go straight down and still gets in the potty and does not leak under the seat. Fits well on our toilet seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend for boys","review":"Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me. My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it. The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his \\"equipment\\" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I found this!","review":"My search for a potty seat that would fit an oval toilet ended here. I love that it can be adjusted to fit so it isn't sliding around when toddler is trying to sit down on it. Great product for the oblong toilet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but like other reviewers have said, the splash guard does not work.","review":"I bought this for my son and read the reviews about the splash guard not extending down far enough. I decided to take a chance and found out that it does indeed lead to spills onto the actual toilet seat and under the toilet trainer seat too. It's not that big of a deal to me because it's not like it's going all over the floor. I just do a quick wipe of both seats after my son is done. It takes two seconds and I do this so I don't get a smelly bathroom. When my sitter and husband watch my son, they don't do any cleaning up of the seats and I have yet to notice the bathroom smelling. We have an oblong seat and it fits perfect. We don't even use the adjust dials and it stays in place. I gave it four stars because I really like it even though the splash guard does not extend further down."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and does what it's supposed to do well","review":"A friend gave me one when my daughter was 9 months old and we've been using that since then. The curvature of the ring cover fits both the toilet and baby's bottom really well. It does not move on the toilet as some other designs do. It's easy to clean. I also have a cover with cartoon characters on it but my daughter would keep moving off it and trying to see the characters so it's really distracting. The Bjorn one does what it's supposed to do and does it well. Now my daughter is 2 years old and started potty training a few weeks ago. I like the Bjorn so much that i bought another one for our 2nd bathroom also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Potty Seat","review":"We've got a couple seats, this is by far the best.

Must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't live in Germany","review":"Not impressed and am returning tomorrow. The little wings you have to dial out barely hold the seat in place. Maybe it works for older toilets or german toilets...but not mine. If the little wings came down more, then it would hook under the lip of the seat. But this will be returned. Got it at babies r us and I will just look for a permanent seat that won't fly off while my kid is getting on or off of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little girl instantly started using it","review":"My 20 month daughter started to say 'pee pee' whenever she wanted a diaper change. We found she wants the diaper change when she was about to pee (or poo) when her diaper is already heavy and she does not like to wet the carpet or the blanket. So I thought maybe it's not so early for her to start potty training.We got this Babybjorn toilet trainer delivered, and tried to put on the toilet - and as a curious toddler as she is, she asked me to put her on it (in her own language) then started peeing and she even tried to clean with tissues (she just dumps the tissue - I think she caught that from her big sister). Since then, she tries to stay away from diapers whenever she's not traveling or sleeping.She's on the heavier side at 30 lb. She sits on it very comfortably alone, but smaller babies might have to find a smaller stand alone type potty trainer bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Boy.","review":"This seat is not for a boy who is 1st learning to potty by sitting. In the picture it looks as though the built in deflector is fairly large, though it is not, it does not do it's job. I love the contour of the seat. But if I pay $29.99 for a potty seat I don't want to clean the bathroom everytime after he goes potty-what a mess. I have found a potty that I love and that works, it is much cheaper as well. I'm wandering if this potty might be worth holding onto until my son is handling more than one buisness in the potty, (if you know what I mean). Until then this is not the potty for me, if I had a girl maybe. But I have a boy, so please think about this before you buy. I did read one review somewhere that also had this complaint, I wish I who have listened. They need to make the deflector better or make one for boys and one for girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It is a seat that finally fits my toilet.

If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt.

This is a bit wobbly and children take longer to be independent on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"We had a cheapo toilet-top seat before this -- it was messy, pee shield too low, had a rough edge which hurt my son.

Our 2yr old son has been very successful and is completely potty trained, but is still very small compared to the potty. We've had 2 other seats both of foam / foam plastic and they make me nuts that no matter how much or how long I clean them I can't ever get the \\"SMELL\\" out from what seeps inside the foam. This seat is a great idea (all easy to clean plastic) no openings, made for a boy, and most importantly not made of any foam. Problem...it DOESN'T FIT! No potty at our house or my parents. We have a new home and standard toilet seats, my parents are quite older, but still standard and of course we can use the gross seats everywhere. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and sturdy","review":"We started with the seats that mount to the toilet. They were ok but this is so much more sturdy. The molded shape lets me feel like my 2 year old daughter is stable on the seat. They also pop out easily, with a pressure fit and easily adjustable dial. I'm a big fan and if you have any hesitation, don't. This is a simple, no-fuss quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This potty works just as described and has been very easy to use. My only complaint is that for a little boy you do have to be sure to push his privates as downward as possible because the bump at the front is not that high. Once I did not do this and had pee going everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME. A good, stable, non-slip seat.","review":"Great, has a turn-dial on the underside that widens or narrows to fit your toilet seat. I have a standard, small toilet and it fits with the dial in the narrowest position. THE BEST THING IS: you can bleach wipe this thing, throw it in a tote bag and bring it places if your child is afraid of the big, public potties. Just turn the dial on the bottom and it will fit any small or large public potty (I THINK SO, I HAVE NOT BROUGHT IT OUT YET, BUT I CAN TELL). The colored ring around the edge is non-slip.I also bought some summer infant potty covers that will stick either on top of this or under it so that your child is not gripping the PUBLIC POTTY toilet rim, but rather, the potty cover which shields it.The splash shield is good for my girl because it does not poke her or come up to high, although she is only 2 and still needs me to lift her on and off.GOOD STUFF!The downside: $25! and I even waited until the price dropped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody likes it","review":"I think you have to like this toilet trainer. It's comfortable, reliable and easy to clean. This is a better model than many alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"Our daughter used this for a little while but I had to keep watching her because even though she is petite it seemed like it was easy for her to scoot onto the back of the seat. I also found it hard to clean because you have to untighten the hinge to take it off to clean underneath. At preschool she was using the stand-alone potty so we bought the babybjorn equivalent and she now just uses that instead. That is easier to clean than I thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for potty training!","review":"Read reviews on what seemed like hundreds of various products and decided to try this one out after reading the good reviews. Well, i am glad i did my research. When your choosing something that you know will get messy but you will need often....think simple and this little product is just that. Its very well designed for quick installation and no worries on it moving around, the rubber edge grips well. When you need to clean it, throw it in the shower spray it down with some bleach and voila ready for another go. If your on the market for a good product this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the others!","review":"I bought this potty seat b/c of the great reviews it had received. And I must say; I agree! We are still in the early stages of potty training for my 2 year old-- but this one is the right toilet fit, right size hole and has the very needed splash gaurd. I had first bought the safety first version and my son didnt even fit on the seat- it was way too small circle. Try this out- its worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for my Grandson","review":"My 20 month old Grandson was afraid to sit on the toilet with the Toilet Trainer. When he did urinate, the urine guard was not high enough & he urinated on the area directly in front of the toilet. I did try to position him right up close to the urine guard & he really didn't like that. He has been using a potty chair at home, so I ended up buying the BabyBjorn potty chair with the high back & he likes this. I think he can tilt forward a bit with the use of his legs on the floor, so this helps with him being able to urinate in the potty chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not adjust to 3 of my 4 toilets","review":"I was excited about this potty but it only fits 1 of toilets which has a more oblong shape, it doesn't fit my standard more circular toilets.

I like the babybjorn stool and potty chairs - they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Works well and no bells or whistles to distract the child from what they are doing.

We decided to splurge for this one once she seemed ready for more serious toilet training. She's 2 and from the first time we put her on this, she said it hurt her legs. The splash guard is wide and digs into her legs and she absolutely refuses to sit on it. Fits the toilet really well, but that's all I can say positive about this potty seat. Disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"secure little seat","review":"This little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet, yet it is easy to take on and off. It also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat. Very easy to clean as well. I will warn you that little boys can still \\"shoot\\" over the small guard. I am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the \\"projection path\\" is downward. I have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them. This seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable. Because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat,too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not attach well","review":"I bought it based on so many great reviews. I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat. The description says \\"adjusts easily and sits firmly in place\\"...well, it does not. It slides right out of the existing seat. SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there, otherwise the seat falls out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Potty Seat on the Market!","review":"Is it possible to get excited about a potty seat? Yes, it is. My 4-year old daughter has been using this seat for four days now and I am thrilled. After owning three other types of seats, I am sold on this Baby Bjorn seat. All of the other seats were so hard to clean and literally collected urine on the underside, it was so gross and impossible to keep clean. The last one I had even leaked the urine onto the adult seat, it was terrible. This Baby Bjorn seat is one-piece and that makes all the difference - there is no where for the urine to collect except inside the potty where it belongs! The seat fits nice and snug on my round toilet seat as well as the elongated one at my parent's house - I bought another one for their house. And the bright pink and white seat is too cute. Thank you, thank you for making a decent potty seat that you can keep clean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect potty cover","review":"We just potty trained our daughter 2 weeks ago, and having her sit on the big potty has been a challenge.

Well priced, well made, and very functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy even for the most difficult little customer","review":"This is a great product for even the most difficult little potty trainee.

I have an oval, enlongated toilet that we use this seat on. A twist of the dial in back simply adjusts it to fit. There's no screwing and unscrewing it each time you use it... just do it once for fit.There's a different brand at church that has handles, so I thought he'd miss not having the them to hold onto. He doesn't miss them at all. In fact, if you are potty training, it's best to imitate the really thing anyways. You're not going to find handles on a public toilet, so why train your kids to get used to them being there?The rubber edge allows it to grip the seat. You put it on there and it's not going to slip.The gentle contour of the front splash guard makes it a great seat for both boys and girls to use. It doesn't get in the way and is still functional.It does what it says and does it well.

Quite comfy in a surprising kinda way at 2am. LOL! This is a potty training necessity, buy it! Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect -I only wish that it indeed fit onto all toilets.","review":"Love the seat. It just didn't fit onto the toilet that we intended it for. It does work well on the others in the house, so we're keeping it. FYI- the one that it does not fit onto is a round slow-closing seat (Bemis brand, I think). Two problems - the back of the seat curves up, so the training seat cannot sit flat. There is also little or no space at the hinge area between the lid and the seat, thus no space for the back end of the training seat to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Boys!!!!","review":"After a couple hours of reading reviews I bought this seat. Many of the other product reviews said \\"not for boys\\". With this seat your boy would have to lean very far forward to not get pee everywhere. I also choose this because it adjusts on the bottom to fit long toilet seats, it fit the seat well. Another problem for me was the size of the hole. I have a big 2 year old and couldn't wipe him well.

This seat is like the BMW of toilet seat covers. It seems very comfortable (not that I've sat on it myself, but my son can sit for a very long time on it), it fits most toilets (has a little wheel you turn to make the inside part get larger or smaller depending on the size of your toilet, which makes it not move around much), and it has a large pee guard. We've since thrown away the other seat covers and bought a few of these for our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the extra money","review":"I originally wanted this seat, but decided to try a cheaper model. It was awful. We have an elongated toilet and it slid all over. And it was puffy and thus horribly tall. It also had all sorts of parts that made it hard to clean. We immediately went back to get the Baby Bjorn and LOVE it! It fits perfectly on our elongated toilet and is a breeze to clean. I love the molded splash gaurd and the hanging handle.

My son can sit on it for long periods of time without getting uncomfortable. He's on the younger side at 18mo and the fit is just fine for him. The splash guard could of course be a little higher but we haven't had any major issues with this one.

Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the \\"cheap\\" one bought originally but really likes this one.

Important when you have a child learning to potty train. He has been potty trained for about 6 months now and he still uses it to go #2. We have never had problems with pee issues....I remember reading something about how the seat didnt work well for boys because urine would leak from the front of the seat... back when I was reading reviews before buying this seat.

It didn't fit our toilet seat and moved around a lot so my son wanted nothing to do with it. I found this Babybjorn seat and it was a life saver. It expands to fit any size toilet and it doesn't move.

It is adjustable to fit different toilet seats and it fits the toilet snugly. Since it is one piece it is easy to put on and take off and it is pretty easy to clean. I tried an $8 First Years seat for a second toilet, but it was a big mistake -- it hardly fit at all, it slid back and forth unless you glued or taped it to the seat, and it was two pieces which was a pain. We tried to use it once, but it just didn't work. I am buying another one of these bjorns. the only problem (not a big one) is that the step stool is a little too short for my daughter (but she is only 2 and can't be on the big potty by herself anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous - splashguard caused us a trip to the ER and four stitches","review":"This potty seat worked well for us until this past weekend, when my son attempted to use it without a step stool. As he was trying to slide off, the splashguard stopped his progress, which caused the skin just above his penis to tear from the pressure of being trapped. He now has four stitches in a very sensitive area, and this was a very traumatic event for him.The splashguard on this seat is pointless anyway, since it's too close to allow any room for the penis to extend, and my son has always had to push his penis down to pee into the potty. A splashguard on the floor chair version seems less dangerous, but on this model, where the seat sits on top of an adult potty, having such a high (and unremovable!) splashguard is just plain dangerous.Parents of little boys, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for boys!!","review":"Based on high ratings/reviews of the product, I purchased the Babybjorn white/blue trainer for my two (3 & 6 yr old) boys. In a nutshell, I would *not* advice parents with boys to purchase this seat. The biggest problem I have is the front shield is too low. Almost always, the babybjorn ring, toilet seat and the bathroom floor have pee all over by the time the boys are done doing their business. This product is not a unisex product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I'm surprised by the high ratings for this product. My wife and I have been very disappointed with it. The main problem is that the splash guard does not extend down far enough. Every time our little boy uses this seat, the bottom of it is soaked, the actual toilet seat is soaked, the underside of the toilet seat is soaked, and the rim of the toilet is soaked. And no, the problem is not our toilet or our existing toilet seat, because the same thing happens on any toilet we use this on. Very poor design--I do not recommend at all if you have a son. Perhaps if we had a daughter, I would be giving it a higher rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one out there!","review":"We love it! It is adjustable so it fits perfectly on our toilet seat. It never slips around & is super easy to clean. I also bought the Baby Bjorn floor potty & loved that too.

They make the greatest products."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy","review":"I bought this seat for my son because of the built in \\"shield\\". I have found it's a bit short and also that somehow his wetness deflects up under the seat and gets the toilet seat and underneath the seat all wet.

Would not recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"I have two of these potty seats - one for upstairs and one for downstairs. They fit the seats perfectly (no sliding around). The built-in splash guard is great for boys AND girls. At first I thought girls wouldn't need it, bit I'm SO GLAD it's there. My daughter has some pretty wild sprays, but the splash guard catches everything. The best part is minimal clean-up (unlike with potty chairs).My daughter is only 22 months old, so she needs a foot stool to reach the toilet. The kid foot stools are too small and unstable. If you have a very young child, buy an adult foot stool (like the ones for elderly patients). They will not flip up/over. The child has plenty of room to step up, turn around, and sit down. The stool is wide enough for the child (and parent!) to feel confident and comfortable enough to bend over and pull his/her underwear up or down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Seat for the Feat","review":"My 22-mo. old loves to hang out while we patiently wait for the results.

There was much in it that I couldn't quite grasp such as the concept of the \\"Conscious You\\" that is introduced here. But a lot of the teachings appealed to me so I decided to accept it all as truth. But after several years of studying the teaching of the Ascended Masters brought through the Summit Lighthouse, I realized that this book has many truths interwoven with subtle lies that actually take you further away from Christ and God.This \\"Conscious You\\" is a graven idol that is being offered you as a replacement for your Christ Self, and raised up as more important than the I AM Prescence. This to me makes it an anti-christ concept. I love Mother Mary, and it saddens me to know that there is one imitating her and using her to introduce ideas that lead people into the mind and away from their Hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"This book has been very helpful to me.

It is so thick but I could not put it down for two weeks day after day. I have to admit that after not acknowledging Mother Mary as our spiritual mother, having read this book made come back to her and have developed a special relationship with her. I am reading Kim's latest book \\"I love Jesus but hate Christianity\\", it is cleverly addressing all major contradictions about God and the religious mongers, if you thought the Da Vinci Code was full of contraversy, wait until you read Kim's book's and his website, askrealjesus.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian themed film","review":"Originally released in 1970.

The story is gripping and well written. As has been stated in a previous review, the thing that tends to detract from the quality is the apparent lack of good editing. (Do publishers not have proofers or something?) The story of Isabelle and her flashbacks of time with the Kind (incubi and succubi) add a great deal, as well. As well as the obvious story, the book seems to have an underlying theme of the importance of accepting differences in people, and trying to live in peace. All in all, it is a great book, and has potential to be a favourite to many for years to come. (Particularly with a better proofed re-issue.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"EDITING","review":"I regret not checking the reviews before buying this book. The story is interesting but I can't get past the horrible spelling and grammar. Champagne is spelled champaigne, for example.

We bought it to replace our bulkier Sony DSC-F707. The large screen is wonderful! The video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video. The battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left. The main downside with this camera is the flash. It doesn't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots. If it weren't for the flash, I would have given this a rating of 5 stars. This is overall a good camera.For more serious digital photography, we prefer to use the Sony DSC-F707 as it has a better flash and zoom. However, it is too bulky to carry around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice outdoor pics, but night shot is horrible","review":"This is really a nice point-and-shoot camera.

You may have heard that this album is not as hard/powerful as previous releases, but I think that is not true. There is an incredible power beneath the surface, making nearly every song a classic. I would also recommend checking out the Mein Teil, Amerika, and Ohne Dich videos.Best tracks in my opinion: Dalai Lama, Los, Morgenstern, Ohne DichNot worst, but not-quite-as-good tracks: Amerika, Stein um SteinI recommend this album to anyone, whether they like Rammstein or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Dissapointing","review":"This album is amazing(no real shocker since all rammstein albums are amazing) seriously though, if you gonna obssess over a band that you cant understand, obssess over rammstein. simply an amazing band. guitar, vocals, song meanings. theyve got everything to offer. get all of their cds though. its a better deal off of itunes so check that out. rammstein is my second favorite band only to cky. by the way, an answer can be found is coming out june 28. dont miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sehr Gute Musik!","review":"As an American, I find The European Continent to be especially interesting--I come from Germany.

I think you shoul buy this, and also at least \\"Mütter, and for you David Lynch weirdo people, the soundtrack from \\"Lost Highway\\"Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That is it? This can not be Rammstein.","review":"True fans of Rammstein can never like this. I listened to it not more than 5 times in the last 2 months. Mutter was good but not even close to their first 2 albums. This is even further away. They should go to thier roots. The style from thier first 2 albums is nowhere near done and no band can do it like they do. So go back.If you guys like this kind of music, give Eisbrecher a try. more electronic but way better than Reise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good!!","review":"Well I was happy to see the Rammstein finally decided to get off their collective butts and give us fans another helping of German Industrial Metal. Well after a long wait it has arrived and I like it!!. It's typical Rammstein, but it also ventures a wee bit here and there off the usual track. It's heavy and melodic, just the way I like it. The vocals are in German off course and this lends itself perfectly to this sound. The vibe that those vocals add as well as the guitar riffage, just seem to fit the songs so well is scary! Rammstein may not be the most talented musicians in the world, but they have a knack of writing good tunes that stick in your craw and get your head a bopping. They have certainly found a formula that works for them and for that I say thank you!Overall I'm very pleased with it. It's still not as good as my favourite, Mutter!!, but it's pretty darn good and well worth the $$$ to pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly best Rammstein yet","review":"I have never been disappointed with this band, almost everything they do I love. Their latest work features two songs fairly typical of their style, Reise Reise and Mein Teil, even in Mein Teil Till explores more vocal range. Dalai Lama is my personal favorite just for its different structure and wide range of vocals. A previous reviewer mentioned Amerika as sounding rather pop, I think that was intentional as the song derides American cultural imperialism, including music.I think Till's delving into poetry also helped him develop his lyrical skills as many of the songs feature more intricate lyrics some make use of clever word play.A great album that shows the band growing as artists of 'Music designed to annoy your parents' 'Paul Landers'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Beautiful Lyrics","review":"I think it's one of Rammstein's best albums in its creativity and diversity.

If you like hard rock music you will like this.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reise, Reise","review":"Reise, Reise is a great album to listen to, if you are eclectic. This album contains many different sounds, like snare drums in Reise Reise and Mein Teil, accordians in Reise, Reise and Moskau, lots of synthesizing in most of the songs, like Reise, Reise, Keine Lust, and Amour, for example. The album is also wonderful as Till can sing in not only German, but English. He even sings with the Russian girl (Viktoria, I believe) and says ??? ??? ???, which is amazing. And amour is French, so a total of four languages are sung. The bilingual songs, like Amerika and Moskau are among my favourites, as I am learning to become a translator. Rammstein has, since I learned about them in 2001, helped me with linguistics. Oh, and Olli sings, too. Great Album, Vielen Dank, Rammstein. Ich hore immer ihre Musik zu!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is personally one of my favorite Rammstein CD's. From the sweeping ballads of Ohne Dich (Without You) and Amour (Love) to the headbanging inducing Mein Teil (My Part/Tool) and Moskau, Rammstein takes you on a tour de force of its lyrical and musical prowess. This album features deeper lyrics and more creative musical sounds, such as an acordian in the title track Reise, Reise (Arise, Arise) and choirs in Mein Teil and Morgenstern (Morning Star). Full of dark humor and satire. Till Lindemann's vocals add weight and sencerity to the music and he keeps sounding better and better. Definitly a must have for any Rammstein fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rammstein's Masterpiece","review":"This album is definitely Rammstein's best - it is impossible to stop playing it!! I really liked the first three albums, but this one is better. Every song has a distinct sound, ie. the songs on this album are less repetitive sounding compared with earlier albums.

Dalai Lama, Keine, Lust Moskau,Morgenstern, Reise Reise, are all great songs, i cant say i care to much for the others, but still cool to listen to once and a while. This album isnt as upbeat as fast as there other albums, i was looking forward to head banging to this album, but it just wasnt fast enough, but all in all its a good album to have.

I still like sehnsucht the best,because I like the catchier riffs. The new album sounds like a better version of mutter. It's still heavy and uses a lot of symphony and violins as backround effects.

A sorry attempt.Believe it or not, most fans agree with my stance. The band did profit from RR (not as much as their other albums), but they LOST money all the singles attached to this album (except for Mein Teil). Thats right THEY LOST MONEY ON THESE SONGS. Thats why Los has been cancelled, and they are instead moving on to their new album, due out this year. They promise it will be much heavier, and will not letdown the fans like this album.So in short, ditch this garbage, go buy Mutter, and download \\"Benzin\\".

I've seen this several times and after being thoroughly impressed by the lyrical content throughout the entire movie, I thought it would be cool to share it w/ a few hardcore \\"hip hop NY heads\\" I know (I'm from DC btw). At first, I thought many of them would tell me that they had already seen it and that they might judge it too harshly. But ALL of them thought it was pretty hot and that neither of them even HEARD of this movie! I really believe that Sticky should really consider \\"remarketing\\" this (aside from any unforeseen legal circumstances). Apparently he put a great deal of effort into this project and judging from the all-star ensemble cast, a lot of money looks to have been sunk into it also. It just seems so unfair that this movie slipped under so many hip hop faithful's radar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie!!!","review":"This movie was terrible.

Pick this one up for your Music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first.","review":"I wish the movie were as good as the soundtrack. Like the other Mortal Kombat albums, this one introduces groups many people may not even know of otherwise, most of which are really great. There may be a couple songs I'll quickly skip past, but for the most part, this album really keeps the beat going at a nice clip. Leave U Far Behind by Lunatic Calm has since become popular, having also been on the Matrix soundtrack. There are many instrumental type songs like Juno Reactor's Conga Fury that just really help you visualize the fight scenes. The only problem is that some of the afore mentioned instrumental pieces can start to run into eachother. It get's to the point that I have to think for a minute to know what song I'm on. Some songs like Scooter's Fire would have done better as instrumental's. But I'm really happy with this album. I listen to it all the time on long trips or when I'm just sitting around doing nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great soundtrack","review":"What can I say? This is a great soundtrack for people who love techno and industrial music. I like \\"Engel\\" by Rammstein, and I love the Middle Eastern theme in \\"Panik Kontrol\\" by Psykosonik. Two bad this song isn't in any of their CDs. I also like \\"Calling Your Name\\" by Libra Presents Taylor, whoever they are. If anyone has any information on the artist \\"Shaun Imrei\\" please e-mail me. \\"Two Telephone Calls and An Air Raid\\" may be the best and fastest techno song I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really cool!","review":"(Man, that was really original...)Like a few people have said, the movie wasn't all that great...

Make the band know they have more songs to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RPG money can buy","review":"I'd have to say that Dungeon Siege is possibly the most addictive game i've ever played.Thats rare considering I'm not a huge fan of RPGs.I bought this game one year a go and still I cant get it out of my mind.Dungeon Siege haves you thrown in a vast world full of adventure without ever having to see a loading screen.Your mission:Rid the world of evil.Of course this is no easy task considering you start out as a farm boy/girl. As the game progresses you'll learn new things.Find tresures and kick some evil \\"rear\\". The best thing is you will never run out of things to do or find. Every step of the way is filled with action and whatever else in between.Plus you have options. You like to beat up a krug with a sword, go ahead. You wanna blown up a goblin with magic, be my guest. This game is virtually endless with fun.If you like RPGs get this game.If you don't like RPGs get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for even a newbie rpg'er","review":"Although the graphics are quite beautiful IMO, especially compared to D2, the game is, well, boring. With an unbelievably linear story, the game takes very little thought, save micromanaging your party (which quicly gets monotonous and annoying). Think I'll stick to D2...no, the graphics aren't quite as spectacular, but at least it's fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hallway to Boredom","review":"Boring! Imagine an impossibly long hallway populated with bad guys, doors on either side that have more of the same bad guys. That's what playing this game is like. You have one path to follow (regardless of the scenery change) and every few feet you fight a monster. As long as you load up on health potions (say, half your inventory), you can easily beat this game in a few hours. The fact that you can choose your character's appearance is cool, until you start equipping him/her and the appearance changes with the new armor/weapons/shields anyway. If I knew what this game was going to be like, I wouldn't have bought it. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gauntlet 2002... but much less fun than the original","review":"Only two things separate this game from the pack, really.1: The score. The music in this game really adds to the immersion of the game. This, I suppose, doesn't mean all that much, since the immersion is not very compelling, but without the music it would be abysmal.2: Graphics. DS is head and shoulders above Diablo 2 and Baldur's Gate (the two games it is most frequently compared to).Another review on this site says something to the effect of \\"this game plays itself.\\" I agree. Honestly, the only enjoyment I have gotten from it is listening to the music as my beautifully rendered character walks around a beautifully rendered landscape.Trust me, though... that gets old quick, even with graphics and music as engaging as DS's.My advice: Wait for NWN or Morrowind."},{"rating":"1","title":"the whole story","review":"Graphically Dungeon Siege is a stunning game. Story wise - there pretty much is none and the gameplay is very repetitive. I would recommend buying it if you don't mind playing something just for the graphics, otherwise I'd look elsewhere.One thing to keep in mind, there is no support for this game. Gas Powered Games offers a email address that they do not answer and Mickeysoft offers a Faq page that doesn't even display half the time (no email support that I could find). If you have any problems (and I've had quite a few), you are on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Talk about your mindless tripe. This game stinks of it. Wander around and mindlessly let your minions beat the monsters. If this game has any challenge, it is because your lost. The miserable overhead map shows you a limited view of where you have been. If you can't find the way through the confusing maze, you're hosed.The graphics are great. If you chose movies based upon effects, you will love this game. However, if you want depth and plot, look elsewhere.Choosing the character class has no purpose. You have enough minions that they just flog everything in the area to death. Very reminiscent of the old game Gauntlet without the fun. The multiplayer game may be more of a challenge, but I wouldn't know. I uninstalled it early in the first player game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is totally FABOULOUS!!!!","review":"I just downloaded the trial version of Dungeon Seige. Its too cool! I love it so much that I had to buy the full version! Its even better that I expected!!! I fully recommend that the whole world get this game!!! I'm not that much into gaming.

I could'nt give this game enough kudos!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun at first, but then you realize it's tedious hack & slash","review":"At first I thought this game was great, simple interface, good graphics and a beautifully crafted world to adventure through. But after playing it for a few days I realized that it was mindless hack and slash the whole way through. No strategy, no thought, just sit back and watch the mayhem, occasionally altering what spell you cast or telling your players to drink a potion. Halfway through the game the only thing that has changed from the first hour of play is the statistics and graphics of the monsters. The storyline is very weak and there is no where to go outside of the one linear path through the game.However, I gave it 2 stars instead of one for the strengths I mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hack and Slash RPG Ever!","review":"This game is pretty fun bys yourself but even more fun when you play co-op with some friends. I actually broke my mouse a few weeks back playing this game. It is really fun. The 3d isometric graphics are top freakin' notch as well as the spell effects.If you want a game like Torment, Fallout, or Arcanum. You will have to look elsewhere. But if you want a clickiy game like Diablo 2 but better (imho), then this is where you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better wait for Icewind Dale 2 & Neverwinter Nights!","review":"I purchased Dungeon Siege in order to try out my upgraded system...I agree, it's visually stunning but it's both a bore and a chore to play after a while (it may be different when it's a multiplayer session, as I was going solo instead). I guess I'm an old D&D gamer type, I like the idea of classes and such. Also, however, I prefer games with a modicum of plot and halfway interesting NPC's, neither of which is found in Dungeon Siege. After a while, I just stopped caring about the game. (I've since sold it and deleted the game on my hard drive, there was no point in continuing.)If you like Diablo, you'll probably like DS to a certain point, but if you want something more just wait for Icewind Dale 2 and Neverwinter Nights to hit the shelves (which will be in 4-5 weeks for ICWD2 and 6-7 weeks for NWN).

This game is nice to look at, nice to listen to, but playing it is about as exciting as watching paint dry. There is no role-playing here, just an endlessly boring series of battles where the extent of your tactical involvement is to say \\"attack this monster with a [insert weapon/spell type here]\\" - at which point you just sit back and watch the pretty pictures. If you like that sort of thing, then I guess Dungeon Siege is the game for you (hey, it takes all kinds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"Graphics are excellent.

All you have to do it point where you want your guys to attack. You don't grow attacked to your character because you can replace it very easy; no strategy is involved in choosing skill or what ever. So me its just a mindless game that is not satisfying.A day after buying this game I returned it, its just a waste of time. its hard to even call it a hack-in-slash because you don't even click to attackget Neverwinter Night, or Morrowind, even Diablo II if you want a cool RPGIF you want boring game easy to play get DS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Game by Big Game Maker","review":"I pre order this item something I will never do again.

This game is basically a cross between Diablo and Baldurs Gate and incorporates features from both games. This game adds new twists on the RPG genre when in that in most RPG's you choose whatever class you want to be from the start and cannot change. In Dungeon Siege this is not so. Your skills and classare determind by how you play.My favorite feature of the game is the fact that once you are inside the game world you do not have to load additional levels. Gone are the loading between levels of Diablo and the disc swapping of Baldurs gate. This is a very good game and one that you will not regret buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION MULTIPLAYERS, LAN BASED - NO SAVE OPTION","review":"If you are planning to play this in multiplayer over a LAN you have no option to save. Unlike in Diablo, quests you have completed will not save. Unfortunaly, the nature of many of these quests are interdependent such that you have to go back and complete the quest again EVERY time you play. Unless you intend to play continuously, the game becomes frustrating and tedious very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Disapointment of the Year","review":"I'll keep this brief. Dungeon Siege was supposed to be the next big thing. Instead, it is a simplified--albeit pretty--Diablo 2. Considering how simplistic D2 was, this is not a good thing. The character development system was a huge miscalculation on the part of developer Chris Taylor. Definitely wait for the demo before purchasing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"a warning to AD&D fans","review":"Ok, the hype got me...but i should have asked a very important question before buying and anyone who is a serious AD&D fan should, does it follow the game rules??, i did not wonder about this and now i am in possession of a game with great graphics an lots of goodies like the reviews say, but it leaves me flat after playing it once, there are no sets or character classes, and the lack of the AD&D ruleset wich other games follow (Baldurs gate, etc) simply takes the fun out for me...guess i will be looking to exchange it with some other gamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"The fact that this is a Microsoft product says it all - it's a memory-hogging game with a ton of \\"ease of use features\\" that just serve to make it bland and boring. Oh yeah - it also crashes if you go too far off the beaten path.If you want to watch a demo of nice technology that needs a little interaction from you, this is the game for you. Heck it even fights battles on your behalf.But if you want a fun game, get anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice graphics, little gameplay","review":"The first ten minutes of Dungeon Siege was great! Decent graphics, smooth animation, great soundtrack - and then the tedium sets in. A lot of little annoying user-interface problems. Sound effects for creatures that grow increasingly obnoxious. NO story or plot. Gameplay that couldn't get any less linear. Click-click-click-click. Calling this game an RPG is a misnomer at best. I'm extremely disappointed in Gas Powered Games and Microsoft, they could have done so much more. The opening and menu sequences feel quite unpolished. Pushed out the door too soon to beat NWN? I think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NO DIABLO","review":"I waited and waited for the release of this game. Back last year I waited and then they pushed back the release date to this month. Finaly I got a copy of Dungeon Siege on the day it became available. With all the hype and buzz I thought that I had last found a game as good as Diablo & Diablo II. Was I ever disapointed. Have you ever played Dark Stone? Dungeon Siege is much more like that game than Diablo. But Siege does not even match up to Dark Stone. The graphics are not so hot, combat is dificult after you get three characters in your party and my bigest complaint is that the game plays so dark you can't even see the bad guys your fighting against! In a number of battles I found myself killing the mini-boss or boss and not even knowing it until after the battle was done!The one good feature is the pack mule. But a pack mule does not a good game make.

I seemed to spend half of my time just trying to figure out where I was and where I had already been since the overview map was useless for this task. Another quarter of my time was spent sifting through a hundred inventory items trying to figure out which ones my party members could use and which ones were better than each other. In the end pretty graphics couldn't overcome the dread I felt everytime I got lost or came into town with a filled inventory."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT game!","review":"I agree completely with ... review and have already recommended this game to anyone who will listen.

So far, I've played in single-player mode, and have yet to be disappointed. The game is completely stable. It hasn't crashed once (unlike Baldur's Gate). The auto-arrange feature in inventory is terrific. I can spend more time playing and less time juggling items around. There is also a feature that allows you to pick up all items on the ground with the push of one button, which adds to gameplay time.

As a Programmer/Tech/Network Administrator with 14 years experience, I couldn't wait to get this game off of my computer.

Really wasn't good.OK that's all I was going to write, honestly, but I'll add this. Though no one will ever read it....The game is titled Dungeon Siege very aptly. Like a real siege, it's drawn out and extremely dull involving cruel amounts of suffering without end and with no lapses or breaks at all.Not to even consider the literal aspect of laying siege to a dungeon. What moron would ever lay siege to a dungeon?! its below ground, full of monsters, cramped, and dangerous. A simpler solution would be to roll a heavy stone in front of the hole and call it a day.ALSO: in soviet russia, dungeon sieges you!Now then, in practicality, I don't suggest the game.

The way it handles inventory, the shopkeepers, and the pack mules are great. The main problems I found with the game was lack of interation with NPCs, and a completely linear storyline.

Just how many Krugs/Lurkers/Spiders, etc. do you have to off before they are all dead? A dozen monsters is okay. Having to kill off three and four dozen on one level is ridiculous and boring. Oh, look! Another dozen to kill before I can move another 25 feet!

I could spend hours just wandering around looking at stuff. There is hardly any repetitiveness in this game. It is amazing. One of the most amazing features is the smooth, ongoing nature of the game. Never will it pause to reload more graphics. Never will it \\"cut\\" over into a new dungeon. It is just one continuous world! Excellent job!Playing the game means mostly killing monsters. For some reason, it never gets boring though. Last weekend, I sat down at 11am to play for \\"an hour or so\\", and finally managed to get away from the computer more than 12 hours later.

This seems to be characteristic of Microsoft games from their flight simulators to RPG's - fuzzy/blurry textures that look beautiful if you move your chair back four or five feet from the monitor or squint your eyes. Also, this game keeps randomly crashing my computer for some reason. Worked with Microsoft tech support on it to no avail thus far. But the gameplay itself is fun and I like the lack of an artificial limit on what my character can do - if I use spells more I advance my magical skills - if I use my weapons I advance my hand-to-hand combat skill. I really like this feature a lot. I do wish that there were more spells but then again you can never have enough spells in a game as far as I am concerned. Finally, the music is very nice and not boringly repedetive like some games out there. Overall I recommend buying this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game!","review":"It's like Diablo II with much better graphics.

What wrecks the books is Bennett's condescending, smug attitude towards his characters. One feels that he would cross the street if these ladies ever deigned to cross his path.

My only big complaint was that the flexible black hose that carry debris to the collecting area can get easily plugged up. This shuts down the circulation and may cause the motor to overheat and apparently happens when you get the collector get too full.

I am returning the system and will hope that the future brings to us a perfected system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!","review":"I have a cable system that has an A-B switch. Tivo does not support this. Their solution is to decide between using Tivo on \\"A\\" or \\"B\\". And when I wanted to switch, it took a 2 hour set up.

The quality of the recording is excellent even at the basic level which provides 30 hours of program storage. The controls are intuitive. It is easy to do basic \\"house cleaning\\" to keep the number of programs being stored in order. Most of all it is fun to use. Before purchasing I was concerned about the quality of picture recorded at the basic or least dense level frankly on my TV (standard color model) I can not tell the diference between the basic storage and most advanced and both are great. The freeze frame gives great quality. Sometimes I will disect a music video, comercial, or program trailer to see what makes them click. Again amazing ... If there were a sixth star I'd give it to this product. Also the automated program guide it is great and very flexible.

The first one was purchased almost 4 years ago, too!The two Tivos that we have had problems with are both Philips Series 1 models. Both have had modem failures. Both have been connected to phone lines that have experienced surges -- my brother's during a thunderstorm and mine due to a 40+ year old wall jack that corroded. I think the folks with multiple Tivo failures need to look at their phone systems!I do agree, though, that having to pay $80 just to talk to a techie about my dead modem was a bit excessive. I will not do that again. $25 or $60 modem replacement kits are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"My unit has been replaced three times!","review":"I have to say, in general what the unit does and the service is pretty incredible. Set up wasn't too difficult ( dish network ) just a bit time consuming. Problem is after 2-3 month the units modem fails to work. It cannot dial into tivo central for programming data. It has been a real frustrating situation - setting up 3 units, having my tv majorly distubed after sending back the damaged unit and waiting for a replacement. and the fact that you are so spoiled with this that when you dont have it it drives you crazy! :-) Im giving up on the phillips unit at least in my case and going to try out a sony unit. perhaps Ill have better luck.. Also have to say the 50 minutes on wait for a tivo troubleshooter is a bit irritating to say the least - try doing it 4 or more times...."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIVO is my new best friend","review":"Gone are the days of skimming the TV guide or reading the paper to find out what is on. Instead, I watch what I want when I want it. With the Season Pass I can have TIVO record the same shows I watch every day or week, whenever they are on TIVO finds them. I can start watching television anytime, day or night, and TIVO has all my favorite ready for me to watch...it also has a few other shows that I didn't specify to record, but thanks to it's Thumbs Up/Down technology, it has learned what I like and records things that are similar... The way I watch television will never be the same because of TIVO. In terms of setup, I found it to be relatively simple. The hardest part is waiting for TIVO to configure itself to my cable sytem. Plugging in TIVO is no different than plugging in a VCR. Easy instructions were included and the 1-800 number included put my mind at ease. TIVO is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You may want to wait to see how long these units last","review":"I was an early adopter of the TIVO technology in December 1999. I agree with the positive things that other reviewers in this space say about it. It greatly enhances TV viewing. However, my unit only lasted about a year or so before it died. I guess there's something wrong with the modem inside it. It no longer downloads program information. Without that, it will not function. After several go-rounds with TIVO \\"customer service\\" (they say there must be something wrong with my phone line, but I say my phone line still works fine and nothing has changed), I've just decided to stop using it rather than replacing it. The \\"lifetime\\" fee I paid when I bought the unit apparently only applies to my unit's lifetime, not mine.

The atmosphere created around an upscale neighborhood of BMW's and martini drinkers felt remarkably current and not at all dated. In fact our society is likely even more enamored today with the trappings of the wealthy than when this novel was first written. This creepy story focuses on a new house built in an established well-to-do neighborhood. Although the reasons are inexplicable, the house itself is hell bent on wrecking havoc on the individuals who reside within it's walls. There are no ghosts here, just a malevolent force bent on destruction.Told from the perspective of the couple who live next door, this novel provides a different take on the traditional haunted house genre; that of the observer not the resident. My only minor criticism of this story was that the ending felt somewhat rushed given the build up. Still, a worthy book if your looking for a late night read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding, grammatically stimulating and exciting.","review":"The House Next Door will draw in even the skeptic reader with Anne'sgifted intelligence with words.

(In fairness, #3 was pretty awful.)I'm sure it could have real promise, but I honestly just wanted to get this book done and over with. I felt the ending didn't follow through well enough.

Takes place in the south, as many of Anne Rivers Siddons' books do, in an affluent neighborhood in an unnamed city. The story centers around a wealthy, thirty-something couple, who live next door to an empty lot. The lot soon sells, and a newlywed couple hire an architect to build a house for them. The house is modern, amazing, and captures the imagination of the entire neighborhood. What no one knows, however, is just what the house has in store for this neighborhood.

I was remarking how great a book Hell House by Richard Matheson was, & it was suggested that I read The House Next Door.While well written, the book is incredibly dry, boring & extremely contrived. It's clearly a feeble attempt at a \\"scary\\" novel by someone unaccustomed to the genre. Again, Siddons is obviously a great writer in terms of style/skill, but this novel was bad. The two stars are merely given as a nod to her ability as a writer, rather than the story itself.I have no idea why Stephen King would have such great things to say about this book, as it is certainly not in league with even his worst effort. The only people I imagine would be pleased with this book are those that do not typically read horror/supernatural tales, but are in an \\"adventurous\\" mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Anne Rivers Siddons is one of my absolute favorite authors.

In fact, I wish she had been the one to write \\"Scarlett.\\" That would have been a real page turner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"The callow lives of a complacent couple get shaken up when the house next door goes bad. As haunted house stories go, this is not particularly scary and compares unfavorably with \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" and \\"The Shining.\\" The book's most notable feature is its portrayal of a bland suburban couple who manage to be offensive and banal at the same time. Are there really people like this? At the end, I wondered if Siddons deliberately created two unlikable people to create a sense of ambivalence in the reader about the effect of the house on their little sheltered lives.By the last page, I was simultaneously rooting for the House Next Door and for the book to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"This book wasn't awful but it just wasn't that good either. I have to admit though, I am biased because I like ghost stories and this book is about a haunted house, so I was of course expecting ghosts. Nope. The whole evil presence thing was just not enough for me. And I HATE IT when authors feel it is necessary to kill pets. Isn't there any other way for the author to make it scary? It just feels cheap. This book is definitely not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very scary","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read and probably will not read another by her. First, the book was not the least bit scary. Second, I found her phrasing somewhat annoying and pretentious. (Silence always \\"spun out\\" across the telephone line or a conversation.) Third, the characters were also pretentious and were high society snobs. Yes, there are \\"evil\\" doings at the house next door but let's go have martinis at the club or take a three hour lunch and have Bloody Marys \\"rich and thick and sprinkled with snips of fresh dillweed, in outsized frosted glasses\\". Blech. The story itself was OK and kept me interested enough to finish the book to see how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously!","review":"this book made me glad to have lived my entire life in new jersey. luckily, everyone in the south is not this boring and pretentious. even their names are obnoxious. do people like this really exist? that would be the real horror.don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The House Next DoorI love Anne River Siddons and have read most of her books. This one left me with a bad feeling. It is not what I expected from this author. I don't like \\"creepy\\" books but kept thinking it had to get better. For me, it didn't. There were too many sad things that happened in that house or because of that house. I don't need a happy ending but this ending was beyond awful for me. As soon as I finished this book I gave it away and this is a first for me. I keep every Anne Rivers Siddons book so that I can re-read it. Not this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a nail biter scary; but another good read by Siddons","review":"No, it's not scary like The Exorcist or Cujo, but it definitely does has a \\"creep factor\\" that makes this a fun little book worth reading! Set in Atlanta suburbs, the main characters are (whether they realize it or not) vaguely snobbish. Perhaps just because they live in their own little world and nothing \\"ugly\\" invades their space. Maybe that's why the \\"house next door\\" is even more appalling than it would be elsewhere. Here we are in this upscale Atlanta neighborhood with a house next door that doing some very strange things to its unlucky occupants. Nope, not a big mystery or hide under the blankets book, but definitely a nice curl-up-in-the-bed-with-a-hot-chocolate book. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"This novel is pure evil - brilliantly conceived and almost perfectly written. Although unrealistic, the dialogue is more interesting to read than if it had been more authentic. Siddons has created a masterpiece of horror that actually succeeded in shaking me up for an entire afternoon. I finished the last chapter over lunch one day, and couldn't concentrate on the real world until the next morning. Everything seemed to flow from the world she had created, seeming somehow twisted, not right. A must read - one of my all time favorite horror novels, in case you didn't notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House Next Door","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this intense and imaginitive thriller. It was told in a style that made you feel like you could very much relate to the characters and the events as they were occuring. Even thought the source of the hauntings is never really revealed, the reader will come away with a sense of closure and finality. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror that makes your skin crawl...","review":"... and it's beautifully written. No big monsters or slimy things, just the creeping feeling that things have gone wrong and are going to get worse. You hope, then you pray that there is something that can be done, or maybe a way out. Like Shirley Jackson and The Haunting of Hill House, this is a meditation - or a nightmare - on the power of our environment, specifically our homes. Read it in a house you love and trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Side of the Mountain- 5 Stars!","review":"My Side of the Mountain is probably my favorite book of all time. This book is about a boy named Sam who runs away from home to find his Great-Grandfather Gribley's farm. Later he meets many new friends and is able to live off the land.

Highly recommended for someone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book!","review":"When I got this book, I was NOT reading it. As I started reading through the book, I thought it was fascinating, amazing, and intriguing. Some days I would not want to put the book down, and other times I would read just a little bit more into the next chapter. This book is one of my favorite books in the world, and I wish to read the sequels.This story is about a boy named Sam Gribley who runs away from his crammed New York apartment to the Catskill Mountains. There, he lives in a tree house, hunts deer, rabbits, and other animals. He made lots of friends both animal and human. But also there are hot summers, fierce winters, and hunters that could mistake him for wildlife.

The story didn't keep my interest and when I was reading it I would always daydream. In the story he did the same thing almost everyday becuse there isn't much to do when you are in the forest. I didn't not like the way it ended it was not very exciting. I thuoght the book had a weird storyline because the father didn't even bother saying no when he decided to run away. This is why I would give this book one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"My side of the Mountain 5th grade book report","review":"We as a class had to read \\"My side of the Mountain\\" and then give a report on it. I did not find the book very interesting for myself because I enjoy historical books, My favorite author is Mary Pope Ausborn.But, if you like nature, it would be a good book for you. Sam is tired of the busy city life and all the noise from his brothers and sisters, and his Dad making fun of him so he runs away to the Catskill Mountains, where he learns to make a fire (with the help of Bill) and he has to catch his food, (he just has to learn to survive on his own) This book is about the challenges he faces and how he overcomes obstacles to survive.I would not read this book again, but since it was required for class, I had no choice. Most of the girls in our class were bored throughout the story. I think the boys liked it better. It just depends on what interests you have in books.And yes, I had to write this review as part of my grade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring book","review":"I did not like this book because I thought it was boring.

If you are the kind of person who likes slow, peaceful, detailed books then this book is just right for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"My side of the Mountian","review":"I think that the book was about a rich boy in the city who ran away from home to get attention. I also think that it would have been better if the boy was injured or killed in the woods. If you like storys about a kid going into the woods and nothing happens you will like this book. If you like books about a kid going into the woods and it is like real life get another one. In this book no animals attack the boy or any thing like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book horible horible","review":"This is a horrible book!!!!!!!!!!! don't read it it will scar you and your children for life!!!!!

The book was good and I would read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Side of the Mountain review","review":"The book, My Side of the Mountain, is a very good book about a boy named Sam Grebley running away from home to survive in the Catskill Mountains.

Seriously though.... a boy is in the wilderness for some reason. He doesn't know anything about surviving in the wilderness. He learns everything he needs to know through his experiences and becomes quite the expert on survival. Oh boy!! How many of these stories can people write?

Terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I've ever read.","review":"I'm not much of a complainer about books, but this book was just simply dreadful. It put me to sleep.

How in the world did his parents not report him missing? Of course, he lives in a tree. This book is so unrealistic because there could not possibly be a tree with a thick enough trunk in New York to hollow out. Of course, I wouldn't know, because I fell asleep after the first couple pages. I don't know what all of these people read, but it couldn't be this book. Now, you are probably wondering why I finished it (I mean skimmed it). I was forced to read it by my 5th grade teacher. She was probably scoffing at us behind our backs \\"ha, ha! I'll make them read this book\\". Why can't Sam have any troubles? You couldn't possibly train a wild falcon. It would scratch your eyes out before you even had a chance to touch it. I recommended this book to only one person, my worst enemy.

It has a unique,interesting plot. How many teenage boys these days choose to run away to the wildnerness? Sam showed great maturity in forging a life on his own in the Catskill Mountains. It was amazing how he tamed a falcon to be his companion. Some humans even visited him occasionally. If I had to live alone in the forest or on a desert island,I'd definitely take this book. Aside from some contrived parts,it was marvelous! Buy it from Amazon! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOY RUNS AWAY...EATS ROOTS...WHAT\\"S NOT TO LIKE?","review":"I can still remember my grade school librarian reading this book to my 4th grade class.

Thank goodness she sat us down and read it out loud. I don't know if I would have picked it up on my own at that age. Yes, the premise a bit implausible. Trite perhaps.

He lives, but it is tough at the start. He makes a home from a tree and trains a falcon that can hunt for him, he also makes many friends.

Frightful was a good friend to Sam and i think that that is really cool that he has a Falcon there with him in my personal opinion i would feel alot more comfortable with some kind of animal so i thought it was really cool how he had a Falcon there with him to maybe warn him and kinda protect him.

Overall this book was fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah for Sam Gribley","review":"My Side of the Mountain is a great book. Jean Craighead George must have spent a lot of time in the forest.

The book starts out with this boy Sam Gribly who wants to run away from his family with only some flint and $40.00 because he feels his family is to large. With a family of 11 I would too. So he goes to find his grandpa's farm. He finds it. And then he hollows out a old hemlock tree for his house. During the course of the book he makes a chimny in his house so he can warm it during the harsh winter, and he makes a couple friends too. This was a kind of boring book.

It's about a boy who lives off the land. This book was a little short and it needs more illustrations to help the reader picture what the author is talking about.

I have packed to run away many times. Not many people actually last very long though. Jean Craighead George tells the incredible story of someone who did. As the main character, Sam Gribley, struggles to face the oncoming challenges, he isn't abnormally perfect. If the character was too smart the book wouldn't be any fun. From his first scary night without fire in the wilderness, to his preparation of a many course feast for friends, you just can't put the book down. Not very many authors would think of having an animal be a chief provider of food. Tons of surprises await you at just the turn of a page. Anybody should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read, but filled with problems...","review":"I've read My Side of the Mountain dozens of time in my life. It's a fun book to read and you learn a bit about nature, but the way the book is written, some of the characters, and the unbelievable elements of the book detract from the overall reading experience. Sam's friends are pretty gay, and there's no way any parents would let their son run away. I find it hard to believe that he survives the winter all alone in the mountains. Sam is a pretty thin character. In this book, they all are. I think it's gay how Sam names all the animals. This book is worth reading. It's entertaining, and fun to reread. Give it a try, just don't expect too much. I've read the sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain. Parts of it are good, but it's a strange story. Not very engrossing.

The kid runs away to the wilderness, not even very far from civilization. he keeps himself isolated for the most part, and he magically manages to get by fine, even though he has no experience of the woods. his parents apparently don't give a crap about him, because they don't even go look for him for about seven months, and then it's just to say hi on christmas. several months after that, they finally all come out, only to join him! marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fourteen year old girl says:","review":"Not an on the edge of your seat book, but wonderfully keeps your attention.

Sam notifies his dad he is running away. He goes to the Catskill Mountains and steals a whole dear from hunters. He has a lot of nerve to live by himself for a year.I think the message that the author is trying to share is \\"Some things don't happen, but not like you want them to.\\" When Sam was making himself his house he lit a fire to burn out the inside of a tree. The fire warden came and put the fire out when Sam wanted it to keep burning. This book by Jean Craighead George was great!

His parents had no problem with it because they thought he was going to come back home just like Sam's father did when he was his age. If I was in the position of his parents I would't let him go. It was also interesting how he made his treehouse, got his food, how he cooked it, preserved it, and lived in the willderness with the company of Frightful, the Baron, the other animals, and rarely seeing a human being.

This is where the story begins, Brian runs away from home to the Catskill Mountains to live off of the land. He begins with only a penknife, a ball of cord, an ax, forty dollars, and some flint and steal. He must rely on his integrity and knowledge of the land to survive the many adventures.

The products are discontinued for the most part. So I don't know how all the other readers can sing the highest praises when it is so hard to accomplish one of the most important parts of the diet.

I have been able to perform better and I have more energy throughout the day. This diet is also very flexible. If you want to eat meat you can (just not too much), and you can also drink coffee and alcohol on this diet (again, just not too much).

This is no different. Some people complained that, upon entering fatherhood, Ian Brown had gone 'soft'. And? This has groove, make no mistake, but it also keeps itself happy without interruptions as background music, in the car, the bath, a spaceship!

YES!","review":"First off I would like to say that the picture quality of this is not the greatest (fullframe transfer,7 out of 10). The audio is also below par (constant crackling). There are no bonus features aside from an optional scene selector and a pics gallery of frozen frames from the film.Even with these various handicaps this film was still able to charm it's way into my heart. A masked mad man is killing off anyone dressed as Santa Claus. There is plenty of gore, a high body count, and some beautiful naked women. It's a fantastic 80's slasher film.

There have been many criticisms of this book regarding some of the treatment suggestions. Think of the book as a transcript of a \\"Parents of Late Talking Children\\" support group meeting and you won't go too far wrong. The author is a very intelligent individual who is writing this as a labor of love. For us, the most important thing was just to be able to read story after story of people who have kids like ours. The treatment suggestions are great tools to spark your thinking but use your brain and if you are unsure of something talk to your doctor or speech therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused me to delay getting essential treatment","review":"While true of some kids, the book does not portray situations true of all children. Some children do not simply start talking later, rather they have an issue than needs to be addressed earlier. The earlier a child starts to communicate (verbally, using signs), the better for his brain development. There are many disorders (for instance verbal dyspraxia/apraxia) where the child benefits greatly by getting therapy earlier. The more you wait the worse the outcome is. Because of reading this book, I delayed necessary treatment for my son until he was age four, and I highly regret it. His problem is not something that would have resolved simply on its own and the delay was not because of anything the author suggested. I am very annoyed that I was seduced by the ideas in this book, because my son's brain processing ability suffered from not getting intervention earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsoleted by sequel","review":"Almost all of the content in \\"Late-Talking Children\\" is repeated in the sequel, \\"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late\\".

The authorseems to be under the assumption that schools profit from labelingchildren as disabled. They do not. In my experience they do everything in their power to keep boderline children from receving sspecialized services. It costs them more money and they have to hire more professionals. The author tries to convince parents that a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder is the same as a diagnosis as autism. This is not true.

Whether it was her remake of Robbie Williams power ballad Angels, or her trying sonnet of the Top Gun classic from Berlin Take My Breath Away. Her latest single has to be one of the very worst covers I've ever heard in years. Not to mention a low for her. Her remake of Nancy Sinatra's classic These Boots Are Made For Walkin' for the movie The Dukes Of Hazzard is arguably a disgrace. It is terrible, and shameful for somebody who was good as a reality Newlywed. I really didn't like it when I recently heard Nancy Sinatra perform it.

She really needs to find songs of her own, not covering others.Song: F"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop doing covers","review":"With Jessica Simpson's ascent to major-stardom, her music seems to somehow have gotten left behind in the dust.. What is going ON with all these weak covers of Berlin, Robbie Williams and now - Nancy Sinatra?

These covers are not doing her justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina?","review":"I think this song is just o.k.I also think Jessica and her parents are hypocrites, they bashed Christina Aguilera for what she wore or did not wear, but then she comes out half naked in this video.

You can feel that persona type come through in the song. But Jessica's version is I don't know what! When I saw the video she made, it seem like she'd be doing a favor to any guy who she walked on and he'd enjoy it with some kind of sado-masochistic pleasure!She imbues a whole different meaning to the song, turning herself into some kind of sex-goddess in Daisy Dukes.If you want the real deal, listen to the original by Nancy Sinatra.

Jessica usually can sing way better than this, she has a much higher range. But in this song, all she does is purr quietly like an annoying little sex kitten. I can just imagine her wearing a sluttish outift (hmmm... super short-shorts and a belly-baring shirt, maybe?), while she tramps across stage \\"singing\\" this song. Britney Spears would do a better job trying to sing the way Jessica does; it just doesn't sound right when Jessica does it.In addition to her bad singing, the music itself is just annoying and will give you a headache by the time the song is over- or even before.Please, be smart and don't waste your money on this single. Even her cover of \\"Take My Breath Away\\" is better then this.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPLASH!","review":"This was a really great cd! Even though it only has 3 songs and two are vocals it's still really good! The first song is sung (I think) by Kasumi(misty) and it's like a beach theme.

Also, the water level it holds(min. or max.) was so low that his poor little parts were way above the waterline. Boys tend not to like cold down there. To be wet then above the water just didn't work. I ended up using this hammock-on-a-frame type thing I got for #1 when she was little and bathed him in a regular tub.

There is not enough support for the baby and he or she will slip and slide all over - even if you are holding onto the baby with one hand. I threw this tub out and purchased one with a net that snaps on over top of the tub. This is MUCH better and safer since it cradles the baby while bathing.

For me this game is almost impossible to enjoy being left-handed, due to not having the ability to modify the controls and the aim being stuck to the right joystick.The game has a lot of potential when the bugs are all fixed. If you're willing to brush off all the nuisances caused by the glitches, then buy this game, otherwise, wait until the team manages to overhaul this game and stick to playing the first game.

I have since read that EA no longer supports the game online, so first off, you cannot do anything online with this, so its only a one player game, no online. For me that was fine as I only wanted to play the single player version but it freezes regardless. I have read that you should unplug or disable the internet so it will not go looking for EA, I did that, but its still freezing and I have yet to play even a second of this game that I just bought.

I like first person shooters like SOCOM, Agent 47 and the Medal of Honor series. What I liked about this title is...a) the fact that you can blow up anything you want. Buildings, cars, trees, people, whateverb) theres a lots of vehicles. Cars , motorcycles, tanks, helicpoters, you name it. You can take any vehicle you want (or buy them) and drive or fly or sail all around if you dont feel like blowing anything up at the moment.c) re-play value. I hate titles you can get through in a day then your left repeating after that. Because of the number of options, choice of characters, choice of who you align with or against, there is tons of replay value.The game is story driven with an overall mission, but there are dozens of smaller missions you can choose to go on or not, or, as I said, just drive around and blow stuff up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action game lover","review":"This is a intense game,very hard without the guide!!So I say to all,get the guide.

Now, the themes seem to circulate every few months and the articles all meld into one long summary.They are all \\"dumb-ed\\" down so to speak and are no longer as engaging. Instead of being the mid level mag between something like Discover and Nature mags, it is nothing more than an elementary review of science topics.

I was interested in science and the magazine challenged my knowledge as a student. I learned a great deal from this magazine over the years but in the recent years the quality has gone down substantially. The pages are beautiful to look at but the content has been dumbed down to the level of a tabloid. No more is the witty humor of the authors and the authority that used to come across in the material.

I'm a retired electrical engineer and like to keep up with science but reading the magazine is just plain hard. Not the subject matter, but the way it is presented.

I then got a notice that they were turning it over to a debt collection agency, had to call and unsubscribe. Cute.If you are looking for research articles and neutral reporting, go elsewhere. Many issues were just a collection of short commentaries, ads, and editorializing. If you like light reading, and don't mind liberal views it might be great. The writers tend to bash religion and rightwingers, and as others have noted spend a lot of time on environmental issues esp. global warming.

At the least it was a periodical that satisified thoughtful, logical thinkers. Thinkers that had been abandon by the dry, inaccurate textbooks provided by the bureaucratic, so-called educational boards that served no other function but to pander to their political interests. At most it served as a treatise of legitimate scientific thought. This once revered, lay, scientific journal that with some effort could be understood by those of us that were ignorant, but interested, has now debased itself into a gooey morass of popular political pap. If you remember it as an enjoyable, informative, periodical that for decades served the purpose of satisfying your thirst for lay scientific knowledge, it is no longer. It now serves the egos of the mediocre thinkers that believe their view of existance should be yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed down fluff","review":"In their attempt to gain a larger audience, they seem to be turning this once great publication into another mass-media, no real content glossy mag.Some articles appear to have mistakes and factual omissions, and we wonder if some of the authors understood the subject themselves.

This latest issue has just 2 articles written by scientists, and all the rest is just fluff written by science reporters, etc. It is curiously empty of scientific content and full of political propaganda dressed up as science. This just makes me want to weep because it is so indictative of the dumbing down of everything these days, along with the fact that nothing seems to be free of a political slant anymore.

But I started noticing a fundamental dilemma: each issue had an article that was superficially science but mainly political, and always of a left-wing nature. If they labeled these articles as editorials, there would be no problem, but they always tried to pass them off as scientific truth. I dropped out. Then I started a subscription recently in order to not lose my airline miles. The January 2010 issue was a big disappointment.

Articles are not newsbites, but moderate-length texts written mostly by scientists involved in the actual research. It is refreshing to read \\"My team\\" or \\"I\\" researched this or that subject in the articles - unlike some mass-market science monthlies. The 'new' SA does go further now in explaining the basics behind a subject, with a phrase or word of background interjected here and there. I say, if you want pure science, read Science.

It's a very elementary book - you'd have to be absolutely green not to know most of the stuff in this book.

The tip of this tool isn't very sharp, and so you really need an awl to make an indentation first or it won't ever grip. The really bad thing is the fact the screw threads are spaced like a machine screw instead of a wood screw. They are much too close together and so it doesn't really get a bite into the wood until you've twisted it for a long time. When you finally do get the thing into the wood, and then unscrew it, the hole will not match the threads of a wood screw. So is it really saving you time and effort? They used to provide screw starters in cheap little tool kits that you could buy for a couple of bucks. You can't find them anywhere anymore. They worked properly. This doesn't, but it might have to do with no alternatives.

This material will be of interest to scholars of ancient Hebrew but perhaps not to the general reader.

A young, brash Jeff Bridges stars as Jake Rumsey, the putative leader of a disorganized \\"gang\\" of adolescent boys, set adrift amid the lawlessness of the Civil War-era West. The boys teeter between adulthood and adolescence, abject fear and murderous amorality, and as they wander through the bleak, vacant prairie, they have no signposts -- figurative or literal -- to guide them. Although the subject matter is pretty raw, the film is surprisingly circumspect (visually, at least), and the violence and pain it portrays is all given a complete context, and full emotional depth. It's a surprising film, with a deceptively simple structure weighed against a deeply pessimistic view of human nature. It's also one of those superior westerns that feels absolutely, completely convincing.

He has never had a haircut and is afraid to go. My hope in buying this book was that it would help him overcome his fear. However, the book did just the opposite since the little boy in the book is afraid to go as well. By the end of the book, the little boy is still afraid to go. I would have hoped that the opposite would have occurred. Cute book if you just want to read for fun but won't help your child overcome his fear of the first haircut.

So I was so relieved to find out that they have all the plans already there, you just have to unlock them and get the supplies for them.But there is a down side, as on all sims game.The firecode. But on castaway it's even worse.I seriously have about 10 items on one lot and the firecode is already at the top!Although on every part of the island the firecode is like that.So you could live on 1+ parts on the island but it's still a very frustrating pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game with a few drawbacks for PS2","review":"As with many PS2 intense games, the loading times can be pretty bad.

Though LA Story came out in 1990 and seems to lampoon the 80s, Michael Tolkin goes way beyond his collaborative work with Robert Altman(The Player) with this pitch black comedy.The film is way ahead of its time. Hollywood has yet to examine the decadent 90s in any way. Here we have characters who are more Clinton era than American Beauty. Pretty astute, considering that the film was released in 1994!Look for top performances from Peter Weller, Judy Davis, and great supporting work from Adam West, Sandra Seacat, and a pre-Pulp Fiction Samuel Jackson. Hopefully, some of the great camera work an slick visuals will find its way on to DVD in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"maria ellingsen wasted- i got lost watching it","review":"This film is a mess. It features a load of stars and made no sense at all. The great Icelandic actress Maria Ellingsen appears once or twice and is her exceptional skills are wasted in this mess. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable","review":"Don't confuse this with a really great book by the same name by Jeff Shaara. This book was all right, nothing to get too excited about. I'm glad I got it from a used book store. I could less about M.A.M.s politics(assuming you read the dedication.) I'm not sure why some of these authors think I care how they feel about the war. I guess it is just their way to vent. Dave Sterns two books on Enterprise, 'Daedalus' and 'Daedalus's Children' were excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Martin and Mangels have followed their hearts, producing a ham-handed allegory, in the tradition of some of the worst Trek episodes. Readers who share the authors' views concerning the war in Iraq and today's political disputes might enjoy finding similar views put into the mouths of Trek characters. The rest of us will find little to recommend in this story. It's not what I'm looking for in a Trek novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well what did you expect from these guys?","review":"This book shares its title with Jeff Shaara's concluding book in his trilogy. I would guess that most of the participants in that book would be offended by this one. Beginning with the outrageous dedication to the pitiful dolt Cindy Sheehan it is apparent that this is going to be a book that will find praise from those who share the same views on Iraq and on alternative life styles and distain from those who don't. Count me among the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in Translation","review":"I have read the English translation, and love it. Agnon's mystical surrealism is worthy of Garcia-Marquez.

Here is a really beautiful collection of art by Andy Warhol, many of the works apparently published for the first time. There are color photographs here of men's body parts-- chests, feet, butts, etc.-- a series of color portraits of drag queens labelled \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\", photographs of a few celebrities including Mick Jagger and the artist himself eating a banana. But most of the book is taken up by beautiful line drawings of men-- figures, faces, body parts, even the feet of Christopher Isherwood. Alan Cumming in right on the money in his foreward: \\"just a simple collection of lines on paper that magically produce a sense memory of something so visceral it can actually arouse.\\" And Mr. Warhol had this thing about body hair! This is a very erotic collection beautifully produced that you will go back to again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!","review":"Freak reminded me so much of the earlier books. Gaia's relationship with Jake finally begins to take some actual hold, and i can honestly say i had butterflies in my stomach in some of the situations Gaia was put in (Sam + Ed + Jake + Gaia in the same room can only = awkwardness.)This book truly goes to show that no one is who they seem as new characters are revealed and old characters make a return appearance. I'm so glad to finally see Pascal focusing on the relationships in the series... It had me on the edge of my seat (and by seat, i mean bed,) and i'm counting down the seconds until the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"The selection was good.

Though Bjartur invests much more energy in his pigheadedness, the similarities between the two characters make me want to think more about what Mississippi and Iceland have in common."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the most touching boo I've read","review":"It is not easy to read at all - I began the book before a trip to Iceland and I only made it through the first, say, two hundred pages because the reviews SAID it was so good and I just felt I SHOULD like it. It was long, dense. I swear to god there is a section of about 50 pages about just sheep. But it is SO, SO, SO, SO very worth it. It is hard as anything to read, but I PROMISE, anybody who makes it through this book (and if I did, then anybody can), will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books ever","review":"This is perfection in every sentence. Nothing more to say. Except that if your edition contains a foreword by Brad Leithauser, don't read it until after you've finished! It will reveal too much of the story, and it will also influence your perception and your expectations. And while you may disagree with some views in the foreword, certainly you will agree with the claim that this is one of the best books ever. Unless you think that a good book should have hobbits in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought my grandfather was stubborn.","review":"Even Iceland had its problems with ignorance and fear of progress. No knowledge of Iceland, except that it is an isolated northern island, is necessary to appreciate this marvelous story. It's a book about people more than place. Having read it, I do want to learn more about Iceland, though.The main character is very unlikable. His single-mindedness is what drives the entire book. His treatment of other people, including his family, compared with his treatment of his sheep is the critical focus of the book.I don't know if I would have preferred another ending, but will accept what Laxness gave us. Highly recommended and I have ordered more Laxness books (from Amazon of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it or you'll hate it","review":"This is one of those books that requires you to sink into it, giving it time and attention. You'll be rewarded with immersion in a time and place completely different from ours. You'll feel the cold and smell the smells. It is of no use to be judgmental about Bjartur -- he lives in circumstances so different from ours and his yen to be independent is foreign to our \\"welfare state\\" society. In Bjartur's time to fail and lose all was catastrophic -- no safety net in his bleak time and place.I agree with those below -- don't read the introduction. Why don't they make an essay that gives the entire plot away into an Afterword? Why do they think we are reading a novel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating insight into Icelandic Character","review":"1st let me say that I truly enjoyed this book. I found myself having to put it down from time to time because 1. It was to overwhelming and 2. Sometimes it dragged on a bit. But, having lived in Iceland for 2 years while in the Navy and having travelled all over the country, I can say that this book hits the Icelandic independent character and nature right on the head. Quite disturbing in its harshness, this book wants to make you scream at Bjartur for his stubborness and hug the poor daughter for her confusion. Overall, a great book with just minor flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheepless in Minneapolis","review":"A wonderful book. It starts slowly as all great novels do, then you're hooked. On every level the book succeeds, as nature writing, as an exploration of themes big and small, as a history of of a country - and of a lifestyle - \\"Independent People\\" is a harrowing, often tragic look at life on a sheep farm, in the early part of the twentieth century.Set in Iceland (Minnesota without cars), the story is about a very stubborn father and his innocent, spirited daughter. Their battle of wills is fascinating, and often frightening, as tensions build as she matures. The writing is remarkable. Laxness can do it all: The story moves from tragedy, to the bleak and comic, to the touching, swiftly. And the nature writing is magnificent. This is the best book I've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Deal Here?","review":"First, don't read the introduction if you don't want to know what happens. Second, the author would skip many weeks (or months) at a time when it seemed that this timeframe was crucial to the story line. Such as when he returned from a 4-5 month absence. He had left his daughter to attend to the household and she was anxiously waiting for the day that he would return. It tells of him returning over the familiar hills and his thoughts. The next chapter he's been home for awhile and there is nothing about her reaction on his return. Also, the conflict between the father and daughter doesn't actual materialize significantly until your about three quarters of the way through. Some terms weren't familiar to me, such as croft, which made it a little slow going at the beginning. Otherwise, the writing itself was very descriptive and I guess this is what got him the Nobel prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live thru several long Icelandic winters--BORING","review":"Well, I hate to sound unsophisticated, but I for one missed the reason this book earned a Nobel Prize for the author. It is an epic of despair, which could easily have been written in 1/3 the pages.

The publisher and Amazon should be ashamed to charge money for such a badly assembled e-book. Hardly a page goes by without a typo that would have been caught by a non-English speaker with a spell-checker. The first word of almost every line of dialogue is garbled, because the optical-character recognition software doesn't recognize opening quotation marks. \\"I'll routinely appears as Hell and \\"I've appears as VVe. I can understand that many of the free or nearly free public-domain titles that are available as Kindle Editions might have typos or poor navigation from the table of contents.

The book is boring. It is extremely hard to read, what with dealing with unfamiliar names and terms compounded by the terrible book to Kindle conversion.I quit when I found myself begging for the book to end, only to find I was half way through it.

Two large compartments provide plenty of space. The smaller is great for glasses, wallet, anything you need at your fingertips. There is also a cup holder with space for cell phones or whatever small items you want to have at hand. The large compartment has built in places for change, a pen and a pad of paper. There is also a clipboard inside the cover for maps or contracts. It fits perfectly on my bench seat and is a comfortable arm rest. The color matches my interior perfectly. There is a strap under to attach the seatbelt but I have found that the unit does not move, unlike my other one which occasionally slid onto the floor.

Despite the fact that it is not the best album by the Connells, it's still better than most of the bad music that we get force fed over the airwaves. The songs on this album are not as catchy as the SONG \\"Fun and Games\\", but they still resonate in the mind and I can sing along with every song (\\"Smoke\\", \\"Back to Blue\\", \\"On Your Honor\\"). I know a lot of Connells' fans who developed a tin ear for this band after Fun and Games, which I can't understand. I know I'm going for sacrilege here, but Fun and Games is my least favorite Connells' album. Give me the darker sounds of Weird Food & Devastation any day(as well as One Simple Word and Ring). 3 stars for the album and one star to give them a boost because I hate to see this blemish on their permanent record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"Recently, I was in the USED CD section of a music store and they had NINE copies of this.

OK, it was a disappointment after \\"Ring\\" but there are good things here ('Maybe', 'Any', 'Hang On','Back to Blue,' 'Pretty Rough').

But buy all the other CDs first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Devoid Of Melodies","review":"It does not take many listens to understand just why this is easily the worst album the Connells have ever recorded. Somewhere along the line the band forgot the melodies and the hooks that made all their other album so enjoyable, and this album is a major stinker as a result. If you are new to the Connells start elsewhere. Any of their other albums are a better place to start than here, although \\"Ring\\" is especially good.

I especially enjoy Old China books. What a great culture. As many as I've read, this one was different. It is a translation yet keeps the Chinese vernacular and takes place during a period which transcends between the old Confucious teaching and the new thoughts. There is no hero or central character. It is about the process of becoming a scholar and the status of the stages in doing so. The various characters, and there are many, are in tune only to their own kind - not their moral attributes but their level on the learning ladder. They reach these levels with intense study and taking the tests of each of the levels. Only few are chosen and not necessarily the best, depending on the judging. Again, it is fascinating because it is different. Just don't expect a story of plots and heros. Know what you are getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Two Witnesses","review":"This is a catholic book. Jesus makes his mother Mary \\"Queen of Heaven\\".

Mary did not die for my sins or anybody else, so I don't worship her. If you are not a Catholic or I follower of Mary, I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice fabric, nice fit","review":"My title says it all.

It takes several minutes to heat up and even at maximum heat it can take nearly an hour to get my thick hair completely straight! I always liked the color and the way it lights up when it gets hot, but several weeks ago I turned it on and the light was burnt out. Lame! Then I noticed the straightener was gradually getting weaker and taking longer to reach maximum heat. Finally, one day when i went to turn it on, it make a strange popping noise, buzzed for a few seconds, then died. Dead! I even tried plugging it into different outlets, but it never went on again. My friend also has this product, and has only had it for about a year, and she recently told me that the light in hers blew out as well.

The iron heats rather quickly, which is great but it does not keep your hair straight. A few minutes after I finish ironing my hair, it starts to get wavy and feathers back (think of the 70's). I have naturally wavy hair but have not had problems with other flat irons so I know that it is this one specifically. I used to own a $20 Vidal Sassoon and it worked great for years but it broke and that is what drove me to this one and that was after studying flat irons for many, many weeks. Incidentally, last week on the my local news they did a 'study' of flat irons to see which one is the best and this one actually fared the worst. I wish I would have known that before I bought this because now I am looking again for a great iron and I don't want to waste more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.","review":"I bought this straightener at Target for 75 dollars because my CHI broke after a year and I didn't want to spend another 140 dollars on buying a new one.

I only have wavy hair, and it didn't straighten any better than the 25 dollar Conair straightener I used in high school.

Rick Duke demonstrates his fresh unique style - the guitar work is true and strong. Nearly all the tunes are originals, which was very impressive. This artist is a very talented songwriter. I can't stop listening to the instrumentals, like Blue Heaven. Touch the Sky is another beautiful track. Rick's vocal selections have a southern folk quality that's new and refreshing. Bull City Blues is a cool tune and Carolina Day really brings my spirits up! Still You Turn Me On and Had To Be You are fantastic! The tribute to 9/11 heroes, Second Son, is the best I've heard of its kind. I would definitely recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Clapton","review":"I was looking for a reasonably priced Clapton hits package to put on my mp3 player.

It also includes his wonderful cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door.\\" The only one that appears to be missing is \\"Tears in Heaven.\\" But every song on here is a classic song, and if you are on a budget, this makes for a great start to a vast Clapton collection.P.S.: Some other reviewers are complaining that there is no Cream on this CD. That is true, but there is a seperate 20th Century Masters collection for Cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Older Songs","review":"This CD has great songs, and I love every one, but they are only Clapton's older work.

It's reasonably priced and has great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"There is no question in my mind that Eric Clapton is an amazing musician. I think he would have to be among the top ten musicians in the era of 1960-Present. In one ranking of the top guitarists of all time, he placed 4th.This album is terrific. While it is rather brief (not really geared towards long trademark guitar solos), it really shows Eric's talent and the diversity of the music he's played.I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Even for $6.88 at Sam's Club, this Millennium Collection CD was no bargain. It's so bad I couldn't even finish listening to it! Where did they get these cuts? They sound so muddy and poorly mixed that they must have been practice session tapes retrieved from the dumpster. The various instruments and voices keep fading in & out so you can't follow the music. Plus, the tempos and overall sounds are very different from the \\"definitive\\" versions most of us think of. I never thought it was possible to mess up a Clapton song, but UMI proved me wrong. And the liner notes? --None in this cardboard packaged \\"green\\" version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Cup Of Coffee","review":"The TA1400 is a fine machine. I have used it for about a month with no issues. I would recommend using pre-filtered water as this is always the key to good tasting coffee, even though there is a filter in the machine.

I'm a 2-3 cup a day coffee drinker and I enjoy my coffee super hot. The Tassimo allows me to try a variety of flavors and brews. I've owned a one-cup traditional coffee maker, but find the Tassimo to be super-easy to use with virtually no clean-up (as opposed to traditional machines). The cost for the T-discs is still more than brewing a traditional pot of coffee, but certainly less than going to one of the coffee chains (Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks). If you shop around, you can get the T-discs at discounts at many of the retail stores, as well as online through a number of retailers. My favorite flavors are Chai Tea, Gevalia Signature Crema, and the Gevalia Cappuchino. Yum!I am thoroughly enjoying my Tassimo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tassimo 1400","review":"it works as advertised, no mess to clean up just insert the disc and enjoy the coffee. this machine is idiot proof, anyone can make an excellent cup of coffee, or other beverage. the only down side would be it only produces 1 cup size. it would be nice if they could make T-disc for larger sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A coffee revelation","review":"I had been grinding coffee beans and using a coffee press for years, until a friend served me a cup of coffee brewed on a Tassimo.

Coffee was excellent and the Earl grey tea was great (I'm not a tea drinker). Trying to troubleshoot the machine through Tassimo Custonmer Service was a challenge. I finally gave up and returned the machine again. I believe this machine is trying to do too much for the price you pay.

It is easy to use and clean up is minimal so I am not sure what the comments about being messy are all about. It is a little noisy but only for a few seconds..so that is not a problem.I find it confusing whe I first hit the button, it goes into the heating cycle. I usually have to hit the button again to begin the brew cycle after it has heated. A minor glitch and it could definitely be operator error.I have had \\"wand\\" type cappucino machines in the past and they have usually wound up at my next garage sale because they were messy and difficult to use.

We are taking it back immediately. Also, for those that try to be environmentally conscientious, the T-disks are extremely wasteful with a hard plastic shell and foil top.

Because they are so slow to ship, you don't know they canceled until two or three weeks later you don't receive the order. We are constantly running out of coffee.

Not to be found. I'm not sure what hell I'll have to go through to get it. We'll see.So beware. Be warned. Be prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the discriminating coffee drinker","review":"If you're looking for a novelty coffee machine, this is for you but it won't give you real coffee or cappucino.This machine appears to be a cheaper knock-off of the Nespresso D90 and Concept capsule machines, which make excellent coffee and espresso. It tries to go one step further with the milk pod to give you instant cappucino but falls flat.The package says it's creamer made from milk. Doesn't taste like milk and half the pod goes unused on the automatic setting. It says not to refrigerate the creamer so you can't use the leftover milk again.If you're comparing this to Starbucks (I think Peet's is better) coffee, this is worse.The positive reviews seem suspect. The reviewers have either nothing critical to say about other products they've rated or this is their first review.

I could never get the lattes to work correctly (I would get the espresso part fine, but the milk dics always caused a malfunction and I am a meticulous about following instructions) and the regular coffee was definitely not as good regular Mr. Coffee brewed.

I love the Keurig and hate the Tassimo. The Keurig is always ready to brew with no wait. The Tassimo has to warm up and heat the water first. Plus, the Tassimo rarely correctly reads the bar code on the T-discs. I've had 4 cups of coffee today and had to manually (holding down the brew button for the duration of the brewing process) make each one with the Tassimo. In short, the Keurig is a hassle-free, coffee on demand product. The Tassimo is a wait a couple a couple minutes for water to heat up, hold down the button while the cup brews product. I would not recommend the Tassimo to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinks taste good but it generates a lot of trash","review":"We gave this as a Christmas gift along with a variety of coffees and latte pods. The gift went over well and the recipient was really happy with it. The family jokingly fought over who got to press the button each time. All of the drinks we tried tasted good and were the appropriate temperature.The only thing that really bothered us about it was the amount of waste from the pods. I knew it was single use and expected a little bit of waste but we cringed at the amount of trash from the pods. They were large pieces of plastic packaged in a cardboard box in a plastic/metallic bag and the plastic didn't even have a recycle symbol on it.If you're constantly driving to coffee shops to pick up drinks this might make sense but I'm sticking to my french press and loose tea at home for beverages that taste just as good and generate a lot less trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Every Time","review":"I really like the ease of use and the freshness of the coffee. The cappuccino and expresso are as good as in a coffee house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Conveinence, need more variety","review":"The Tassimo coffee system is a very convenient appliance. The coffee is good and it brews very quickly. The availability of coffee should be expanded to supermarkets and the variety of available products should be expanded. Currently, the coffee is only available in home furnishing stores like Bed Bath and Beyond, or by mail order."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works but too expensive","review":"This was a wonderful Christmas gift that someone gave. The machine works. You get a cup of hot coffee in about a minute with little mess to clean up. The bad news is the coffee is too expensive and choice is limited to what kinds of coffee and teas that can be used. So if your wealth is such that the cost doesn't matter and you like the coffee then go for it.I'm thinking of acendently knocking it off the counter and inadvertnetly kicking it hard enough to break it so I can throw the damn thing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas Present","review":"I got one for me and one my son's family for Christmas and mine doesn't work and never did, they won't take take it back or exchange it so I'm out the money for the maker and I have all this coffee and hot chocolate sitting here unused with a coffee maker on the counter reminding of a Chrismas present that doesn't work. Be careful where you buy this Target has it and you can return it if it doesn't work!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I bought this and they dont have Hazelnut coffee","review":"When I bought my Tassimo from Bed Bath and Beyond the sales rep told me I could order online Hazelnut coffee. I come to find the Tassimo has a very limited range and its of brands i never heard of. I really was looking forward to making Hazelnut cappuccinos in my home. I am returning this system and going with the system my sister just got, the FLAVIA since it not only makes cappuccinos it makes Hazelnut, French Vanilla cappuccinos. I can't believe these guys launched a system in the states without flavored coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Non-Review","review":"I can't review this product because the product was unable to make it through customs for some reason and had to be returned to sender.

I haven't had a good cup of coffe since I got the machine and went back to my old Calaphon Coffee maker. The idea of single serve is great. Hopefully someday the coffee pods will improve. But, if you like the taste of brown water; enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST RIGHT","review":"I have been using the Tassimo 1400 System for about 6 months now and enjoy it as much today as the day it came into my home. What a joy for the single who does not want to make more than a cup of any beverage. My tea is always perfect and that ocassional latte or cappachino what a treat. No it is not Starbucks or that coffee specialty shop down the street however it is the next best thing to it. (In my case that Starbucks or Speciality shop is at least a 30 min drive.) Well worth the investment even though the discs are to the more expensive side what I save in not wasting extra coffee or tea to make a pot is worth it. The travel mug size thing is what made my rating 4 instead of 5. I got one for the office so we can offer our clients a choice of beverages because I liked this one so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous . . .","review":"I've had my Tassimo for close to two months and use it several times daily. I've never had a single problem with it - it's incredibly easy to use and clean up is simple (I don't know what the people complaining about mess are talking about). Best of all, the coffee, lattes, cappucinos, hot chocolate & tea drinks are great. No, it's not Starbucks - but it's as close as you'll get with a single serve home machine. I love it and recommend it highly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tassimo is a great product","review":"After studying similar marchines on the market, I chose the Tassimo. Pros: quick & easy to use; great tasting beverages--it truly does make the perfect cup; the variety of beverages including coffees, teas, hot chocolates PLUS lattes and cappuccinos. Cons: when you remove the cup base and use a larger cup, a small amount of unused water drains into the base which you have to wipe up--it's not a big deal though. My sister bought the competitor Keurig and after testing hers I still like my Tassimo better for 2 reasons: 1) I can have lattes and cappuccinos and 2)it makes a better cup of coffee. In defense of Keurig though, it is a well-made machine, it accomodates larger cups better, and offers a larger variety of coffees but lacks the lattes and cappuccinos. To give the Tassimo lattes some variety, I have bought flavored coffee syrups so I can have hazelnut, vanilla and caramel lattes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tassimo made me a coffee lover!","review":"I have never liked drip coffee. Between the bland taste and the mess created to make it, I have always avoided dealing with the coffee maker.Now that we have the Tassimo, making coffee, lattes, cappucino, hot chocolate, tea and more are so easy!! No mess and quick to serve, even for a group.I would recommend cleaning under the t-disc holder, especially after using any of the milk products. A small amount of fluid does build up there after every cup and can cause residue to drop into your cup the next time you use it. It's super fast and easy for clean-up.We have a Nespresso machine at work which I also like, but for the low cost of the Tassimo and the variety of beverages you can make, I think this is a great value! We use the 20% off coupon from Bed, Bath & Beyond to buy more t-discs at a discount."},{"rating":"2","title":"good coffee, environmentally unfriendly","review":"I do love the coffee but I wish that the disks were recyclable. There's a plastic part with a foil top that has to be thrown in the trash after each use. Out here in Oregon we hate to throw anything into the trash. Tassimo would be doing the earth a big favor if it could figure out how to make a biodegradable or recyclable disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very decent machine","review":"Tassimo is a very decent hot beverage machine. The pros outweigh the cons. My highest praise is for the variety of drinks offered... coffee, tea, espresso, latte, cappuccino, cafe crema, and hot chocolate. Selection of beverage brand is currently very limited, but the company is promising an expansion of the T-DISC line. Tassimo-World is an excellent reference site for all things Tassimo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like hot water with a hint of flavor...","review":"I don't know what kind of coffee people drink but this is horrible. Anyway, I certainly didn't expect any kind of coffee house coffee, but I did expect a bit more than coffee flavored water. I returned it and happy that I did. I'd rather buy an espresso machine and a coffee machine and do it that way, than spend this much money on something that is not near worth it. If I could rate this with minus stars, I would, but I had to give it at least one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money and Time","review":"I received this as a free promotional gift and although I appreciate the thought it is a terrible product. I was looking forward to it being a great coffee machine, but it's not.There are two things that make it a waste of money for those of you who may think of buying it.1. You can only buy tasteless and weak coffee to use in it.2. You can't buy the coffee in any local grocery store, only specialty kitchen stores or Amazon. This is not very convenient.I bought all the coffees that Amazon sells and along with a few friends tested them out. The only thing worth drinking was the Earl Grey Tea and the Hot Chocolate. The question you should consider, is why spend over $150 on an instant hot water machine. Use a microwave if you need it that fast.The coffee taste awful! If you are someone who drinks Pete's or Starbucks coffee on a regular basis you will not like this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst service ever.","review":"Well the product works well, but I have now been without coffee for a week and a half thanks to Tassimo's \\"service.\\" I called them today to ask where my shipment was, and they told me it shipped (I swear) 11 days ago! What on Earth takes so long to send a peasly little box to Texas? I cancelled my account. I will now pick up my discs on a local basis - and only rarely for specialty drinks only. It is much cheaper to brew regular coffee by the pot anyway if you drink alot, and it is much \\"greener\\" since there isn't a little hockey puck of plastic created for every cup you make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, slow delivery of T-Pods","review":"I bought my Tassimo in January 2007. I like the coffee very much, especially since there are many choices. However, I very much dislike the slow and inconsistent delivery of T-Pods purchased from the Tassimo site and the indifferent customer service. I have no choice but to order T-Pods, so my overall rating is influenced by delivery.The Tassimo machine has been removed from my Christmas giving list. I would not recommend it to those who cannot buy at retail, or who would feel limited by the typical retail selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I recommend this to any one who loves to brew a good cup of brew but does not like making it.

We enjoy it so much we bought a second unit for our motorhome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We've had a Bruan Tassimo about a week now and I am really disappointed in the end product which is about a measly 5 ounces of lukewarm coffee. We have to zap water in the coffee cup in the m/w twice to heat the cup, empty the water, then make the coffee, add about an ounce or so of water to it and put it back in the micro wave for another zap. Hardly user friendly. Also, we have difficulty finding the coffee pods and find that the stores are usually limited to Gevaglia decaffinated or chocolate drinks. It is one of the more expensive single cup coffee systems and one should expect a better end product then this. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one. I am returning the one I have to the store tomorrow. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Very happy with the Tassimo TA 1400. Makes hot and great coffee. My wife and friends love the Cappuchino and latte as well as the convenience of using pods to make coffee. I highly recommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be better for the price","review":"The problem with the Tassimo machine is it's design and quality. The first problem is that it sounds like a jet plane taking off when it brews a cup of coffee. I wish I were exaggerating, but it is a VERY loud machine. The other major problem is that it leaks almost as much water into the drip cup as the single cup of coffee it produces. This is especially problematic if the cup you are using does not fit onto the platform. You are then forced to place the coffee mug into the drip cup with the leaking water . Ingenious design! The quality of the coffee it produces is good, but the hassle with the noise and water only allow me to give it 2 stars. There are better products on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope it never breaks!","review":"I bought this machine in December - it broke in January - it's now March and still no machine, no refund and Tassimo always has an excuse...I've contacted them by phone and emails several times.I did love the coffee when I had the machine. But I wouldn't spend the time or money again with a Braun product.Buyer beware! No service with this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee Ever","review":"This is the perfect treat for all coffee lovers. The unit is small and compact enough to make it on any kitchen counter. Each cup of coffee is brewed to perfection, thanks to the on board computer that reads the bar code information on each T-Disk. The unit does exactly what it advertises and my husband and I have been nothing but pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this is great!","review":"We have two of these. One at home and one we use in our RV and cabin. They both work great, We like the choice of coffees and the quick service we get when orgering coffee from Amazon. We have found out that we can buy coffe at Targets and Bed, bath & Beyond, so we're never out. Maybe not the cheapist way to get your coffee fix, but far cheaper that going to starbuck's shops and the product is just as good. I like the Late's and have not notiuced a chemical taste as was noted. You do have to watch the dates on the milk containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee","review":"I LOVE my Tassimo Beverage maker. I Love the convenience, the ease of making one FRESH cup of coffee each time I want it. Now my wife even started to drink coffee, someone who never did before.

The Tassimo made a perfect cup of coffee, it was better than going to an actual Starbucks. Now these coffees are no longer available. I have tried many of the other coffes available such Gevalia, and they taste bitter or watered down. I have now switched to Keurig. I woul drecommend that you NOT buy a Tassimo because of the poor choice of coffees available."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love My Tassimo!!!!","review":"My Tassimo is fantastic!!!! I saw an ad in a magazine shortly after purchasing a Keurig machine to replace my older pod coffee maker (typical). What completely \\"wowed\\" me was the fact that it made cappucino and latte in addition to regular coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The T-discs are also a lot smaller (flatter) and take up less space than the K-cups that the Keurig uses and the machine itself is also a lot smaller and takes up less space. I finally gave in and bought one last week and it has been in constant use ever since. I like lattes and cappucinos, my partner likes expressos and the children like hot chocolate. This machine meets everyone's needs and is ready to make the next beverage a lot quicker than the Keurig. Needless to say the Keurig is now for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Discs not a cup of tea","review":"I just received my tassimo today. I made 3 cappuccinos and made a complete mess with the second. I also have a Keurig K-cup machine and it wins hands down. The only thing is it does not have the ability to make espressos or cappuccinos. But it truly does not make any mess and is easier to work. I knew when the first thing I unpacked was a cleaning disc that this machine was not going to be a \\"cup of tea\\".As others have reported the first couple of drinks, even after running several cups with the cleaning disc, tasted very plasticy. After that, and changing to a 2 espressos to one milk ratio, they were fine.If you've never used the Keurig machine you will probably be very happy with this machine. But if you are looking for a coffee maker with a large variety of coffees, you would consider the Keurig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought this thinking I would get a great quality cup of coffee...but I was dead wrong.

The coffee capsules were all loose in the sample box. The bags had been cut open and the boxes with the capsules had also been opened. All the bags were in the box but none of the parts were in the bags. The water filter had already been cut open and used.I will just sell this one since it was on \\"Sale\\" and I used a gift card, the one I have that is new works great. Cleanup is simple, just run the cleaning disc before and after use(this takes one minute each time).Beware of sale, it maybe because these were all returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not good","review":"This coffee maker brews a quick cup, but I do prefer the old-fashioned slow-brewed coffee with real steamed milk. That said, I will sacrifice some taste for a few extra minutes before work. I recommend this if you don't mind a slightly artificial taste.But I am really, really bothered by the amount of waste each cup produces. I much prefer the Senseo type coffee pods, which are still more expensive than regular coffee but at least I can throw the entire pod in the compost bin. I hate looking into my trashcan and seeing all those spent plastic Tassimo pods. Not for the earth-friendly crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two In A Row DOA","review":"Recieved the Tassimo system, set it up, followed the instructions, nothing happened. Called Tassimo customer service, they said it's defective, send it to a place in Ft. Worth. Instead I sent it back to Amazon. Got the replacement two day later. Guess what. This one tried to work, but all I got in the cup was bad tasting coffee and a lot of grounds. Tassimo customer service again said it's defective. Back it goes. Two in a row, MAJOR dissapointment. Will try the Kuerig next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Cappucino","review":"If you are an espresso or cappucino connoisseur, this is not for you.If you want a good cup of cappucino with no work, you just pop in the cartridge and press the button, this is a FANTASTIC product!Easy clean up (you do have to wipe it down after every use, but just a few drops).I love this machine and will not be without one in my kitchen until I employ my very own Italian pastry chef.Excellent product, good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this machine","review":"Not much more I can add to the positive reviews. I received this machine as a Christmas 2006 present.One negative: I do find that at times I have to open the lid where I've put the t-disc and then close it again to get my machine to go into the auto mode. Other than this, I get a perfect cup every time.I have tried most all the coffees offered but my husband and I like the lattes and cappaccinos best because they are sweeter. The earl grey and green teas are also very tasty.Bed, Bath and Beyond sells a lot of the t-discs but they are more expensive than ordering from the tassimo website. For instance, for the lattes--a package at Bed, Bath and Beyond is $8.99 (for 9 cups) vs. $4.99 on the website. Target also carries some t-discs but the choices of t-discs in my area Target are limited. All in all, I haven't been to starbucks as often because, in my opinion, the cappaccinos and lattes are just as good. This was well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Has Something For Everyone & Just Couldn't Be Easier!!!","review":"I purchased this Tassimo for my best friend & his wife. I received mine for my birthday from a couple of friends & absolutely love it. I wanted it for the tea and hot chocolate and my boyfriend wanted it for the coffee! It has something for everyone. My best friend's wife loves the espresso & capaccino! It's easier than waking up! You turn it on, slip a disc in and press a button. THEN VOILA - YOU ARE DONE!!! When you are done, you take the disc out, shut it off and YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN A THING! THAT IS RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY NO CLEAN UP!!! I have the discs delivered to my work from Tassimo every month and they are actually cheaper than buying them any other way and their service is great!!! I got it for such an EXCELLENT - LOW PRICE!!!

The coffee maker price has NOT dropped but I am weak and now have one at work and at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yum! Enjoy it while it lasts.","review":"I bought this machine yesterday after a week of doing research. I decided to go with the Tassimo because of what people were saying about the quality of the coffee with the t-disks. Set up was incredibly easy and within a half hour of opening the box, I had a fabulous cup of latte (it took that long only because you have to soak the filter in water for 30 minutes before first use). Yes, it's a little pricy, but considering the fact that a latte is almost $4 a pop at the coffee houses, I think it's worth it. I would definitely recommend this product.*Update* This machine only lasted about a year before we started having trouble with it. The coffee didn't taste good, no matter how I changed the filter and cleaned the pieces. Then it started to spit and shut off mid brew. Everyone I know (6 other people) who had this machine had the same problems.Great while it lasted, but for the price, it didn't last long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo for the Tassimo","review":"A great machine. From hot chocolate when the grandkids come over to Earl Gray tea for me, to the excellent Cream Coffee for my husband--we love almost everything about this machine.Cleaning is extremely easy--just pop the cleaning disc in and the machine is cleaned in 30 seconds.I like the manual feature. It is easy to add more water if you want to. This lets you control the strength of the beverage you are making. I don't think otherssingle beverage machines have this feature.We are hoping, however, that Kraft comes out with a better regular coffee disc. All the others are wonderful.This is a versatile, good looking appliance. We've had it since the end of October and use it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonder maker","review":"I love my Tassimo System.

Sorry for the confusion and the duplication.I got the Tassimo two years ago as a wedding present. Not much of a cofee drinker but I will make myself a cup every once in awhile. The great thing is that you can buy so many different varieties of hot beverages and everyone is happy. No more brewing a cup of Decaf for one person and regular for the next. It takes about a minute per brew and everyone is happy. The pod fills about half a cup so you should plan on using two pods per person. I really like the hot choclate and the espresso. We have never had a mechanical problem and it is super easy to clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for yummy hot chocolate or tea, you may want to look elsewhere","review":"I bought this machine about a year ago because I wanted frothy hot chocolate like you get from the machines. I also wanted to use it for tea. Well, I have been VERY disappointed because both beverages tasted like the machine's plastic water tank. I thought running the cleaning disc many times would help,(it's what customer service recommended as well)but it didn't help. A year later, it STILL tastes like plastic. I've never tried the coffee, but it seems that most people here use the Tassimo for coffee and, from the reviews I have read, those people have no problems with the taste of the coffee. However, if, like me you want hot chocolate or tea, this probably isn't the best machine. I suspect that the coffee is okay because coffee's taste is so strong and distinctive, that it covers up the plastic taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for a small office","review":"We purchased a Tassimo beverage system for our office about a month ago. Everyone is pleased with it and happy to be able to make one cup of several available beverage options to suit a variety of tastes. It was very easy to set-up and even easier to use. We no longer waste pots of regular, decaf or flavored when someone wanted another kind than what was currently brewing. Now everyone brews whatever they want whenever they want one cup at a time. And despite the per cup cost, especially if making lattes and cappuccinos, it's certainly less than the cost of same at a coffee shop. And we got our free 2 packs in about 10 days. Expected it to take much longer. It's a stylish, compact design well suited for a small kitchen. Thumbs up all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine, do not believe the negative comments!","review":"Quite simply, this is not a \\"cheap machine\\". I have owned it now for about a month, and the ONLY negative I can say about it is that the coffee tastes so good, I'm going through too many T-Discs. If you order the T-discs direct from Tassimo, they take too long to get them (almost 2 weeks). I went to Bed, Bath, and Beyond, paid the same price as on the internet but with no shipping and no waiting.My kids love the hot chocolate, and I find that the Carte Noire coffee is the best tasting they offer.It's a great machine, well worth the extra $$$. I bought the cheap Senseo for $50, and took that sucker back. Coffee didn't taste good, and it was luke-warm at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but....","review":"I got this to replace my Keurig that died. I love the coffee and the fact that they have milk cups for it. My only complaint is it needs constant clean up, especially after making a latte or some drink other than plain coffee. The Keurig rarely needed anything. And that dribble cup is not cool. If you take it out to make a travel cup or large cup, you better have a dishrag or paper towel handy. After I ordered this I found out about the Bosch tassimo. I wish I would have ordered that one so I highly suggest you check that out before you make your decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for an office","review":"We use our tassimo in our office and it's great to offer our clients different choices of coffee drinks. THe only negative thing I would say about it, is that it is a little bit loud when it's brewing and also the t-disc's are kind of expensive. But the clients feel very special when they can \\"order\\" their specialty drink from us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wait until it breaks!","review":"The customer service for this product is THE worst! This is the second review I have written for this product (my first one didn't make it up here for some reason). Anyway, the machine starting spraying water from the top and wouldn't quit until I unplugged it (this was just 2 months after I received it for Christmas). Now, when I plug it in, nothing happens. It is dead and broken. Customer Service says to send it in, of course, I have to pay for the shipping to send it in to get fixed. Closest service center is in San Francisco??? Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tassimo 1400","review":"I have tried many different coffee makers and this is the easiest to use with the least mess, most consistent coffee, and best flavor. I have an espresso maker, a coffee press, drip coffee makers, a couple of different pod machines, and a few others and the Tassimo makes the most flavorful coffee with the least amount of mess. The 1400 does need to be kept clean or it will not work as well but it is not difficult to run the cleaning cycle with the included cleanup disc. Since I am the only person in my household who drinks coffee, I have been trying all of the single serving coffee makers trying to find one that works well and this was it for me. The only one that I haven't tried is the Keurig but I see no reason to now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Tassimo TA 1400","review":"I love this machine. It's so easy to you.

It does a very good job with most things, but I agree with some others that it isn't quite up to Starbucks quality or cup size. I usually use two espresso discs at a time because I like strong drinks. Two of these plus one of the hot cocoa discs makes a decent size, very tastey Moca drink. I'm mostly a coffee snob, but the Maxwell branded stuff works quite well for less money. The Yuban Rain Forest blend, claimed to be organic, is actually great standard coffee at a reasonable price. The device needs very little cleaning. You may be tempted to wait too long between cleanings in which case things can get a little sticky and gross, but as one person said, just a minute or two of hot-water rinsing every twenty uses or so works great. BTW, I have the Senseo at home and can't wait for it to die as I like the Tassimo a whole lot better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Coffee","review":"Great machine and coffee better than Starbucks. Only issue we have with this machine is that it is very noisy.

It makes a decent cup of coffee, and if they have your preferred coffee type, this may be a good choice for you. However, for the same price the Keurig B60 is a better buy. I use a Keurig at work and bought a Tassimo for home, figuring that it would be similar in features to the Keurig. I found the Tassimo lacking in comparison. Here's what I like about each:Tassimo:Nice looking machineWater filter is a good plusThe ability to do milk based drinks like lattesKeurig:Also nice lookingWider selection of coffeeYou can buy a filter that allows you to use your own coffeeIncludes a menu driven LCD that allows you to adjust things like temperature, auto-start time, cup size, etc. LCD also gives you status message so you know what the unit is doingThe side mounted water cannister is more convient than the rear mount of the Tassimo (strictly preferance here)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best single cup brewer I have owned!","review":"This is my third personal brewer. I own a Senseo (passable quality, decent coffee although SMALL serving unless you use a double pod and very reliable. I also own an \\"O - Pod which was very pricey and again - the need for a double pod for a full mug of coffee. The Tassimo (Braun Model) is the BEST personal brewer of the three, by far. The Tassimo coffee T-discs are expensive, but do make a FULL MUG of coffee using just ONE, so it evens out. Starbucks have a line of T-discs for those who like Starbuck's coffee, too.The Tassimo makes a FULL MUG - the coffee is HOT - it isn't excessively noisy - the water reservoir is large and easy to fill. I LOVE this coffee maker.The only negative is the waste created by the T-discs - I doubt if they are a \\"green\\" product. Maybe Tassimo can respond to that issue in future iterations.In any event - you will not regret this purchase if your goal is a full MUG of piping hot, delicious coffee, hot chocolate or tea.

Well, 5 weeks later and Tassimo has billed my credit card twice and told me they don't have the item and will not look into tracking. They refuse to credit my account.

Instead, I have to clean the machine after each milk brew with a clear disc and just found out the coffee is made by Maxwell House- the king of average coffee. Definately not worth 169 dollars. Even Martha Stewart Live had an issue making a cup with a Tassimo- it didn't work 2x on live TV.I had a Keurig before the Tassimo and was fed up with making hot chocolate without a k-cup.

I also thought the bar code concept was cool too. I ended up buying my first Tassimo machine, began the cleaning process and when I turned the machine on it sparked and smelled like burning wires. I unplugged it, plugged it back in and it was a no-go. So I returned that one for a second one, only to find that when I began the cleaning process again, no hot water came out and when I called customer service they said the nearest repair center was about 6 hours away from me. Also, the machine was horribly, horribly loud when I turned it on, and when I called the customer service line the guy told me that the machine is just loud. I never got to try the coffee, so I can't really say if it was good or not, but if it tastes anything like the way this machine is built, its probably horrible.

I have had absolutely no problems with my system. Set up was easy and the directions very understandable. This system makes a great cup of coffee. There are two reasons why I did not give it 5 stars: l. Some of the choices of the coffee T-discs only make a 4 ounce cup of coffee. So, to make a full cup you have to use two T-discs for each cup. 2. It would be great if there was an empty, reusable disc that a person could fill with their own favorite coffee. I love my machine and look forward to my morning cup of coffee. The machine is a bit noisy when brewing but after the first day it becomes unnoticeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this, mine broke down in a week","review":"This is NOT a well designed product. The T-discs need to be punctured to operate properly which is supposed to happen when you close the lid. You'll spend more time closing and reclosing the lid to get the badly built device to puncture the tdisc than you will enjoying your coffee. I spend minutes every morning cursing this device as I close and reclose the lid.Some mornings the motor just takes the day off and even though the lid punctures, nothing happens except that it gurgles water out of its various holes onto the countertop and then goes to sleep.It's a cheap plastic badly conceived product that is a lot less simple to use than people on here are making it sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Birthday to Me!","review":"My husband asked me what I wanted for my birthday. When I told him that I wanted the Braun Tassimo, I'm sure that he thought, \\"But we already have a coffee maker\\". Little did he know that the Tassimo is not JUST a regular coffee maker. After reading the reviews posted on Amazon, I admit that I was quite apprehensive. People were complaining about how loud the machine was. One reviewer described it being as loud as a machine gun?? I admit that it is not as quiet as my regular coffee maker but it certainly is not as loud as some people described. When we first tried it out, our newborn infant was sleeping in the room right beside the kitchen. She didn't wake at all.Overall, I very much enjoy the machine. The Gevalia coffees are great! For the price per cup... I would much rather stay at home, in the comforts of my own living room than in a loud and crowded coffee bar, paying an arm and a leg for a cup of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little noisy, but otherwise very nice","review":"The Tassimo is a very nice beverage machine. The machine is fairly noisy, and the selection of T-Discs is a little limited, the cappuccino and hot chocolate it makes are fantastic. It is very simple to use, and very fast. For a single drink, it is much faster than even instant coffee made in a microwave, and much better tasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tassimo","review":"My parents had one and so I had a chance to \\"try before I buy\\" and that's where I fell in love with it. It is so much cheaper than Starbucks and there are recipies online that let you make \\"designer\\" drinks just like they do, for a third of the cost. My only complaint is that it makes my coffee a little weaker than my parents, however I can adjust that by pushing the stop button before the cycle is finished, which is a bit of a pain but do-able. Overall, its a great machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Chocolate Needs to be revamped","review":"I personally am in love with this system, but the reason I bought it was for the Hot Chocolate! My daughter hated instant hot chocolate, so I thought this would be alot better...and it is... by about one notch!

Just like one of the reviewers below I have the originals of all these songs of course they are bootlegs but they all sound 100 times better. The original Pac's Life is one verse with Prince's Pop Life music. What's Next also is way better on the original. The only two good songs on here are Untouchable Remix, and Soon As I Get Home which uses the original. Bout time I got to the song with Keisha Cole I was ready to take the cd out which is a first for me when it comes to 2pac. Also the original Don't Sleep has Daz on it and a much better beat.

She should read Mark Warhol's book on The Art of Programming with Visual Basic - there's a writing style that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best VB book I ever read","review":"In a very easy and straightforward manner, this book introduces the concepts of Object Oriented Programming and shows how it works in VB5. Deborah Kurata uses the GUIDS methodology, which is simple and very efective in any serious software project. OOP is a BIG time-saver, as it lets you create resusable buildind blocks, that can be compiled and called from any other applications you develop, keeping your code concise and easy to trace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"A few of these reviews are dead-on. This book is so impractical that it is laughable. Deb Kurata needs to leave the lecture circuit and do some work in the real world. It's just not this simple. Maybe a good grade school book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For novices only...","review":"An extremely high-level look at the fundamentals of OO programming. The techniques illustrated are certainly not advised for the serious developer and do not reflect what Microsoft considers as best practices for n-tiered development. The world is a little more complicated than simply wrapping tables in classes and Kurata devotes very little time to discussing when and why certain techniques should be used. The variables that need to be considered when making performance, reusability, encapsulation, scalability, and abstraction decisions simply aren't covered in this book. The VB5 product ships with better docs than this book (Programmer's Guide, Getting Results, etc.).

Tom Miller travels awful far to come home with his suitcase full of frat-boy stereotypes and over determined metaphors. Cubans here are sexy, mango eating, Chevy driving caricatures. Having traveled there frequently over the last ten years, I can tell you the only subject illuminated by this book is the inability of Miller's mind to look past his own North American biases. There are excellent books about Cuba written by strangers to that country, see Cardenal's for example. There are also excellent books about Cuba written by Cubans, see for example Franqui. This book however is not worthy of the trees that died for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-indulgent, disjointed dog of a book. Awful!","review":"This book is a complete waste of money and time. The author demonstrates little (if any) literary skill. The book is completely disjointed, with little connection between paragraphs. It contains pointless accounts of virtually every boring encounter the author had. It is painful reading. In my view, the book is not worth the paper it is written on. There is very little that any traveller to Cuba will find useful and it's not worth the effort to find the few things that might be moderately helpful.

The extra storage space is wonderful, I'll be buying another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty easy to mount, with a little planning","review":"A pretty good product. Take your time mounting the first one if you order more than one like I did. I recommend figuring out the lines you want the racks to follow first, then mark the stud points along those lines.

All in all, easy to install, and sturdy enough to get a lot of miscellaneous junk off the floor in my garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"The hardest part of the installation was locating the studs. My ceiling has 2 sheets of drywall making the stud sensor useless. I ended up drilling a bunch of tiny holes to locate the studs. Also the lag screws and the test nails are a little short for ceiling with 2-sheet drywall. I had to purchase longer ones at Home Depot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install and strong","review":"Hi.I'd read some of the other reviews before buying, so I thought installation would be a hassle. The directions were good, and I had THREE of them installed in thirty-minutes. The only thing that was [somewhat] tricky was finding the rafter beams. That's not the system's fault, it just is what it is. Once located, it went up in a snap. Everything you needed was in the package, and the instructions were logical.You need a hammer, drill with a few regular bits, and a couple of wrenches. Easy.Once installed, it seemed plenty strong to hold normal junk--lots of it. I wouldn't store a pallet of bricks or anything, but boxes of clothing, some books, kitchen gear, sporting goods--no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!","review":"I bought three of these after looking around the internet for weeks for the best deal. Amazon's free shipping got them to my front door without me getting a truck. It took several hours to get all the ceiling joists located and the location of the racks just right, but after that installation was a breeze for a not-so handyman like myself. The amount of storage is perfect and in our two car garage we put everything up and away while still getting both cars in each night.

(The latest two were on a Gold Box Special). These are very easy to install once you locate the joists in your ceiling.I was able to install them without any help and had three up in about 3 1/2 hours. I have room for two more, hence my additional purchase. (I have also ordered two of the Hyloft 45\\"X15\\" shelving systems based upon the high quality of their overheads.One recommendation: I did NOT use the nails for setting the original brackets as the directions specify. I used a one-inch screw that allowed me to immediately get the bracket off if I missed the middle of the joist on the first try. The 4 nails included are weak, and if you miss you probably won't be able to use the same nail again. Screw was MUCH easier and saved a great deal of frustration.EXCELLENT, WELL MADE and THOUGHT OUT PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Park your car in it's space","review":"Got alot of stuff off the garage floor with this product.

It takes a little effort to install but the process is very easy. Combining multiple units is simple as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I needed suspended storage in my garage so I researched all the options. The Hylofts were the best value and most cost effective solution I could find. You can spend hundreds more, but I opted for these instead. They hold 250lbs each (that's a lot) plus they can cover good square footage (you can get in a variety of sizes).All you need to do is make sure you screw them into your ceiling joists. From there you hang the arms down to a variety of lengths, depending on your needs. The rest of the setup is easy, just simple nuts, bolts & screws.I had just moved into my house and was having contract work done, so I had the contract attach the arm mount to the ceiling joists, then did the rest myself. I had four of them done in about an hour.Once mounted and filled with stuff, they do swing slightly, but not much. Overall they feel solid. For the price, you just can't beat it.Thumbs up from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good system overall, but be aware of a couple of things.","review":"Other reviewers have covered this item well. In my experience, the hardest part of installation was locating the ceiling joists behind the drywall and getting the ceiling brackets up. It's not all that comfortable standing on a ladder, looking up, and working on the ceiling. Once the four ceiling brackets are up, then it's pretty smooth sailing. I overtightened and snapped one of the small bolts that connect the grids to each other, so watch out for that. (Luckily, Hyloft included a spare.) The unit sways when you move items onto the rack but overall it feels like it will hold up. A small nitpick is that I measured the grid and it's actually 43 x 45 inches, not 45 x 45. So one star off for the somewhat inaccurate product title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Hy loft is great if you plan on storing items of very little weight. Its also very cheesy looking if you are a man that wants a tough looking garage. I suggest Monster Rax if you want a tough sturdy rack for storage.

No, i do not work for Monster Rax, i am just a satisfied customer who has tried others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced at $70","review":"Just picked up four of these from Lowes, $[...] each. Decent product. Fairly easy to install. Once you have the ceiling brackets screwed in the rest is easy. Only takes one person, though two would be great. Keeps you from running up and down the ladder. I used mine for ceiling storage above my garage door. Once you see them in the box you will understand why paying more than $30 - $40 bucks is to much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best storage solution ever!","review":"We now have eight of these Hyloft units in our garage/basement. We started with only two and keep adding them. They are so nice looking and keep everything up off the floor and so organized. I have things stored on them according to category, ie; electrical & plumbing parts, car parts, camping gear and ice chests yard supplies. I use a lot of the plastic storage buckets for small pieces and label them so I can read them from below. Only draw back that I have encountered is that I have to get the ladder out and climb up to get things down. Not a big deal when you consider that I have room in the garage now for the ladders to hang on the wall not to mention room for the cars! They hold a lot of weight too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well made and very useful","review":"UPDATE: Owned for 4 years now. Still love them!I installed these babies in my garage ( 10 foot ceiling) a little over 3 years ago. They have proved to be durable and cosmetically pleasing ever since. They fit right above the garage door and are hidden by it when the door is open. When the garage door is closed these shelves provide the best storage space and YOU CAN SEE WHATS ON THE SHELF!I would recommend to all who need extra storage space in a garage. I store coolers, mower parts, camping equip, christmas lights and more up there. On the ends I hung \\"S\\" hooks to hold my extension cords up and my lightweigt ladder hangs on these as well . Make sure you install into structural rafters becuase these babies will hold a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy install; very useful!","review":"I bought 2 of these years ago to try and increase my garage storage.

Bought 1 of the 4'x4'. Fits with no touching, or any other problems (well, except finding studs to mount to the ceiling)! Bought 2 more and now I have to room I needed for boxes and decorations and baby stuff and whatever else I need to put away!

I could not put the brackets 45 inches apart because of the rafters but it doesn't matter because the shelf can hang over the ends.

They were well packaged, had good instructions and high quality materials. I really appreciated the small touches, such as carriage bolts that fit into the grid so you can tighten with just a wrench, self locking nuts and clear labeling on the small parts. The packaging of the nuts and bolts was really helpful. It's a small tray that holds everything in compartments so there's no sorting so you can just grab what you need and go. There are also extra parts clearly labeled as \\"extras\\".Anyone with a reasonable comfort level with tools, especially a cordless drill/driver can easily put one of these units up in 45 minutes.A word of advice - wear safety glasses.

I would really like to extend it but I wouldn't be able to open my garage door over and over without taking it down.

Although the garage ceiling/roof hasn't been sheet-rocked I read the reviews and directions here and thought \\"That'll work.\\" Unfortunately it didn't work out that way.Yes, it will work on pitched ceilings, but they would have to be a pretty shallow slope - ours is far less than 45 degrees (around 25) and the supports simply weren't long enough on one end or short enough on the other to adjust. It's a shame really as the system itself seems very, very well constructed.Oh, and like another reviewer mentioned, the screws will go in just fine if you remember to prepare the screws with a little old fashioned bar soap. Once the threads are coated it'll zip right in.

Every piece in every box had multiple scratches and gouges down the the bare metal with rust beginning to show. They were so bad that people asked if I had bought them used.I suspect that I received product that was misplaced for some years and was finally found and shipped out. The zip ties for holding multiple units together all snapped when I tried to pull them tight. I had to go buy new zip ties, which led me to believe that this was some very old product.Bottom line: I suggest that you buy these locally if possible. Our Lowes had the same product for about a buck less. Returns would be much faster and convenient.I agree with the other reviews that this is a well designed product.

Sadly, Amazon doesn't offer a sample clip so I buzzed around the internet until I found a sample from the CD and it was the Breathing exercise.The mans voice sounds somewhat automated. \\"Breath in two, three, four...\\" I'm trying to decide if I find his voice soothing or even tolerable for meditation but then as he begins counting down (to exhale) you hear this loud \\"AHHHHHHHH....\\" followed by \\"out two, three, four\\". Kinda caught me off guard. Personally, I didn't find his voice soothing or the loud \\"AHHHHHH\\" relaxing. In fact, I immediately realized that I would end up feeling anxiety instead of relaxation and decided this isn't the right Meditation disc for me. Before you buy a CD, try to find a sample of the persons voice leading the meditation. Had I purchased this, I would have been truly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation","review":"This was one of the worst 'relaxation' techniques I have ever experienced. I would rate this <1, but that was not a choice. I bought two different CDs on the same day and I have listened to Indigo Dreams only twice; the first time I turned it off and the second was to make sure I heard it correctly the first time. This CD is useless to me, since I bypass most of it. The breathing exercises are absolutely horrible; the counting seems to make you FORCE your breath, as opposed to relaxing and allowing your body to do what's natural. I would not recommend this for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great!","review":"I also bought this CD on it's great reviews. As a person who is studying hypnosis and deep relaxation this CD just isn't that great. It sounds like a seminar or something you could listen to on the ride to work. Just not while you are trying to really \\"relax\\". I'm not sure what it has to do about Indigo's or Dreams...both of which aren't addressed in this CD. It all depends on what you are looking for in a CD. It's not a soothing person talking to help you fall asleep..."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all need affirmations","review":"We have had a few of Lori Lite CD's in the house now for the past 5 years. The Indigo Dream's collection has helped my son learn the skills to cope with his ADHD and Sensory issues without medication. I decided to give the adult CD a go for myself in hopes of some techniques to learn for myself with stress, which leads to anger and anxiety.I bought this CD and was really pleased with the results to which this CD has helped me with. By eliminating the stress and the calming voice and wonderful, positive affirmations that are on this CD, it has helped me to manage my stress and also helped me to make healthier food choices. Healthier food choice helped me to kick start my weight loss and I continue to fell better and better each day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathing instructions are completely incorrect","review":"The instructions given on the CD for \\"belly\\" or diaphragmatic breathing are exactly the opposite of what they should be. The narrator says that your belly should expand when you breathe out. Not only is this illogical, since you are expelling air, but absolutely incorrect. In this kind of breathing, the belly should expand when you breathe in and contract when you breathe out.Aside from this rather serious flaw, after listening a couple of times to the comparison between how a tortoise and a rat breathe, I wanted to tell the narrator to shut up.I bought this CD because of the preponderance of 5-star ratings, and regret having wasted my money. I can get better relaxation techniques for free over the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"This was not was I expected. I didn't like this cd but maybe someone else will.

My children have been using the Indigo Dreams CDs for years. They have had such a positive impact on my family that I finally decided to try one for myself. The stress managing exercises help me wind down from my daily stressful routine. I used to toss and turn till 1 am unable to shut my mind off. Now, I look forward to getting in bed knowing the CD will help me stop thinking long enough to fall asleep. I love the visualization that is also designed to boost my immune system. All of the techniques are easy to follow and listen to. The speakers voice is soothing and the music is also first rate. This entire series has become a part of my families lives. My kids are now enjoying the new music CD.Indigo Dreams: Kids Relaxation Music Decreasing Stress, Anxiety and Anger, improve sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Calming","review":"This CD is great! The first time I used it was after a very stressful day when I was hoping to take a nap but was so wired I couldn't sleep. This CD is so soothing, I was able to completely relax my whole body and fall asleep. The quality of the recording is so crisp and clear and the man's voice is very calming. It is almost hypnotizing. There are a few different sections to the CD. It is great that the body relaxation part (about 15 minutes) is near the end and is then followed by very relaxing music (about 10 minutes), so after I fell asleep my CD player automatically shut off. I highly recommend this CD. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tool for relaxing...","review":"The quality and content of this CD was no surprise. We own the one for children and loved it. This CD has proven itself as well. The CD is a wonderful evening or bedtime tool to slow oneself down, to relax, to destress. The quality of my sleep is much improved and my heart rate has slowed down considerably which can only improve my overall health as well! This family owns several of the Indigo Dreams products and every one is a wonderful tool. As you can tell, I recommend all Indigo Dreams products highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love this guided meditation CD. It's my first one, but I love this type of meditation anyways. I think it's great, it relaxes me and the affirmations help me feel better about myself.

A lot of the people who like the heavier bands may enjoy this, it's just not the sound I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product !","review":"I'm sorry, but this is hopeless for the following reasons :(1) It is hot after cooking and with a mit on you cannot open it without moving the grease tray, but then grease runs out onto your counter. The part you put your hand on to open it is not real hot compared to the edge but even without a mit the clearance between the grease tray and the place you open it is small and it is real easy to accidentally move it when opening.(2) The instructions said to cook a large hamburger 8-9 minutes for medium, I tried that, burned to a crisp. I said \\"fine\\", and I tried 4 minutes. The hamburger was burned crisp on the surface and medium to rare inside, in other words it is too hot for a hamburger.(3) And here's a big one, it is easy to have the extremely hot rear part touch the power cord when putting food into a preheated grill. Obviously this is very dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"1998 Release","review":"Amazon lists this as a 2007 release when in fact it dates from 1998. In my view Bruno e Marrone haven't found their niche yet when they made this album. There are no memorable, melodious songs on this cd. As per another review of mine for this duo: if you want to buy only one Bruno e Marrone CD, buy 2003's \\"Inevitavel\\" - a great CD with many brilliant songs which linger in your head, esp track 2 - 4 + 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake","review":"I purchased this flag for a grand opening of a new manufacturing facility. The governor of NC was going to be there for this event. The night before the event (which was held in a tent) the tent was blown down in a violent thunderstorm with high winds. As the tent was being reconstructed, the three flags (US, NC and company flag) got wet and were thrown in a corner by the tent people. The NC flag's red stripe had bled onto all of the white parts of the other flags. So, I had a pink, red and blue (with pink stars) US flag, a NC flag with a red and pink stripe and a company flag which had been a white flag, that was now pink. It was a disaster. I threw the NC flag away. It was unsalvageable. I replaced the US flag from a local Walmart store. I scrubbed the white background of the company flag. I will NEVER use Amazon again for this type of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather a let down","review":"I was really looking forward to reading another novel by the talented author of The Vow and The Baron. Unfortunately, this one is not nearly as heart-tugging and emotional as the former. The constant faith discussions for the first half of the book between the two leads really started to wear me down (Can we talk about something else besides religion?) And if Aislinn is so pious as to worry about breaking a commandment (like lying) - isn't fornication right up there as well - perhaps even more serious? A little contradicting.However, I did like the history info - esp the final chapter included by Garnet about her research.Inspite of this, I look forward to Garnet's next book. I still think she has incredible talent and potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL KNIGHT AND DAMOISELLE","review":"I loved this story and the way it was written.

While not the best I ever read, it is worth a read by anyone interested in Renaissance-era romance.While it starts a little slow with all the talk of monks and the abbey, it picks up as soon as the pair meet. The obstacle to their love - the fundamental nature of the two people - was an excellent one, because it was realistic and believable, as opposed to being kept apart by some ridiculous misunderstanding or such that is often the case with romance novels.I have never read a book by this author before, but I am going to look for more by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"This was the most boring book I have ever read!

They have been around for a long time where I enjoyed their small, colorful illustrative books as a child.

For those children who enjoy science and the curiousity of insects, this book is handy and a nice presentation of introducing them to the world of insects."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Bug Books","review":"Even if you didn't read a word of the educational information concerning the orders of insects this book is worth the photos alone. Outstanding as a field guide, the photos are excellent, and often include inset photos of larvae. Handy ID notes right on the photos point out details of the insect to make identification easier. A photo Table of Contents will help you zero right in on the order of the insect in question. This is not the only bug book I have, but by far the most used. Though featuring insects of all of North America, each photo and description tell you the range so you know if the insect you are questioning is even in your area. If you even have a mild interest in insects, this makes a great \\"picture book\\" to peruse, but for those who are seriously interested in ID'ing and learning it is an indispensable tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of Your Seat","review":"Fascinating and exciting book. Shackelton writes in the most British of style -- he describes an ice floe splitting beneath his tent in the same plain delivery as the description of a depth sounding. The book is overflowing with the most amazing of events, placing Shackelton's crew in an adventure every bit as great as Lewis and Clark's expedition (read the Ambrose book \\"Undaunted Courage\\" if you like this one).This is a fine edition, as it includes approx. eighty photographs of the expedition. From the outset of the voyage to the harrowing crossing of St. George Island, this guy would put today's extreme adventure-seekers to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 Antarctic Expedition","review":"Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton's own words reproduced.

Only the first half is about Shakleton's expedition. The rest amounts to a log of the Aurora crew that Shakleton relays second-hand.The Endurance expedition, itself, is quite a piece of history, but the book does a poor job of showing this. The writing is dry. Killing dogs, penguins and seals is a regular thing. Location and weather are reported on almost every page. He does give a good sense of the cold, however and the food supplies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good text (I suppose), awful edition","review":"I am sure Ernest Shackleton's account of his adventure deserve a better edition than this one.

Venturing into possibly the most unwelcoming area on Earth, Shackleton and his team faced the most overwhelming difficulties in trying to make mankind's first crossing of the Antarctic continent. Although they failed to achieve their aim, most of the party survived against incredible odds.The book has a host of excellent photos, and the comments added to Shackelton's text by editor Peter King are very helpful.

The words \\"High Quality\\" appear twice on the cover much the same as one expect on some cheap plastic toy. The \\"quality\\" of this book is below pathetic. It's a faintly printed copy in a typewriter font. Any middle school student would be embarrassed to submit this level of presentation as homework response to an essay question.

You can see there is still a very conservative 'Leave it to Beaverish' quality here, especially in the stiff acting by the parents. Also, it's filmed with a glow filter over the lens, giving a kind of hazyish quality, very weird. They only used to do that for aging female stars to hide the wrinkles.

Boy likes girl, girl doesn't know he exists but his best friend adores him. Mary Stuart Masterson was the right pick for the character of Watts. Notice the kiss scene: Masterson exhibits the perfect balance of nervous tension and school girl charm, holding back and striking at the right moment. Mary, you should have gotten tons of work after this performance but I think you were typecasted. At least we still have this film to cherish.

The author's narrative style is mostly straightforward, and frequently told from a female perspective. Men are not the bogeyman, but often seemed caught in their own constructed lives as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning of the end for the Gold Belt","review":"This show is pretty much sums up why the NWA never caught up to the WWF.

However, Flair pulled a backstage power play, and not only got the win, but also got Dusty Rhodes fired, and Luger de-pushed.

I just feel like I don't know what the point was. And then, the pasty black-haired guy who saved Marian from the accident driving his black hearse comes on looking all creepy for the last 2 minutes and I'm left thinking \\"What the F?\\"I dunno... I was told by a few people that this movie was so fantastic and that I had to see it, so I did. I'm certainly not making any recommendations here.

Especially the son.I rented this... \\"film\\" becuase I go to Bloody-Disgusting.com for my horror movie news. And they gave it, 4 skulls I believe.

There isn't much gore, as matter of fact you don't actually see anyone getting killed at all. All that said, somehow this film flows and gives enough chills topped off with some funny one liners to make this a ride to remember. The ending was kind of lame, but I still would recommend checking this one out anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate thriller","review":"\\"Dead End\\" offers an absorbing, terrifying and genuinely creepy tale involving a whole family on a trip that takes a detour at Christmastime.

Normally, it doesn't take much to create a watchable movie around this idea, but not so much here. The acting and dialogue are utterly ridiculous. The first 10 minutes or so of the movie involve a family in a car, with a young (16 y/o-ish) boy almost nonstop harassing another male passenger about him being gay. About 5 minutes later, that same annoying boy ends up masturbating in the woods. Seriously, who writes this garbage? I can't possibly emphasize the need to avoid this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horror story","review":"I give this one 4-1/2 stars. I thought it was great and loved the ending.

Lugging it 10 minutes across campus leaves my shoulder and upper back sore (and I am NOT a weakling -- I lug around a 33 pound toddler all the time!). It is not roomy, and not very conducive to conveniently carrying components -- even a power cord. The water bottle pockets on the side are nearly useless because of the way they're designed.And worst of all, having only used this bag for a little while, the top handle is ripping off!

I just don't get it. The silence is deafening. No site? A disappointment, but no problem that can't be forgiven if someone just took the time to offer those of us who spent $30.00 an explanation.

I was pleasantly surprised when we turned the disposal on. It was so much quieter than the old unit. In fact, I actually thought, is it working? When the old unit began to malfunction sometimes it would only hum, opposed to spinning as it should. I'm if you are looking for a new disposal, then you know the humming sound I'm talking about. This new unit, running, chopping food, is about as loud as that hum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"We've been using this \\"Evolution\\" model for three years since we moved to a new house.

I e-mailed them 17 days after it arrived. They responded 25 days after it arrived and said it was more than 30 days and I cannot return it.

The old one was way too loud and kept getting jammed up. This one is so quiet I first thought there was a problem with it, but then I realized it was just that quiet. The install went pretty smooth, the hardest part is geting the wires connected up, the wires from the switch on mine were super heavy duty gauge and were a bitch to manipulate through the hole and get connected. The drain pipe on mine needed to be trimmed down slightly to fit since this one is a little fatter I guess. Once I got everything installed it worked like a charm. I love it. I'm looking for stuff to grind up now.

I've listened to this CD years ago, and I think it's one of the best interpretation of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto no.1 to date. While watching this DVD, I felt robbed of seeing the young Kissin's virtuoso performance of this highly difficult concerto. I wished Sony Classical could produce another better DVD showcasing the then young Evgeny Kissin's amazing talents. I would highly recommend this DVD for Karajan-admirers, but if you're a Kissin-fan then trust me, you don't want to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling except for camarawork","review":"I'm not a big fan of the Sony Karajan series in general but the two DVD's with Kissin and Mutter are excellent.I too was a bit disappointed in not seeing the camera fixed on Kissin more often and for that reason deducted one star. Nevertheless, compared to many of Karajan's subpar Beethoven DVD's, this one is a real gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances!","review":"Von Karajan obviously enjoys conducting the Prokoviev, and it shows in the vivacity of the performance. Sometimes the pp passages are ppp, but all else is fine. The Tchaikovsky is an unusual performance, with much slower tempos and more deliberation during transitions (even pauses) than are generally found in this work. Probably played five minutes longer than Horowitz or Gilels would have required. The break between the 2nd and 3rd movements surprised me. The 17 year old pianist is excellent; he surely does like his deliberate, almost hesitant, tempos. Great clarity of finger attacks on keys, separation of notes. Remarkable, really. The camera could spend a bit more time on Kissin's hands and less on his and Herbert's faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgraceful Presentation Of A Good Serial","review":"Three major complaints:1.

The story fills in a lot of gaps and answers a lot of the questions I had about the first one (which at times could be confusing, but nonetheless brilliant) and provides a lot of insight into the lives of the characters.

At times, Suze Orman is yelling each word and it sounds as if each sentence ends in an exclamation mark. It's especially obvious since the tape/book is done in a question & answer style and the people asking the questions are speaking in a normal tone of voice. It's been a few years since I've read her other books, but this seems to be a repeat of previous information, just presented in a question & answer format. It also includes odd advice on personal matters, like dealing with divorce, death of a loved one, etc. I know these are related to financial situations, but I expect Suze Orman to give her opinion on the financial side of a situation, not the emotional side."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding Me","review":"After seeing Suze on PBS I decided to go out and get this book. About 40 pages into the work I came to the conclusion that this tome is more about marketing and salemanship than investing. There are a lot of naive people though that might buy this book thinking that it will help them, but nothing could be further from the truth.

This absurd advice is so trivial and in many cases not even accurate that unless you're a total money moron it won't show you anything you haven't heard or read elsewhere. Many women's web sites give far better advice that you can actually use. Suze is the queen of infomercials so why doesn't she offer a money back guarantee?

It does not provide a lot of new information, but this is true of 99% of financial advice (that is not pushing speculative and risky fads). The trick is to get people to follow through. Ms. Orman is good at this because she does not talk over her audience's heads. I don't know if Ms. Orman has a finance degree, but many financial advisors & investment bankers (if not most) don't have finance degrees. I know for a fact (with my finance background) that it is not required. What she does have is a great deal of practical and successful experience. This is what makes her effective in teaching AND convincing others to deal with their financial lives. Like any successful investment banker she is a good salesman and marketer. Save on the commissions and buy the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The least informative financial book I have encountered.","review":"(This was the unabridged audio cassette version). There were some very simple financial observations given in the book, but they were very basic. The client stories droned on and on. Also, the divorce proceedings last way too long.

The stories that Suze has to convey tell about her own success, but with stories like these there is often more than meets the eye. I wish I could recommend this book, but I can't and I felt like it was not worth my time and effort.

Money is about so much more than mere dollars, and that's what this book explains. (Maybe that's why some guy don't get it.) Also, regarding the earlier reviewer's negative comment, there's rarely a good excuse NOT to take a 15-year mortgage. Do the math -- it costs very little more every month (and costs tens and tens of thousand LESS over the life of the loan.) It's wonderful advice.

Like Suze's other books, this one patiently urges me to do what's obviously in my best interest and convincingly explains why I might find that hard to do.It offers very smart, imaginative solutions to common financial quandries (getting out of credit card debt, retirement planning, issues of marriage and divorce) and really motivates me to act on them. Favorite insight: Thoughts create words, words actions, actions habits, habit character, character destiny; so how we think about money is very important.

Understand what your debt means, instead of avoiding thinking about it. And look at the big picture. She has some sound advice for organizing your financial life, and takes you through the process of purchasing a home, and more.Since she's made most of the mistakes she warns about, Suze doesn't come off as totally snotty or superior, she's just going through some guidelines that make sense.

Ms. Orman candidly explained the reality how money and emotion are deeply connected and how it can affect our preception towards money and other people.Ms. Orman also includes some basic tips in investments, home buying, retirement and a bit on the tax side. This book gives me a jump start that I need to start thinking and managing my money better and encouragement to start doing my own research.Since this book is very basic, I would highly recommend this for those who has no clue of what to do with their money.

Their guitarist was so spectacular as well, her stage presence and handling of the guitar was something I'll not forget (I'd say a punk rock Bonnie Raitt just in the way the guitar seemed to extend from her body as another appendage). It's been too long, but I believe they didn't have any copies of their album on hand at the show (I got a shirt, road cone orange).

It was sad to hear of the passing of V. C. Andrews, but it is nice to know and I think she would be pleased of the work that is being published after her death. I know this was suppose to be a review on the book itself but you have to recognize the people behind the book that make it possible for her books to read by everyone. I do recommend you read her books and don't just read the ones that are mentioned in these reviews but take the time and read all of her books. Trust me, you won't be dissappointed. Thank you for the pleasure of reading her books even though she is no longer with us.

It is the first novel I ever read and it is probably the best book I've read. Now I am looking forward to reading the rest in the series. I was attached because there were new, exciting things happening right after another. I almost cried at the sad parts. It was so touching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Nothing too exciting about this book. Pretty predictable if you've ever read any other V.C. Andrews series. Also not a fan of 2nd cousins being in an intimate relationship. Boring read, but I'm the type of person who has to finish a book, even if it's painfully boring. Was glad to finally get to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"This book was alright. Not the best one in the series, but I think it still gave some insight about the lead character, Melody. The one thing that's always bothered me about V.C. Andrews is that I don't think she ever makes clear what time frame she's writing about. I can probably guess, but I know I won't be right. I assume Melody is set during the 70's or early 90's. I can only imagine that Laura is written during the late 50s or early 60s just because of how strict her bible wielding father is. Plus he was always adamant about praying before eating and reading the bible and who Laura could date. I don't think that kind of parenting is common these days, but I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough scares","review":"For a book this long, there isn't that much thrills. It's too much like a soap opera, and Grand. Olivia is way too boring. Even when Melody visits her real Grandmother in the mental clinic, there was no action!!! But if you want to learn more about the Logan family, then I would read this. Otherwise, skip to the third novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like I've never seen this before","review":"This is basically a Harlequin romance for teens.

I enjoyed several others from this series, as well as other books by Nancy Holder, and I love colonial American settings. Boy, was I disappointed.

I never felt that these two characters loved each other or could be happy together. And the ending came out of nowhere and was just totally bizarre and made very little sense.

The earth is now populated by 4-toed humans with rosewater for blood. These hive-dwellers live beneath the surface, which is dedicated to agriculture.

All four of the episodes are well done and fun to watch. They do not follow the Nancy Drew series very closely, but in effect do give the gist of several of the stories and each is done in a way that is very impressive. I enjoyed seeing what life must have been like in America in the 1930's when these movies were produced. Bonita Granville, looks like what I think Nancy may have looked, and Carson Drew also, but apart from that there are significant changes in the characters. George and Bess are not in the films at all. Ned Nickerson is Ted Nickerson in the films and his relationship with Nancy is based more on manipulation than on real affection as in the books. These are fun films and are worth getting for anyone who truly enjoys the Nancy Drew series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fashioned charm!","review":"I only came upon these old Nancy Drew films recently, and overall I think they are a lot of fun, especially watching them from an historical perspective. This is a very different Nancy than in the recent Emma Roberts film (which I loved) but except for being overly bubbly, more like the original character. This isn't great movie making, and the directing and acting aren't what we're used to, but that's part of the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old movies","review":"Bonita Granville is great in these old flicks.

It builds on their roots - more garage than surf-rock, paying tribute to Link Wray wih a cover of Run Chicken Run, while also redoing a few classics like Misty and Summer Wind.My favorite tracks on the album include Our Weapons are Useless, Shake Some Evil, Zombie Compromise, Theme from TV and, of course, Having an Average Weekend.

Shaw has managed to make a subject that could be less interesting and exciting, very interesting and exciting. I am impressed by the level of scientific evidence and thoughtful enquiry, and also historical detail. It all weaves together so dynamically and makes for very interesting reading It is almost like a detective novel. One wonders where is it going at first. And then it falls in place with very sharp logic. It is a fine piece of scholarship which includes much helpful information for people who want to learn more about the dangers in eating foods with trans fats.

That's when much of the laughter begins.Fine supporting cast, including a very grumpy James Coburn in one of his last screen performances, and Nichelle Nichols of TV's Star Trek, playing Cuba's adopted mom; still gorgeous beyond her years.

The movie is about a man that is transported to an enviroment completly different for the comfort that he enjoyed in Miami.

This is by far one of the worst I've seen. Sure, 9-year old boys and girls will love the slapstick humor, but parents will be wanting to pull their hair out if they have to listen to anymore of the predictable, unimaginative one-liners. I thought Cuba Gooding, Jr. was supposed to be this great, talented actor. So when the kids suggested we watch this film, I admit, I was looking forward to it. I expected some really touching scenes reminiscent of Remember the Titans or some truly hilarious moments like I saw in Cool Runnings. Instead, I was shocked to find overused jokes and no character development. Kids will love it, but parents, if you're looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy- forget about Snow Dogs.

The movie is not as funny as it was touted to be, nor do I find it a worthy film for children. There could have been more time devoted to the dog team since that was the focus of the movie. I was disappointed by the lack of morals portrayed in this movie. I expect better than that from Disney for a children's movie.This movie was advertised to be something that it is not.

The plot has a Miami dentist and dog hater (Cuba Gooding Jr) inheriting his late adoptive mothers sled dog team and moves to Alaska.

The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgements made on both sides.

Sit!","review":"Many others have detailed the awesome badness of this film, so I won't list all the numerous problems Michael Bay has brought to the screen, however, two things trouble me after watching this disaster last night.1. The same Japanese actors played the same roles in 1970's Tora! Tora! Tora! You'd think somebody'd promoted them by now. But maybe the Japanese Imperial Fleet is a slow-promoting organization.2. As a father, I can definately tell you that somebody with Kate Beckinsale's figure who has conceived in December would not be wearing a tight dress in April. Nor would she still be in the Navy in 1942.Armmegdon was so much fun. What happened here? I suppose messing with the future is easier than messing with the past.I blame Michael Bay. This movie is so bad for so long. A Director's cut? What did he leave out? Guadalcanal? Tarawa? Monte Casino? Why not show Hiroshima where we showed the world what happens when you disrupt our back nine on Sunday morning?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Movie!","review":"I absolutely loved Pearl Harbor! Everyone in this film did excellent, but I won't lie: I LOVE Josh Hartnett! I think it was his best performance in a movie yet. The friendship between Josh and Ben Affleck's characters really shows. I liked the romance in the movie and the action sequences. Normally, I really dislike war movies, but I definitely made an exception with Pearl Harbor. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen.-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average At Best","review":"Pearl Harbor is a movie unlike many others. Most films are fast and entertaining in the beginning and end, and slump in the middle. At the end of Pearl Harbor, I was bored. The best part of the movie occurs at about 90 minutes into this three hour monster. The attack on Pearl Harbor is absolutely thrilling and fast-paced. It will also bring out the patriotic soul in all of us. The attack lasts for 45 minutes and is the best part of the film. The problem with this movie is that the first 90 minutes and the last 45 minutes come no where near the excitement or involvement of the attack sequence. The love story is filled with cliches and it monopolizes most of the film. Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are fair, but Ben Affleck flounders. Rent this movie; do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Special Effects","review":"I thought this movie was excellent. Although it was much better on the big screen, I still enjoyed the video version. The actual historical timeline was acurately followed, and the actual attack itself was by far the best part of the film. I was happy to see that when the Arizona was hit, it was done correctly with the bomb penetrating the forward magazine instead of the myth of the bomb going down the smokestack. Perhaps the best part of the movie was the capsizing of the Oklahoma. I also enjoyed the Eagle Squadron scenes from England. I didn't care too much for the romance side of the movie, but it is excellent for history and special effects buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dang movie of 2001-2002!","review":"Don't listen to all the other people who are giving it bad reviews, as a HT hardcore person, extreme movie goer, I tellyou that you will be blown away by this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Michael Bay a break!","review":"This film has suffered to much bad mouthing.

But based on the promos for it I was so turned off by the INaccuracy, I refused to see it.In the promos, there's a woman hanging up her wash on an outdoor clothes line. With the Japanese buzzing past her, presumably on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor.The facts are the Japanese attacked at 6:00am.Now, you may say that it's possible for a woman to be doing laundry at 6am on a Sunday.But in the same promo, there's also a little boy playing baseball by himself on a little league field. Also with the Japanese buzzing by.Complete and utter HOGWASH. And an insult to my intelligence.Admittedly, since I haven't actually seen the movie, I could be taking these scenes out of context.

Fine. Buy MIDWAY instead. OK, the love bit is in there but if you are buying a movie for its commemorative value, remember this: a) the flying is real, b) the planes are real, c) the explosions are real and d) the result is real.The guys crashing in the sea do not dry off and go back to their trailers. Think. Reflect. Commemorate the real efforts of real people making real sacrifice. Oh, yeah and enjoy the love bit if you want that too.But it was those real people in the midst of the fight in the movie MIDWAY (and everyone else everywhere else all over the globe then and now) that made Hollwood a place free enough to generate 'Pearl Harbor'.

There's nothing wrong with that, provided you are a 12-year-old girl. But if you aren't, beware that the love story is improbable, if not ludicrous. And this thing is LONG with a capital L-O-N-G. Why they felt the need to include Dolittle's raid is beyond me. I guess so it didn't end on a downer. We know who won the war, you don't have to put it in the freakin' movie.Still, great action scenes. Too bad it is physically painful to watch up until that point.

It's got to be the most boring war movie I've ever seen. The director and writer were obviously trying to reproduce the success of \\"Titanic\\" in a different context but failed miserably. The actual Pearl Harbor invasion scenes are good, but you have to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for it.

Too much of a bad thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain offensive","review":"When I heard that another movie about Pearl Harbor was being made, I was excited. I was curious to see what kind of result we'd get from Jerry Bruckheimer. After waiting in line opening night for three hours, I watched in horror as a horrific American event was turned into a sappy love story. Instead of the movie focusing on the actual event, and the heroes of December 7th, we had to endure watching two idiots fight over a woman, and then the attack scene. I will admit, the attack scene was very dramatic and the special effects were wonderful. That is the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Tora! Tora! Tora! is the only movie about Pearl Harbor that I will acknowledge as a decent piece of filmmaking regarding this crucial event in American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh is HOT!!","review":"I dont know why everyone is saying that it is so bad cuz i thought that it was a really good movie! all i gotta say is josh hartnett is really hot!! and hes from minnesota like me! i thought it had enuf about that war that was basicly all that it was about so i dont know why people are saying that it had too much of the love story part and not enuf about the war... but it was a really sad movie too at first when ben dies... and then the end was the saddest part ever when josh dies!! but it was the best movie so i think that everyone should go out and see it or rent it if you havent see it yet... i dont know why you havent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over Substance","review":"This is a classic case where the movie looks better than it really is. This movie released purposely on Memorial Day Weekend 2001 had a thin story line other than the Pearl Harbor Attack. Kate Beckinsale is hardly a good actress and the movie just suffers from bad acting from everyone. The other problem with this film is it is too long. They could have m ade this a 1 and a half hour movie instead of 3 long hours. This movie shouldn't be on two discs because DVDs can hold 4 hours and the extras and the song to this movie are terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Great Movie on Two \\"Inconvenient\\" discs","review":"If you loved the movie on the big screen, you'll love the movie on DVD. The BIG problem is that the movie is split-up on TWO discs!You have to get up, about three-quarters through the movie, and change discs!!With 6 hours of space available on one disc, I'm amazed at this \\"Laser-Disc-esque\\" format. They made a great movie a SUB-PAR DVD experience. I would rather watch something else than have to get up and change discs in the middle of a movie. I would buy it again in two seconds if the movie was available on one DVD, with the bonus materials on a second disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Better Then The Original Theatrical Release","review":"This movie almost put me to sleep in the theatre. TOO, too mushc of a love story. Way too much! They could have cut an hour out of the movie and I would have enjoyed it so much more.It works better on the small screen. The attack itself is done very well. The story still lacks integrity, but the visuals are good.The best part about the DVD is the extra features. There is a great perspective video on PerlHarbor. Even the making of the movie documentary is much better than the movie itself overall.The best thing I can say is that the extras on the DVD are better than the Movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BETTER CUT & A GREAT DVD RELEASE!","review":"The Vista Series has released the biggest and greatest DVD package ever assembled with \\"Pearl Harbor- The Director's Cut.\\" The new 184 Minute cut is edited better. The attack sequence is more realistic and graphic, the reason for this cut's R-rating. And the four-disc set features hours of behind-the-scenes footage, two documentaries on the real attack and the Doolittle Raid, and commentary tracks from Michael Bay and Janine Basinger; Jerry Brucheimer, Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Alec Baldwin; The Director of Photography, Costume Designer, Visual Effects Supervisor and Composer. A great addition to the DVD collection. And if you think this is good, then get ready for the November release of \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring- The Director's Edition\\" four-disc set! Movie Grade: A+; DVD Grade: A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"The cinematography was beautiful and the sets were beautiful, catching the time period perfectly. What a pity that they had to be wasted on this pitiful excuse of a movie!Much like \\"Titanic\\" which preceded it (for which the above paragraph could apply in its entirety), \\"Pearl Harbor\\", rather than being a great movie about a historic tragic event, offended the viewer by using the event merely as a backdrop for a \\"chick flick\\" plot...and a very POOR one at that.I truly looked forward to this movie, believing the writers and producers would show this event the respect it deserved. So sad that the remaining WWII vets get THIS as a \\"tribute\\". What an insult!

We could barely get through it. We watched the first hour and turned it off. It was that bad. I was opened minded about it. Gave it an hour of a chance. The movie is like a soap opera. Bad all the way around. I guess some people might like it. I thought the writing was terrible. Makes you wince. The pace was slow and you don't care about the characters. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet Titanic's little brother!","review":"Okay, I'll admit that the Special-FX and the acting was pretty good. However, the ghetto love story isn't neccesary! It's been done already in \\"Titanic\\", which is another Hollywood failure! Plus, the attack couldn't have looked anything like this!(\\"TORA! TORA! TORA!\\" had a MORE realistic look). I was sooooo disapointed when I first saw this. They've made TOO many of these P.H. films already. Try something new for crying out loud!!!

I was thoroughly disappointed. Kudos to those who wrote this movie for disgracing an important period in history by making this movie into a tawdry romance. I was expecting a movie about the WAR, not a twisted love story with a [bad] ending. Most of the people in my school who were raving about it cared nothing about the history; they only saw it because they had a thing for either Ben Affleck or Josh Hartnett. If you want to see a real movie, get \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Bomb!","review":"I saw this lame movie last night and was blown away by how weak it was. The lines were so trite that I actually felt embarrassed for everyone who was involved in this film. It was so \\"Hollywood\\". There was never a moment in the movie when I was not acutely aware of the fact that it was an over-inflated production. In other words, I never lost myself in the story. Also, I thought the attack scenes were awful. I mean, jeeze, whenever a plane was fired upon, the cockpit always exploded. The cockpit!? That would not happen. The fuel tanks are in the wings, not the cockpit. How stupid!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick flick? Don't think so!","review":"People say that Peral Harbor is a chick flick, but how? It is a real life situation with real drama. I mean I am a girl but how would you feel if you were bombed?! It is a romantic story with action and great special effects. I think you should buy this DVD because it is the best movie ever! Although I said this wasn't a chick flick you still might want to buy a box of kleenex."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Not So Good Movie in a Bad DVD Presentation","review":"First of all, this movie does not have a good storyline nor script. I have a feeling that the main characters were ripped off from some other story. And personally I think Josh Hartnett is the only one doing a decent job while the rests fall below standard.Secondly, the DVD presentation is extremely disappointing. The only reason I choose to buy DVDs is to get the whole movie uninterrupted. Of course I prefer DVDs with lots of extra features. However, I feel that just because there are not enough extra features to fill up the second disc, the studio actually divided the movie into 2 parts!This movie is only 3-hour-long, the same as \\"Meet Joe Black\\" and \\"Braveheart\\", so I don't see any reason why the studio needs to split it into 2 discs. I must say that I'm extremely disappointed with this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a good thought.","review":"Unfortunately I believe this movie tried to cash in on the success of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". Unfortunately it failed. As in SPR, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" used actual events but the story line did not concentrate on the events before and after the attack. Rather it chose a weak love story theme that ruined the film. Yes the attack scene was dramatic with some artistic license taken but it was still good.I think that this tried to be a cross of \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\". My advice would be to get these if you want a love story and a war story.Watch \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and take it for what it is, a movie, and not a pseudo-historical account."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"Are there any clichés left which this film didn't make use of? In fact, in time it may be considered to be \`clicking over' to be so bad it's entertaining. But I won't give it any stars for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Harbor - 2 hours too long","review":"I bought this DVD from Amazon 2 years ago and finally watched it yesterday.As a WW2 buff who grew up in England, I enjoy most movies about this era, however this one was mediocre at best.The RC airplanes getting their wings blown off in every dogfight, crashing into towers and still being decipherable, weird 10 minutes with the English battles, 10 minutes at the end for the Doolittle raid, ridiculous love triangle, was not what I had hoped for.The actual main battle scene was good, but there were way too many pretty people in this movie to make it real.And there was plenty of fiction in this one. Let's not use this content for any history books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried and tested money making formula","review":"The same old Hollywood 'blockbuster' flag waving tripe, guaranteed to make huge money appealing to an ignorant US public. If you have a 70+ IQ or want a proper film rather than a love story acted by wooden puppets, save yourself two and a half hours and dont bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is absolutely AWFUL. There was not a SINGLE redeeming quality about this film. Normally, if there's a few good explosions or a battle scene, then it usually can save a movie from the trashheap. It is THAT BAD when I can honestly say that the action did NOTHING to save this film.Torture. If you are sado masochistic then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I absolutely hated this movie. This movie is an absolute disgrace and a disservice to all the people who died on that tragic day. The biggest complaint I have about this sick mess is that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay have taken a serious and somber subject like Pearl Harbor and thrown in a silly love triangle involving hearthrobs Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale to appeal to the MTV crowd which of course is a huge market for the movie industry. That's what I dislike about Bruckheimar and Bay namely how they make big, lavish, loud, dumb-downed movies just so they can appeal to mainstream audiences. Bruckheimer and Bay are the Britney Spears of filmaking. Why am not I talking about the movie? Because there's nothing about the movie that's worth mentioning!! Don't waste your time. If you want to see a good chick flick then see A Walk To Remember or if you want a good war movie then watch Tora Tora Tora."},{"rating":"1","title":"See this is why we should be able to go to negitive stars!","review":"It dosn't matter what they do with this movie. Unless they burn all of them it will still be the worst historical play on a US tradgity ever made. People who like this hours and hours of tripe really need to think about they're lives. You can't be to intellegent if this cast seems to good, or fair or the story is realistic to you. This is one of the worst movies I had to sit through. This movie drags, the story is false and could be more fake(the pathetic love story) and the lousy acting all make this a terrible movie. My one star dosn't even account the this takes three and half hours of your life. I would give this negitive five stars! And counting the two days worth of additional footage it should be banned! The cast should never work again for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"This ranks among the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Visually appealing, yes. But the story, the acting, the flow of the movie - just terrible. It was so bad, my wife and I actually contemplated not watching the 2nd disc - even though that's the half that has the attack, which I knew would be cool to watch; and yet - I had no desire to waste more time watching this film. The joke now is that if someone tells us they liked this movie, we know that we cannot rely on any opinion they might give on another movie.Yes, it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie isn't just action scenes","review":"The Pearl Harbor attack is indeed spectacular (although a bit long) : good special effects, dynamic...But except for this 15-20 min scene, the movie is quite boring. The love story is just dumb and so predictable : young cute pilots, beautifull nurse, you add a 20 years friendship and a war, and you have the picture. After 5 min. you know how it is going to end (and I'm not talking about the attack)It is just another so-called \\"entertaining\\" movie (and it's not a compliment) except this one is lame. Famous actors and special effects don't make a movie even if it is supposed to be a patriotic one; you need a story, and this one is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst...","review":"The action scenes are quite good but that doesn't make a film. The scipt is terrible. Probably the most stereotypical plot possible for a war film, a woman loosing a man to war. I've seen that many times. Pearl Harbor has 2 hours of pathetic unoriginal footage. The only parts i cant complain much about are the action sequences because well, they came close to depicting war. However I thought Disney's desicion to not allow the film to be rated R was rediculous. It didn't make it seem as terrible as it was. Almost a lack of respect towards those who were at pearl harbor.If they weren't about to change the script so that the actual story [not the events of pearl harbor] were something new, the least stupid braukheimer could have done was shorten the thing to torture movie goers a little less. Thanks a lot...jerk....I can only hope he doesn't ruin BlackHawk Down, ridley scott beauty, the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The movie itself is alright, but Ben Affleck isn't an actor at all. He ruined the whole movie. Josh Hartnet was excelent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to \\"Tora Tora Tora\\"","review":"I was hoping for a lot from this film, but I was disappointed.The effects were Ok, but using modern vessels as \\"stand ins\\" for some scenes did not look quite right.The entire last third of the film had nothing to do with the Japanese attack, instead it concentrated on the Doolittle raid.I feel that this was a pointless exercise, as it did not advance the plot, or tell anything about Pearl harbour. I think that the Doolittle raid deserves a film in its own right, it is a classic story of WW2.The film should also have concentrated on the real human drama of what happened on dec 4 1941, using actual historical characters, the USN, USMC, USAAF and US army produced many real heroes on that day.Making a film about their exploits would have been a far better tribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the longest day had better special effects","review":"Alright, I really like movies. But if you're used to quality products, this is not a movie you're after. ... First of all, it takes ages before the actual attack starts. And what about Benn Affleck saying he was in occupied France? After a few months he returns home. It's no secret Americans know nothing about Western history, but this really is not acceptable.Special effects. Alright, you expect a quality attack, a big overwiew of the Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, instead what you get is a camera who individually follows every aircraft one by one, then the bomb as it's flying through the air, an explosion where you can search for blood. Search thoroughly though 'cause it's like watching the A Team. Even the sound effects are nothing. And then the awful love story, but how come a film like Enemy at the Gates can pull it off to put a lovestory into a war movie? Simple, don't use Michael Bay for such a project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Harbor.","review":"This just in.....Michael Bay could not direct traffic,more a less a \\"historical epic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Directors cut?","review":"we don't need a stinking directors cut!

I am deeply disappointed that the youth of this time would be subjected to so much misinformation. The only plausable fact in the movie is that Pearl Harbor happened. Even the special effects are phoney. My, my , all those gas engine prop airplanes moved about the screen as it they were jet aircraft of today. The only believable special effects were the scenes that were \\"borrowed\\" form earlier movies about Pearl. There are too many distortions to itemize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made.","review":"This movie is one of the worst movie's i've ever seen.The script,acting,plot is terrible.Michael Bay can't direct and he needs to get out of the movie industry.Don't watch this movie ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic was better.","review":"This movie was very bad and it looks like its been made only for the money.The reason why James Cameron made Titanic is because he just wanted to make a good movie and not for the money.This movie had good effects but the script is bad.Don't see this movie and just go see Titanic instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring melodrama with occasional special effects","review":"As soon as the film opened with Soap Opera style melo-drama (which is never addressed in the remainder of the film) I knew this was going to be a tough one. The action sequences were brilliantly done, the story completely predictable and contrived. All of this could also be said about Titanic. However Titanic works because it embaces its sappy melo-dramatic nature. Pearl Harbor doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gospel truth, guv","review":"The first half hour of this film is written as almost slapstick comedy. Now why couldn't 'Saving Private Ryan' treat the war in the innocent way it was meant? We also learn that the poor put upon Japanese were victimised by the USA with an oil blockade. Now why would they go and do a darn fool thing like that? No doubt the gospel according to Jerry would explain Nanking over their failure to lend the imperial army a cup of sugar. Alec Baldwin runs away with the cornball dialogue like there's no tomorrow and seeing as the atomic age was just dawning we can't fault him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to veterans.","review":"This cartoonish 'film' was even edited in foreign markets, to increase sales.

I think he's rolling in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"If you're looking for a great war epic like Saving Private Ryan you'll be greatly disappointed. The interaction between the main characters are shallow and it seems like an hour action movie with 2 hours of thin plots and poor scripts to fill it out. The love plot between the 3 characters are very corny and detracts from an otherwise okay action flick. I must admit the CG effects are very good and the action scenes are great but even with the action it seems to run out of steam towards the end with the raid of Japan scene. It seems very rushed and there's no sense of climax at all. Audio wise it's very average, no big gun sounds but instead sounds very tinny. Actually, the whole movie sounds very tinny besides the explosions which makes decent use of your subwoofer. If you're a die-hard war film fan and you've seen Saving Private Ryan there's little you'll appreciate in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Harbor - the ultimate chick flick","review":"3 words can describe this movie: Titanic in khakis. The first 30 minutes or so of this movie will drive all testosterone from the room you're in. This is, without a doubt, a movie destined to be shown on Lifetime or Oxygen cable channels. Let there be no mistake who the target audience was: young teenage girls.The special effects in the attack scene were amazing, but the story was a blatant rip-off of Titanic and Top Gun (even down to the pilots buzzing the air control towers and having a character named \\"Goose\\"). Overall, this movie didn't come close to all the hype around its release. I was thoroughly disappointed when the movie was over. Save yourself some time; the 30-minute attack scene is the only part worth watching.

Ben Affleck sold me on the idea that he was a 'hot-shot' pilot (sort of like the Tom Cruise character in 'Top Gun', also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer). The British Beckinsale pulled off being an American girl very well. The special effects used in the re-creation of the December 7 attack were breathtakingly realistic.The love stories do lack some spark, but they're by no means bad. The historical tale will be compelling to young people just learning about WWII. The bonus documentaries are top shelf.

The reasons it is awful have already been covered in detail by many reviewers, and suffice it to say that a third-grader with only a single \\"60th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor\\" magazine article could have written a script that was more factually accurate and--yes--more entertaining. Not even Shakespeare could fashion a tragedy as awful, complex, and heart-rendering as the actual story of Pearl Harbor. Apparently Michael Bay et al., suffering delusions of grandeur, decided that they could improve the story...this travesty of a film is the result.

What the viewer receives is a drawn out, Titanic-esque, melodramatic romance, with a 'smidgin' of battle to draw attention. While the battle scenes are impressive, they don't make up for the other two hours of clichéd writing.World War II can be a touchy subject for artists to work with. While I know that romance abounded during that time (how could it not, with soldiers leaving home and loved ones?), this movie SHOULD have focused more strongly on the battle...or else have the show renamed.If you want a *good* World War II movie, try \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", or best yet, HBO's \\"Band of Brothers\\".If you want bad romance and melodrama, try Titanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult","review":"The movie billed itself as a historical recreation of this major event in U.S. history.

I even saw a row of old men around their 60's watching...crying actually during the raid scenes. I wasn't sure how to react but that made it memorable for me. The movie made my summer, I won't even bore you with the details because if you haven't seen it and you're planning to buy the DVD,(preferably the one coming out this January 2002) Go ahead and pay-away, it's worth adding to your collection.

You can tell that the worked very hard on the movie and it has wonderfully choragraphed computer graphics that really makes you feel like you are there most of the time. I warn you that even though it is based on the bombbing of Pearl Harbor more than Titanic was based on the ship, the love story is a big part of the movie. It is a beautiful love story but some aren't into that. All in all, it was a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I was interested to read other reviews of this movie as I found it the most disappointing movie I saw this year. The love story (stories?) did nothing to endear the main characters to you (if you could even believe that such events transpired) and the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was, sadly, only a small slice of the film. The action scenes were well constructed but it wasn't enough to save this movie.Also - I don't really think personal attacks on someone who writes a review is necessary. There is room for everyone's opinion on this page, & no one logs in to read your opinion on another reviewer, just on the movie, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great Cast!","review":"What made this movie even better was the superb casting. Of course everyone knows the setting and plot, but the \\"story within the story\\" is very engrossing. It's hard to mix romance and action without one or the other suffering, but here the director did a superb job.The attack sequence at Pearl Harbor was done extremely well and with great attention to detail. You will see camera stunts that are incredible! One of the best parts of the movie is the portrayal of FDR by Jon Voight, and Jimmy Doolittle by Alec Baldwin.The only problem with the movie is that I would have liked to see the dynamic between the main protagonists played out a little more, especially at the end. Otherwise, quite entertaining and well worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one","review":"This film must rank amongst the very worst high budget films of all times. And even with a 200 million dollar budget they were unable to recreate 1940s warships. Ever wondered why they show the Japanese carrier battle group only for about one second at a time? Because it's a modern U.S. carrier. All the ships in Pearl Harbor (during the overflight scene) are clearly modern, and even for the explosions they used only scarcely camouflaged Spruance class destroyers from the 1970 and Knox class frigates from the 1960s.Combine these horrible and unforgivable anachronisms with ridicolously bad acting, a totally unbelievable and inaccurate story, and so many slow motion shots that it makes you sick and you get a cinematic disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bora!

I found some of the lines laughable and without a true understanding of the time and the people who lived it. Hollywood has repeatedly treated the viewing public with contempt. They believe that if you give the public alot of eye candy (Millions of dollars worth of CGI and good-looking acting hacks), the substance and quality of the script is irrelevant. That's like building a designer home with a foundation made of balsa wood. Such a moment in our history should have been treated with more respect and greater attention to detail. If Disney had done that, instead of trying to cash in on a Titanic-esque story, they would have made alot more money (which is all that they are really interested in)."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of an Act... from Team America: World Police","review":"I miss you more than that movie missed the pointand that's a lot girl.

I just hope that the special R-rated director's cut can make this movie more enjoyable, because this movie made me fall asleep several times. I actually fell asleep eating my popcorn. Mike Bay should stick to making intense action thrillers, not sappy love stories, especially ones that are true stories, that never had romance.

I thought it was supposed to be about Pearl Harbor and the men who died and survived, not about some soap opera where the best friend takes the girl then dies. This truly does degrade the survivors of that fateful day. I will admit, I gave it 2 stars because the Doolittle raid had its moments-until the end: \\"Don't die! You can't die, because your gonna be the daddy of my girlfriend's baby!\\" It seems more like a soap opera than a tribute, and although it has some parts to it, your better off seeing Tora! Tora!

It seemed like it dragged on forever and ever. I don't do the long synopsis of movies but I will say this. The story was supposed to revolve around these characters during the attack on Pearl Harbor. That much they got. But I didn't care about the characters, the development really stunk. I found myself rooting for the Japanese pilots, a la MST3K. Drivel doesn't even begin to cover it. The costuming was done well, and the props in the sets well selected, but that's about the only good thing I can say for this movie. Watch it once.

Special effects don't make the movie!","review":"Face it, technical effects and historical significance can't make a good movie without a script, actors and a director with vision.The only reason I can think of to watch this awful retelling of the story of Pearl Harbor is to make one realize how far writers/directors/producers can get from being able to bring a good story to the screen. The dialog is more wooden than the acting, the characters are stereotyped, the history is questionable, the emtional situations are contrived. Tora! Tora! Tora! is a far better telling of the history, and From Here to Eternity is a much better love story. I wonder how this would have come out if it was directed by Steven Spielberg and starred Tom Hanks. Oh, yeah. They made that move and called it Saving Private Ryan.

What is arguably the turning point of the 20th century is used only as a backdrop for a cheesy, formulaic love story. The acting is poor, the script is poorer, and the director wants us to forgive these because of the great visuals. Sorry, Jimmy, but making Hawaii look good isn't exactly a feat of magic.Oh, and for all of the liberal left out there, Cuba Gooding Jr. is tossed in for a multicultural, look-at-the-black-man moment.

It deserves far more than a big-screen soap opera that is an insult to the memory of those who died at Pearl Harbor.Add to that the fact that the producers, in order to pocket the largest profits possible, made a \\"Japanese-friendly\\" version for release in Japan and you have one of the most irresponsible movies ever made.

In fact the only people I felt any sympathy for were the Japanese for wanting to drop lots of high explosive on them.The action sequence, whilst impressive in terms of pure effects, was too confusing to leave any sense of emotion - I felt neither angry, nor sad, nor anything really, except wondering what the hell was going on. And the post-attack part of the film is instantly forgettable.\\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" was so much better in every way.

The film dishonors the men who fought and died at Pearl. There appears to be no overall theme, the characters are cardboard, the plot is shallow, Pearl Harbor has practically been thrown in just so that the directors had something to blow up, and historical accuracy totally flunks out.

Josh Hartnett acts out the best pal to Ben's character and the best more-than-boyfriend guy to Kate's character.\\" I think that you should give the guy some credit since it was his first big-time movie. I mean, who, in their first big movie, would want to die? I mean, why can't the unbelieving \\"Rafe\\" pass away?

Maybe their overdoing of everything was to appeal to a younger generation of movie-goers, but this epic is executed like an over-budgeted music video. Why oh why didn't Jerry Bruckheimer make this movie like Black Hawk Down (which had some of the same actors and a similar 'military tragedy' plotline). However, two stars are deserved SOLELY for the hospital scene, which I thought was excellent, yet it was only a small fraction of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is one of the worst movies of 2001.

The movies makes a couple of farm boys look like Demi-Gods against Japanese pilots who have been in combat for almost a decade. Not only that, Afflect never did tell his Beckinsdale how he survived after being shot down in France all those months. He says he'll tell her later but he never does. One of the many loose ends that is conveniently forgotten. There doesn't seem to be a overall moral like all war movies before except Americans are great and big explosions.Love story may have worked if they didn't throw the third wheel in but alas what could have been. Tora, Tora, Tora is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than this movie and that was made in 1970. If only Tora, Tora, Tora was made with the kind of budget and special effects nowadays.

The attack on Pearl Harbor is in the movie but only after 2 hours of a love story that doesn't get shown in the ads.This movie was made for little girls who want a Titanic romance type story. Titanic was not a bad movie, but the things that made Titanic a decent movie are not in this movie.This movie is way to long, not really focused on Pearl Harbor, and not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Michael, learn some history!","review":"Sure the effects are cool, sure the actions are great... and sure some people watch for the romance, but I really hate it when directors do a real poor job on details and accuracy of past events. First off the date was wrong in respect to the Japanese calender, the chronological order of some events were wrong, popularity of certain warhead and machinery were wrong... I can continue for hours about how terrible this movie can get. You wanna see romance? Go see \\"Thomas Crown Affiar.\\" You wanna see a war flick? Go see \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Just don't watch this movie, it's simply not good enough (any way you look at it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Love Story, The \\"War\\" Is just a backdrop.","review":"Being somewhat of a Ben Affleck fan, mostly just of his Kevin Smith movies, I went to see this movie, thinking it will be a fantastic war drama. And lets just say this, in my 30 years on this planet, this was the only movie I ever walked out on. It is boring, sappy, insipid, mushy, and lost all aspects of the little war that happened to be going on. If you want a real war movie, rent Saving Private Ryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING","review":"This is nothing, just another Bruckenheimer commercial attempt to blockbuster, copying avery cliche imaginable. It has the greates actual wooden actor, Ben Affleck. It has a stupid and unconvincing love triangle the leads nowhere.

Really bad acting, very BORING story, throw in Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heavy handed overwrought special effects and direction and what you get one hell of a flashy movie with incredbly DUMB story lines and even worse acting. Except for the fact the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor there is very little in this movie that is realistic. Even the Dootitle raid seems phoney. A very fat Alec Baldwin was terrible as Jimmy Dootitle, the special effects are so ridiculous that they are laughable and make the story seem like some sort of fantasy sci-fi, and that Love triangle PLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEAAAASSSSSEEE!!!!!!!!

Move along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The attack and battle scenes in this movie were very good. But other than that it had little to offer. The sub-plot of the love story was weak and predictable. I was dissappointed in the movie as a whole. I felt that there was a lot of promise to this movie that for some reason was not fulfilled.It seems as though some people really liked this movie but that was not my opinion. My advice, I would view it first and decide before buying. A mistake I made was to buy before viewing based on information I had heard from friends. I was sorry I did not rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ppppplllllleeeeaaassee","review":"When I saw it at the theater with a group of other middle aged friends, I enjoyed it; but watching it again alone in my living room, I felt like, why bother?? Being with my friends the first time gave me the opportunity to voyeour their watching it.While some of the characters and events in the film are true, the love story aspect was just too sappy. Give me a break. Danny dies and Raf gets the girl, the baby and the happily ever after.The love story really distracted from the story line. Special effects were good, though, as well as the music. I bought the soundtrack hoping to relive some of the 40s magic, but it was mostly orchestral with just that one song by Faith Hill. I had to find another CD with classic 40s music to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two possible reactions to this movie:","review":"You can laugh at the incompetent, unimaginative, boring, and historically inaccurate storytelling; or you can cry at the fact that many young people today get most of their \\"knowledge\\" of history from garbage like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Slobber.","review":"People like sombraff just don't get it.Anyone who makes light of the significants of Pearl Harbor has no heart.The scary thing is these people who drive on the road.Ooooooh,scary thought.The film was totally shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"My mouth was open for the entire movie.......","review":"My mouth was open for the entire movie.....it was that bad.This movie is a total disaster.Nuff said.Apparently I need four lines for this review,but I can't say any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good.","review":"Mistitled as being about a battle that takes place about halfway through the film,there is so much in this film that is fictional or mistaken that this film is barely worth of being represented as\\"The film about Pearl Harbor.Some of the supporting characters are based upon true historical people,and their stones are also the most interesting.I would have to seen anyone,of their parts larger,rather than what this film is obsessed with...a patiently false romantic triangle brimming with platitudes and corny dialogue.The worst part of this movie is the first half,which contrates far more on establishing the three fictional characters.After Titanic became a success the studio found a way to make money.The 40 mins of action are great,but everything else is just not good.Just don't see this movie for anything in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly in shock.","review":"I canno't believe someone actually wrote this movie.This is the worst film i've ever seen.Stupidly obounds.You can bet ill bet getting my money back from Blockbuster.My 5 year old sister could write better romance lines.The movie should not have been called\\"Pearl Harbor.The part that didn't really happen\\"I mean,wow,to think that the only reason Pearl Harbor happened was because of 2 nurses friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie Of All Time","review":"This was one of the best movies i have ever seen.

It's worth the rent or purchase!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Extremely Bad Love Movie","review":"This Movie Was absolutely terible. The basic point of the movie was the same as Titanic. The makers were hoping to make the same billion dollars that the Titanic made World Wide. The love story is that the main character has a girlfriend and than supposibly gets shot down. While he is away his girlfriend gets pregnent to his best friend. Then he shows up alive and hates his best friend till the end of the movie were his best friend gets shot to death.

I thought the movie did a great job..and everything was tied together nicely at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"This movie is NOT about Pearl Harbor. It's more about a sappy soapy predictable love story that happens to take place at Pearl. It is filled with historical inaccuracy. Just horrible. The only thing that was accurate was that Pearl Harbor is a US naval base that was attacked by the Japanese. Hell, I've heard some of the survivors of the true event trash this movie.You don't need to make up a sappy love story to talk about Pearl Harbor. There was more than enough drama in the real event.To any history teachers that may be thinking of showing this to their class....please don't! This is NOT history. I recommend showing then Tora, Tora, Tora instead.

This movie is an incredible trivialization of such an important historical event.It is also a fictional version. Doris Miller's actions were heroic, but he did not shoot down any Japanese planes. The pilots on whom the characters played by Ben \\"Aflac\\" and the other actor whose name escapes me were based did not down three Japanese planes by playing chicken with them. The attacking Japanese planes did not zip in and out and around ships and buildings like Star Wars TIE fighters.But why am I even bothering to go into this much detail? The movie is horrible.

What a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a history film...","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, as judging from the trailer, it was a fantastic looking movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie turns out to be less about the attack and the war, and more about a love triangle between the three lead characters. The scenes of the Japanese attack are truly fantastic, but apart from those visuals this movie is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you give a film fewer than 1 star?","review":"It's a pity really, that any film with the vast resources and talent that Pearl Harbor had should fail so spectacularly. With the possible exception of the writer(s?) and director, the forces arrayed in making this film could have put together a true cinema classic. Instead they turned it into a cocktail joke.This is doubly sad, of course, because the historical events depcited here have so many natural and compelling stories (even fictions) that could and should be told. I'm tempted to call this film an insult to those who served and/or died that day. But that's not really fair. The intentions here were good, the execution was lazy and sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Dreadful","review":"Some superb SFX notwithstanding this is an thoroughly awful film.

The characters don't develop through the movie and it leaves out why December 7, 1941 was important. And the DVD is a bit expensive given all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, corny, awful. (Good explosions, tho)","review":"This is an icky, overblown, overacted travesty. Some corny movies are good; this isn't one of them. I thought it was dreadful.

Still, what a cheap way to evoke painful memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON ALL OF YOU!!!","review":"This movie is an absolute disgrace. Most will not understand my comments about this movie, but that would be due to a lack of knowledge on their part. It made me so sad for the Veterans of Pearl Harbor, because they had to witness the ignorance of the individuals who said this was a good film. I am disgusted by the Director, and every actor who participated in this travesty.Shame on those who had something to do with this film. Men died at Pearl Harbor. For some one to take an event as sobering as this, and turn it into a joke, such as this movie, is sickening. But, those who took part in this film sure got paid. Blood money!! Shame on all of you, and shame on who ever purchases this movie. You should be thrown out of America!!Go ask a WWII Vet and ask him what he thinks.

It is a shame what this country is coming to."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 2 disc movies","review":"This movie was placed on two different discs. That is unacceptable. The movie can go on one while the supplemental can go on other. Do not purchase this movie until it comes out on just one disc. A DVD can hold the entire movie if they didn't try to cram in so many different features on disc.

I'll just say this; whenever the girl in this movie falls in love with a guy...that guy dies. If she's lucky he comes back to life. Her only problem is she's already in love with her dead lover's best friend. This would be a good movie if the story wasn't SUPPOSED to be about Pearl Harbor.

I felt no connection with any of the characters. In fact, this film failed miserably to get any sort of emotional reaction out of me besides boredom and annoyance.

Even the battle scenes didn't bring any emotion to me. (Not to mention the utter lack of blood and body parts, which made the Pearl Harbor attack scene seem very unrealistic. My friend and I blamed this on the MPAA). The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because my friend and I fast forwarded through over an hour of the movie to get to the war parts.Now that I think of it, I will give this movie only one star because of all the fast forwarding we had to do to see anything of interest in this movie.The only reason I decided to rent this movie was to see what everyone was raving about.

True that the attack sequences are quite good (though they should have relied more on the ILM effects instead of using some very modern-looking mothballed Navy ships as props), but by intertwining a predictable, sappy love-triangle, the action is seriously blunted.The film is tortuously long, largely due to the \\"human interest\\"element that is neither interesting nor very believably human. Could the writers not have come up with something that's just a bit less of a cliche than a love triangle? Of course, moviegoers who long for mental, as well as edible popcorn, will no doubt \\"eat it up\\".I'm reminded of Shakespeare: \\"...a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, blech, blah, zzzzzzzz","review":"I actually really looked forward to seeing this film but WOW, there is no other way of describing this film as anything but a horrible mess.

The sheer stupidity of the fictional love story is bad enough, but even a cursory glance at the actual historical events shows how deeply this film has been dumbed-down for (...) audiences addicted to special effects. The CGI effects in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" are intensely obvious, looking like nothing more than animated paintings.

BRAVE JAPANESE PILOTS !!!","review":"Apart from excellent scenes of the Japanese attack on drunk American pilots and sailors, this film is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this because I saw the aircraft used in the movie being wrapped up to be sent to Hawaii. The only thing true in this movie is that the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor. While the graphics were fair, I still can't understand how the director can think the viewer is that stupid as to think a Japanese pilot would fly between hangers during the Pearl attack AND they would be shot at by airplanes and ships shooting down, into the Americans that were on the other side of the airplane.Plus, the \\"heros\\" of the story end up crash-landing together after the Doolittle raid. Yes this is a chick-flick for those who have no idea of history or reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?...","review":"Why does Hollywood have to make a three hour movie about a terrible day in US history and turn it into 'As The World Turns'? I could not believe that I sat through this piece of junk. It was 2 1/2 hours of 'General Hospital' and 1/2 hour of reality. It's a shame that Hollywood feels that 99% of the films that come out today must contain some kind of soap opera setting to satisfy what they think the lady folks wish to see. I find that to be rather insulting to women and I am not a female. There is nothing romantic about December 7,1941. It gets 1 star for the actual attack sequence. I must mention that I highly doubt that while they flew over head, the Japanese pilots were signaling to the American children to take cover. Silliness. If you wish to see a great film on Pearl Harbor, seek out 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' and let this one rot."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Enemy' denied humanity and believability","review":"In addition to the historical military inaccuracies which have already been mentioned in detail on these pages, I would add the unfortunate stereotyping of Japan's military leaders as a major negative. Indeed, we are at a time in history where such silly cardboard cut-outs are no longer necessary - if they ever were - in trying to portray the psychological truths that plunged the U.S. and Japan into war with each other.The director was apparently lazy or just stupid. The idiotic rendering of Japanese and things Japanese in this movie dismisses it from serious consideration as a thing of value or merit.It's trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"can your hear the foghorn: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!","review":"Hollywood's worst formula ever: Take one of America's darkest moments, add a sappy love story between a nurse and two no talent, flava of the month, babyfaces add some forgettable special effects and you get this piece of dribble.I saw it in the theater and after 1 hour coudln't wait for it to end. The love story killed the whole thing. I don't know why Ben Affleck is so popular. Since \\" Good Will Hunting\\" he has not made one single decent movie.

Tora! instead. Though the actual attack sequence is very well done, the rest of the movie would have been better left on the cutting room floor. The performances of all the main characters, especially those of Josh Harnett & Kate Beckensdale in the contrived, pathetic love story angle just blew all my interest out of the water. It's almost like Bay and the gang didn't know what story they wanted to tell - a straight up war story would've been the best route with the capability of the special FX at hand. But no....they tried to serve all crowds and all tastes. They failed horribly - we didn't want a \\"chick\\" flick, we wanted a story of valor and heroism. Give Tora! Tora!

Fine.But then what's a little boy doing playing baseball by himself at that hour?Complete and utter HOGWASH.And if those promo scenes happened prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, wouldn't civilians seeing Japanese airplanes(not to mention the Military) slightly minimize the element of a surprise attack?"},{"rating":"2","title":"PEARL HARBOR GOT BOMBED AGAIN!THIS TIME BY AMERICANS","review":"I found something amazing about this movie, not the movie itself but the reviews of the movie.

It is without question the WORST I've ever seen from a technical standpoint. Their technical advisers should be ashamed to cash their checks.

SO many shots of ships that weren't even BUILT until long after WWII. AND even worse, all those shots of ships with NO HULL numbers. DUH! No hull numbers means NOT COMMISSIONED!Well, if you want to see a film about Pearl Harbor, SKIP this joke! IT is a fictional love story that insults anyone interested in history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top fluff!","review":"Pearl Harbour is a big budget special effects offering from you guessed it Jerry Bruckheimer responsible for such over the top Hollywood films as Armageddon. Micheal Bay director of Bad Boys and The Rock helms this box office terror of a film. Starring one of the worst actors of all time Ben Affleck, the film starts well but ends up in cornville.What could be a powerful movie after the tragic events that took place in Pearl Harbour about sixty years ago is just an excuse to spend money on high quality effects. Pearl Harbour is a no brainer.

The movie is filled with corny tearjerkers and portrays little of the actual historical value of Pearl Harbor. Ben Affleck gives one of his worse performances as a man, who, if this movie had any basis in reality would have died in aplane crash. His monotone, undeveloped charecter does little to boost the already pitiful movie. The only reason I gave this movie one star is because of Josh Hartnet, who is not only gorgeous, but also a blossoming actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was it called Pearl Harbor?","review":"This wasn't about Pearl Harbor, this was about how to tell another stupid love story with half-assed actors appearing to be bigger stars than they really are. If you took out the Pearl Harbor back drop and attack scene (which only last for about 10 min. in this long 3 hour movie), this would be another bad love story. Pearl Harbor was used as a way to get viewers to see another dumb Ben Affleck movie. I felt dupped. I wanted to see a story about PH and got this mess instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the ratings do not go negative!","review":"Other than special effects, I find nothing memorable about this film. The misinterpretation of historic fact borders on the hysterical, and to some degree almost criminal. The film does a diservice to all those who perished in the attack, and especially those who survived and fought to keep America free. For those who are interested in Pearl Harbor, and are looking for a more accurate portrayal, get Tora Tora Tora. This movie should die a unlamented death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Historical Issues","review":"You won't be watching this one in Mr. Smith's History class. The only historically accurate part of this movie was that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. I'm even surprised they got that right in this film. The fact that I'm a huge WWII History buff makes this movie almost completely useless from a history point of view. Hollywood defiantly worked their charm on this one. Anyway, there were some good scenes during the raid if you fast-forward an hour and a half to get to them so you can miss all the chick flick stuff. I did like the tie-in between Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid even though they had nothing to do with each other and none of the pilots from Pearl even flew in it. (Another big history issue) Over all though, it had some really nice special effect during the raid. So if you're into good war special effects there are about 45 minutes to an hour of that good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie with an identity crisis","review":"Too much romance to be a war movie.

Whatever you want to call this hodgepodge of dramatic cliches, don't dare call it \\"historical.\\" Like \\"Titanic,\\" which suffers from a similar affliction, the fact that celluloid was even wasted on this is supremely insulting to the real people who actually lived through the events. The worst aspect of it is that it was obviously intended as a means to purely commercial ends, riding into theaters on the coattails of far more artistically and morally distinguished movies like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\" and the groundswell of renewed interest in World War II which followed them.If you want to watch a reasonably accurate dramatization of what actually happened at Pearl Harbor, your money will be better spent on the classic \\"Tora!

Seen from a British perspective, this film may not have quite the same relevance as it does to the target audience, but one line in particular stands out as the work of a scripting genius; the RAF bloke saying to Affleck \\"if all Americans are like you god help anyone who starts a war with you\\" (or something to that effect). Pleeeease. Another pointer to the inept directer of this pile of tripe; not showing the stars and stripes EVERY five minutes may save upwards of 20min film time, and therefore allow some sort of plot development, or other minor detail that is normally a prerequisite for a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative packaging and loaded with extras: The ultimate set!","review":"This is without a doubt the coolest and best-designed DVD set I own - and I own over 200 DVD's.The packaging is beautiful and shows amazing creativity.

The film I would maybe give 3 stars. Take out the love-triangle story, leave only the historical elements, and I give the movie 5 stars as well!I wish people would rate the DVD instead of the movie here on Amazon.com...The movie, sure, but not this fine-crafted set..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!","review":"Great movie.

It's almost as if Michael Bay just said \\"how can I do everything I did wrong in Armageddon, and multiply it tendfold?\\" They really should have cut everything around the fight scene and just shown that. I've never seen something in such desperate need for editing. The plot went on and on, and the love story was dull and cookie-cutter. It wasn't a decent love story like in Titanic, it was a miserably boring and uninvolving story about two people you don't care about.The only redeeming qualities of this film come from the special effects on the attack of Pearl Harbor. If they had just cut out all the other stuff and left this in, it might make for a nice Discovery Channel special. As a feature-length (and more) film that is supposed to keep you entertained for 3 hours, it leaves very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewrite of History","review":"This is the worst rewrite of history in the past thirty years!

It would be just dreadful, but its more the lack of humility and the debasing of a real tragedy that elevates this to the status of truly awful.This is like writing a cheap romance around 9/11 with lots of slow-mo shots of Ben and Jen running from the falling buildings to the sound of Aerosmith. I hope I haven't given the producers an idea for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best movie on the earth!!!!!","review":"This movie was the best movie I've ever seen in my life!!!

The events surrounding the bombing of Pearl Harbor are dramatic in and of themselves - the silly love story doesn't add anything except an extra hour. This is just another Bruckheimer/Michael Bay flick - Armageddon in the 40's. Same generic characters, same generic Zimmer score, same generic shots of tough guys looking cool in slow motion.On the plus side, the picture quality and sound of this DVD are absolutely top notch.

Horrible writing, a cliche-ridden plot and some phone-it-in performances gave many scenes an almost comical flare. More than once during the first thrity minutes did I have to elbow my wife to stop laughing or making cracks at the WB/UPN teen drama-like dialogue.It's not the concept of the love triangle as the movie's secondary plot that's the problem. It's that it's a horribly done love triangle. They went full tilt for a Titanic-type love story and failed miserably. Instead of pulling at the heart strings, the movie only manages to by sappy - and at times, very funny.Great special effects. Bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reenactment of History!","review":"I really enjoyed Pearl Harbor because of the special effects, but without the great plot, they wouldn't have mattered.

The plot consists more of a crappy love story, then of any historical importance. Even with its strong supporting cast including Ben Affleck, Josh Hartinett, Jenifer Garner, and Kate Beckinsale; the story's poor character development and uncaptivating performances hinder enjoyment of the film. If I had to pick some decent part in the film, I would have to say it's when they show the devotion of the troops to defend the country after the attack, and near the end when the bombing run of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is shown.

But tonight I watched some of it on TV and cried with laughter. Why? The storyline was dire, the acting was embarrassing and the dialogue made me think of steaming elephant excrement. It is difficult to find the words to describe how truly awful this movie is. It is worth watching only for the side splitting laughter factor and very relaxing. The only serious element is that some poor deluded fools might think that this is historically accurate. All it does is to illustrate how badly prepared and complacent the USA was in 1941.

For the most part, though, \\"Titanic\\" got its history straight. \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is loaded with howlers. The ultimate is FDR standing up to get the Doolittle mission approved, but there are others. I had no idea that America had guided missile cruisers in 1941, but there they are being blasted by the Japanese. Nothing took off from Ford Island, but our heros manage to do it anyway. Doolittle didn't take on any fighter jocks for his mission (he had own own cadre of bomber hotshots), but somehow he does here. The list goes on, and that doesn't even count the mistakes on the Japanese side. What did they get right? Well, the Japanese attacked and it was on December 7, 1941.

I thought it was a tribute to the \\"Greatest Generation.\\" The Pearl Harbor battle scene is the best war scene ever. It bests the Saving Private Ryan D-Day by a wide margin, also when the R-rated version comes out next fall, it will leave no doubt as to the absolutely astounding quality of the battle scenes. The love triangle is a tad overwrought, but so what, it is adequate, just like Titanic was adequate. The atmosphere created by the filmmakers greatly overshadows the inadequacies of the plot. You could spend all day pointing out little historical discrepencies in every war film, Saving Private Ryan involved a mission that never happened, I won't name others. Basically, Pearl Harbor was a movie that got canned by critics who love their films pretentious and self-serving aka Waking Life or Memento.

It's way too long and the actors are not really that good. The special effects are amazing to look at but it gets boring after a while. Jennifer Garner had a very small role in the movie. Why didn't she got a bigger part is beyond me. This unrated version is not that special only has a lot more gore/violence. Why did I waste time and money on this one I really don't know.

Special effects wonderful.Cuba Gooding Jr did a fair job acting. Everyone else stank.The story was plotless and strangling in its own mediocrity.The love triangle with Ben Afleck and the other two was forgetable.

But that's just me. I have many reasons why I gave this movie such a low rating. Firstly, it didn't live up to its hype. It was supposed to be a movie depicting the events that took place at Pearl Harbor, but then it seemed to me as if it focused more on the cliched love triangle between the leading roles than what it claimed to.*takes back the tissue* And it even failed to touch me very much, even with 2 hours of non-stop emotion.The 2 stars came from the brief war scene, its pseudo-saving grace.I don't recommend this film, lest you're into romance and such.

I truly felt I was watching Top Gun, and every sickening love story ever on the big screen. The only cool parts were those of the diesel engines, and Pres. Roosevelt getting out of chair by himself.

The Japanese just happen to attack during this love story. This movie is crap! It's not even a good chick flick.I'm angry that I was duped into spending my time and money on this tripe! I think I'll use it for target practice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a chick flick fan... not after \\"Pearl Harbor\\"...","review":"I think this must've been the strategy behind the making of \\"Pearl Harbor\\": some girls wanted to take their boyfriends to a chick-flick-in-disguise. They added a battle scene or two, and voila! \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was born. I got to see this movie first as extra credit for a humanities class; the teacher shouldn't have bothered, because \\"Pearl Harbor\\" had very little to do with actual history. Most of the movie was bogged down in a sappy, overused love triangle, not to mention the improbability of a downed pilot coming back from the dead. Then, at the end, the Doolittle raid convieniently removed one of the men from the scene. Strange how perfectly things worked out for the other guy... Cliched lines and a syrupy plot make this one to avoid for all but diehard fans of the bushy-eyebrowed Hartnett and cleft-chinned Affleck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The actors don't seem to know they're living in 1941. Ben Affleck just mouths his lines. The only time I cared about any of the people in the film was the anonymous sailors and nurses who died in the attack. What a hackneyed plot. They wrote better \\"B\\" picture scripts in the 40's. Where's Artie Shaw?Where's jive talk? Where's the radio shows? Parts of the attack are quite emotionally moving without being too manipulative which is the only reason I gave it 1 star. If you're interested in the Doolittle Raid get \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\\" which has excellent SFX for its time and is a true story with first rate actors and direction. Ignore the first half of the movie's bad plot - coming back from the dead, how many times have we seen that one on daytime television? The middle 30 minutes are okay and at some points even spectacular, but Pearl Harbor should not be about \\"Entertainment\\" with a CAPITAL \\"E\\" and that's what all the pyrotecnics are there for it seems, just to entertain. Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"More patriotic pap that didn't exist.","review":"Pure popycock and predictable.

The story is primarily about a love triangle that just happens to involve two pilots - but that fact is really unnecessary to the story itself. The love story itself could have been by and between any three people who happened to be in Hawaii when the Japanese attack took place. The story wasn't historically accurate but the performances kept it from being a total disaster. I'd pass on buying this. If you must - rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Perverted by Hollywood","review":"This was the absolute, most terrible movie I've ever seen. It was historically inaccurate and filled with every romantic-drama cliche there is. If Michael Bay wanted to make a romance, he could left history out of it. I think the event of Pearl Harbor itself is quite dramatic enough for a film, without having to add sex and betrayal. The saddest part is that people are actually going to watch this movie think that FDR actually drew attention to his disability so blatantly, when in fact he never would have done anything like struggle to his feet that way. And no one died on the Doolittle Raid. Only Kamakaze pilots wore the rising sun head bands and they weren't used until 1944. And turning the struggle that followed the attack into a game of chicken? The utter disrespect for the people who suffered through Pearl Harbor is abhorent and I cannot believe that more people do not feel this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I skipped this movie in the theater, and I'm glad. I was afraid to watch Ben Affleck after Armageddon, the movie which started his career towards running parallel with Leonardo DiCaprio's. Ben Affleck was worth watching in his Mallrats and Chasing Amy flicks, but now I wouldn't waste my money on his movies again. I made that mistake twice (Armageddon and Pearl Harbor), I'm not going to make it a third time.The name \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is accurate for less than half of the movie. I would have named it \\"Titanic in Hawaii\\" or something like that. This movie reminds me what I think NSync would be in movie form. ($) is not worth the 10 minutes of interesting footage surrounded by (...). The first time I watched it I had to fast forward to find out if the movie had ANYTHING to do with Pearl Harbor.

It takes a depressing day in history and turns it into a ... love story with pretty special effects. The attack on Pearl Harbor was entertaining, but not nearly enough to save this movie. Even the historical backround in the movie is off at times. Pearl Harbor should have been made similiar to Saving Private Ryan: cold, dark, and bloody.

Yes, there were some good special effects and big explosions (the only thing keeping this from one star), but overall this missed the mark. Why? Mainly because of the hokey love story that was the main premise of the movie. People go to a movie title \\"Pearl Harbor\\" to see what happened at Pearl Harbor, not to follow some corny love triangle superimposed on the attack. Basically, this is a chick-flick disguised as a war movie, and it doesn't work.If you want to see about Pearl Harbor, rent \\"Tora Tora Tora\\". If you want a love story, rent \\"Titanic\\".

The movie version is a hollywood-imitized discrace. My first and biggest problem is that the movie is about fighter pilots. That's cool, but what about the sailors? This is their storyline, not two hotshot fighter pilots. I think the movie should have been told from a sailor point of view (Cuba Gooding's 5 minuite part doesn't count). Also, the movie is about 40 minutes too long. If you are going to make a bad movie, at least make it a short bad movie.

It's the same like Titanic. We see another chick flick movie without telling us any history. I got pretty disappointed with this one and it's nothing but girls talkin about how guys are cute in this movie. It also gets annoying too. Saving Private Ryan was probably one of my favorite war movies of all time and I think it's a true story too and there's no chick flick in it thank goodness but movies like Pearl Harbor and Titanic are overrated and don't give us any history information. The attack of Pearl Harbor don't really happen till near the end. If you want to see a better true story movie go watch Blackhawk Down or Saving Private Ryan those are better than watching these cheap chick flick rip offs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly horrendous","review":"Possibly the worst WWII movie ever made.

Also this film is an insult to the actual events that took place on that terrible day, not only to the dead but also the survivors of the actual Pearl Harbour tragedy.

The film is polished to the limit, the love triangle is annoying, really ANNOYING. The way they used the Doolittle raid was a joke in the story. This is a heartless, big-budget movie, like countless others. The only scene I liked was the air combat over the Dover cliffs, between RAF Spitifres and the German ME 109.

It is now obvious that they had way too many of the P.H. DVD's made because they try to resell in in new packaging. whats next Pearl Harbor the waist of time Edition with 2876 hours of bonus footage.

There is very little historical accuracy in this film. I am not usually one to be very critical of this, but considering the subject matter of this film I felt that it was very significant. Also, the whole stupid love story part was totally unnecessary and very poorly done. The ridiculous love triangle made me feel like I was watching an episode of Jerry Springer. Also, I felt as though the last hour of the film was also unnecessary. The only reason that it was in there was to show that we got our revenge which isn't really even true. In truth, that mission had very little effect on anything. However, I must commend the action scene. It was very good. If you want to watch this movie, fast forward through the first hour, watch it for 45 minutes, then turn it off.

The war scenes are quite well done, but those just don't make up for the complete lack of a believable plot and the lack of chemistry amongst the lead actors. There were so many REAL stories that could have been told about the people who gave their lives at Pearl Harbor -- why was the decision made to fabricate a foolish love story that is completely unbelievable and predictable, and foist that on an unsuspecting public?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Blu Ray","review":"The two stars are for the Japanese approach into Pearl Harbor and the action torpedo sequence.

Why? Because it's trying to be like Titanic but it doesn't even come close. First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet made the audience believe they are in love and that is not the case with Pearl Harbor's stupid love triangle. Ben Affleck is a terrible actor and Kate Beckinsale does a good job of being one of the worst actresses of our time. Josh Hartnett does what he can with the poorly written role he was given, but the only good performance comes from Cuba Gooding, Jr. His performance was emotional and amazing, but that was the only good thing about this film.

Had they titled it \\"Dolittle's Raid\\", it might more accurately reflect the wretched production. My father, who was on the West Virginia that day (and was represented without name in the movie) must be spinning in his grave. History it is not, nor anything like unto. Entertaining--possibly to those of low or no standards of historical accuracy--but to pretend it reflects anything whatever about the tragedy at Pearl Harbor is a farce worthy only of Hollywood in its cups.

No, this is not exactly a \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", however it is still a great movie (Even though there are a few flaws). Because of mis-leading promotion, I think it may have lead some people to believe that this movie would be straight-forward action, similiar to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". If you are the type of person who only like action movies without any type of drama, then you probably won't like it (There is plenty of action in it). However, if you don't mind a little drama, I think you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you aren't the latter though, still give this movie a try. You might like it. I certainly enjoyed it.

Yes, pilots may have gotten in illegally, its possible. But in my mind it is a MAJOR screw up from the screenwriter and director Michael Bay for allowing such inaccurate battle scenes to be filmed. *SPOILER* You cant tell me you can shoot up a plane from a tower with a pistol and shot gun. maybe a heavy duty machine gun, but that is pushing it. the love story got over the top too.very poor overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a disaster!","review":"Other have dicussed this film's cliched script and insipid acting.

Survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack manning Doolittle's B-25's? (not ONE of any of the B-25 crews were present at the Pearl Harbor attack).

The historical perspective is distorted. It's just a mushy love story with the attack on Pearl Harbor as the backdrop. The attack as depicted seems like a Star Wars battle.

As a career Naval Aviator and student of history, I found the events depicted in a manner so inaccurate (read: \\"Hollywood\\") as to be insulting to the participants.

Get Vile instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"It seems to me that Cannibal Corpse gets alot of publicity merely because of their sick, perverted, vile and disgusting subject matter. Butchered At Birth is really just another Cannibal Corpse album. Heavy, fast, aggressive, intense, and shocking lyrics.Its not an album that breaks new ground, and it won't convert anybody to metal. The fact is, if you're looking for good death metal, look elsewhere. Go buy Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" or \\"Show No Mercy\\". They are ten times better than any of Cannibal Corpse's albums. The only people i can recommend this album to are Cannibal Corpse fans, extreme metal fans, those who already have all of Slayer's and Nevermore's releases, or those who are just sick and disgusting people like Cannibal Corpse."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the deal with these guys?","review":"CC is pretty bad compared to other metal bands.

But I know a band that knows only 3 chords and plays those sloppy when I hear one. And this is just junk...., the whole \\"look at the depressing world as it is\\" theme is so overused and just plain old childish.

And readers, please put aside the feigned outrage of the previous post from \`metal fan' and others who post reviews and seem to never have listened to the discs or know any metal fans.

As a vocalist, I will write gross, sick, and perverted lyrics, and make silly grunts, grumbles, and gurgling noises while saying only half the lyrics. As a band, we will write sick and repulsive subject matter just to shock the public and make people feel sick, make gross and graphic cover art(especially horrible ones agianst women) to do just the same, make nothing but sick noise instead of music, and send violent messeges through our \\"music\\" in order for our fans and listeners to commit all sorts of acts of violence, and walla!

But I think, though this time God doesn't speak to me through this album, songs in it can still bring blessings to other brothers and sisters who like this type of melody/lyrics. So, I praise God for that. In this way, I am not very disappointed, because I still have other 100+/- CDs to enjoy.

I must say that my husband likes their first release better, but one thing we both agree on is that they were all worth the money. I am so glad we gave this group a chance. All three CD's have slightly different styles, but you can expect that as a band grows and matures as a group. In the end their message is the same.

I'm not making charts and laminating patient education booklets in my free time and not getting paid for it.

One caveat: while Ferguson points out in his introduction that the work is not a financial history, he unfortunately doesn't paint as rich a picture of the financial markets of the early 19th century as the book requires. While the house's trading history makes for a fascinating read, it takes place without any contextual comparison of how other market makers behaved and traded (other than an occasional comparison of profits and losses).

The background music (happily there isn't much) is almost inaudible. The Austria video starts in Innsbruck and travels east through Kitzbuhl, Salzburg, the Danube, Vienna etc. Nice sites (what you could see of them) but the general quality made it a little hard to watch and rather boring.

I don't think these will last very long. Save yourself the money and buy regular burp cloths or another type of diaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thin","review":"Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths, I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center. This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering. However, the same brand, with the absorbent center pad, is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"look around","review":"i am very disappointed with these diapers. they are very thin. i purchased these with the intention to use as burp clothes. now i will have to spend twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for diapering or burp cloths","review":"I have experience with other brands of flat diaper cloths. I needed more, so I bought a pack of Gerbers and I was very disappointed. They are as thin as gauze and spit-up runs right though them. The edges are finished with some kind of cheap polyester felt that lacks any absorbency and frays easily. The Gerber cloths shrank so much that I can't possibly use them as diapers even if I tried.If these were named \\"utility cloths,\\" I could understand. But calling them diapers is a joke. Gerber used to be known for quality, but these are junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, and definately rapid relief","review":"Fortunately my daughter doesn't get to many diaper rashes, but when she does, this works well. When my daughter gets a diaper rash, she gets the ones that are hard to get rid of, so it might take a few treatments to fully get rid of it, but this product definately helps brings relief each time I use it on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, as usual","review":"I agree with the other reviewers of this series - excellent storyline, character interaction and development and acting. Of course, it features several of my favorite Brit actors, so that was no surprise. It definitely lived up to the high standards BBC has set for TV series. I can't wait for the next series (out Oct of last year), as I am a real murder mystery aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY EXCELLENT VERSION","review":"THIS 3 PART TALE OF A MODERN DAY \\"JACK THE RIPPER\\" IN LONDON IS A MASTERFUL, INTENSE VERSION.

The characters are real people and not super-cops who never make a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Yes, it's formulaic, but what I really enjoyed the most was the tension between DI Chandler and Investigator Miles and his crew. The constant sparring and downright hostility that evolved into begrudging respect was wonderful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening And Too Realistic","review":"I slept with the light on for weeks after watching the first episode. The show is exactly as described. Imagine my joy when I watched a show that exceeded my expectations for quality and casting. This program is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very suspenseful police procedural","review":"This is an excellent protrayal of a modern day copy cat Jack The Ripper villian. Very suspenseful with excellent actors and nail biting plot. I am not a big Jack the Ripper fan but this is a very absorbing murder mystery. I was so anxious to see how it ended I watched all three episodes in one afternoon non stop. I also have series 2(Region 2 DVD) which I think will be just as suspenseful as the first series. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"One of the best mystery series out of the UK.

Great acting, interesting characters, but why would police persons put themselves in harms way without any protection? Not even mace? or an ASP? Seems a bit odd to me.. Anyway, interesting story line until the ending of this first serious that was a real disappointment. I'll watch the second series only because I enjoyed the characters, especially Phil Davis and Rupert Penry-Jones and the rest of the DI team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Very boring \\"crime\\" drama.

That was not a happy discovery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"In my experience, this book was not helpful for Step 1 preparation. Partly because Behavioral Sciences is not heavily tested in the exam and clinical vignettes are time consuming. Also, I felt that by studying a standard review book alone, I was able to remember the distinguishing aspects of each disease. However I am sure there are many people who would find this book useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seattle's Back","review":"Once being the grunge capitol of the world I haven't heard to much come out of Seattle lately until the band These Arms Are Snakes (well there was The Blood Brothers). I would like to give this cd a 4 because I feel they can still achieve even better than this brilliance, but a 5 it deserves so a 5 it gets. I'd compare them to the Mars Volta in their style as a kind of art post-punkcore band, whatever that is. The distortion, the jams, the shifts, I love all these parts and more to This Is Meant To Hurt You. Stever Snere is a great vocalist, distortion is often used on his voice and it fits perfectly with the music and Brian Cook is incredible at worst with his tempo-shifts and tones. These Arms Are Snakes have managed to pull off a great EP and I wait impatiently for the LP. This album changes from jams, to melody into frantic punk effortlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no Botch, but....","review":"I like a lot of people was probably let down initially by this disk. I like all sorts of music and I'm a huge fan of Botch (a band some members of TAAS were in previously). Most hardcore musicians opt for the indie rock route after thier angrier projects run their course, and while TAAS doesn't rock the frenetic riffs of Botch, this record more than holds its own. It's something of a throbbing, midtempo, dark record that would be filed next to Quicksand or the Jesus Lizard with a singer that yelps like a VSS-era Sonny Kay if anyone ever gets around to writing a punk rock Dewey Decimal system. Anyhow, it took this record a bit to grow on me, but those kinds or records are usually the ones that stick.Also, they did the smart thing by releasing a 5 song EP as a debut instead of opting to drop a record right away. I'm stoked to hear what they do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless with OS X","review":"The keyboard is supposed to be compatible with OS X, but it's not. The biggest problem is that the keyboard is hypersensitive and repeats almost every letter, even with the system prefs adjusted. There's also a delay before anything appears on screen. So I guess it's also undersensitive. I found the joy stick hard to control, but maybe one could get used to it. The construction seems very cheap. Also: I emailed the company for help on the repeat keys over a week ago and got no reply. I'm returning to ergogeek, where I bought it. Ergogeek, by the way, seems like a great company. No complaints there."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-consuming encouragement from a humble man...","review":"I read this book when I was just a teenager and I still refer to it for its profound yet gentle encouragement and open-hearted sincerity. Beautiful book by a beautiful Christian man who lived and practiced his faith. His humility and sweet nature are very evident in the pages of this little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent view of Lewis's Life from his own hand","review":"The reader formulates his own opinion of the American lady and embraces the opportunity to be in the circle of friends of CS Lewis, from his bachelor days to the death of his beloved wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Grouping Terms, For Kids To Learn","review":"Good fun for 3-8 yrs. Everybody knows that a group of fish is a school, or a bunch of ships is a fleet. But what do you call several peacocks, or a group of kittens, or a gathering of witches? Puzzeled?This is the first childrens book I have come across that could answer those questions for children, with many more collective nouns to spare. Good illustrations, relatively quick read, and interesting and easy for children to follow. Mega points for originality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?","review":"I have always loved Sissy spacek, since she both broke my heart and scared the hell out of me in CARRIE. She earns her two stars, above, simply for being in a film. She remains powerfully watchable in an interesting role. However -- this film, which begins suspensefully, if not surprisingly, eventually crashes and burns with a made-for-TV movie ending. It really does not deserve the accolades it has been bestowed these past few weeks. The quiet, introspective quality of the film has nothing over ORDINARY PEOPLE, which is infinitely more moving and explosive. The performances are good, and the narrative is solid, until the final 20 minutes, at which point I wanted to leave the theatre -- not because I was disturbed, quite the opposite -- because I wasn't. Most of all, it has nothing to do with redemption, as the glossy TV ads suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie that runs like a book.","review":"People that hated this movie said it went nowhere. I know some folks that walked out of it. I enjoyed it. The scenes were set up well and objects needed to be noted for their place and their symbolism. The acting was tremendous as well as the realism of the characters. The movie captures the helpless feeling that one might get in the situation of losing your son, and the silent ending of a marriage. If you are a fan of Mr. Dubus and his writing you will like this movie. (or DVD)Set in Maine, the rural aspect, scenery as well as people is an enjoyable and important side note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Wilkinson Shines","review":"All of the critics have been raving about Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei for this movie, but, in my opinion, the true \\"best actor\\" here is Tom Wilkinson, who is certainly the carrier of this film, as it is he who shields his emotions from even his wife, he who comes forward to her to rationalize their emotions, and he who brings closure to the painful situation he and his wife have endured. Todd Field's direction is also excellent, as it actually makes the movie comedic in many scenes. This is only Field's first directorial effort; I can't wait to see his next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully slow in some parts, but thoughtful and well-made","review":"This movie tells a very moving story about revenge, jealousy, divorce, and parental relationships, but in a very artful and subtle way. There is none of the wearisome heavy-handedness that plagues many Hollywood pictures. The scenery of the New England town is also goregeous. My only complaint is the excruciating slowness in the middle 1/3 of the film, but it does serve a purpose and is an approach that very few films take. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie of 2001","review":"This was the best movie I saw last year. Its not full of car chases and explosions; it is an actors' movie. Tom Wilkinson should have won the \\"best actor\\" Oscar; I believe he carried the movie. The evolution of Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson from grief to anger is palpable. It is realistic and relevant. I can't say enough about the acting! It is the most moving family drama since \\"Ordinary People\\", but isn't quite as morose. The scenery is small town and beautiful, which lends a sense of familiarity with the characters and their circumstance. See this movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"A dull movie that is \\"good for you\\" because it's got a literary tone. But it's dull. Slow. The movie LONE STAR and COOKIE'S FORTUNE were movies the critics loved, and were very like IN THE BEDROOM, but that I hated. If you happened to see and like either LONE STAR or COOKIE'S FORTUNE, then you'll love IN THE BEDROOM. But if you hated those, you'll hate this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this film rated so highly?","review":"I must have missed something here because this is one of the most boring films I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. The characters are credible, which is about the only good thing I can say about the film. It trudges on, relentlessly, mind-numbingly, towards a flat, predictable ending that arrives about an hour late.It's a cinematic sleeping pill, the only reason I didn't walk out was because I paid good money to see it. An awful film that barely rates as good enough for daytime tv in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From The \\"Bedroom\\"!","review":"Having become a new fan of Andre Dubus's writing I rented this movie having high expectations from all the Oscar hype a few years ago.How could this movie ever been nominated for anything? First of all the length: This story was at the most a 90 minute movie, but was dragged out to near 2 and a half hours. Watch the beginning to get the gist of the story, then FF the first 45 minutes. You won't miss a thing.The director was trying to be artsy by subjecting us viewers to scene after scene after scene of the dead boy's parents being reminded of his former existence. Then after they kill his killer and the movie gets interesting, it's over. I really wanted to know what would happen after that. If you're having problems with insomnia, this is the cure for you!Question: In the end titles there was a sort of In Memory of Andre Dubus III 1938-1999. I didn't know he was dead. He appeared in \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" as an actor which was filmed in the early 2000's.(???)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleaseeee","review":"It would be a much more pleasant world if the anger contained in this movie truly exhausted the anger of those in society who deal with the murder of loved ones. But, alas, it is another example of capitalist explotation of people's situations in the name of art. Very few people who have been in this situation could find validity in the representations of these people on the screen and those who find value in this film are merely voyeurs to the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"One of the more overrated films of the past few years - In The Bedroom mistakes pace for depth. While the majority of reviewers note the somber tone and deliberate pace of the film, it is really nothing more than an Egoyan-ish remake of Redford's Ordinary people mixed with any of the Charles Bronson Death Wish movies. Nothing new, nothing original, and designed to make one think that it contains depth that isn't there, In The Bedroom is as copmplex as your average episode of The West Wing, with all of the subtlety of a hammer to the side of the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some movies comes out of the rectum","review":"And that is one of them.But I still try to understand how THIS can get any award.

But after viewing it, Im left wondering 'why'? I'm not one that has to have tons of action in a movie to be entertained, but it doesnt have to be THIS slow, either! The first few minutes of the movie told the viewer that there was a relationship between the son and the older woman. The extra 20 to 30 minutes of drivel continuing on this fact was pointless and it almost made me fall asleep. I perked up a bit when the tragedy occurred, but just as quickly, it grew mundane again. And the ending left much to be said. Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei are great actors, but this movie was just simply boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good preformances in a pointless, boring movie","review":"The acting in the film is quite good, especially the father (Tom Wilkinson), who I thought really took his part well.However, who cares about good acting when about 75% of the movie is pure bordom. I had no problem with the slow pace at first, because it was used to show what effect the main plot point had on the family's life, but come on! Enough is enough!Within ten minutes, I understood what was going on and was ready for the story to move forward. Instead, the filmakers decided to add an extra hour and a half of mundane activity which added absolutely nothing to the story or even the character developement.Complete waste of time which will make you wonder how this movie ever received any positive attention at all, with the exception of the great acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN THE BEDROOM PUTS YOU TO SLEEP","review":"MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO SEE THIS WITH THE GREATEST OF EXPECTATIONS.

The actor who played Marisa Tomei's husband was stiff and not particularly believeable in the role. And again, too many pregnant pauses in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and depressing","review":"I'm sorry I wasted money on this film. While the acting was superb, the story line was hackneyed, and the pacing was so slow, I wondered if it would EVER END. And the ending -- my God, haven't these people ever seen a crime drama? Don't they know about forensics? What could these otherwise bright and well-educated people be THINKING???!!! I'm sorry, but the script writers themselves should have been shot for this one.If you MUST, wait for the video so you can use your remote to speed through most of the film, or go get a sandwich."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Bedroom","review":"I thought that the movie moved VERY slowly. The storyline was predictable and drawn out much longer than it needed to be. Many of the scenes seems unnecessary. It was chopped up a lot. The abrupt ending made you leave wondering why there wasn't something more to it. Throughout the movie, we kept waiting for something more to happen. The acting in it was good, but not anything out of the ordinary for the gifted performers in these roles. VERY disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not rent or buy","review":"this movie sucked. my boyfriend and i decided to rent this movie since it was up 5 times for the oscar. Boy were we wrong. we wanted to not only brake our tv, but kill each other too. it was very boring, most scenes did not involve any speech but just pointless things that waisted a lot of time. The pointof the movie i must say was alright, but it was not good for a 2 and a half hour movie. i strongly suggest you dont go buy or rent this movie!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly tedious!","review":"Big, big disappointment. Even the most artsy-fartsy French films are usually not this belaboured, snail-like and flat. With the exception of Nick Stahl and Marisa Tomei, the main characters are not only dull and depressingly repressed but annoyingly passive and pathetic. I totally agree with one of the previous reviewers who said that this movie mistakes slow pacing with emotional depth.There are much better films that deal with complex emotional issues but do not require several shots of espresso to keep your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me crazy but 1 star isn't low enough...","review":"I guess I missed something in this movie because it think it was the most boring, slow moving story I have ever seen! There were literally minutes of no words spoken all throughout the movie. I constantly battled whether I should just give up and quit watching it, or skipping several scenes just to get to the end. I'm sure I'm not the average movie critic, but I would say, Don't Waste Your Money!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T GO!! SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME & MONEY","review":"What a waste of time. I should have left, many people did. I actually thought something might happen. The actors were all so ugly and especially with all the hideous close up shots. It was so boring.

It is so slow and boring that you will be fast asleep in a matter of minutes. Good thing I didn't put out money for this DVD. I checked it out of the library. So on the cover that it was nominated for awards. Who are these people that nominated this movie for an award anyway? The only redeeming quality of this movie was that the acting was good.

That's how awful it was. The acting was bad. The directing was bad. I kept hoping something exciting was around the corner but I was wrong. Luckily I rented it and didn't waste money to own such a flat, pointless excuse for a movie. The ending was so dumb. No wonder it didn't win any Academy awards.

If you want something really moving, watch 'Requiem For a Dream' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable family melodrama reminiscent of network TV","review":"These types of films are programmed to press the emotional buttons located inside the brains of middle-aged, middle-class American women. This film is not recommended for other brains, particularly male brains. I tried this film for thirty minutes, then suffered an adverse reaction and had to press Stop. I had my fill of these growing up, on network TV, which probably caused brain damage that I have only been able to reverse by watching such movies as \\"Master and Commander,\\" \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\".Yet another quintessential chick flick. I gave it a spin because I fondly remembered Sissy Spacek from other movies, and thought Marisa Tomei was not bad looking. (In this movie, her hair could provide nesting space for a family of birds.)The New York Times gave this a rave review, which decides the question of whether I am going to subscribe to that newspaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"[It was terrible]","review":"All I have to say is I couldn't even watch it to the end. I'm the type of person who HAS to watch a movie to the end to find out what happens no matter how stupid it is, and with this movie I really didn't care....it got turned off half way through. To sum it up....BAD!! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait and rent it on DVD If you have to see it.","review":"I am not sure what they were trying to get through to the audience in this movie. There was so many camera moments of no talking, fade outs and well I just found myself very confused. The story of losing a loved one , domestic violence , how a family grieves and an unjust legal system is kind of thrown at the audience in bits and pieces. The movie does draw a conclusion at the end but only to leave you w/ another sense of \\"huh?\\".I really wanted to see this movie and left very disappointed. I expected based on reviews to be left w/ things unanswered but I never realized that the entire movie would be like this. There are moments in this movie that are very disturbing however I really felt they could have connected the characters and their story in relation to each other far better than they did.Save your money and go see I am Sam. A far better movie with a different plot but very good at reaching the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Told me nothing.","review":"The movie poster outside my theater had so many good comments about In The Bedroom, which is why I went to go see it. Were they seeing the same movie I saw?While the events and the characters were realistic, the flat plot didn't make for a good movie. (And I don't think the trailer portrayed the film accurately.) I wished I got my money and time back!Yes, a murder tears the loved ones apart.Yes, it's not a typical subject.Yes, I saw the subtext (what was not said supposedly spoke volumes) and it STILL did not carry the movie.No, the film wasn't particularly dark. Also, other movies that showed degradation of the character(s) were more interesting than this one.In the end, I was left thinking, \\"So what?\\" Again, this movie said nothing to me.All I can probably suggest if you're still interested in seeing it is to wait until it comes out in the movie channels or somebody rents it and you'll end up seeing it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highbrow Sucker Punch","review":"Surprisingly few films attempt to show us believable people faced with extraordinary circumstances. In the Bedroom became a critics' darling owing to its initial movement theretoward. By the time the crisis is exposed, we're convinced we've never seen anything quite like it. The film then meditates on its own riveting magnificance for a good long while before tacking on an ending that provides resolution without context, one that is utterly shocking for its utter lack of shock. Like a Bernie Madoff investor, you'll be haunted by questions of how you'd ever been convinced to expect otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped for no reason at all","review":"This was one of , if not THE worst movie I have seen . I could barely watch the whole thing. Plodding and pretentious, hardly any good dialogue...If Sissy Spacek was allowed some great words instead of constant silence /brooding/smoking ...yes I understand the art of acting is not only the words but this movie had such a lack of stimulating dialogue. Sissy was the reason I saw it, as I love her work, but was deeply disappointed. Too much about the flat boring father, predictable pat ending, horrible actor who played the exhusband. Sorry to be mean but he seemed like a juvenile actor who in no way conveyed the depth needed to make his character seem real. It was like watching a high school play, (no offense to high schoolers ) .Do not waste your money buying this, unless you have seen it and know you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Justice","review":"This is a quiet, sort of artsy film which miraculously makes you forget you are watching a movie. I think one of the most effective elements of this film is making the lives of the people you are watching seem completely honest and genuine. You beleive everything in this film, I never doubted a single word or action by any of the characters. One major thing I started to notice was the built up anger of most of the characters in this film. I was waiting for each of them to expolde into hysterics, and well......they pretty much did, according to my expectations. The main thing I was most pleased with was the ending of the film. I so wanted the father to do what he did to you know who (the jerk). I even caught myself saying \\"good\\" out loud when he pulled the trigger. What a relief and what a great ending to a sad story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Flawless","review":"In The Bedroom was one of my favorite films of the last year along with A Beautiful Mind and otnemeM (Memento), but it is not for everyone's taste and definatly is not mainstream. In The Bedroom is about a family and the people around them who are shocked by the family's son's death. Past events that were long forgoten are reawakened and no one is left unshatered. The best performances in this film went to Tom Wilkinson, Sissy Spacek, and Marissa Tomei. It has a great screenplay, with no cheap B-Movie lines that affect some films like Mortal Kombat: Anilathion (\\"It's my animality.\\"(What does that even mean!?)) and no tongue in cheek events. I would have given this five stars, but like I said, not everyone will like this. I however, liked it alot and think it was one of the best films of 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done drama/Sissy Spacek won Independent Spirit Award","review":"In the Bedroom is the much awaited thoughtful drama of the year. Sissy Spacek's latest role, Ruth, is that of a teacher of Bulgarian folk music, and the great haunting harmonies of the Bulgarian women's choir provides appropriate soundtrack.Set in a Maine fishing village Ruth (Spacek) and Matt (Tom Wilkinson) play the parents of Frank (Nick Stahl) whose relationship with Natalie (Marissa Tomei) caused conflict with her estranged husband.The story is simple, intense, and has a low budget feel (in a positive way). What it comes down to is loss, mourning, and vengeance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the reviewer!

Instead he gets an evening of waiting for plot to start, while fighting off sleep.Nothing much happens in this movie. The characters are shallow, the storyline is so poor that it's easy to tell what will happen next, the dialogue is bad. Maybe the acting is good, but who cares about that when you are fighting off sleep?This is the slowest paced movie I have ever watched. I suffered through it, saw through the stupid \\"suprise ending\\" long before it happend, and I feel ripped off by those charlatans who somehow arranged for the thing to be nominated for awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Film","review":"Very good, but Spacek with a nomination?

Pretty depressing idea but I am glad I watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funeral, dealing with grief","review":"Good movie, a bit slow at times, but brings up some very good points that make you think. Realistic portrayal of what grief does to a family when death touches it. Sissy Spacek really made the movie shine as well as Tom Wilkinson. Marisa Tomei played a good part as the cradle stealing lover of the young man (Affleck). All in all, not a bad movie, but a bit too long and the slow parts did drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge letdown.","review":"In the Bedroom was nominated for a lot of Academy Awards a few years ago and to my disappointment, this film is slow and boring from beginning to end. I was expecting so much more from this critic's darling and even though Tom Wilkinson is a great actor, I am sorry to say not even his flawless acting could save this shallow train wreck. In the Bedroom is just one of those films with great acting but the plot is weak and never gets off the ground. The ending is just plain horrible, didn't see the that one coming, ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORBID MORBID MORBID","review":"sometimes you want to love a movie. Great actors making a comeback (Sissy, Marisa). Excellent English actor (Tom), but its overtaken by a morbid and depressing plot despite the actors excellent jobs. Yes, it was realistic. Yes it was deep, but as in one scene (that felt like it lasted for hours) Sissy and Tom are just sitting and not speaking. Like i said under the circumstances i suppose it would be like that but i can't understand why anyone would praise such morbidness. I just will never understand why movies like this are made when we go to the movies for escapism (especailly at times like this). And why people would want to go see such a depressing. dull movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASe don't waste your time!","review":"This movie aside from being extremely BORING, this movie is super depressing beyond belief.

Marisa Tomei offers a great performance (for the sum total of 10 minutes she's on the screen), and Sissy Spacek is always enjoyable... but if this movie were any slower they'd be filming grass grow.

They great actors but they cannot save this BORING script. The plot is up in the first hour, but unfortunately there is still 70 minutes of the movie to go. There's alot of blank staring into space, regression to 'bad' habits such as smoking and drinking because the characters don't know what to do with themselves. Some might say, well that's the point. They are disoriented. Well, that's fine, but not for 70 minutes.

In this instance they are correct. The directing is fine, the acting is superb; but the screenplay is fifth-rate, full of cliches and tired old plot moves. Those who gave this movie 5 stars were obviously not watching this movie but some other movie they were imagining. This is not a tragedy but a tiresome waste of time (and only the performances of Wilkinson and Spacek will convince you otherwise)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excruciating experience","review":"One has to wonder just what film was the director trying to make.It starts as a lively, entertaining study of family dynamics. Then it shifts to a long, interminably boring segment that's supposed to be a study of grief but is, in reality, just a long series of under-directed vignettes that all fade to black and give absolutely no motivation whatsoever for what follows. And what follows is yet another wrenching, inexplicable shift into the vigilante/revenge genre.... When there are some film-makers out there that really know how to tell a story, who do critics go ga-ga over a film-maker who largely depends on the audience to fill in the emotion he can't seem to put on the screen?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pump, works great!","review":"This is a new pump for me, as I recently upgraded from a much smaller Sunterra pump.

If your a connissuer of audio/video tecky stuff, you may not like it. But for the average TV viewer or mom and dad looking to upgrade their their entertainment center on a budget, you won't be disappointed. It's not hard to learn all of it's functions, and the remote is easy to use once you've tried it a few times.If the picture quality for the VCR could of been a few tads better, I would have given it a 5 star rating.

It's now in the repair shop with Sony and hopefully will be back in time to capture my son's first birthday on the 24th.Am noticing a trend though with the various mechanical complaints. Might want to invest in something different, especially since the warranty only covers the camera for a year.

It doesn't snap the picture when you hit the button, and the delay is ridiculous when you are trying to shoot pictures of children. It takes too long to reset after the flash goes off. I find that it really only takes consistantly good photos outside on sunny days, mainly because you don't need to deal with the flash. Indoors in low light, forget about it.

When I try to take a picture, it flashs a symbol indicating the camera is not stable and the picture could be blurry. However, the symbol keeps on flashing even when I set the camera on a surface (i.e. on a table) - how much more stable can you make the camera to be? Needless to say, the indoor pictures are all fussy and quite bad. I can't beleive a camera from Sony could be such poor quality.

Also battery life is used up way too fast. All in all a piece of junk despite the Zeiss lens. If you're looking for a camera that is dependable for fast shots this is not the camera to get.

A realtively small size and excellent viewfinder.4. High quality pictures without huge complexity.This camera is excellent in these areas.

I didn't recognize any of the moves - or music - from watching ballroom-variety Latin dance on TV. That would have been a disappointment but not a total loss - if I were able to follow the leader in whatever it was she was doing to whatever music. I wasn't. Why does no one ever place the camera behind the leader once in awhile so that the viewer can copy the moves without having to mirror-image them first?

I got frustrated not being able to see how she was moving - I spent most of my time yelling at the non-existant camera man to pull back!

I never would have found this book in a conventional book store and I was happy to come upon it shortly after publication. I have lent it to several people and bought if for several others.

I'm not the head of any ministry at my church, but \\"It\\" convicted me in how I think about the ministries I do participate in, and encouraged me to go out and get more of \\"it\\" and give more of \\"it\\".My only gripe about the book is that even though Groeschel states \\"it\\" is not about money or the number of people, the churches he profiled as \\"it\\" churches are all big churches with thousands of people and well known pastors. He frequently quotes Bill Hybels and Andy Stanley, pastors of BIG \\"It\\" churches. So, even if Groeschel believes that small churches can have \\"It\\" he doesn't produce the evidence. Although he says this is not the case, Groeschel's examples seem to say you don't have \\"it\\" unless your church grows into a group of thousands of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on target!

I mean, if your going to write a movie about another time and place, you can't just chuck someone into the middle of it and expect the viewer to know as much about the characters as the writer does. They don't tell you jack, and if it was simply a case of giving you a minor amount of information to make it engaging, then fine. But with this, all you get is bits and pieces of loose-ended ideas and characters that I KNOW that I've seen before. Finally, the last thing I must rant is that of all the names to call this vampire hunter D impersonator... why did they call him Darkside? I mean... you can't get any less origonal than that, but I guess that's the situation with this whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.

But this isn't well done. It's not even medium rare. It's road kill. It's just bad.Since every other review has been good, I have to say: Sorry if you liked it and I've made you mad, but I really think it's crap.

The story is set in a Bladerunner environment with one Mega-corporation owning most of Japan. There are small areas of rebellion known as the Darkside of Tokyo. Far more interesting than this typical plot is the arrival of a possibly supernatural stranger. To reveal more would spoil a well crafted plot. The animation is exellent, the music suits the pace of the movie. The dubbing is also good, and the overall quality of the anime is very high.

Why does this seem to be such a bone of contention with everyone? 1,000 vocalists sounded like Tom Fischer (Warrior) after Celtic Frost debuted, but so what? Makes sense that if he can well pull off the Filth vocal, then go for it! Doesn't really matter who came first, as long as there's QUALITY in songwriting, musicianship, etc. This is a pretty good effort, and since Dani Filth's vocal style appeals to me, it's nice to be able to hear it from a band other than CoF. Every band is an extension of a band that came before it, to some degree. Amazon offers snippets, so 'don't like it, don't buy it'.

Spacing often random, words misspelled (or with random symbols instead of letters), punctuation strange. Looks like a job done by a flawed computer program and never reviewed by a human being.The translation is also strange. Done by Thomas Carlye, apparently in the 1820's, so one might expect the English to be a little old-fashioned, but this is extreme to the point of absurdity. Translation is a challenge, it's not surprising that translators such as Constance Garnett are criticized. But she at least produced English that didn't jar with every sentence. Was Goethe's German so stilted, formal, archaic? I can't say, but this book is impossible to read.This book is reputed to be the original bildungsroman.

Now, I am stuck with nothing :(The plates on this grill are cheaply made.Nothing that has been cooked has cooked right although I've followed directions and tweeked things here and there.There is no OFF, you simply have to unplug it (which doesn't work for me because where I have mine set up is it's permanent home and the plug isn't all that close.)

I cooked meat, fish and vegetables. However after less than one month the right screw that allows the upper plate to be opened and closed broke.

I am contacting GF to let them know that they have units being shipped with exposed chrome handles that have VERY sharp edges that can cut skin if you run a finger along the edge.After reading all of the reviews I expected great things from this grill but have been very disappointed. First I had to use a infrared temperature sensor to get an approximate idea of what the different settings (1,2,3) correlated to and discovered the plate temperature fluctuates greatly when the unit reaches the desired setting. This temperature fluctuation makes it difficult to predict what kind of cooking time you need. If you are making a panini frequent checking is required. I just cooked some salmon on it and even preheated to the highest setting it had virtually no sear/char.I just ordered the Breville Smart Grill and hope it will pick up where these \\"cheap\\" grills leave off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my G5!","review":"I love my G5!

I washed the plates multiple times and again heated it and let it cool multiple times and the fumes never went away.

A terrible experience, will never buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive disappointment","review":"I purchased this grill for $129.99 in June 2006.

However, now the red paint on the back half of the top of the grill is turning black & peeling off.This grill has received only light use & I expected it to last much longer than a year and a half (especially for the price).

The non-stick coating peels off within a year and for some strange reason the people over at George Foreman do not make replacement grill plates. Now with all the concern for the environment, why would I need to dispose of a working product just because I need teflon back on one of my grill plates? But yet I can't buy just the grill plate from the GF people even though this unit still performs? What a waste and unneccesary expense. George Foreman, get with the times. Save the planet's resources and our pockets and help us replace your faulty non-stick grill plates buy selling us just the grill plates when our grills are still working.

I ordered this model to replace a GPR99 (the jumbo model w/digital).When the unit arrived I was very disapointed with the build quality. It didn't come close to my former model. It was very light weight and cheesy looking. Not sure why they exagerated the long handle; surely that will break.

With the removable plates, however, clean-up is a breeze -- most of the time the plates can just be cleaned with a quick soap and water rinse and don't even need to go in the dishwasher (although they do fine in there). I also love the idea of interchangeable plates. This grill now replaces my waffle iron, old Foreman grill, and square griddle pan. I also bought the omelet pan, which is unnecessary really, but great for making poached eggs or small omelets (if you want a larger omelet, use the baking pan that comes with the grill and just fold the eggs over). The grill is also nice looking enough that I can leave it out on my counter and store the unused plates in the cabinet beneath. I would give this more than five stars if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Next Generation Grill","review":"I found it to be disappointing in the griddle feature. The pancakes would not brown.

It is easy to use and very functional with the different plates. I like the fact that you can adjust the angle to drain off the grease or place the grill flat for cooking other types of items. I even baked cookies on it one time. It worked great although you can't fit too many on at a time. I only have a couple of suggestions that would make it better. I don't like the hatching on the upper grill plate as it is difficult to clean. The straight ridges on the bottom plate are really easy to clean, and I would prefer straight ridges on the top as well. I would also like a timer on the grill.

So I basically have to keep flipping my burgers or one side will be burned and the other side not cooked enough. Also when I open the lid it basically stops cooking since the bottom plate isn't as hot. I'm not a big fan of the long drip pan either... I had a different brand before where it sent everything into one corner and into a little cup... that was easier to carry and dump than this long, shallow pan.

I pulled it out last night to grill some chicken breasts and noticed that the 'tilt' mechanism wasn't locking in place but it wasn't a big deal because I needed it tilted so the grease would drip out. I assumed it had some mechanism that if you had the grill plates in place it forced the tilt. After cleaning the device and removing the grill plates I checked to see if I could get it to be level (which you need for waffles, omelets, etc). sure enough the spring is broken! I tried to return it to Amazon but I'm a week past the return window :( I'll see if George Foreman stands by the grill or if I have a hundred dollar hunk of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment I belived other people's rateing.","review":"I purchased the grill December 11 2009 The nonstick surface no longer works on the grill , so clean up is very difficult. Today's date is May 19 2010 this sucks because I purchased this grill based on customers reviews. 5 months use is terrible performance. I had a Foreman grill that some one gave me and it the surface worked grate for one year and six months. The grill did not have removable plates and was in the $39 price range. I was looking forward to long term usefulness from this grill I purchased all the extra plates available. The quality control for this product is sourly lacking or the consumer reviews are exaggerated. I know that nonstick coatings vary greatly based on the process used. Clearly the coating on the Gorge Foreman grill is inferior and not a premium coating. Premium nonstick coatings last for many years with out fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ability to purchase replacement plates.","review":"This grill works but after a year of usage, the plates are very difficult to clean (loss of non-stick ability). Looking back, I wish I would have purchased the warranty service because without the plates, its worthless. I only use the grill plates and its getting more and more difficult to clean them. I attempted to purchase a replacement but Foreman doesnt offer them. A good way to keep the profits flowing in, I guess. When it comes time, Im going to purchase a non-Foreman grill out of principle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This product is great with it's removable plates.

As a matter of fact, one of the plate didn't even hold and my first try at grilling fell onto the floor as I was using the side handle to maneuver the machine. I have spoken with customer support and reported this incident. They also realize other customer reported this same issue. They are sending out a replacement order. I will wait and see if this also has the same defect.Just received replacement item today and still has the same defect. Also spoke with customer support and they are saying customers have also called in reporting the same problem. Why would anyone knowingly sell a defective product that posses a serious hazard?

I love the fact that all the plates are not only removeable, but dishwasher safe also. It sure beats trying to remove the grease and pieces of meat that stuck to my original Foreman. I'd recommend this to every one. Only drawback is that it is a little smaller, but you can get around that issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down","review":"Have owned George Foreman GRP90 for over a year and am now replacing it because the finish on the plates has eroded. Followed manufacturer's directions for cleaning. When I put the plates in the dishwasher they came out rusty -- a first with any metal object I put in the dishwasher, much less one with supposedly nonstick finish. The nonstick finish, in fact, was never non stick. I will say that it did the cooking job, but the difficulty in cleaning it made it a frustrating experience. Now, with the finish gone, It cannot be cleaned well enough to use. Another problem: Unlike other grillers, it doesn't have a drip pan. There is a little hole in the bottom where grease drips out, even after you've cleaned the plates and wiped the whole exterior with paper towels, the grease continues to ooze out of the bottom. Yuk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill!","review":"Pros:I got my grill for $20 on craigslist...At first I was a little apprehensive about the waffle plates, but I made waffles a la Betty Crocker (USED 1/2 c. butter)... they came out GREAT... after I remembered to grease the plates.I have used the baking tray to toast almonds... works great.I don't think cooking anything else will be a big issue.Cons:My grill was used, so the plates were pre-scratched for me :-)I have to agree that the plates have a bit of jiggle to them and that the clean up is a bit more involved.For waffles, make sure you add more grease to your batter or grease the actual plates. I had to use a wooden skewer to loosen the waffles and took the bottom plate out and knocked it on the counter a bit... cooked on high for 5-6 mins... GREAT waffle maker.NEXT: I want to try to make cupcakes/muffins in this thing! AWESOME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile, Easy To Clean, & Convenient","review":"My husband and I were so excited to receive this grill. We love to make paninis and look forward to grilling up all kinds of meals. So far, the only meal that didn't turn out so well was waffles. They just didn't cook evenly and then they stuck to the grill plate. For waffles, we prefer our old inexpensive dedicated waffle iron. For everything else - this George Foreman grill is incredibly versatile. The removable/dishwasher-safe plates make it easy to clean and very convenient. Amazon had the best price at under $90.The grill smells rather \\"smoky\\" when it comes out of the original package. I figured the odor would fade after usage and washing -- but it hasn't. I'm not fan of that scent, but it's not a deal breaker. For protective storage of the plates, I found bubble wrap envelopes at Staples. Works great! Overall, we are very peased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I absolutely love this grill. The removable, dishwasher safe plates is exactly what I was looking for. I had a first generation grill but the plates were not removable. Let's just say that it went swimming a couple times in the sink.

I usually grill up a chicken breat or hamburger patty for lunch with it. I think it will have paid for itself in the first month with what I am saving vs. going to the company cafeteria.The cafeteria charges me $8.99 for a cheeseburger and fries. And that's for a wimpy 1/4lb burger. I can make half-pound burgers right at my desk for a fraction of that cost.If this thing could make french fries it would be the perfect cubicle accessory, but I'll get a mini fry-daddy for that and then I'll be in heaven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, conveinant grill","review":"Nice grill, love the interchangeable plates and ability to change the elevation.

I like supporting Foreman anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 plates for 2 possibilities","review":"Looks great. Love the handle that can be used without getting burned. But, for a 5-plate interchangeable thing, there aren't really 5 things you can do with it. Yes, you can make waffles. And, you can cook a steak and chicken. But, if you try a panini, it not only looks really weird given the top (god-awful-to-clean) plate, it doesn't melt and cook equally all the way through. So, if you need something to get rid of fat when you do hamburgers or steak, go for it (or a way less expensive version that takes up less space). If you want it to be a multi-purpose griller to make breakfast, lunch and dinner, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Grill","review":"I have had three other Foreman grills... loves em all.

The paint is actually peeling off on all of the plates I am using with it. This is despite it being \\"dishwasher safe\\". I called their warranty department 3 months ago for replacement plates and I STILL haven't seen them delivered. Last time I called, they claimed they were on \\"backorder.\\" Either lots of people are having this problem, or they are completely incompetent.That said, the grill cooks fantastically. I love cooking on it.

Amazon sent a replacement grill very quickly! It arrived intact, but I managed to break the handles off two of the grill plates myself. I absolutely LOVE the grill! It cooks just great! However...the handles are very fragile. They should be made of hard rubber rather than the brittle plastic they are made of now. I would gladly pay a little more for a grill with better handles.If you buy this you will be happy with the way it cooks but BE CAREFUL WITH THE HANDLES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My experience was negative","review":"I read a great deal of positive comments about this product, but when I used it, the bottom grill just doesn't get the job done.

Very disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I had one of these, though I didn't buy it from amazon.com. I recently tossed it out as it didn't live up to expectations. The nonstick coating doesn't work well and after washing there is often a white residue on the exposed aluminum on the back. When this first happened, I thought it was due to the dishwasher detergent (though it's supposedly dishwasher safe). It still happens when hand washing with Dawn dish soap. Also, steel plates would heat more evenly than the aluminum which is used. Lastly, it smells odd when cooking, making the food smell less appetizing. I plan on replacing it with a Zojurishi electric grill since I've had nothing but good experience with that brand. I'll have to turn food over to cook both sides, but that's not difficult and it has a cast iron grill for even heating."},{"rating":"2","title":"GEORGE FORMAN MODEL #GRP90WGR","review":"This is a great item and the reason I chose it was the removable plates.

I futzed around for 20 minutes before I could get the removable plates to fit and latch, and even then the attachment was far from secure. I prepared my standard, tried and true, waffle batter, warmed up the G5 until the light went out, and added the batter. The waffled cooked fine, in a reasonable time, but stuck to the grill like there was Gorilla Glue in the batter (see picture). It took a half-hour to scrape the grill plates clean with the useless, little plastic spatulas supplied with the grill. By the time I was done, the family had made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for breakfast.It's definitly NOT a fat reducing grill if you have to grease it every time you use it, and calling it non-stick is clearly fraudulent advertusing!!

For a sandwich on a sub bun, the top side tends to slip when the cover is lowered, have to compensate for the slippage. The power cord could use another six inches. Also the $69.99 on a Friday Amazon special was a nice touch.UPDATE: 6-6-08 Bought a Cuisenart GR-1 for Paninis, much better for thick sandwich, top bun stays \\"put\\". The G-5 is still my \\"go-to\\" for perfect eggs. Also have bought the omelet plates, perfect for hashbrown patties. The GR-1 is available @ $39.xx once in a while on AMZ.

With extra plates included, this is a better value for those intending to use the grill regularly. Extra features that matter include an adjustable temperature setting, grill tilt adjustment (to adjust position depending on the grill function), and the large handle.

The plates do not seem to lock in securely, which I believe is the reason that it doesn't heat up properly. The recommended cooking time for waffels is 3 - 5 minutes. I cooked my first one for almost 10 minutes and it still wasn't brown. Today, after making sure the plates were fastened as securely as possible, I used it again and the results were the same.

After 3 waffle makers, and looking at new ones for the same price as this multi-function grill, I decided to go ahead. Amazing... I really like it. Bacon has never been easier to make.

The top grill plate started sticking to food shortly after I started using it. Now when I grill anything, I open the grill and the food either sticks to the top grill or comes tumbling down and out of the grill.The waffle and flat grill are worthless for waffle and pancakes.

Unfortunately there isn't a straight plate to use on the top.The second complaint I have is the heat adjustment. It worked poorly to start with, heat adjustment didn't have very fine control.

First, you cannot put two fish steaks, beef steaks or any other kind of meat side-by-side if they are not the exact same thickness. The thicker piece will cook and the other will not.

I have the original small Foreman Grill, and I love it. We make everything on it from grilled cheese sandwiches to steak, but it takes too long to make 10 hamburgers. So I thought this one would save time. Plus I liked the fact that the plates are removable and interchangeable. My only complaint is that the cord is so short! It's ridiculous! The little grill has such a longer cord, and that takes up less room on the counter. So you are limited to where you can put it. If you have crowded counter space, you need to move the appliance around; but the short cord doesn't allow you to do that. Very annoyed with that design. Plus the top plate doesn't fit flush up against the unit. Feel like it will fall off. Hope it doesn't!

I don't need to own a different appliance for every little thing I cook.I hope the nonstick coating holds up over time.The manual is unacceptably skimpy-3-4 recipes plus basic operating instructions.

Or you use the skillet for eggs, pancakes, etc. Then, you can have a freshly grilled sandwich for lunch, with an unbelievable crust and melted cheese. And of course for dinner, it is the best way to make grilled meat that has the juices seared in, and the grease drained off, indoors without smoking up the house.On top of that, it bakes pizzas and desserts. What else could you ask for. There is hardly a meal, much less a day, that goes by that we don't use it. And, it is just right size to feed a family of four, but not take up too much counter space.Of course, there are some things that could be improved. The heating element could be more evenly spaced, and the upper grill plate pattern is difficult to clean. But over all, it is one of the best uses of $100 you can find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Sideshow Cinema","review":"Honey Glaze pays homage to James Bond movies while venturing into uncharted territory in an altogether hilarious and successful romp.

The actors do a terrific job at being believable in their roles, keeping straight faces and staying in character as they get into one bizarre situation after another.It goes beyond \\"appreciative chuckle\\" to \\"burst out laughing\\" many times, and is good enough that I let my young teens watch it despite an oh-so-brief nearly-topless scene that's absolutely necessary to the plot.

The little pegs that are suppossed to hold up the bottles are not strong enough, so they fold down, causing a domino effect with your bottles. If you use wide neck bottles, you can only fit a couple on the rack at a time. Also, the base of this is solid, so air does not circulate that well (unlike a simple dish drainer, which allows maximum air flow).

Its a good idea, but it needs some work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rack!","review":"Ditto the other reviews-- this one is great because it is angled to drain into your sink. The brush was not my favorite -- not as good as the kind with the sponge on the end -- but it is serviceable.

I thought at least these would be soft (as the name implies) and that he may like to chew on them the way he does his kiddopotamus table place mat. Not so! These bibs are not at all soft, and the way it fastens around the neck hardly holds together even if you are not trying to pull it off. These bibs are a great idea in theory, but in my opinion, Baby Bjorn needs to work on the design of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby hates this bib.","review":"I want to love this bib. We have many Baby Bjorn products and this, by far, is the least useful. The plastic bib might work well IF the baby is willing to wear.My baby hates it when he started baby food at 7 month old (he now is 20 mo.) He refused to wear, crying, trying to rip the bib off (thanks to the snap disclosure, he couldn't) and finally stopping eating because this bib annoyed him so much. I had to change a softer yet still waterproof bib. I've made my baby wear it several times. He still goes crazy when I put this on him. I hate to see a well design product useless and will save it for my friend's baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far, not working out...","review":"As far as waterproofness and easy clean, these are great, but so far, these do not fit my 9 month olds. The bibs are too rigid for my twins - no matter how I adjust the neck strap, these seem to slip up and the neck gets caught in their mouths, so they can't eat and can't move it back under their chins themselves...

The plastic is sturdy and feels like good quality (hence the 2 stars) but it's not easy to put on and once it is on, my baby could easily take it off or just pull on it and chew on the collar. It's not comfortable and I would recommend to any Mom to just buy some dark Cotton/polyster bibs and throw them in the wash after each use. They are soft and easy to work with. If you prefer plastic, the softer ones are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bib that your baby can't pull off","review":"I really like this bib because our son cannot pull it off. He is 7 months old and has mastered taking off other bibs that use a velcro closure. This one has a pearl necklace like lace that you depress, kind of like the cord on a fan. It's also good for catching liquid, which is nice since our son is just starting to use a sippy cup and would otherwise end up drenched. I highly recommend these bibs. They may be a little pricey, but they seem long-lasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"Easy to clean, lovely colors, shaped to fit the contour of baby's body, adjustable strap to accommodate growing baby, a wonderful product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too easy for toddlers to remove- don't buy.","review":"We ordered these bibs out of desperation because our 16-month-old twins have mastered the art of removing velcro bibs. Some reviews of the single bibs and of these 2-packs on other sites indicated that these were very difficult to remove and that they stayed on better than any other bibs on the market. That is not the case for our sons at all. One figured out how to undo it (with one hand, no less) within a day, and the other within a few weeks. The material itself is easy to clean and we loved the pocket, but that does us no good since the boys don't keep them on! I really don't see how any baby over, say, 9 months wouldn't figure this out in a heartbeat and be throwing it on the floor like our kids do. Stick with bibs that snap (if you can find them) rather than ordering these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!!!","review":"I Love this bib! It is easy to clean and catches food well. Meal time is always a mess but this is my favorite by far our daughter even eats from the bib when it catches her food! With others I have found they are harder to clean and take forever to dry or the pocket doesn't stay open to catch the mess. Great gift idea too for new moms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best bibs!","review":"I have a very messy 10 month old and we have tried every bib out there. Most bibs have a pocket at the bottom but there isn't any way to keep it open and every piece of food that my baby dropped would go straight in his lap. These bibs are shaped so that the pocket is always open and let me tell you it catches everything! Also these are SO easy to clean! Just wipe or rinse them off and you're good to go. I have never tried putting them in the dishwasher because they are so easy to clean by hand but it certainly is nice to know they are tough enough for that. You won't regret buying these and they really do last forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"I really wish Baby Bjorn would have started messing with products that used to be so good... I have a 9-year-old who had a similar bib when she was little, and we LOVED it. It was much softer, and much larger. It was completely round along the sides, without this weird S-shape, and it definitely caught more food.The newer models aren't as soft. The funky closure mechanism always gets my baby's hair caught in it (ouch!), and worst of all, the cut-out shape means food now ends up all around the bib, and not in the bib pocket where it should go. All my baby has to do is turn his head sideways to mess up.On the bright side, these bibs do wash really well. I've even stuck them in the dishwasher, and they came out just fine.So here's my plea to Baby Bjorn: RETURN YOUR OLD BIB STYLE BACK, PLEASE. They used to be much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hated it","review":"The bibs were far smaller than I thought, and the baby felt like choking.

We have been looking for the famous in 1970's Tommie-Tippee bib that sold for a couple bucks. This Bjorn bib is a high end copy. Unfortunately, it does not fit a child weighing 20 lbs. This bib is too short and the neck opening is too small for him. If some company makes one of these \\"second chance\\" bibs for a toddler who feeds himself, we'd love to find a bib that fits him. These Baby Bjorn we can not use. A lot of money for a bib that is too small. The size needs to be rated and made known to the buyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I purchased these bibs for my 6 month old son. The bibs, while easy to clean, are not big enough for an infant who is eating solids. They let food in under the chin onto his clothes. I have accidentally pinched him in the clasp. The bibs don't cover enough of him, so the food ends up on his clothes all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hated it","review":"Maybe should have started earlier than at nine months.

If you have a chubby baby do not waste you money in this ones since the neck part is very small it may work for small babies buy not for chubby babies or regular size babies. The material is to hard for them. Buy it only if your baby has a long neck or a very tiny neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"We didn't like it at all.","review":"We got one of these as a gift, but never successfully used it. The crumb catcher at the bottom prevents us from putting the highchair tray all the way back up next to the baby. But what's worse is our baby totally HATED it - would not wear it for anything. He was fine with any other kind of soft plastic or cloth bib - guess he hated the firmness of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The European Style \\"Pelican Bibs\\" are the BEST!","review":"After moving from the UK where you can buy bibs like this everywhere, I struggled to find anything comparable in the US stores. The ones I did find were expensive, messy and a pain to clean.The BabyBjorn bibs are wonderful!!They are easy to clean - either wipe or top shelf of dishwasher.Almost all of the food falls into the bib without a mess. My 1-year old daughter's clothes are now staying clean throughout her meal - before using these bibs, her clothes were food stained after every meal.I bought 3 of these bibs a couple of months ago. They have been used constantly and still look as good as new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Bjorn Soft Bibs","review":"These bibs really minimize the messes at mealtimes! The plastic allows spills to slide right down the front, and the built-in \\"trough\\" catches them. After feeding time, I just rinse off the bib or hand-wash it with some dishwash liquid and shake it dry.The adjustable strap around the neck fastens and opens easily and it adjusts to quite a wide range of sizes. These bibs have saved LOTS of laundry and I wouldn't be without them. They are comfortable enough that the baby does not mind wearing them and doesn't try to pull them off. Overall, I think this product is a real winner!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My twins HATE these.","review":"The clasp pinches if you try to get it on close enough to the chin to keep food from going down the neck, the crumb catcher doesnt fit above or below the highchair tray, and every time the bib shifts it yanks the baby in the neck. Every time we put them on the kids, they end up a teary, tortured mess. I cant believe so many people love these, we simply could not use them at all. After this we bought the Kinderville Silicone bibs which are softer, and that was a perfect solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bib Ever","review":"When I first saw these on Amazon I thought, wow they are not cute like all these nice bibs I got for my daugther. Let me tell you throw all the other bibs away! This bib, catches all the food that falls, is easy to wash, doesn't mildew and quite frankly the only bib we use. I just wish I would have found it earlier. My daughter is two and now eats cereal and milk and I don't have to worry about her clothes as this bib does it job. At first I thought wow pricey for a bib but worth every penny! We bought them over a year ago and they look still new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for my little guy","review":"I know that I'm in the minority here, but these bibs were not the best for my son. They are quite stiff and would get caught on the high chair tray quite often (we use the Chicco 360 high chair that attaches to the table top). The neck piece also doesn't seem too comfortable. I use fabric bibs that slip on over the head almost exclusively and they seem to be more comfortable as well as catch more of the mess around the arms/shoulders (he's learning to feed himself, so we have food everywhere!). I'm sure these work for some, but not for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bibs I've used","review":"My 1.5 yo daughter is a disaster zone when she eats - and the toughest thing was always breakfast. We eat cereal with milk, it would soak her bib (which over time with the cloth / superbibs would cause them to stink HORRIBLY even if you put them through the wash) and also the bib wasn't that good at catching the milk so it would also get her entire outfit wet (yeh, I wasn't that excited about changing her outfit right after I had just dressed her, so she often goes to daycare soaked in milk). Enter these bibs to the rescue! They catch all the milk, PLUS as an added bonus are very difficult for her to tear off herself (she can do it with enough effort, but it usually gives us enough time to step in and distract her). I am really impressed by the quality and design of these - I've been using a few months and can already see these will far outlast any of the superbibs we use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I figured with all the great reviews these bibs would be awesome. I feel like I really wasted my money. I used these with my daughter when she was around 6m old. She pulled it up and started chewing on the neck part. If I made it tighter she just tugged and tugged on it. Plus, I figured they would be bigger and a bit softer. They are too stiff and don't fit comfortably in front of her in between the tray and her body. She is now 13m and we still don't use them. Wish I could get back what I paid for them. The food pocket catcher is nice, but if it can't fit down between her and the tray it does no good. Now I'm searching for a good long-sleeved bib."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless - baby hates it and easily yanks it off","review":"These are going straight back to the seller. I was really disappointed that Baby Bjorn would stand behind such a pathetically designed bib that a 8 month old baby can EASILY, almost IMMEDIATELY yank it off. I am not sure if the strap around teh neck bother him or what but he immediately gets aggravated when I put it on him and proceeds to yank it off. These are not like the pocket bibs with the thicker strap around the back of the neck that snaps well into place. These have a very flimsy thin string that does not fasten well at all.

Because of their doubts, I took a few shots at it and my bbs easily went through the plastic parts from 20 feet away. I ended up having to take it away in pieces (after many hits) because the plastic could not hold up. The metal mess covering your eyes also dented from hits from bbs, but it didn't break from the hits. Also, my gun shoots at 400 fps which is decent, but you can find guns that shoot over 500 fps in games. Anyone who chooses to use this product should be careful because any good hit and it will break to some degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Mask but cheap","review":"Cool looking mask with great protection for the entire face. The wire mesh is a smart solution to the fogging up problem with other masks. But the \\"chain is only as strong as the weakest link\\", the rivets/buttons that hold the mouth portion to the goggles are made of cheap plastic. My son played two one hour games and three out of five rivets are gone. If you look at the stock photo on this site you can see for yourself that one rivet is missing from the right side of the goggles. You will never guess what country made this product, it has the letters c h i n a in it.

But it makes them explode on contact with the wire mesh. My friend shot me full auto in the face with his 300 FPS uzi. My eyes were sprayed with multiple plastic fragments. I think this should be reviewed by some safety organization and banned from the market. The area where I was hit by fragments got sliced up pretty good by the plastic bb fragments, I never knew that they could do this much damage. Buyer beware, do NOT buy this for your children!

When my son put the mask on it did fit his face but the elastic strap was so old it was completed dried out and had lost its elasticity. I was able to dig in my crafting supplies to create a new strap.The one thing that gets me is the original cost of this TOY (as it is described on the packaging) was $25? I truly doubt it.

This is a wonderful CD full of great combinations thats sure to help you put more interesting moves into the way you dance as well as workup a sweat. One of these reviews says something to the effects of \\"if you are looking for a bellydance workout try Suzanna Del Vecchio\\" I have both her workout tapes and I love them and would reccommend them, I would also reccommend Keti Sharif's Bodyquake I love that one too and in the same breath I would reccommend this one too!!

To me I can wake up and think do I feel like a strenuous workout or do I feel working up a sweat or do I feel like being sensuous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Entertaining","review":"I am fairly new to belly dancing and LOVE it! I have taken some classes, attended a workshop, and have purchased a couple of videos. I found Shamira's video to be the best of the ones I've seen. I do not understand why anyone would give this tape a negative review...it is easily the best of the instructional tapes that I've seen...and I've seen some of the ones mentioned in other reviews and they are NOT anywhere near as good as this tape.Shamira clearly demonstrates each move and her use of combinations is excellent. The video is well produced and well worth the price. I hope to some day dance half as well as Shamira!Happy dancing to all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"self-promotion, not dance instruction","review":"Low instructional value -- the artist seems to regard the genre of dance-instruction videotape as a means of self-promotion.Playing up major assets -- face and upper body -- results in a video next to useless for a student of BELLYdance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This is the best, most complete, most beautiful guide to meditation practice that I have ever seen.

Why?? because I gave it only two stars?? David can sing no doubt about that, but his stage performance was and is terrible on this dvd. I like most of his songs very much, but the way he is acting in front for a group over-aged screaming old women is awfull, sorry to say I know but it is the truth.For the music 4 starrs, for the picture 0 starrs, so an average of 2 starrs because it is a dvd and not a audio cd.Sorry fans, if you read my review of his Cherish album then you would know I am a fan, but I try to be honset, sorry again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Awesome! Mezmerising! Addicting!","review":"What can I say, this DVD of David is played over and over again. His voice is gorgeous, his moves OMG!!

This DVD is a must for all David Cassidy Fans! A MUST!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Best Thing to Being There","review":"This DVD is awesome!

Overall it does a great job--the sound quality is pretty good and the microphone works well. I especially like the pause feature for when I am transcribing the tapes. My only complaint is that this pause feature is hard to use when typing because of the shape of the recorder--if I set it on its side it is wobbly and falls down when I use the pause switch, while if I set it on its back so it won't fall over the pause switch cannot easily be flipped.

First of all, the theme is just the very old revenge clash with love type, like all of Kim Yong's fictions. This is among one of the unsuccessful Kim Yong stories. The best would probably be Condor Hero and Return of the Condor Heros. Book and Sword is good too. As for the TV series making, it's made for the naive audience.

The plot follows an early-30ish married, successful Londoner as his fiddling with his company's books result in the attention of Inland Revenue. Suddenly desperate to pay off the authorities and maintain his standard of living, he is forced into bed (yes, literally and figuratively) with Russian mafia/bizness concern, all of which leads to some silly tie-in with oil pipelines and British and American intelligence. What is much more interesting than all this, however, is the internal musing on the nature and uses of sex in the the protagonists' life. While there are some good bits here and there, I found it to be a rather annoying book in the end. This may be partially a result of my raised expectations after loving A White Merc With Fins so much. His next book, Dead Long Enough, was a rather mixed effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, I read this, why, I don't know.","review":"I won't go as low as hating it but I was stretching it by giving it two stars. More like 1 1/2. I never saw the movie so I have no idea which is better but if the big screen version was the same as the book, then I can understand why my friends said it was terrible and don't bother seeing it. This book was boring from page one. I'm one of those people who have to finish a book once I start reading it so I had no way out but to read to the end. The main character comes across as a complete nutter to be honest. A lonely nutter at that. He decides to befriend one of his customers who really wants nothing to do with the cable guy. As much as he tries, he can't rid himself of him though. And that's the whole plot of the book! Pretty exciting huh! NOT. Don't bother.

I have heard it said so many times that \\"children do not lie about these situations\\". This movie bears the fact that this just isn't true!

[i had just watched 2 1/2 french speaking films] if you wtched latter days you know that even God hates the french. ha. i was really happy to see that this movie is in black and white. had it been in color it would have lost a lot of what makes this movie great. based on a true story, the starkness reminds me a little of \\"Citizen cane.\\" the stories are not alike at all but the stark reality is there for both of them. this movie does not have the strange camera angles that c.k. had but the director makes a great movie with the light. this is a great movie and i thoroughly enjoyed it. we need more like this but would like to see more gay actors in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"very strange","review":"Though well acted, well directed, somehow it misses something. I don't agree with the message that protecting the true pedophile was a good thing, just because it would have hurt his widow.

Come on, Amazon, this isn't a gay film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"You don't know if this movie is meant seriously in some strange way or joking about a serious issue.

The story line was good, not as good as the novel, but I have yet to see a movie that's better than the book. I felt the actors were being carried through thier lines. They felt hollow and unconvincing to me. I felt that the relationship between Chris and Tommy should of been given more time on the film. To be thrown in to thier relationship, without decent actors, created an empty void for me. I also felt the Black & White aspect of the film degrated the film even further. It looked cheap and homemade. Though this topic is highly taboo in America today, it still should of been made to show how this type of \\"LOVE\\" truly begins and that all things aren't always as the seem to be on the surface. Thus breaking the darkness that surrounds people who love those how turly care about them. Regardless of gender, skin, or age difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to Innocence Another Way","review":"The good thing about this movie is the point it's making.And some of the cinematography was nice.The difficult subject matter at hand is in itself, well treated, but deserves a better herald than this movie.Its ultracheap production values and wooden performances, sometimes laughable when really they should be emotional moments, make this in a way a lamentable effort.The plot is too predictable and you end up watching the movie for the wrong reason.............."},{"rating":"1","title":"matb told it like it is","review":"Just an extremely bad movie with creapy actors that leaves you behind with a creepy feeling about the people that made the movie and you keep wondering what their intensions were."},{"rating":"2","title":"An example of independent cinema at its best","review":"Based on the subdued novel, which is a very good read, Return to Innocence tackles the issue of an alleged sexual abuse on a minor, with the unique spin of placing the man in the position of victim and the boy as aggressor. You really get a sense of the danger the man is in and you find yourself pulling for him during the trial. Richard Meese (the man) nails the sympathetic male role to perfection, while Andrew Martin (the boy) does a very convincing job at making you love and hate him at the same time. This film is not for everyone, but those of us who work amongst children as I do (teacher) will find this little film to be an educational tool in addition to its entertainment value. It is a well-crafted movie, and a true example of independent cinema at its best. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and well made","review":"This was a refreshing change of pace from the last 4 or 5 movies I have seen. RTI is a very entertaining movie. The acting was believable and the story held me down. But since I almost never give movies an \\"A\\" grade, I must say destructively that the film could have been polished up a bit. I noticed a few mistakes but I guess that is expected from a young director. I do however recommend the movie to any one interested in court cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Salutary Narrative","review":"For his directorial debut, Rocky Costanzo has chosen an uncommonly ambitious story that tries to comment on child abuse and the prejudices surrounding an intergenerational relationship. Unfortunately for him though, the screenplay by Gary Frazier touches on issues of homosexuality and pedophilia, which even in the hands of an experienced director may have been difficult to get across the factual emotions and reactions necessary to lift the film from the level of simple drama to that of extraordinary motion picture. Occasional missteps cause this film to get abandoned somewhere along the way, but despite its flaws, it is an affecting film and surprisingly good for someone's directorial debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"its a good start for a tackle box. made well but tackle is cheap but I didn't expect much more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tacle Box","review":"Very nice tackle box for a beginner or young child.

The author develops with mediocrity his theory applied to business, which he considers to be revolutionary, to the point that includes a manifesto at the end of the book. The true is that It lacks of real and strong examples of companies that have succeeded by implementing the strategy of preventing broken windows, or in other words have paid attention to small details.

It is an entirely just criticism, as this is possibly the most downbeat book on achieving business success that I've ever read. While the premise is intriguing, the actual substance of the book is pretty thin. Yes, we know that details are important and that the little things do matter. Yet, the author's idea of good business practice seems to be to obsessively micromanage every aspect of your business and of your employees' behavior.

Many times the author says that the customer \\"might\\" see something bad so they \\"might\\" think something bad and therefore won't do business with you again. the book would be more useful if it identified how many times \\"might\\" actually occurred and gave better examples.And then the section about \\"don't have broken windows in the first place\\" -- geez, if i knew how to avoid them, i would not have purchased the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and Poorly Constructed","review":"The theory Levine espouses in the book may have merit, but his case studies as well as his overall tone are at best tedious-- at worst pedantic and over simplistic.There are many more better books to read with related subject matter, like \\"The Tipping Point\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Needed Book!!

I am sure the result is hugely entertaining.Great sets, costumes and,overall, persuasive acting. I agree with the comment that the writing could be sharper and Corky's Irish accent is a little off, but Copper's head on confrontation with the harsh, often desperate, poverty endured by the immigrants, and characters who are flawed, complex people who feel real, pulled me in. I didn't feel the plot was unfocused--I particularly like the abrupt transitions from violence to tenderness and vice versa. And the mystery of Corky's lost family helped tie in several subplots, including an abortionist's murder and a child prostitute's precocious love for Corky.Overall, I give this a big recommend. Every episode unveiled (sometimes unnerving) surprises, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"a stellar creation from historic inspiration","review":"I have been very impressed by this series! I live in rural Alaska and stream movies and TV shows for evening entertainment. This series not only continued the 5 Points scenario created by Daniel Day Lewis & Leonard DeCaprio, but actually taught me more history of this time period concerning the Civil War draft of the Irish, Southern arms coming from France, and of course the fragility of Lincoln's presidency.

Comes across as being very Deadwood with slightly less violence, sex and language. But can be graphic too (murder of a pedophile might be too much for the sensitive viewer). Characters are not always good people (a man looking for his wife still sleeps with the local madam who has some serious \\"territory\\" issues!). However, they are always interesting and make you wonder what makes them tick. They are good TV/good story telling. The episode with who killed the local dentist had a wonderful twist! Ends on a cliffhanger making you want to watch season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copper Season 1","review":"This is old old fashioned police work. I'm a big fan of police shows and detective shows in general, but this one is even better because the detectives actually detect instead of waiting for the lab results to come in and then going after someone like in CSI which is starting to wear on me. There are some old style police beatings too, so be prepared for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"We looked forward to this show with great anticipation. After 3 episodes it became repetitive. The show did not seem to get beyond the shock of having a little girl want to be a prostitute. Nothing interesting about showing a little girl in the sex trade.

Read, \\"How the Irish Became White\\" and watch COPPER in that context and see how much riskier COPPER is in it's portrayal and though \\"stylized\\" starts to deal with the history of America similar to the book.

Honestly I didn't think Disney did a good job on this film. Characters were left out and I didn't like how they merged \\"The Book of Three\\" and the \\"Black Cauldron\\" together. They changed some of the events a bit which didn't make sense to me and the movie seemed rushed, especially when it came to finding the black cauldron. I think this film would of done better as a live action movie, such as Disney's sucsessful \\"Narnia\\". And it could have been done in parts, since the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexandre consists of 5 books. 6 including \\"The foundling\\". Another thing I didn't like was that the movie was too dark, too scary for children to enjoy.I think I would of enjoyed the film more if I have never read the books.

Magical and full of atmosphere, it is one of the best feature animations of the past twenty years. If you like the mystic and medieval, you are in for a treat. I was very disappointed by The Sword in the Stone, mosly because many of the sequences not essetial to the telling of the story was too long and tiring for my taste. The Black Cauldron helped me fill the gap made by that film. It is a quite dark and fast-paced film, and it includes some of disney's early experiments with computer animation. It may not be the most stunning film in terms of visuals or story, but it is a highly entertaining experience with wonderful characters and places, and definetly worth the watch. If you liked Robin Hood or Alice in Wonderland, you might as well enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"what no bluray edition ... for shame.","review":"This movie was a disaster for the Disney studio. Granted it didn't have any song and dance numbers - the books were dark in tone and style and the movie for the most part reflected that. The prior DVD edition also suffered from a terrible looking print. Given the fact that this film was the last Disney film processed in Super Technirama 70mm, you'd never guess that from how they transferred the film to home video. It's also quite telling that the studio doesn't have any faith in the movie... now... since it's very unlikely that this will be released on hidef bluray.

There are a few funny and scary moments, but for the most part this feature leaves a bad aftertaste.

Instead, the movie consisted of very loud rumbles, crashes, special effects. The characters were one-dimensional lacking any warmth or depth.

However it is really nothing like the 5 books of the Chronicles of Prydain. These books are much more amazing than the movie. The books have many more characters that you never see in the movie, the movie has scenes which NEVER happen in the book. However I give it 4 stars because 1) It IS a good movie still and 2) Because of the fact that the movie is different than the books it kind of creates its own story which is unique and by watching this movie you don't ruin the experience of the Chronicles of Prydain because you can still read the books and they are basically a very different story.

Then they took one of the series major heroes, Gurghi, changed him from an undersized bigfoot into this waist high dust mop with a Donald Duck voice. I remember talking one of my friends into seeing this with me in high school, he was just like dude-wtf? And I remember saying, I'm really sorry John, I didn;t know they were going to do this, the books are really cool.Anyway, this is a mortal sin from Disney.

While most Disney animations go through continuous change up to the end, they have never been \\"completed\\" and then \\"re-cut.\\" The original version was a bit to scary for the suits at the studio.

I like how the cute characters in the film, like Gurgi and Hen Wen, are ESSENTIAL to the plot, not thrown in just for the sake of having something cute (like in many a Disney film).

I have always been really into fantasy, and remember watching the Black Cauldron as a kid-- alongside the animated versions of the Hobbit and LOTR.

An F- Grade for the paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"dogs and kids love it","review":"This is my australian shepherds third one. We take it to the park and even the little kids can pop that ball out for him. It is so much fun for the younger children who can't master the sling shot that my dog also loves. With this they just stomp it or jump on it and the ball pops out. It does not send the ball flying a long distance but has provided my dog and all his little friends with hours of safe and uncomplicated play. I highly recommend this toy for little ones and their dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic documentary!!!","review":"I have watched Pirates of Silicon Valley first, then i learned that it is loosely based on this documentary. I found Triumph of the Nerds truly fascinating. Robert Cringley has access to many of the great geniuses and visionaries of Silicon Valley, he is knowledgeable and able to ask the right questions. The great thing is that many of the people interviewed are still around today so you can validate their claims and statements that they made a few decades ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"This is a great 3 part series on how the personal computer went from blinking lights on the Altair to a common occurance in every household.It is fun to watch and surprising at how the rise of the personal computer paralells the smartphone/tablets that are popular today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for anyone that uses computers","review":"Objective, authoriative and enlightening. What a story. A history of the personal computer industry that explains the humble beginings of such computing greats as Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Gates, Ellison, Jobs and Wozniac. A great show to watch with the children. Educational, entertaining and just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! A must see for anyone using a Mac or Wintel Pc.","review":"This is the history of computers condensed. You get a good grasp of what happened between Microsoft and Apple. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are interviewed. Key players at Xerox and Ibm are also interviewed. This is a very informative documentary but lacks, the personal story telling appeal of the Pirates of Silicon Valley (a must have vhs tape that dramaticizes this documentary). This Dvd pretty much explains how it is we came to using mice and file folders and pictures instead of boring command line text entries. It's a great documentary. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"The last volume of this excellent set ended off with a quiet bang. I really enjoyed all of the interviews with the influential players in the world of the nerds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love those nerds!","review":"If you're fascinated by computers and haven't seen Triumph of the Nerds, it's a 1994 documentary you should not miss. It tells the story of the development of the personal computer @ 1970s, and the birth of the IBM PC and the Mac through the '80s to the mid-'90s. And, there are interviews with some of our favorite nerds, Steve Jobs (Apple), Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer (Microsoft), and Oracle's bad boy, Larry Ellison. Not only is it interesting but it's fun looking back and seeing the way these guys evolved. I guess it was no surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary and entertaining documentary","review":"I remember seeing this on PBS. I didn't want to spend three hours watching this, so I didn't plan on viewing the program. But as chance would have it, I tuned in about a half hour into the program and I was absolutely hooked! I made sure to watch the entire broadcast when it was re-run. All the biggies are interviewed here - Gates, Allen, Jobs, Woz, etc. Cringley is very entertaining.I liked the show so much, I taped the entire program on a VHS tape.

Sadly, so is the used VHS copy I purchased. Maybe it was once available on VHS uneditted but not anymore. Beyond the scenes already mentioned as missing, additional scenes include more background on the Mac team and Steve Job's recruitment for the team; early discussions at Apple to make the Mac open source; and an extended scene about the \\"Microserfs\\". By my count there are 21 edits (large and small) which add an additional 15 to 20 minutes. I see no reason for the edits since they could easily fit on a videotape or stereo DVD. I am guessing Bob thought he improved the pacing of this program by the edits and a few are more \\"politically correct.\\" But I am still waiting for the full version. In the meantime, I will keep my old broadcast edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don\`t buy","review":"this book have not very much pictures and isn\`t very informative, apart of that it was very bad scratched, and I can\`t tell if was in the shipping or from the buyer"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Tunes","review":"The Comfies \\"Close to me\\" is for lovers of Squeeze and Guster.

As a Christian, I was very offended for the author to claim to be THE intrepeter of God's word.The information presented is very minimalistic, concerning itself only with the basic conception and birth process. The author's only attempts to address children's questions about sexual feelings, masturbation, homosexuality, etc. is a simplistic \\"I (the author, speaking for God) say it is a sin.\\"The author, quite forcefully, attempts to replace parental responsibility of instilling morality in children, with preaching his own views, evangilizing that to not follow his views is sinful and punishable by eternal damnation. He even goes so far as to mock the Supreme Court of the United States!Highly recommended to avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate Illustrations","review":"I felt that some of the illustrations in this book were too advanced for my 11-year-old. \\"Almost 12\\" would lead me to believe that it is geared towards ten and eleven year olds. I don't think an 11-year-old needs to see an illustration of a woman giving birth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Christians Only","review":"I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was so oriented toward a strict religious view of sex. I believe it is detrimental to children developing today to have so many \\"forbiddens\\" and to teach them that sexual orientations different from the norm are wrong. This book tries to take the parent's place and teach morals directly to the child. If you buy the book, make sure to read it before giving it to your child to read, you may find out your child is learning exactly the opposite of what you want him or her to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to small","review":"I enjoyed this book in it's audio version so I had put it on my wish list.

I suggest the regular size edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom:Practical & Spiritual Steps","review":"This book -- 3 inches by 3 inches -- is just a joke. I could not believe a version of this book is selling. I bought this book with the hope it was like the regular book since I have seen the reviews of it and maybe did not pay much attention to the details of the book on the internet at the time of purchase. It is impossible to conceive that Suze Orman would publish a book like this to deceive people into buying it to make money. The outside and cover looks like the real book but the content just had an outline of the 9 steps. I was disappointed when I received the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very helpful","review":"I thought this book was fabulous. I appreciate that as other reviewers said, Orman spends much of the book getting us to understand our ideas about money. Everyone views money differently, as a result of various experiences in our lives. It's not until we understand how we treat money, that we can change our habits about it.There is of course practical money suggestions as well. I found the section about wills/trusts/life insurance to be the most helpful. She spells out the difference between a will and a trust, in simple language that makes it easy for all readers to understand. Furthermore, while I found hints on many things to change in my outlook, I was also very heartened by the things that I am doing right!If you're looking for a book that is entirely practical information,then don't turn here first. However, I strongly encourage you to go through the psychology examples she uses here, and you will indeed be closer to financial freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but...","review":"Suzie is great but this video is too \\"skim the surface\\".

Your library will have it or something comparable. Now, a warning. This book was written by a woman who believes that money is the most important thing in life. I'm not making that up. In fact, those are practically her exact words (see the introduction). So if you just want to be the next ignorant SUV-driving capitalist, this may be the book for you. If, however, you view financial security as more of a necessary evil than one of the joys of life, pass on this book and go consult an officer at your bank branch.

The book gets you to look at your financial education...how you were brought up with respect for money. That is what it is all about. It is not how much you make but how much you keep and what you let that grow into. This book really helps you understand that caring about your money does not make you greedy but it is responsible. This book teaches you not only how to get your financial house in order but also how to incorporate it into all aspects of your life without going crazy.

Her wisdom is amazing and her message is clear. So clear that it may be viewed by some as simple. But thats the trick. Her message is simple ....so simple its too complex to those of us who have become materialistic or worldly.I recommend you read or listen to her message.I believe Suzie is a great coach, teacher, and mentor.The time and money you spend on her material may be the best investment you've ever made because you're making the investment in yourself.Thank you Suzie.

Basic investing is explained from IRAs, to money-market and mutual funds in simple terms but without condescending to the reader.

There are many money-saving tips as well and advise on estate planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"9 steps to financial freedom","review":"Good information and easy to read.

This book focuses on alot of spiritual nonesense, but forgets about the practical aspect of financial freedom. Don't waste your money.

So baby boomers if your gen x kids are swimming in debt from student loans hand more money to charities and places of worship and don't \\"lose power\\" by helping your kids.

Is this book concise, well written and to the point, a no nonsense primer on achieving financial stability? Yes it is. Does Orman pander to the lowest common denominator, i.e. those with virtually no financial acumen? In my opinion, yes she does.I recently read an interview with Orman in the Wall street Journal where she claimed that of her $25 million in net worth she only has a million in the stock market. That's 4%. Most financial experts would assert that's way too little. But Orman's not an investor, she's a common sense lady with a brass tacks approach to money, and it serves her well.And I just read a book I like even better than Suze. Dave Barry's \\"Money Secrets\\" contains a dead on skewering of Orman.

She encourages us to capture a money memory from our past that has changed our perceptions about spending, and to move beyond them. Ms. Orman teaches us that money is a living thing, to be nurtured and respected so it can grow-- what a practical and profound insight!

The best, by far, was Investing for the Financially Challenged by Walter Updegrave, an expert from Money Magazine.

What a letdown. The boys spend about 2 pages of the book on the AT and the entire time they spend whining about how hard it is. The scene quickly shifts to a small town where we get a \\"mystery\\" about a stolen armored car. Sure, you could hide an armored car in someones barn with EVERYONE in the town knowing about it and get away with it. The Appalachian Trail is such a perfect setting for a mystery how could it be wasted on this lousy story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted character study","review":"Marber's skill in the mechanics of writing drama is the some of the most solid I've come across. The arc of the play isn't very broad, but the dissolution of the main character, Howard Katz, is compelling and disturbing. Although Marber does descend into philosophical/spiritual soliloquies, something I am not terribly fond of in drama, and Katz's redemption is unconvincing, the play as a whole is quite engaging.

If you never had a Helstar CD, i would recommend Nosferatu first, then this one. I think Nosferatu is a little more polished. Distant Thuder still rocks completely, so don't get me wrong.

In my opinion reviews really get down to personal views and feelings and we are all different. Having said that I have just watched this movie for the 4th time in as many years. I still feel as strongly about this movie as I did when I watched it for the first time. Apart from giving an insight into the difficult decisions the Presidents of the USA had to make and their reasons for the decisions (and we would all love the advantage of hindsight), I wonder whether any of our political leaders have learned the lessons of Vietnam. It seems that the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are mirror images of what is displayed in this movie. Path to War is a gripping and intense lesson in the futility of war.

It seemed a great leap forward from both Schmoelling's work with TD, but also from his (also excellent) first solo effort; \\"Wiuvend Riet\\".Consequently I was not as eager to buy this re-release as some who had been unable to find the original, but being something of a completist regarding TD and the solo work of the members, I decided I had to have it.What a disappointment!

Really, if you like emotional rock music at all and can deal with intense screaming, I guarantee this will touch you. This is an album that truly spans the spectrum of emotions, from the usual hardcore anger, despair, and claustrophobic fear, through serenity, hope, and ultimately heroic triumph (if you want to hear that last, listen to \\"A will remains in the ashes,\\" or the album standout and one of my all-time favorite songs, \\"Go mad and mark.\\" An almost entirely major key hardcore song!)In closing, buy this record immediately: you'll be supporting true artists, giving yourself an amazing emotional experience, discovering a future classic, and changing the way you think about music, and probably life."},{"rating":"2","title":"financial analysis","review":"What is missing from this book is Cd-rom containing all excel illustrations and questions used in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written book.","review":"This book is horrible if you do not have the basic understanding of finance or excel.

You'll have to find out if it is true or not by watching, because my lips are sealed.Performances like Mr. Hawke's make you wonder if he got his Oscar nod for the wrong movie.

It's as if the director were making scenes, instead of a coherent movie. So, what you get are bits and pieces of a story, but nothing you can enjoy as a whole. Loved the cave setting for the climax, but the jungle scenes are so similar, it looks as if they were all filmed on one acre of land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was very weak.","review":"I did not like this movie at all. It was very weak in all departments. I would not recommend to any friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for storage","review":"These are fine for storage, but I got tired of having to pour into other bottles to feed. I found the Avent pump conversion kit online and bought that. With it, I can screw the Avent bottles I use to feed my baby right onto the shields. That was a better buy than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful for storage","review":"i use this to store breastmilk so my husband can feed the baby. i also use the bottles to freeze breastmilk. its great because its compatible for the medela pump but my baby isnt that fond of the nipples. i end up using the avent for feeding and transfer the milk from the medela. buy this if you are planning on storing a lot of milk. otherwise you are better off with avent or gerber new traditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wanted bottles...","review":"not nipples and rings and caps... a set of 10 bottles that can be used for freezer storage too. Now I don't have to buy the freezer bags anymore, unless I am storing A LOT of milk.I have heard the nipples, etc. that come with this set don't work well. If you want to be able to feed from the bottles that come with your medela pump, the Evenflo Elite line has a nipple and ring that fit these bottles. They come in different flow rates too. I always keep one with the pump in case I suddenly have a hungry baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great","review":"I love these bottles, granted I don't use all the stuff they come with it, I have my own nipples and rings. But I love the bottles and caps. I use them to freeze and store my breastmilk for daycare and they are sturdy and compact. Also, I just have to defrost them and they are ready to use. That's why I chose not to use bags, they seemed like too much trouble- I would rather pay the extra money and have plenty of bottles. I have been using these bottles since I got home from the hospital and would bottle feed him from time to time. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't use all the accessories, otherwise I would have said 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I used this set with the Medela Pump in style for my daughter (now 20 months) and am about to purchase it again for number two. I went back to work when my daughter was 5 months, but breastfed her till she was 11 months, so had lots of experience with the set, which was small convenient, easy to use and interchangeable with other niples and bottles for when she got older. My only complaint is that I culdn't buy a steam steriliser to accompany the set (as you can with Avent systems) as boiling the bottles every day was a real chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive!","review":"I wish I had not bought these BEFORE I really had experience with pumping and feeding, didn't know what I needed and just got the set that goes with the pump. This week I went to my nearby ...store and bought *16* 4 oz Evenflo bottles ...- no nipples but I don't need too many more. I don't see the Evenflo bottles on the site, sorry. My 5 wk old baby is also having some issues with these nipples, as noted by the other reviewers below."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lids and Nipples LEAK constantly, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I bought a Medela pump (love it!) and some bottles came with it. I also bought an extra set of bottles. It was a complete waste of money. I am telling you - these bottles leak out of the top between the o-shaped lid and the nipple. DO NOT BUY THEM! If you're concerned about freezer storage, just buy the Medela pump and save bags, they work great. For pumping, you can attach almost any bottle and store those in the fridge. Seriously, this is such a hassle. You can't take these bottles anywhere without spilling all over and you don't want to mess with them at 3 a.m. when they're dumping milk all over you child, trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for feeding","review":"These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely. My baby hates them for feeding, however. I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles. I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast. Um, no. Take one look at them and it's pretty clear. My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth. She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples, however. Much, much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent set","review":"I do like this set. I have recently had to stop breastfeeding, but I still sterilize and use the bottles for mixing formula, but I know that my daughter will outgrow them soon (the bottles are only 5 oz.). My only issue with the set are the nipples... they are okay, they seem a little too flexible. My daughter sort of twists them up in her mouth and seems to get a lot more air than when we use the nipples the hospital gave us. However, the collars and caps are very convenient. All in all, not a bad purchase, even if i was only able to breastfeed for 6 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper alternatives available.","review":"The bottle quality isn't great for the price. Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style. So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles. I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product.","review":"These worked very well for us. Now that our daughter is much older we still use them - freeze water in them and use to ice knee or achilles and arch (can roll it) - makes for an excellent massage/icer post nursing use."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby bottles","review":"we used these bottle because they are compatible with the medela pump. the 5oz capacity is much better than the tiny 2oz ones. my wife was very happy when they came. I would check to make sure these don't have bisphenol A (BPA), we didn't know about back when we got them. fast shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle!","review":"I am a working mom who pumps and feeds my son from the bottle. He had a problem with spitting up. We bought 2 of these when I was going back to work so that we could have bottles at home for the day and I could take some to work. The nipples turned out to be the best that we have tried yet! They take a little getting used to because the baby has to put his whole mouth on it and get his lips in the little grooves, but once they get used to it they were wonderful! The hole being on top of the nipple keeps him from gulping so much and solved his spitting up problem. I haven't had any problems with leaks or anything. I love that it came with the solid caps AND the caps with the pop out middle for the nipple AND the nipple cover. We didn't buy them online so we paid a little more than the price here. I still think they are a great value. I will buy more and this time get them for the online price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for pumping and storage, bad for feeding","review":"I have a medela \\"pump in style\\" breastpump, so I use this set daily. It is great for pumping and for storage, but I can't use these nipples for feeding because the milk comes out of the nipple much to quickly (even though they claim to be \\"low flow\\" nipples). I had to buy Nuk's low flow nipples instead, and they have worked well with this set. So if you use this set, I would suggest buying other low flow nipples to use with it. Other than that, the set works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary","review":"Don't bother with these. They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary. It is much easier to buy storage bags. If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.They also flow too fast for newborns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but leaky the bottles aren't the best","review":"I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right? Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding. Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now). I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage. I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for storage","review":"These are great for pumping and storing. Am very happy with them in that respect but baby did have problems feeding from this bottle so we went to the Avent for feedings. So basically we only use the bottles and screw on lids and that is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for pump & storage, but useless nipples","review":"I use these to pump & store my milk with the Medela Harmony pump. Each bottle is the perfect amount for 1-2 feedings for my 6-week old baby. But the nipples are worthless---not shaped like me in the least (and probably like no one!)--my husband tried them once while I was away (when we first bought them) and she hated them. Instead we pour the milk into a Playtex drop-ins system bottle with the big slow-flow nipple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonerful Product","review":"I love these bottles!

It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro!

Instead, I found this book a dry theoretical 1236 page tome that is long on theory, and impossibly organized. Even if I know the exact name of the Javascript function/command/object, I had to page through multiple sections to locate it. There is no tutorial and in my experience this book is impossible to use without reading the whole thing.

It is about a girl whose name is Bambi. Although her name is irrelevant, it's almost as simple as the storyline in the book. Most of the novel was pretty unbelievable. And if you're anything like me, the last thing that I want to torture myself with is characters for which you hold no regards and storyline which is barely even reasonable. Although the book offers some very far and few between page turning moments, there is nothing in this novel for which I'd truly reccomend. Unless you are a devout follower of the 'Hood Book' genre, this is something you can afford to pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love Really Does Happen....","review":"It took me 2 days to read The Glamorous Life, and because I'm such a Nikki Turner fan, that's about average. Most of her books usually take me a day or two. I can officially say that Nikki Turner has done it again.... In this book you find everything from love, betrayal, and finding true love again. When you first start reading the book you actually say out loud, \\"Oh, no he didn't\\"! Then you keep reading and your like, \\"You go girl\\"! By the time you get to the last page you're ready to call Nikki herself and ask her why she left you hanging like that....This book is begging for a continuance! Nikki Turner is undeniably the Queen of Hip Hop Fiction!!!!

I can't begin to say how disappointed I was, the storyline was weak and plain over the top. If you've read one of these so called street books, you've read them all. Goldigging women seeking a hustler, and quite frankly it's getting boring. I'm amazed that people actually like this ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint peeling is more exciting","review":"When I saw this book had almost 5 stars I thought it might be worth the money. I was so wrong. This book is lacking suspense. T This one I put down several times. The ending was good but not worth my time or money. Not only that but I felt as though I was reading a novel written by an 10th grader. At best it was forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Again","review":"I gave Ms.Turner 1 Star for the pretty cover. This book does not measure up to the dozen of great writers.

After her relationship with Reggie ends, Bambi becomes a very successful event/party planner which leads some unlikely characters her way who attempt to set her up for a fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Playa-Playa!!","review":"Bambi is a young girl that has been sheltered from the cold, cruel world of being used by men because her mother has schooled her from day one. Use them before they can use you. But, youth plays its hand and she gets caught up, but like a 'real black woman' she picks her face up and plays the game like its supposed to be played. Enter an OG that likes what the package before him, and despite a preceding rep tries her out for starters. It's a fantastic voyage, but like life as we all know, one day you have to wake up.This book has a good story line, but it could have stood to have a little more meat and cheese. But, all in all, it's still a great read! Good job Ms. Turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"The Queen of Hip Hop Fiction has graced her readers with another guided tour into the world of the playas and those who get played.

However the plot was to much like trash tv for my liking complete with homo-thugs, drug dealers, baby mamas, ect. The characters' actions were unbelievable and the plot, such as it was, too inconceivable. This book could have used better proofreading i.e. refering to God as \\"he\\", when it should read \\"He\\" or \\"Him.\\" I am sure this book will appeal to those find designer lable name dropping, \\"shot-calling\\", \\"gaming\\" and hustling \\"glamorous.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read!","review":"This book was good. I read it in a day, and then wanted more to read from Nikki Turner. She is truly the QUEEN of Ghetto Faboulous books.

The struggles and underlying themes are the same: karma, because what goes around comes around, hold your man down for whatever because if he sets you up you move on, but remember hold yourself down while staying in full length furs, and get all of someone else's money for the best revenge.Maybe I'm spoiled after reading Mina's Joint but I don't feel the love and passion between Turner's characters in any of her books. All I get from them is that they are about a hustle. Hustle him, them, work, blah blah blah. She makes love a hustle because drugs are involved.I'm not trying to say anyone is copying anyone but what's up with the few sentences about Bambi having a sister named Yarni. Hustler's Wife didn't make much of an impression on me but that's the name. At least the sisters can bond over their experiences of hustling.

Also, some words differ from Oxford and Norton editions. If you're buying this for a class, you might want to choose a different collection of Donne poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate table of contents, poems run together","review":"This does seem to be a complete Kindle collection of Donne's poems, and they are properly laid out on the page (ie they do not run together like prose, as happens in some Kindle editions of poetry). But the table of contents takes the reader only to the first poem of different sections of the collection. Although each section has its own table of contents, these are not interactive - so that the only way of finding a specific poem in this big collection is to go to the beginning of the relevant section and then go through it page by page. Also, there are no page breaks - or sometimes even line breaks - between the poems, so that the title of one poem appears immediately after the last line of the previous one. This is the kind of mediocre editing that, in 2011, would barely be acceptable in a free edition, and certainly not for a book for which the editors are asking $3.99 . I hope they correct these errors and issue an updated version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate","review":"I can only second what an earlier reviewer has said: the poems are here, but the table of contents is inadequate -- it does not link to individual poems -- and there are no stanza breaks, everything just runs together.

It's full of atmosphere with moments of weirdness and beauty. Medeski sticks with the keyboards, allowing shipp to handle the acoustic keys. This is really what helps the album to be so enjoyable, neither of these guys take it over. Parkers bass is thumping and dancing all over this cd.

The term \\"fairy stories\\" is something of a misnomer, however, as no true fairies appear or even make cameos. Instead, these stories tend to take something from nature (e.g. The Ugly Caterpillar) or something from tradition (e.g. The Discontented King) and spin these people, animals or objects into a nice anecdote to read with your little ones. And the illustrations are gorgeous!Highly recommended if you like vintage kids books and stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Schlosser has done it again","review":"Wow, what an excellent and well-written book.

What's even more interesting is that as people opt out of paying-- they still expect benefits from the system, e.g. health care, subsidized college tuition, retirement monthly checks.

Reefer Madness (\\"RM\\") falls far short of that standard, though.In essence, RM is a collection of what should really be three magazine articles. Further, some examples/stories are stretched out so long that it seems that the author is just trying to fill up space.For example, the longest section of the book is supposedly about the Porn industry. RM spends so much time on the story of a particular Porn businessperson that the book seems more like a bio of his life than a study of the underground Porn economy.RM claims to be about the huge underground/black market economy, but, the three sections (pot, migrant workers & Porn) seem largely unconnected. The book has no cohesive thesis or point.On the plus side, the author is a skilled storyteller and he does a good job of telling the stories of the players in the different industries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Work By Schlosser","review":"With Reefer Madness, Eric Schlosser provides us with another extraordinary piece of reporting. This work is well documented (a large number of pages are deveoted to notes and references) and is a compelling, hard to put down read. Perhaps the most important theme that unifies the three essays in this book is how the US Government manipulates the moral and legal arguments for or against an issue (legalizing marijuana or cheap farm labor, for example) in order to meet its needs or agenda.

I'm not much of a fiction reader, but once I read the two page preface, I was hooked. Commander Johnson has put together a marvelous story of adventure, mixed with love, intrigue, and how Long John Silver manipulated hundreds of pirates and Colonial patriots into doing his bidding to find and take back the treasure of Dead Man's Chest. I was especially taken with the 1777 transcript of the Royal Navy Admiralty Court of Inquiry that formed the foundation of this amazing epic adventure. I recommend Dead Man's Chest to everyone who likes a great yarn, and truly hope this important literary work makes it to the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Journey!","review":"I've always loved adventure stories about pirates and treasure and now to have the story of Treasure Island continue is a real treat!

The deadly cutthroat must form an alliance with his teenage nephew and Captain John Paul Jones, who just might be more dangerous than any wanted criminal, to retrieve a staggering ransom of gold and jewels from the \\"Dead Man's Chest\\".

I still gave this product 2 stars, 1 for the absorbancy, and 1 because they are a good idea and great to have on hand. I keep them in the top drawer of my son's changing table and like to throw them on top of the changing pad cover when I know I'll be getting into more than just a wet diaper.

A good summer beach book or airplane read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overview of the Presidents","review":"Taranto provides concise and generally well-written critical biographies of the presidents (Washington to Clinton) written by authorities on each, along with an interesting ranking created by a wide range of academics and other professionals. Most rankings tend to be either fawning or condemnatory; this is neither. Likewise with the biographies. In most cases, the good and bad on each man is well presented. I very much enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rife With Right-Wing Bias","review":"You don't need to be any sort of left-winger to see that this book is heavily slanted in a conservative direction. The fact that one editor is from the WSJ, one from the Federalist Society, and the introduction by William J. Bennett is kind of a giveaway. The polling they conducted may have been more even handed, because the numerical ranking of Presidents fairly typical. But the essays provided by such conservative icons as Robert Bork, Lynne Cheney, Ken Starr, Peggy Noonan, and Fred Barnes generally go out of their way to point out the flaws in Democratic presidents like FDR, Clinton, Wilson, and pay glowing homage to Republicans like Reagan. If you're a regular Fox News viewer, this may be what you're looking for, but if you appreciate objectivity this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book sets out to establish the factors that make a President great and fails miserably in its task. While a few of the essays were written by well-known scholars, the vast majority are authored by people I (and probably you) never heard of.My biggest criticism is that the book lacks a coherent theme. Instead the reader is confronted with a poorly edited collection of essays that bounce around from President to President without any real structure or connecting theme, which you would think is supposed to be \\"What makes a President great?\\" The book is a good idea, but the editors seem to have just taken what was given to them and not put much effort into the project. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"This book has potential, but unfortunately fails to meet it. This book can?t seem to decide whether it wants to be a popular work or a scholarly one and, as a result, fails at both. Nor can the book seem to decide whether it is a series of essays on the presidents, an analysis of leadership characteristics, or a rating of presidencies. The section devoted to ranking the presidents is the section of the book that merits the most praise. Unfortunately it is far and away the smallest part of the book and the editors relegated it to an appendix. Putting aside the conservative bent of the authored pieces, the essays lack any cohesion ranging from a clear grab for a popular audience in the inclusion of media darling John McCain to scholarly professors like Jeffrey Tulis to seemingly obscure David Rivkin and Mark DeLaquil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Perspective","review":"Most of the analysis in this book is right on the money. The way that the book is organized makes it easy and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Overview of Presidential History","review":"This is a good book for anyone wanting a nice way to get familiar with our former presidents while only having to read just a few pages of material each. I just wish the book was better referenced for the parts I would like to get more information about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliff's Notes on the Presidency","review":"James Taranto and Leo Leonard?s assessment of the presidency is somewhat disappointing. The book gives a shallow coverage of each of the presidents and does not sufficiently analyze the role of the presidency with any objective criteria. The book appears to have been put together rather hastily and falls short both in biography and in analysis. In short, it most closely resembles a Cliff?s Notes on the presidency. I would recommend the book for younger readers who wish to gain a quick, general idea of our past presidents, but would recommend Jeffrey Cohen?s book on the presidency for the more sophisticated reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely biased...","review":"I found this book recommended on some website and the premise sounded interesting so I thought I would read it. While the rankings seem unbiased, the essays on each President are incredibly skewed towards the right. Every small government, Republican President is highly praised regardless of his failures during his administration, while every liberal President is heavily criticized, regardless of his successes. This book would have been a lot better if the authors of each essay were not all conservatives plugging their own ideology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exercise in Futility","review":"James Taranto's book starts with a premise that it cannot defend: the idea that presidents can be \\"rated\\" in a sequential order of quality, as if historical leaders are reducible to the same status as restaurants or beauty-pageant contestants. The book attempts a tone of objectivity that I found fatuous under the surface. Taranto's M.O. seems to be to affect the role of disinterested observer while engaged in the thick of political battle. The section on Reagan is pure hagiography, and you get the sense that Taranto and co. would like nothing less than to see the faces of Mt. Rushmore replaced with four Reagans. I would recommend this book only for those who regard presidents with idolatry rather than seeing them in the context of the times in which they lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it pretends to be","review":"If you are looking for a studied, objective, serious analysis of presidential leadership, do not buy this book. If you want to see how some scholars will prostitute their intellects, read it with careful interest. Although it disguises itself as one thing -- a work of history and high-minded criticism -- it is quite another. You will find factual inaccuracies, pre-conceived conclusions, falacious and sometimes comical reasoning, and in the end a snapshot of 43 political leaders taken through a purely right-wing filter. Perhaps one illustration will suffice. In the section on George W. Bush, the author recounts his subject grabbing Laura Bush from behind to feign placing her hands in wet cement during a dedication ceremony. To Bush, this was reportedly hilarious, to the author evidence of an admirable measure of self-confidence. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative","review":"I bought this book expecting to find a fair and balanced view of the Presidency.

It puts Ronald Reagan 6th all time! Absolutely absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criteria for greatness","review":"This book attempts to compare presidential performances which, because of luck (good and bad), preexisting circumstances, and the passage of time, are fundamentally incommensurable. Consequently, the ratings that are one of the book's highlights lack authority. Still, the exercise has value. The quality of the writing is almost uniformly excellent, albeit tilting toward the rightward side of the political spectrum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my you-know-what","review":"Bought this item a few years ago when I was having hip pain.

I remember being captivated almost immediately by the story of a young girl just a little bit smarter and more alive to the possibilities of the world around her than her kinfolk were -- there's a scene in which she and other kids her age are dancing around and shrieking next to a barn, and something -- sunset? a bonfire? -- throws their elongated shadows against the side of the barn. Such an amazing, powerful image. Sadly -- and this just rang so true -- being a little bit smarter was not enough to save her.

A young woman had surgery on her eyes and when they took the bandages off they installed blue glasses in her eyes so as to adjust to light before putting the clear ones in. But something went wrong, either with the surgery or the glasses, because she sees everyone with an animal head that defines their character. She is very relieved when her clear glasses get put in to see that everyone has a normal person's head again... but I won't take away the surprise ending.

To coin a comparison, Panjabi MC is the Moby of bhangra.I am a big fan of his popular tunes, but the track that gets me is Ghalla Gurian, with an absolutely intoxicating female voice starting out the track.Jugni has some of the finest drum beats I've heard.The album is a work of art as a whole, and will see much more popularity shortly as it gets more recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and we don't stop!","review":"Ever since David Byrne's label introduced Vijaya Anand's Bollywood movie soundtracks to us, with their mix of Indian classical and pop music with western, middle-eastern, and even South American rhythms and instruments, I have been waiting for hip-hop to make the discovery and run with it.This album is great.

Sayuri's love, the driving force of the book itself and the only reason I kept reading, remains unexplained and unfulfilled right to the end. Why did she love him so much? Why did she love him at all?! Why did her rival geisha hate her so much? Sayuri herself is an unintended dichotomy. The other characters say repeatedly what a clever, witty woman she is, but the reader only sees an undecisive and pliable girl whose ultimate fate is a matter of dumb luck, not will. In an odd turn, I hope that the film version is better than book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight to the charity pile","review":"There's no way I'm going to recommend this to anyone I know. Golden couldn't seem to decide between writing a travelogue or a cheesy novel and ended up failing at both. He's got a few moments of smart dialogue or interesting factlets (the old lady's chicken-neck thing...eww) but those only seem to highlight the rest of the book's shortcomings (like the thin plot and the pathetic, one-dimensional characters).

While strictly a fictional story, Golden did his homework so well that one could easily believe that the story of Sayuri is true.The novel has many strong points, the strongest being Golden's colorful and detailed descriptions of geisha life in Gion. The characters are very real, and Sayuri is an extremely likeable heroine...you're rooting for her from the very beginning. The story flows, for the most part, very smoothly, making for an easy and pleasurable read.The one part I found disconcerting (very much so, in some places) was the dialogue. I really felt like Golden was stretching or compromising in certain parts, trying too hard to be poetic or dramatic, and it threw off the otherwise lyrical flow of the story. Other than that, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is quite an enjoyable experience, and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy a good storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book I've ever read!!!","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is by far the best book I've ever read!!

I could not put it down and even read it during class, lectures, and when I should have been doing homework. The ending was a little dissapointing, but I think the point of the book was to have an insight into the life of a geisha. Most westerners have very little knowledge of Japanese culture and history. I think Mr. Golden not only wrote a book that was educating, but so enchanting that you couldn't tell you were beign given a history lesson.

I think Mr. Golden did a fine job and I was totally immersed in Sayuri's story. The descriptions are wonderful and the cultural aspects of it are fascinating. I was in Japan many years ago when I was young and this book brought back many memories especially of rural Japan. I saw the movie, too, but there is no comparison. The book really is superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic story... you are mesmorized...","review":"I loved this story... it is one of love, sorrow, sadness. Highly recommended, take it for what it is without expecting it to be the story of all Geisha women in Japan... Just a glimpse of what it might be or might have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional story told with the restraint typical of a geisha","review":"This beautifully-written, detailed story not only carries the reader through the complete range of emotions, it is also chock-full of interesting information on the training and politics of the geisha society. The author maintains the polite, restrained voice of the geisha throughout the book, without deviation--quite a feat! This is a thoroughly engaging book, not to be missed. I'm planning on reading it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I read this book after reading so much press about how great it was. I was skeptical but thought the subject matter was interesting. By the time I was into the second chapter I didn't want to put it down. I don't want to say anything about the story so as not to give anything away but I recommend the book highly. I have already given it to 2 friends who loved it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Reading","review":"I want to make this clear-this is NOT literature, it is something to read on the beach. I rank this right down there with the Bridges of Madison County-written by a man, that for some reason sends certain women into paroxysms of gushing. It has the usual villainous rival, the Daddy Long Legs benefactor, the male fantasy of old man/young girl(oh sure, every pubescent teenage girl falls in love with a middle aged man on first sight and pines for him for years), mean mistress, etc. etc. There's too many good books out there to waste your time if you are looking for quality prose. it's fine for escapist summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"Honestly, had my sister not given me this book I would have never read it. It pales in comparison to the work of Amy Tan, Maxing Hong Kingston or Shirley Lim.The writing was mediocre at best and I was sorely disappointed. Now, I understand why so many of my friends didn't like the book and refused to see the money. I'm going to the used bookstore and trading this in asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not True?","review":"I actually borrowed this book from the library and my dog literally ate the cover off (thank god for hard backs) so I had to purchase it from the library. After reading it however I was thankful for that result as I can read it again and again and pass it on to others.It is so beautifully written, so wonderfully crafted that the fictional author created in the beginning of the book had me for the remainder of the story. Her voice came through so clearly, there was no doubt in my mind it was a biography. The story is so inspirational I wanted it to be true. It took me a while to accept that it wasn't but the theme and message that came across though the reading was worth it all the while. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Educational!","review":"My review of this book is short and sweet...this book was great! You have to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"There's nothing more satisfying than reading a book that doesn't leave your side...you want to read it as often as possible until that last page. And then it's all over...what a great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Journey into an Interesting World","review":"This book was great in that it gave me not only insight the life of a geisha without ever getting boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial.","review":"After the first third of the book I couldn't stop raving about it and recommending it to friends. By the time I got to the last third I couldn't wait to finish it and move on to something else. Arthur seems to have lost interest half way through the book and did what he could to finish it. Maybe I was expecting something deeper but even for a fairy tale its unbelievably childish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, delicate writing - aptly reflecting the subject","review":"I was enchanted by the delicacy of the writing: I BELIEVED it was written by a Japanese woman, reflecting on her past. My favourite books teach me something about a different place, or time, or lifestyle - within the context of a good plot and well-written prose. Memoirs of a Geisha is a wonderful example of this kind of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow & manipulative deeds win over loyalty & honesty","review":"Regardless of the argument of whether Sayuri is believeable as a real Japanese character or not, I was completely disappointed by the general tone of the book -- that those who are the most capricious, selfish, conceited, shallow, manipulative and superficial will always win out over the same types, and that inevitably, those who are loyal and true will only lose out.The main lesson of the book, if there ever is one, is that it is better to seek perfection in superficiality over true good-hearted nature on a much more deeper level. The true tragedy of the book is that it lauds the attaining of dreams through manipulative and shallow methods, and punishes those who stay true to their principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want it to end.","review":"Golden's fictional account of the Geisha culture in pre- and post-WWII Japan is so well-written, you will find yourself checking the cover again and again to make sure it's fiction. After her mother's death, nine-year old Sayuri's distraught father sends her away from her poor fishing village with a wealthy man who promises to look after her. They travel to the city of Gion, where Sayuri is sold as an apprentice Geisha. As Sayuri grows, we follow her from one teahouse to another as she emerges from a clumsy child into a beautiful, much sought after Geisha.I couldn't put this book down. My only complaint is with the hurried ending. It didn't seem to fit with the rest of the story. Other than that, it was one of the best book's I've read in a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"PJ","review":"Don't pass this one by!! This story is just wonderful and is such an enjoyable book to read. I didn't want the book to end. So easy to visualize the characters and situations from the authors detailed descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I was told that I wouldn't believe that it was written by a man. However, I could believe it! There is no character development or meaningful friendships or relationships. All of the characters in this book are one-dimensional. All women are portrayed as greedy, shallow, vain and vindictive. Even if this is an accurate depiction of geisha life, I think that these women deserve more credit, as well as personalities and not just a pretty face. Pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman's heart","review":"Historically accurate, this is the account of a young girl in China who hasn't a ghost of a chance to follow her dream, but survives with courage and patience to live the life of a Geisha. Her heart is broken many times, yet she perseveres to achieve the status of a woman fulfilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent view","review":"This is a wonderful book. You will not be able to put it down. I really became attached to the characters and what they represnted in the book. A must read.

It's beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience old Japan through this book.","review":"Loved the book. Felt like I was living alongside the characters in the book. The images of Japan could not have been made any more vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on the Bandwagon","review":"There needs to be a better way to learn about Geisha than having to wade through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl Loses Job Over \\"Memoirs\\"...","review":"To say I couldn't put this book down would be a cliche, so I will simply say that we have a \\"no reading\\" policy at my place of work and I have now recieved a verbal warning from my supervisor! The most amazing thing to me is that I can so clearly see Gion and its inhabitants. It's as commonplace to me as Citrus Heights, California; the town where I grew up. I picked this book up nonchalantly when Books-a-Million didn't have the book I was actually looking for. Bless you B-a-M for never having what I want in stock and bless you Amazon.com for being my new source for great reads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN WRITE ABOUT GEISHA?","review":"At times I loved this book at others I was astonished at how an American could so easily fool me into thinking this was a biography. I guess it is simlar to a good Japanese restaurant where the food is authentic but the entire Japanese cuisine is not offered in America. Excellent voice throughout the book. My favorite part was in the garden where the government official got sick. I thought I was there. The ending was anticlimatic but fit nonetheless. At times the female characters appeared thin. These are all minor criticisms. An excellent read and I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!!","review":"I have never written a review before, but this book moved me so, and made me keep coming back for more!! I can't wait to see what Mr. Golden will write next!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A forbidden world unmasked....","review":"Arthur Golden lifts the veil of secrecy into the secret world of the geisha. Sayuri strikes a balance between being a traditional geisha and being a woman in control of her destiny. Whether it is outwitting her rivals, or finding her true love as her traditional society crumbles around her she triumphs. The sensuality and detail with which Mr. Golden writes, takes the reader into a world of which most westerners have no comprehension. I felt as though I lost a friend as I read the final page. I have recommended this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: may require sake","review":"Maybe a little dash of sake would help bring this book to an enjoyable level. I haven't read anything so bad since I was twelve and went through a short-lived (thank god) Danielle Steel phase. It read just like a romance novel: contrived and depthless. The metaphors made me wince. They seemed to slip in every 100 words as if Golden thought \\"Oh: time for another metaphor\\". I'm delighted to see that there are other intelligent people who don't believe this book should have been on the best seller list for over a year. This will be the last time I let overzealous marketing get the best of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk reading--a true Geisha would never share her memoirs","review":"This book was loaned to me by another fawning fan. It reads like junk food. The artificial flavoring may be tasty, but it was largely empty calories.For anyone who has spent time in Japan and amongst Japanese, the book rings false. It is purely a Caucasian male's projection.As an alternative read, I would recommend Tanizaki's Makioka Sisters (and if you can find it on video, it is a wonderful film as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Description Cannot Overcome Plot/Character Flaws","review":"Although the subject matter was quite interesting, the overall book was not dazzling. The plot and character flaws could not be covered up with the author's lovely descriptions. The spitefulness, stupidity, and bitterness of the entire book was not endearing. The protagonist herself was not bright, even though the author found it necessary to remind us constantly of how she appeared to be a \\"smart girl.\\" Sayuri was also coniving and selfish. The ending of the book was unsatisfactory; the resolution of her romance wasn't believable nor remotely credible. Also, her treatment of Nobu was absolutely awful; it reveals her to be selfish and crass. The way that her actions late in the book were interpreted was also unconvincing. The ending was just uninspiring. I've DEFINITELY read better books. By the end of this one I was thoroughly disgusted with most of the characters. If you must read it, get it from the library. It isn't worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books I've read in a long time.","review":"I bought this with little insight as to what was held within its pages. But when I got home, I couldn't stop reading it. I showed it to my japanese teacher, and he said it was very good. Now it is my battle against boredom, because I can get lost into it many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"This the most beautifully written book I have ever read.","review":"This book is one of my favorites. Arthur Golden's writing is exquisite. The metaphors he used were so vivid that I would often re-read them several times, in awe of the clarity with which he describes the feelings we have all felt at some point in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and fascinating novel","review":"I really enjoyed reading this story. I learned something about a dying Japanese tradition and felt for a moment that I was living in Kyoto in the early 1900s. I wish that Golden had spent more time on the relationship with the chairman as it was so much a part of her life and everything she did. But definitely an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous account of the life of a Geisha as if you lived it!","review":"This was a captivating story from the first moment. We lived in the shoes of this young girl and felt her experiences as she grew up and became a well-known Geisha. All the questions were answered about who these women really are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For historical and anthropological interest only","review":"A fascinating insight into the Geisha lifestyle and ethos, this work fails as a novel through one dimensional charcterisation and weak narrative. The rise of the heroine, through the Geisha hierarchy is revealing about that system, but not its main protagonist. The reader simply never feels this is a real peson -merely a useful instrument in Golden's quest to enlighten. One also feels gets the feeling that the author wants us to share his ambiguity about a intriguing, but immoral system of oppression. Part of the general trend to worship everything different from the Western paradigm. For \\"culture\\" freaks everywhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! I'd give it ten stars if I could.","review":"Memoirs Of A Geisha does not need an articulate and witty review, like most of the reviews I just read. It is simply, a really good book. I think anyone who likes to read will love this book. This book would appeal to readers ranging from Jane Austen to Danielle Steele. I think the coolest thing about this book is that A non- japenese GUY wrote it. This book will take you to another level!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable, captivating experience","review":"Not since my childhood introduction to the \\"classics\\" have I been so intrigued by a novel. I cannot recall the last time I found myself in possession of such a brilliantly told story, narrated by an equally accomplished author. Golden has created a masterpiece filled with both historical integrity and human dignity. I found myself slowing the pace of my reading to prolong my interest and pleasure, while learning to appreciate the complexities of this beautiful, if not at times, cruel culture. I have recommended this book to every woman I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Original","review":"This book is one of the most engaging reads ever. Teeming with evocative images and haunting characters, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" envelopes you immediately into the mysterious world of the geisha. The reader feels as if s/he is accompanying the protagonist throughout the teahouses of Kyoto and enjoying a privileged glimpse into this often cutthroat existence. Its pace is brisk and leaves you wanting more at the finish, which comes much too soon. A riveting work, beautifully written and highly original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deliciously compelling and informative read","review":"The imagery and descriptive qualities used by Golden in this novel allows the reader to be transported to Gion and lives the life through the geisha's eyes as if they were your own. I thought this novel was interesting and superbly captured the essence and time necessary to create a great 'memoir' and story."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating story about the mysterious tradition of Geisha","review":"I first learned about this book from listening to Arthur Golden's interview on National Public Radios' \\"Fresh Air\\". A story about a Geisha written in first person by a western MAN sounded intriguing. A most difficult feat, but Golden manages to pull it off. In the interview, Golden described how he completed the research for this book and why his earlier attempt at writing in another voice besides first person failed. The details Golden adds when describing the rituals and training of young Sayuri, the Geisha-to-be is what I enjoyed most about this book. The Geisha tradition is very foreign to me as an American who has never traveled to the far east, and has limited exposure to Asian culture, firsthand. The story of Sayuri's life is very sad, but the reader is rooting for this strong willed woman to survive and overcome the tragedies of her early life. I think this book is destined to be a classic like Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I bid popular fiction a fond adeiu after this one.","review":"This book at first seemed to me like a modern-day Dicken's novel. I couldn't putit down. I read all 430 pages in three days. The problem is that after the great story development at the beginning of the novel, the last half of the novel is not that informative and, in fact, quite boring. In the end I really feel that for all I learned about geisha, I really didn't learn that much at all!! What do they do during the day, except pine for men old enought to be their grandfathers? After me initial excitment it was with much dissapointment that I finished this novel. I wish a woman had written this insipid drivel so that I could stop hearing about how well Golden writes a female character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I absolutely loved this book, I saw the movie years ago and I loved the it. But this book add a depth you just can't get from the movie. Will definitely recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 10 favorite books","review":"The movie was not nearly as good as this book. So much was left out. I don't know how anyone who watched the movie understood what was going on without reading this. A must read! One of the few books I will keep on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book I've read","review":"From the first page I couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've ever read sorry it took me so long to discover it.

I'm not much of a reader but I read this book for my high school english class, I read half of the book thinking it was real but I was surprised to realize all the fascinating love and suspenceful details are fiction. Arthur Golden is a great Writer and I look foward to reading more of his great books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese reader says, \\"Two Mt.Fujis Up!( two thumbs up)","review":"As a Japanese, I've had a preconceived idea that non-Japanese people can't write or understand about Japanese culture. In beginning, I wasn't interested in this book, even though the book was already on the million sellers' list. However, when I picked and little peek on this book at a bookstore, that preconcieved idea which I had were immidiately gone from my mind. I bought the book right away. Since then, I couldn't stop reading until the end. The story is great and smooth toward the end. The author must had done research very hard and carefully. Because understanding Kyoto's culture is more difficult than anywhere in Japan. He understood their mentality and culture very acculately. I recommend this book as a text for anyone who want to study or understant our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful picture of Japan","review":"I've been to Japan twice now, but this is the first time I have a chance to read a novel about it. Memoirs of a Geisha is a captivating piece of fiction with vivid images of the Japanese society before, during and after World War II. After you read the novel, you come out of it appreciative of what Geisha had to go through and get to live the details of life at the time in a way that gets you closer than ever to reality.A great read and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Novel!","review":"This is an extremely well-written novel that kept me captivated from the very beginning. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" follows the story of a young woman who experienced many misfortunes throughout her life, who overcame many trials to improve her status in the world, and who ultimately achieved what she wanted most. I loved the overall plot and descriptiveness of the book, especially since I was reading about a completely different culture (Japanese) than my own. I also loved this novel because it showed the life of a Geisha and what being a Geisha meant - the book detailed all the training they underwent, schooling, what was important, how the world viewed them. This book was full with drama and action, and I couldn't put it down the first time I read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating journey into the life of a Geisha","review":"I started reading this book at the airport, couldn't get into it as easily, my first trip was to California, the usual trip for work, and by then I had gotten more into the story of this poor miserable Sayuri girl. Then I was on my way to Japan where the story takes place, and what's more, I actually visited Gion and I was reading the book during all this time, and I finished it on the train from Kyoto to Tokyo. It made an amazing impression on me as the story went on and I can't tell you what an effect it had when reading it in the country where it was set. I do recommend it, and I can't wait to watch the movie.If you like to read my comprehensive review of Memoirs of a Geisha, please see my blog post below:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but Kindle version awful --Amazon need to PROOF READ!","review":"This book is good but the Kindle version has a typo every 3 or 4 pages. It's clearly been electronically scanned and not proof read.This really slows down the reading of the book and, for me, removes lots of enjoyment: after pondering over why it says \\"stem\\" instead of \\"stern\\", or \\"fee! happy\\" rather than \\"feel happy\\", or why there are random full stops in the middle of the sentences, the pleasure of reading the text is removed.As the Kindle version costs the same as the print copy I would expect a similar about of quality control as a book would receive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Boy was I disappointed. Don't get me wrong, Golden know's his stuff. He has a thorough knowledge of Japanese Culture and History. But, I just felt so misled, when I realized that what I thought was going to be a an enlightening and entertaing read, turned out to be a thinly disguised 400+ page Harlequin Romance. It started out as such a charming story, but the subplot with the Chairman was so annoying, and the ending just ruined the whole thing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting,but not great.","review":"This was an interesting look into the life of a Geisha,but not a great novel. Where is the passion? Definitely not from a womans perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Publishers, take note...","review":"While I enjoyed the novel, I kept wishing there was an accompanying photo book, showing photos of various kimonos, Kyoto before the war, pre- and post-war geishas, their environment and their patrons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as it was hyped up to be.","review":"Although it was very well written and it kept my interest, I felt that Golden (a man) wasn't able to convey how the main character (a woman) truly thinks and feels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect depth","review":"Sure, it's a fun read, a good book to take to the beach. The book's best characteristic is the in-depth look at Japanese geisha life of that period. Enjoyable at a certain level, but that's as far as it goes. Our all-women book club read it and a few people loved it (the ladies I privately consider the least sophisticated readers in the group) and the rest of us thought it was a waste of time for the group. Not because it's a terrible book, but it's not substantial enough to sustain a decent discussion. The characters are mostly one-dimensional, the descriptions are lavish but unconvincing, but it is a fascinating subject. My advice -- wait for the movie, then wait for the movie to come out on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I didn't like this book. Although I admire Mr. Golden's knowledge and efforts, I must say, as a Japanese woman, that I was very disappointed and somewhat disturbed by this book. The story is unnatural. Sayuri's behavior and emotions are not the ones of a Japanese woman of my grandmother's generation. I couldn't help thinking that something very important was missing throughout the book. People who are interested in Japanese culture should try reading books written by Japanese authors as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book was, simply put, wonderful. The narrative was rich with desription and humorous metaphor. I thoroughly enjoyed this peek into the culture and mindset of a woman in pre and post-depression Japan. I found Sayuri to be exotic yet still accessible and likeable. I read it in about four days, the time flew by while I was enthralled by Sayuri. I recommended it to my mother and two best friends who both also gave glorious reviews upon completion. My only complaint is I would have liked to have heard Sayuri's thoughts even more, such as more of her inner conflicts about love, the chairman, and her thoughts about her place in life and society. This book stuck with me for weeks after I sadly finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, albeit mildly entertained.","review":"There is some slight entertainment value in this book for those readers who aren't interested in anything with real substance. I kept waiting for some deeper insight into \\"geishaness.\\" I was hoping for more historical background. I was wishing for some plot and/or depth of character. Sad to say, I was disappointed on all fronts. I did finish it, however, so that says something."},{"rating":"2","title":"what an amazing book.","review":"i have to say this is one of the best books i have ever read. i couldn't put it down for a second , and i enjoyed every minute. it's truly a master peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"All surface no substance","review":"From a cultural and historical perspective this book was of some interest. However, Geisha never truly gets into the mind of its narrator. In fact, it seems to brush over major events in her life. And the reader never really gets to know her all that well. It was quite obvious that the author was a white male. While Golden may be a student of Asian culture, he does not possess enough insider knowledge of what it's like to be Japanese let alone a Japanese woman. If you want a well-done glimpse into the mind and world of Asian women stick to authors such as Amy Tan who really know their subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching on all levels of human emotion and hope","review":"Wonderfully woven accounts depict this easy to read and relishing novel. It touches all sorts of human behavior and emotion and offers an intimate glimpse into one aspect of Japanese culture. Having been to Japan many times over the years, and having relatives, who still owns tea houses, I found myself reminiscing the very typical scenes described in the book. Overall, quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most captivating book and culture.","review":"Memoirs is one of the best books I've read. As with most books, you get out of a book what the author has put in. The author no doubt put forth a tremendous effort as an historian and a wonderful storyteller. I will definately recommend this book to my friends and family and be most certain no one will be disappointed.This book is a page-turner that will keep you energized into the wee hours of the morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and read this book!","review":"If you're checking this book out, look no further. Pick it up, read it and let me know how much you enjoy it. Even years after reading Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha, I still regard it as one of the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Cinderella?!?","review":"A well written tale, this book shows the core elements of Japanese (Geisha) culture back in World War II time as well as a fascinating tale on one of Japan's most celebrated geisha, Sayuri Nitta. Even though Ms. Sayuri may or may not existed, Golden sure did a great job in describing the events that I could feel the pain, as well as the happiness that Sayuri undergo.This tale also reminds me of the original disney tale, Cinderella. From a poor girl in a small fishing village in the outskirt of Kyoto, Sayuri, with inspirations from her prince charming, became one of the greatest, most successful Geisha in Japan. So for a little twist from the old Cinderella, read this book and learn about the oriental culture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional rollercoaster","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a fantastic book. Right from the first page I was transported to 1920's Japan and enthralled by the mysterious world of Geishas. The author, Arthur Golden, did an excellent job bringing Sayuri and her experinces to life. He payed great attention to detail, down to the last stitch of Sayuri's beautiful kimonos. I felt as though Sayuri was walking me through her life, from the tipsy shack she lived in with her family in Yoroido to the elegant teahouses in Gion. I found myself growing attached to her, feeling everything she was feeling. Her life of fear, desire, hope and pain is at once captivating and heartbreaking. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a work of fiction and not an autobiography. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A secret world","review":"Hundreds of people have reviewed this book, but I haven't yet, so here's my contribution. This is a book that ordinarily would not have read had I not had a little push from someone whose opinions I respect. \\"Memoirs\\" could have been fluffy and soap opera-ish, but it avoids most of those literary traps by eschewing romantic cliche and sticking to a fairly realistic, believable tone in which characters make hard choices with unexpected consequences and don't always get what they want. They grapple with making the best of their lot. In other words, a lot like Real Life.\\"Memoirs\\" is written as an actual confessional, and if you don't read between the lines, you could almost believe that it was dictated to the author. It's an interesting look inside the world of the geisha and of life in early to mid-20th century Japan. The characters are involving and the plot is sprinkled with interesting plot twitsts. Some of them are a little pat at the end, but not terribly so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Enchanting Story","review":"I have never read a book so quickly in my life, I just couldn't put it down. Arthur Golden has done a magnificent job really capturing the reader. I felt that Sayuri was right beside me telling me all about her life. I felt so many emotions from excitement to anger to happiness and sorrow. Japan is so rich with culture and history and I strongly recommend it if you are a woman who has an interest in Japan and its unique ways. This story takes you away into the streets of Gion, Kyoto in Japan growing up with Sayuri from childhood to the wonders of womanhood. This is an eye opener. I am keen to read more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasinating!","review":"I had no idea what to expect from this book so it was a great surprise to find that I could not put the book down. And when I did have to put it down, I couldn't wait to find a few spare minutes to pick it back up. I learned about a way of life that I never even thought about and it was written in such an interesting way. The story of this geisha captivated my interest in a way that few books have ever done. I don't want to give any of the story away or tell you what it's about because you probably already know that. I just want to tell you that for me to read a 400+ book in a few days is highly unusual. I have picked up 4 books since this one and just cannot get into them because they don't even began to compare with memoirs. The author wrote in such a beautiful style. Just read it and you will know what I am talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is truly amazong","review":"I hardly enjoy reading books these days. As a sophomore in high school, I'd rather watch Dawson's Creek or go shopping. But when my mom gave me this book to read, I was captivated by it. From the first page, I became engrossed in Sayuri's world and amazed by the life of a geisha. Golden's prose is unbelievably poetic and i loved the way he described every aspect of a geisha's life. This is not like the usual memoirs i have read; I found myself staying up till 3 in the morning reading as much as i could until my eyes failed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites - a must read!","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a fascinating read, it's engaging, the characters seem to come to life and the Golden's writing style really is beautiful. I know there's a lot of controversy over accuracy and how close Golden stuck to reality but I say, the book itself is very interesting and certainly worth regardless of whether or not it's fact or fiction. Memoirs of a Geisha certainly makes it into my top 10 favorite books and I re-read it every few years or so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of exoticism","review":"I cannot deny that \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is very entertaining story. But to me, a reader having studied Chinese and Oriental culture for more than 20 years, this story is uninteresting, entirely written in a man's point of view. Throughout the book, it is obvious that the author is trying hard to convince the reader that the narrator \\"is\\" an oriental woman, i.e. the geisha herself. But he fails after all. And the result is, the story is full of stereotypes, especially stereotypes of Asian women (e.g. good girls and bad girls, rivalry between women...), Asian men (e.g. how they victimize women) and patriarchal culture. In short, it disguises itself as a history of Asia women's struggle (purely in the eyes of the West), full of out-dated symbols, cliche and exoticism, which only appeals to the readers in the West who are not similar with the Orient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking... a joy to read!","review":"I had two friends recommend this book to me, and I finally sat down to read it. What an amazing story! The author does a wonderful job of drawing you into this woman's life, learning about the world of the geisha as she herself does.My only complaint (and I'm sure it's one other people have)... I wanted more! I sat and read the last 200 pages in one sitting and I really wished there had been more to the story... I mean, it seems like we learn SO much about Chiyo/Sayuri's life, and when the book reaches a certain plot point (I won't spoil it for others who haven't read it), you are pretty much left with a quick summary for the rest of the book... I wanted the story to keep going!Having said that, I highly recommend this book... it's fascinating, celebratory, heartbreaking and a joy to read. I almost cried at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Very descriptive life of a Geisha. Loved the movie and enjoyed the book as well. Could picture the characters very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not real memoirs","review":"While I enjoyed this book while reading, my enjoyment was diminished when I found out about how the author used the subject's story without her permission and had presented many of her positive experiences as negative and many of her negative experiences as positive. If you want to read actual memoirs by a geisha who worked during the early 20th century, go straight to the source. Skip this and go straight to Geisha: A Life by Mineko Iwasaki.Geisha: A Life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and all the different struggles and how she overcame them. This is a fiction book but the author did a decent job with his research. I felt the end of the book was a little sped up and it would have been nice to have a little more elaboration there but overall I did enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth rereading again and again.","review":"As a student of Japanese history and Language I was very hesitant about reading this book. I refused to read it for years afraid of a sorid tale in the typical western image of the geisha. I finally picked it up one day by chance and was pleasently surprised. This is by far one of my favorite books. It has a capitavating story but what makes it so wonderful is the scenery of Japan so vividly described. I love reading this book because it takes me back to the time I lived in japan the climant the food. The rich culture and the meld of modern and traditional that still exists if not so much in modern times with the Geisha themselves. In Japan you can walk down a modern business street and run smack into a shrine, see men dressed in business suits and a woman in a kimono. This book essential breaths that and also does well at capturing the modernizing changes that have happened in the last century. I highly recommend this book to read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. After reading through it the first time, I've loved it so much that I had to re-read it all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"I loved this book! I was transported to Japan no matter where I was reading. I forgot who and were I was!! It takes a great author and an amazing book to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I expected this book to be much like the film which i liked, so i bought it because of the good price but when i read it i found that it exceeded my expectations. It is much better than the film and so hard to put down!

It is wonderful and once you start it you will find it impossible to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking with lucid details","review":"Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is one of the best contemporary books I have read in a long time. It tells the story of a popular geisha during the early 20th century. While the end is lacking and disappointing, what precedes it is fascinating. Golden delves into the culture of Japan and how geisha fit into it. He writes the story richly and convincingly, a most excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book was definitely not boring. It held my interest for the long run. However, the ending was slightly disappointing to me, as it seemed to end too abruptly, and I felt there was not enough closure. It was a good book, though, and I recommend it. But don't be disappointed when you find out it's really not a true memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, not fantasic.","review":"This is the story of Sayuri, a geisha in the first half of the 20th century. It details her life from a moment when she is sold as a young girl well into old age. It documents hardships, love, and spiritual triumphs. A beautiful story, really. For the most part, Arthur Golden's style seems smooth and thorough. There are spots in the book, however, that simply seemed to deserve more attentioon than was given. This especially applies to the ending. For such a complex and emotional book, Golden seemed to be in quite a hurry to get the ending over with. It left me unsatisfied, but the book still shines for a first novel. Hopefully, his writing will continue to blossom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"I found this book fascinating. Once I started I could hardly put in down. The characters are great and it almost seems you know them by the end of the book. It also teaches you about the Japanese geishas and whole Japanese culture in general. Golden did a great job drawing the reader in and explaining the Japanese traditions. The story was very believable and excellently written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"I don't care if there are certain aspects about this story that may be, arguably, inaccurate. It doesn't matter. This book is wonderful! I cried crocodile tears while reading it! A fabulous story about a girl and a lifetime of obstacles and adversity, ending with...I'm not going to give it away! Plus it really clarified in my mind what exactly a geisha is! However, buying this book for the story alone is enough--it's breathtaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too repetitive","review":"I completely agree with wishnick's critique, prose with no soul, which was extremely eloquent and intelligently written. I disliked all the characters because they were too superficially drawn, and I felt that the writing was too repetitive. In fact, I skipped about half or more of the book, and merely read the ending because I could never NOT finish a book. Because the author keeps repeating himself over and over to drive in obvious points, I feel that I didn't miss anything, despite my blatant skimming.I'm sure we do get a good idea of what constitutes a geisha's life, though you can probably get better depictions by reading other books about geisha, and hence you can bypass Golden's annoying writing.Fortunately, I borrowed this book from the library! If you are still intrigued with this novel because of the high critical acclaim (unfounded), please just borrow the book. This is the type of novel that does not bear reading twice, or once for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for your library...","review":"It was a fast read but captivating nonetheless. Although I do not think that, this was a work of non-fiction as the author proclaims. It is however, a book that swallows you whole and takes you into the life of a Geisha. I found this book engaging and all conquering, I'm sure you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing to the end!","review":"An excellent book for people who like detail in their reading. It guides the reader to paint their own picture using only limitations of their imagaination. Opens up a side of culture most of us are not familiar with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down","review":"This book combined information about a different culture (for me) and a compelling story. I found the writing beautiful and the suspense exciting.

It is a wonderful story of a small girl torn from her family and thrown into a world that she knew nothing about, the world of the geisha. the book is an account of her journey from child to woman and her final triumph of becoming one of the most prominent geisha in her city. Gives a view into the real daily routines of geisha even those parts that aren't so galmorous. I highly recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Im a college student currently interested in Japanese culture and noticed this title because I once read an article about a modern day geisha in a girl's magazine(just flipping through) and found it interesting. I found out that this wasn't just information on geisha but a beautiful story that kept my interest throughout the entire book. Im glad I listened to the good reviews and gave it a try. You'll fall in love with the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"Prior to reading this book, I had little knowledge of the world of geisha. The author, Arthur Golden, has a skill of weaving historical facts with his fiction. So not only was I thoroughly delighted with the story, but also gained some knowledge at the same time. At the very start, he places us at the beginning of a young girl's life and takes us through the stages of her life up to old age. He takes the reader by the hand and places you in the middle of the scenes he paints with his words. It is a remarkably beautiful book which I hated coming to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"When I read this book it reminded me of listening to my grandmother telling me stories about when she was younger. This book realy sounds like one geisha telling her story, even though it is writen by an american man and is actualy derived from the colective notes from many geisha's experiances. I thought it was wonderful, how the main charictar (Sayuri) describes her live, how though for the most part she lived in complete \\"comfort\\" having everything she needed and plenty of money. But though you can seem to have it easy you can still a quite hard emotianal life. I do have to say however that it is more of a \\"chick book\\" and wont be verry enjoyable for many of the men out there but hey give it a try. It really is a good read and should be taken advantage of for all the readers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of a Geisha","review":"This book lets you to escape to another world and time, when woman were treated more like beautiful objects than like people. This is not always a bad thing because they were cared for, pampered and admired. The attention to detail allows the images to appear in your mind as your read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"Better than Twilight, but still one of the worst books I have even read. It advertises itself as historical or realistic fiction, it's neither.

This should have been called a \\"condensation\\". The advertisement gives no hint of the running time which is far too short to tell the story. Erica E.

Using beautiful metaphor and a rich understanding of asian spitirualism and beliefs this book fairly jumps off the page and into your heart. I was so deeply moved by reading this book. I feel as if I know Sayuri personally. What is interesting is that, although the book is wildly entertaining, it also holds some subtle lessons. In this fast moving world of RAM speed and megabyte patience, it shows the subtle undertow of life's tides. Wonderful, simply wonderful a must read for women and men, young and old alike. Thank you Mr. Golden, Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, amazing and enjoyable.","review":"This book was a page turner. It was so thoroughly researched, I couldn't believe it was fiction. It's definitely not your typical mass market novel, but written much like a novel by Charles Dickens. This is a book of quality, don't expect lurid details of sexual encounters, rather it's the journey of a girl into her adulthood. As a woman, I couldn't believe Memoirs was written by a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xcellent Book","review":"i would say that this is my all time favorite book. i've never felt more passionate about any other fictional novels than this one in my life!. i read it about 3 times in total, and the wonderful thing was, each time i read it, i discovered something new that i totally missed in the first place!highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"sappiness overload","review":"i was in an airport waiting for my flight, and i bought this book in a giftshop to read on the plane. ugh. it was horrible! i almost threw it down the aisle at least ten times. it starts out ok, but once you realize that sayuri doesn't leave the mindset of a 12 year old in the whole book, it just becomes grating. bah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"The only not-so-great part of this book was the confusing names. I found myself looking back several times to keep the people straight. Other than that, I absolutely loved it. Not often can I not put a book down, and I finished this novel in about 2 days. I absolutely recomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Japanese-American I am insulted...","review":"Everyone screams praise of Golden, but most of the Japanese women I know who have read this hated it, as do I. Golden may have researched and trained for ten years, but my own music and dance training by a geisha taught me that geishas take twice that to train. A Westerner who attempts to write about Easterners is fine, but do not claim you can ever understand the nuances of a culture or that you are an expert on something when its obvious you are not. I was so insulted and continue to be that such horrible indiscretions about my culture continue to exist and are pedalled to be true by so many uneducated people. Being half American I am so ashamed that we believe a work of FICTION as truth so desperately. Its not about political correctness, its about misunderstanding a people."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mockery to the japanese culture","review":"This was the most shallow and superficial attempt of a cultural novel I have ever read. I read that Golden wrote another poor novel before this one, also set in Japan, and the man had not even been to Japan before! When that novel failed, he decided that maybe it would be a good idea to understand what he is writing about. Good idea! I'd hate to see how it would have turned out if he hadn't.If the Japanese culture interests you, than please read Tanizaki's \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" and I promise you that you will realize what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously written by a man","review":"My first thought, when I first heard of this book, was how could a white, American man write from the perspective of a Japanese geisha? The book's rave reviews, plus Spielberg's purchase of the story rights, convinced me to read it. It turns out that my original thought was correct. The prose is filled with cliches, and the story is quite inaccurate from the female perspective (particularly the scene where the heroine loses her virginity.) Why must every commercially hot property turn out to be like the script for \\"Pretty Woman\\" (i.e. an unrealistic, male fantasy)? How degrading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab this for \\"by the pool\\"!","review":"This is an entertaining story, and a quick read. It doesn't go too deep, so it is perfect for those summer days trying to read by the pool while a group of 10 year-olds are screaming and splashing nearby. You don't need much concentration to follow along. The characters are pretty flat, but somehow I was able to stay interested because the subject matter was so unfamiliar to me. If you are looking for shocking plot twists and juicy revelations, read something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic beauty of a young girls journey to adulthood","review":"I loved this book!! I felt as if I too was on a journey through time with the young giesha.

It is a great story of the struggle and life strategy of a young girl who learns to love her life. The story is beautifully told and is very rich in the geisha culture. The author completely submerses you into the life of Chiyo/Sayuri. I feel that I have been to Gion. My only disappointment was that the author misleads you as to the source of the story. He doesn't come clean until the very last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst in years","review":"This is the worst book I've read in years ...hundreds of books. My instinct in putting it off so many years was right -- what a completely romanticized, Americanized load of crap. I respect all the positive-review readers here, and I never write reviews here, but I just couldn't contain myself from trying to warn someone from wasting a slice of your life on this mush. If you want to spend \\"time\\" in Japan, 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is a much better experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating subject - hard to put down","review":"After reading several books lately which took place in Japan, I was interested to learn more about geishas. Since I had purchased this book several years ago, it was a perfect time to read it. The book was very interesting, very sad, very informative. It appeared the ending was going to be tragic. Instead it had a delightful twist. It didn't make for a fairy tale happy ending, but it made the ending something I could accept and believe. I highly recommend it, especially for women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book fell apart","review":"I bought this book in large print for my mother who is 81 years old & in a home.She enjoyed the contents of the book, but the pages were falling out as she read the book...

Even though it was about Geisha, there was less talk of sex than in most books I've read. All about the struggle to survive and overcome lifes obstacles.

But if you strip away all the cultural details and an occasionally lovely description, this becomes a book about a basically simple-minded woman who spends a lot of time talking about clothes, hair, makeup, and boys. I find it hard to believe that a real geisha, who is trained as an artist and conversationalist, would be this banal. The other characters were also nothing more than skin-deep depictions. Since the book was set in this century, the author had an opportunity to explore any number of interesting juxtapositions: the impact that modern Western culture and technology had on Japan, the way the Japanese were emotionally affected by WWII, ANYTHING that would have caused this book to operate on more than the most superficial level.

A great adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters and Setting are Superb; Memoirs is Haunting","review":"The setting and characterization are superb in this first by Golden. You could feel the stiff kimonos and quiet movements on the tatami mats. I could hear the wind and see the vivid colors and the wrinkles in their faces. No other author has been able to entrace me into a story like so, this was so realistic that it was scary.This is just one of those stories that give you goosebumps down your arms after finishing it.

I don't know enough about Asian culture to know how \\"correctly\\" written this book is, but I loved it for the story itself. The detail made me genuinely feel like I was living with the characters. This is a story about patience. It is a story about having something in your life that makes you get up every morning and survive. It is a story about hope. I'm really not sure why I didn't give it five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"Easy reading, and well written. I could not get myself to put the book down which caused lots of very late nghts. You get very involved in the story and made me read up even more on the life of Geisha'a in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lllllloooooovvvvvveeeee this book!","review":"It is one of those books that after having read it, you really get a sense of that time and place and are left with a hunger to find out more by going there yourself! I did eventually go to Japan and visit the Gion district with a better understanding and appreciation for its history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"The book started out slow, and then got worse. I've never read about such a spineless group of women in my life. Halfway through the book, I didn't care what happened to the characters, but I had to finish it for book club. What country was it a National Bestseller in?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Beautifully written! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a little too graphic in some scenes, but otherwise, it is exquisite! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catty and only marginally interesting","review":"Cat fights set up like Joan Collins versus Linda Evans, brief cultural references, and then back to more back-biting plotting and night time soap stock plots. Two stars only because of some of the facts gleaned. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"Not really what I had expected. There were a lot of good reviews for this book, but on the whole it was a disappointment. The book tends to drag on about the girl's life, and at times was lacking the insight that other parts were rich in. You would have to, though, applaud the author's attempt to try to write through the eyes of a young woman. A well written book, nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's little me vs. the masses and one very rich Mr. Golden","review":"Can you argue with money and wicked mad sales? Sure!

I still remember nearly all of the book... three weeks and about twenty novels later. Maybe he was a woman in a past life. :-) This novel places you right in the body of a geisha. You feel her pain, her struggles, her love. A masterpiece! (P.S. I am not saying that guys can't write books like this, its just that it is rare.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Descriptive Talent","review":"Arthur Golden's ability to describe emotions amazes me, and the fact that he is describing a woman's emotions so strikingly is even more surprising. I underlined some sentences because they are so true to life -- he is extremely perceptive, and able to express feelings very clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Japanese Fairy Tale.. very good read","review":"I thought this book was a very sweet and sad story of a young girl who was forced to become a geisha. I recommended it to all my friends and every one of them loved it. I read it in 3 days. It has alot of historical information about geishas but it also adds a little love story to it as well. Very sweet book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"This story is set in Japan in the 19th century during a period in time when young girls' futures were based on their ability to serve, and their appearance. A young girl's life changes at the age of 8, when she's forced to grow up. Seperated from the ones she loves she strugles to experience things that were of another world. This author, Arthur Golden, portrays the life of a geisha through stories that a dear friend of his tells him on her deathbed.He was inspired by the stories of these young girls that had experienced similar incidents. Although Mr. Golden is a Caucasian male that has only visited Japan a few times, he has a way of telling the story as if he were there in the first person. I've never been fortunate enough to read his other books, but if they're as good as Memoirs of a Geisha they're next on my list. This book is encouraging in a way that you would least expect, and one that everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Year's Best","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha captivates and transports the reader from his/her own space and place in time to the historic Geisha district of Kyoto, Japan within a chapter. The characters are touchable. The settings are as real as if one were seated alongside the guests of the famous tea houses. Arthur Golden is masterful at setting the scene and drawing the reader in, not as an observer --but as a participant. This is a terrific story told by a very talented storyteller. If I were giving out awards, this book would receive top honors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Male Fantasy more than Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"Arthur Golden did a fine job of researching the life of a Geisha. However, he failed to capture the emotions of Sayuri, the Geisha whose memoirs we are purportedly reading. This novel may be a stereotypically love story if one ignores the age and social status difference between the geisha and her love interest (sponsor). Or it may be a story of abuse of women in Japan. It may even be an outsiders view of what life is like as a geisha. It is not an insider's view of what it feels like to be a geisha as the title implies. Perhaps it is nothing more than a male fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"The simple discriptive nature of this book easily draws in the reader and makes it a great story. The historical references enable the reader to grasp the state of the characters. The love story does come off as sort of an unrealistic sidebar but overall a great book with which to end the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...Intriguing...Engaging...","review":"This book is one of those incredible treasures that come to readers once in a lifetime. The characters were all so realistic. It felt like the opening and closing of a Japanese fan, disguising and at the same time allowing some peaking into the world a woman of the West surely is not aware of...Incredible read...Congratulations on this most beautiful book, Mr. Golden!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Engrossing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. From page one, I was hypnotized with the life of this girl. I could not put the book down. It's been a long time since I have been so engrossed in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed account of life as a geisha","review":"It is amazing that a man can write something like this and be able to capture a girl/woman so perfectly. The detailed experiences are shocking and interesting. The story seems a bit slow at times but for the majority of the time I couldn't put it down. A definite good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Final Dream","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is about a girl that was sold by her father into a slavery kind of atmosphere. From the struggles she had and the memories that she experienced with her parents death she tells the story of how she survived through it. She became known as one of the most popular geishas in all of Gion, Japan. In the end she experienced her dream of having her danna, (a man that takes care of a geisha) the Chairman, in which she always was in love with. She finally ended up in New York in the United States and started her own little geisha teahouse. I kind of liked this book just because it was a little experience of how you could live if you were a girl in Japan, but it was just bacially about her life, which in a way is kind of boring. But overall it was nice. I read this book for a class noval reading book, my teacher actually picked it out because the cover just looked good! It was iteresting enough for me to read, even though I hate to read?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinderella in a Kimono","review":"The most glaring problem with this book is that Arthur Golden doesn't know the meaning of \\"less is more.\\" Every other paragraph is spent in painful detail, and you flip pages wondering when he's going to get the story back on course. And the story itself is nothing more than a watered-down Cinderella in the Orient: poor girl wins suitor against pathetic odds.This book is terribly predictable. So much time is wasted on insignificant details (like what color stich was on what color kimono or what hair pin was worn on which geisha's head), that the author loses sight of the characters themselves.If detail and dry stories are your thing, this book is perfect; but if you're looking for a good story with solid, well-defined characters, you're better off to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THIS ONE???","review":"I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THIS BOOK. EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT IT, SO I THOUGHT BETTER LATE THAN NEVER TO READ IT. WISH I WOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is simply an insult to the buyer","review":"***Spoilers***In the beginning of the book, the writer says a real geisha(Sayuri) asked him to write this book about her life, but in the end the same writer says \\"Even though Sayuri never existed and I made everything up, blablabla\\" What the hell?And it's not even a decent fairytale. It's filled with pedophilia, pornography, immorality, treating women like objects, like slaves, etc.The film was pretty good, but it's been a shock when I found out in the book that Sayuri was only 15 y old when that old doctor had sex with her.In conclusion, avoid this book. Better watch the movie. It doesn't reflect the reality of Japan culture. Rip-off"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Slow","review":"This book was so slow. I think only about 1/4 of the book was actually interesting: the first chapter and the last 3 chapters. I was incredibly too long and the story was so drawn out. You think throughout the book there's this big build up and it's finally going to all pay off for the main character and it's just not the best ending at all. There was a big culture gap but the author did make it pretty easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly, sappy drivel","review":"Risking the wrath of those who love this book I have to say...this book is BAD. I felt a bit entertained during some of it but mostly I couldn't wait for it to be over-I only finished it because a friend lent it to me & I felt obligated to slog through it for him.The characters are two-dimensional, predictable and uninteresting. Another reviewer described it accurately as junk literature. This book reads like and has as much depth as one of those dime-a-dozen romance novels or that other really bad bestseller \\"Bridges of Madison County\\".Your time and money is better spent on popcorn and watching a Gilligan's Island video."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale of dubious worth","review":"After the promise of a glimpse into a mysterious and secretive world, the reader is delivered nothing short of a trite tale with dull characters. Ultimately stale (a story you've read a hundred times) and trashy, sorry to say. An easy read, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but Not Historically Accurate","review":"If I were to rate this book on how entertaining and engaging it is, I would say 4 out of 5 stars. Unforunately, what I was looking for in this book was historically accuracy and correct insight into the Geisha culture. Though I read the book knowing the individual characters and plot were fictional, I expected the culture and major events surrounding the characters to be portrayed as precise in the time period it was to be set in.Do NOT read this book for historically information on Geisha and do NOT hold this book to any truth if you're wanting to study true Geiko life and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of A geisha","review":"I am 14 and I have just started reading this book. I am nearly half way through, and I'm fidning it absolutely amazing. It's a wonderful book, and it's one I can somehow relate to. In the smallest way. This book reminds me of a birthday party when I was five, unravelling the parcel, and finding little surprises in each opening. So far, I am thoroughly enjoying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"So many people liked this book that I couldn't wait to curl up with it. However, I kept scratching my head when the plot was trite and too many thin similies were used. As for showing the world of the geisha, I was most intrigued by Hatsumomo and Mamaha but still felt these characters were not built to my satisfaction; the bad cop was too bad and the good cop was too good. It was Mr. Golden's first effort and unfortunately completes my experience for this author. I felt like it was basically a harlequin romance veiled as a high-brow novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of saki","review":"I am just astonished at all the wonderful reviews for this book. I had to read Memoirs for my Book club and I say HAD because I'm sure I wouldn't've finished it otherwise. I just didn't find it beautifully written as others did; I guess I read too many really well written novels. The rivalry of women in Japan was hard to read about as was the control of the men. I suppose Golden did a good job conveying the culture of Japan but I like characters who have some redeeming qualities or that I can care about and I didn't find any here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the boat","review":"Sometimes I really wonder what attracts readers and generates best sellers. The first half of this novel, admittedly, was engrossing as we learn of the intimate details in the life of a pre-war geisha and come to know Sayuri and her struggles to find meaning to her life. But its all down hill after that, and it would have served the author well to quit right there as he seems to have run out of steam and relied on the contrived Hollywood ending allowing Sayuri to fall into the arms of her long-time idol, whom we actually know nothing about (except for one sentence that says he is married!) and live happily ever after jet-setting between Japan and New York. You spend 400 pages getting to know her only to find out that she is a big disappointment.Was this maybe the intent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"IN A WORD - \\"DISAPPOINTING!\\"","review":"This book got me all steamed up enough to write a review! I suppose anyone would if they had believed in all the hype and walked away with a copy in hand and high expectations. Very very light reading. One dimensional, lacking insights to a people and a culture. Doesn't even compare with a paperback romance novel if you are looking for substance. Hiding behind a woman's persona, a geisha in this case, the author's glossy treatment of characters are insufferable. Truly lacking the nuances of relationships between people and social norms of a culture that would give understanding or the very least some insight. Very flimsy, save your $7 or $14 or whatever it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I don't understand what everyone thought was so good about this book. It's a simple rags-to-riches story with a few twists. That's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly overrated","review":"I found it entertaining during the first several hundred pages, but ultimately this book left me flat. The characters were uninspired and hollow; the writing was at times just plain silly and stilted. Ultimately, I found \\"Geisha\\" to be little more than a garden-variety romance novel dressed up in fine silk robes. Save your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be advised this book is FICTIONAL!!","review":"This book is very easy reading. I could not help but laugh at some of the remarks only a Yank woman would say. As if the author had no idea about their language. I have read other Geisha books, studied Japanese and know people who live in Kyoto. This book is very American it's no wonder all the mindless Yanks love it!! It is a wonderful story no doubt of the struggle of a young \\"Geisha\\" woman. I read it in 5 days. It was a nice change. It's almost the same as if a Geisha would read \\"Hollywood Wives\\". It's almost laughable. The whole Chairman ordeal was very tiring. And Hautsumono's character was eliminated too easily and without a boom. In fact the story was not even about Geisha at all. Only about 2 women trying to bring another down for treating one of them so badly. Sounds like elementary reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"Don't believe the hype! The effort that went into creating this book is admirable, but this is a shallow exploration of a geisha's profession and of a woman's mind. It's crammed with details, but they don't add up to much. After finishing the book, I felt I had learned very little about the geisha arts. What was Sayuri learning in that school all day long? The narrative contains an abundance of cheesy metaphors and at times reads like bad haiku. The central romance of the book is implausible -- Nobu is a much more compelling love interest than the two-dimensional Chairman, and any woman as \\"clever\\" as Sayuri supposedly is would recognize this. To see a male novelist writing from a woman's point of view successfully, try She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb -- not Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good....","review":"This book is so good, you wont be able to put it down for a second. The culture and writing along with the story line are so impressive. The movie and the book are so good, but this book is just wonderful. It will have you crying and laughing at the same time while you take a trip back to a Geisha's life just before WWII. This book is by far one of the best works out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spurred me on","review":"I love it when a book proves to be so interesting that I continue after reading it to find out more about the subject. This is one such book. A really good read--not easy to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"I can't recommend this book enough! I started reading this book and simply could not put it down. This story follows the path of young Chiyo/turned Sayuri. It puts you in the shoes of a geisha. Some of the things that young Chiyo had gone through was heartbreaking.. her life as Sayuri brings her in a completly different direction! This book was powerful and amazing. I plan to read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was a total offence!!","review":"Although there were geishas in Japan, there were only some who actually slept with men. This book is a total offence for Japanese women like me as some close minded ignorant western males still view Japanese women as being \\"geisha\\". Remember: 1) the author is a western MAN who depicts almost like European and Americans during imperialism. 2) Geisha whom he got many details from sued him for fabricating the truth and disgracing her name 3) He is not Japanese and didn't live in Japan long enough to know Japanese 4) the audience was not intended for Japanese but English speaking western who hardly know about Japanese"},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"Don't believe the hype on this one. This novel reads like it was written by a North American man trying to imitate Danielle Steele. The heroine remains devoted to a man who gave her a handkerchief; she betrays the man who truly loves her; she sees men only as instruments to her own ends. She comes across as a vacuous shallow person and she's one of the better written characters. Don't waste your time with this book - there must be better ways to learn about Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"It's not the worst book I've ever read but still, I did not like it at all. I did not care at all for the main character. I found her to be totally materialistic and incompetent and totally narrow minded. I wanted to choke her. The minor characters I found more enjoyable to read about... Pumpkin (as she grew up to be crass and blunt I totally enjoyed every page she was in), Nobu (great character who wasted his time on stupid main character) and even the \\"bad girl\\" Hatsumomo (there's usually always that enemy role in a book right?)... at least she had life in her even when her evil deeds made her have that stereotypical bad girl role. All the talk of Kimonos and various makeup and the whole \\"Chairman this\\" and \\"Chairman that\\" and everything just made me roll my eyes. This girl knows nothing of importance but that chairman. I just wanted to say, Just STFU already and slap her so she can get back to reality. I couldn't stand the main character. I did not feel any \\"heart\\" in her at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing; should have been called \\"Memoir of a Bore\\"","review":"While Mr. Golden's prose holds up pretty well after 400+ pages, the story of Chiyo/Sayuri, the geisha, does not. For a memoir (fictional or not) to be worthwhile, the subject must have led an interesting life. While the portrait of the geisha 'trade' and life in Japan during the period treated is certainly interesting, the experiences of our heroine are pretty dull.Yes, there are personal rivalries, power grabs, and lots of emotion. But frankly, other than the unorthodox setting (the Gion district of Kyoto), there's nothing compelling about this story. After 250 pages it dawned on me that geisha are, in fact, prostitutes (consider the relationship between a geisha and her 'danna') despite everyone's claims that there is somehow something more subtle and nuanced about their profession.Left me disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I, like many others, couldn't put this book down. It's a beautifully written book with a lot of detail and culture infused into it. The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because the ending was too rushed for me. I think it ended quite abruptly. Otherwise, it's definitely still worth reading and I do consider it to be one of my favorites even with that flaw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"novel, or movie script?","review":"Well, I understand why they picked this up as a movie now. I received this book as a gift and have to say I was a bit disappointed. The story was captivating, really...but also a bit contrived. It was not especially well written. I continued to read it only to find out if it ended how I though it might...and it did. Perfect for a box-office hit!To be fair, Golden did an amazing job with his research. I am not an expert on pre-WWII Geishas, but the details felt authentic, and I did learn a thing of two about this fascinating culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poetic Journey Into Old Japan","review":"What a lyrical and beautiful book. Honestly, I mostly read non-fiction but I was swept away by this story. It felt so real and the characters completely captivated me. It makes complete sense why so many people have loved this book. I believe it will have an impact on anyone who picks it up. The setting was almost mythical in its feel. I could sense the foggy winters and perfect springs. I think a novel should transport the reader to another world and present characters who the reader can really relate to, whether they be contemporary or ancient. This book did just that. This is really a 5 star effort.I look forward to reading more of Arthur Golden's books, although it will be hard to top this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I found the book to be amazing and fascinating. What started out as just another Lit assignment, left me mesmorized. I spent the first half of the book thinking it was non fiction. Arthur Golden's tale is just too emotional and detailed to be fiction. I highly recommend this read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching, very sensual story","review":"This book was very well written, never boring. I read it quickly, and enjoyed it thoroughly. It seems to have been very well researched. The details lend a realism to the story that makes it difficult to believe it's not an autobiography. The characters are so real. The author does an excellent job of contrasting what seems on the surface to be a privileged life with the darker, sadder side of geisha life. It is as much the reality of Geisha that they are pampered, privileged, and respected, as it is that they are bought and sold, and lack ultimate control over their own lives. But throughout the story we learn, as Sayuri is learning, that there are means for gaining control over one's life and destiny. Such means require wit and cunning. Learning such means is the art of Geisha as much as tea ceremony, or any other craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Memoirs","review":"This story was awesome! I didn't put this one down. After this came out, the Japanese were really stirred up! There were stories and documentaries on TV all over the place! \\"Oh no, we never do those things!\\" \\"We're really not like that!\\" \\"It's just to entertain men - just company.\\" SURE! Well...maybe some of this was for the excitement, but in general I don't believe it was far off. What's the big secret anyways??! It's been going on for thousands of years! PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs of a G","review":"Just didn't do it for me.Romantic story? I don't find old desperate men swooning over a girl who's paid to be with them particularly enchanting..Evidently Geisha's become skilled at the art of manipulating people... particularly men... in order to get what they want. The best are described as skilled conversationalists.... at least in in the genre of locker room gossip stories.Its difficult to sympathize with the so called heroine in any way... from willing to sleep with the minister to get what she wants (or doesn't) ... to a lack of recognition that her sister worked as a prostitute... to her materialistic preoccupation for her clothing, kimono's and appearance. Supposed to be a happy ending, but I feel sorry for her...Admittedly, the Japanese perspective and conditions during the 2nd world war was interesting at times ... and there is some value put on knowing what a Giesha really is. Overall, I slogged through the whole book, rarely interested in reading the next page."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful wonderful wonderful","review":"2 years ago, this was the book i took with me on my honeymoon in borneo. saying that it is still one of the most vivid memories i have from that time is not a criticism of the vacation (a night in the rainforest with 6 inch spiders takes some beating for memorability) but a measure of its brilliance. fascinating in its historic detail, deeply affecting in its humanity, relentless in its narrative, this is quite simply one of those books. the fact that it's totally fictional and written by a brit makes it all the more astounding. save it for a special occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetically flowing and hard to put down","review":"I found this novel to be quite poetic in its own way. The words flowed in vivid details.I found that it was almost impossible to put this novel down. Events, people, and ideologies were descripted with certain details of other events for a comparison. When reading this novel you honestly almost feel like you are their in the Teahouses with Sayuri. You can almost feel the people that the author is decsribing while seeing them in your imagination. THis novel is quite fascinating and quite educational at that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story of Finding One's Destiny","review":"Of course this book lives up to the reviews it has received - both from popular media as well as personal recommendations. It is a story of a particular life, and in it, a story of life. The Japanese way of looking at things - or rather, the author's rendition of the Japanese way of looking at things - is striking. Remarkable in that it is written by an American male born in 1957; unusual in its choice of narrator, especially for the pre- and post-war period it covers; sensitive; told without judgment; universal in its pull toward the unknowable: What is my destiny? How is it that my destiny is fulfilled? Why do some people seem to achieve theirs, most others don't? Why is there so much pain in achieving one's destiny?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book, not the ending","review":"This is one of my most favorite books of all times. I believe it will one day be considered a classic. The author draws you in from the first sentence, and the book is hard to put down. However, as much as I loved this book, the ending is not my favorite. I believe the author goes against Sayuri's true character at the end of the book in her treatment of Nobu. Read the book and you will understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I read this book six years ago, and I still recommend it to others. It really is a fascinating look into the life of a geisha. This was the first 'memoir' type book that I have read, and I honestly couldn't put it down! I can't wait for the movie to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book - couldn't put it down!","review":"This is a wonderful book full of emotion and life journey. I loved the development of each charactor, but I felt the ending was a bit abbreviated. While reading it I found out that the movie is being released Dec-05, so I cannot wait to see it then. As for the book, I wish the story had continued a bit further. Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"It reminded me of another boring soap opera with an extremely predictable ending. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme A Break","review":"I had heard a lot about this book. From the public, I heard nothing but good things. From my mom, she said drastically overrated. So I read for myself. <insert a HUGE yawn here> The characters had about as much flavor as water, and they could quench anything. This sort of thing happens all the time in any country. Don't waste your time. Read a Japenese business strategy book before this one. Moral: Always listen to Mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about young Japanese women being 'catty'.","review":"I had read/heard a lot about this book. As with most books that are heavily 'hyped'....it failed to be as good as expected. The main character, Sayuri, is quite self-centred....those around her share this characteristic....and they ALL seemed to be bent on 'getting' each other....why this is interesting I have NO idea. It occurs in ALL cultures...has since the beginning of time...and will continue to DO so. Give it a miss. You'll likely do better reading something ELSE about Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not without its flaws","review":"No doubt about it, this is, by any standard, a book that excels through its sheer readability. Nothing could be more entertaining and engaging than Sayuri's struggle to survive as a geisha after being sold into slavery by her own father. We really care about this character, and that's the test of a good book. However, this book does have its problems, as others have noted. The main one seems to be an unfortunate difficulty that crops up over and over again when a male author tells a story through the viewpoint of a female protagonist. Namely, there's something fundamentally passive about Sayuri. Everything happens TO her, and everyone acts ON her. She never truly does anything except to react to what the other characters are doing. This is the same problem that marred Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\" and Callie Khouri's \\"Thelma and Louise\\" screenplay. A passive female character does seem more appropriate in \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" but it still gets annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!","review":"This is a wonderful story. Golden brings the characters alive. I read it in one sitting (I stayed up until about 3 in the morning on a school night). Definitely a book that will live on for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was absolutely captivating novel ; a real page turner","review":"Memiors of a geisha by Arthur S. Golden was an absolutely breathtaking and captivating piece.It captures you page after page in the life a geisha. The best part of the novel I would have to say is all of the detail that he puts into the piece. The detail makes you feel like you are right inside of the story and that you are not left with any questions on what is going on in the book.Also what is so captivating about the novel is that the whole story seems like a true account of a real giesha which makes you wan to read cover to cover on what will happen to her . On the whole it was beautiful piece that had suspense , passion , and wonderful detail all brought in to one great novel that once you start to read is very hard to put down ."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Honestly, this is one of my favorite books. I read it my senior year of college and neglected all of my academic work for a week because I could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful eye opener into an incredible culture","review":"I enjoyed this book emensely. Some may call it \\"flowery\\", or too much like a fairy tale, but I couldn't disagree more. The author writes gracefully, and simply enough to carry you through without rereading difficult passages, but at the same time is thought provoking. You will fall in love with Sayuri, for her character is one we can all in some way relate too. True, it was difficult for someone who knew nothing about the life of a geisha beforehand to understand everything, but that only made me want to learn more-like any good book should. I definitely recommend to anyone, from as picky a reader as any!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice twist at the end and good details.","review":"One of the best 3 books I have ever came across. The author provided very fine details not just into how the giesha's 'world' operate and also into an individual's innermost thoughts. I especially like the ending which I thought would be bleak but ........."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enthralling book you will not be able to put down.","review":"This is a wonderful read! You really care about the characters, and the historical details (1930-present) include the Japanese side of World War II. The plot centers upon a poor girl from a fishing village, and the fateful people and events which catapult her to become one of the most famous Geishas in Japan. It is a fascinating book, and I still think about the characters several weeks after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I was mesmerized with every page! I was engrossed with every experience Sayuri encountered. Golden couldn't have perfected it any more. The language that he uses in this book vividly captures the Japanese culture. This book is one of the best I've ever read. I'm anxiously awaiting for Golden's next novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good read.","review":"Entertaining, plus it's informative. It'll give you a better perspective of geishas and their life in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the real story, a lot better than Golden's made up one","review":"I felt so ripped off reading a story written by Arthur Golden that he supposedly got from a \\"real\\" Geisha.. (A man writing about a woman's profession should have been a red flag to me right away) But then find out he embellished and wasn't even writing a true account at all.. Mineko Iwasaki's book (the woman he ripped off) does tell the real story and it's a shame he twisted her words. I wonder if she won the lawsuit against him... And also can't believe how boring and unrealistic the film was that was made about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation according to Mineko Iwasaki","review":"When you read about Mineko Iwasaki's reaction to this book you are thrown so off center. How do I get dreamy and absorbed in a book when the principal source says the author got it wrong and is left angered. Reading this story now will be like walking on a rotted floor--- you just don't know where the holes are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great detail on Japan, catty story","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha provides striking detailed descriptions of the life of a Japanese entertainment worker before and after World War 2. Golden's research is immaculate, as he describes a place and life he could never have seen or experienced. For that alone, the book is a great read for anyone interested in Japan. The story itself is weaker - after a point, the self-absorbed ramblings and snipings between the Geishas loses it's story. The interesting morality plays much be infered with an open mind, as the surface presentation (like much in Japan) is only a small reflection of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing and captivating. Definitely a must read","review":"A great book. Very detailed and ornate descriptions. Intriguing representation of the life of a Geisha and the Chinese culture. I can't believe a man wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent, Low Calorie Novel","review":"Thin characters, thin romance. Seasoned and decorated with cultural descriptions. Written competently in the first person, a pseudo-memoir well handled keeping this reader to the end of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting history lesson","review":"Though a novel, much study has gone into the writing of this story of the life of a geisha. I do believe that this is the best history book that I have read in a long time. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has even the slightest interestin Japanese life in the 1930's."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look at the lifestyle and culture of a Geisha","review":"I enjoyed this book after I got into it, but it started kind of slow. For anyone interested in how a Geisha lived in Japan during the 30's and 40's, this book really gives you the flavor of that lifestyle. The ending was quite abrupt and unexpected, but overall a book worth reading. Hard to believe it was written by an American male."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Geisha's life drawn out","review":"The life of Sayuri as a geisha in Japan could have been told in a more efficient and effective manner. I felt that the story had been \\"padded\\" to lengthen the book, dragging out seemingly insignificant happenings that did nothing to enhance the story. However, I did learn more about the Japanese and their ideas regarding the place of women in their culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but interesting Sayuri was \\"saved\\" by a man.","review":"I was completely drawn into the book, couldn't put it down, just like most of the other reviewers. But looking back I find in interesting that almost all the women are portrayed as without human concern for each other, and in the end we find that it was the male \\"Chairman\\" that saved Sayuri. So it becomes the typical Western Cinderella story. Even the kind Mameha was only acting on the Chairman's behalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"forget sleeping!!!","review":"Couldn't put it down!!! Had me totally spellbound and waiting for the next scene! Almost made me challenge the idea that this story was strictly fiction. Highly recommended. Great weekend book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The heart of a woman, written beautifully by a man!","review":"I am sadly reminded of Princess Diana and of every woman as I am drawn into a world completely foreign to Western culture - this books fascinates with its strange detail, yet reverberates with essential and universal truth. Bravo, Arthur Golden!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautifully Told and Wonderfully Written Story.","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha, by Arthur Golden, is a beautifully told and wonderfully written story. It is the story of a young Japanese girl who is innocently and unknowingly thrust into the secretive world of the Geisha. Golden's writing the story in the narration of the main character is so abosrbing, it's as if he he has given us a driect light into the mind and thoughts of the characters he so colorfully describes ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and a definate page turner","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel immensly. Definatly provides a cultural insight into Japanese traditions. I found it interesting that a Westerner could depict the feelings of a young geisha (who is forced into the trade) with such precision. A very captivating book which makes you fume with rage at some of the injustice that Sayuri <--(I'm not sure if I spelt that right) has to tolerate. While in the process of reading it I thought about nothing except getting back to the book until I finally finished it. Only after I reflected on the reality I was slightly perplexed. The ending seems unprobable and questionable - overall a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the tour-de-force the literary reviewers claimed.","review":"This book is easy to read, and at times the prose is delicate and provocative. But ultimately, the thin characterizations (and absence of motivation for any of the characters), and our heroine's complete lack of an inner life--she goes through life with blinders on, never learning, never changing, never growing--damage this book. I never thought of our narrator as \\"female\\"; she seemed sexless, and she often reacted to things like a man. Arthur Golden, despite the reviews, failed to find a woman's voice and sensibility in which to tell his tale. I found \\"Memoirs\\" superficial and frustrating; I forced myself through to the contrived ending. Golden is an able enough writer; he's just shallow. We've all been duped by great reviews garnered because the subject matter is unusual and exotic. I'm glad I borrowed a friend's copy and didn't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it is too late for such a book","review":"To the reader of 1999 after so many books and films about geishas their is nothing new in this book. The book humiliat the women. As a literature - it is only a colaction of good sentences. The \\"happy end\\" is not an integral part of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCHING!!!","review":"i thought, i wasn't going to have fun reading this book. but i was wrong the moment i read the first paragraph i fell in love with it.i was crying in the part when chiyo and her sister rode the train to kyoto and that Mr. Tanaka said \\" mata yo\\" to them and how they got separated, i was crying so much i can't see what im reading. it just touch me so much i couldn't put the book down until it was finished. for those who want to get a copy. you should get one now!!! because the movie is coming out in the fall. trust me it's really worth the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fascinating exploration into Japan's Geisha community","review":"it was a page-turner. I could not put this book down. Hooked from the first chapter, you follow the life of this Japanese Geisha from about 7 years old until she's in her 60's. If, in addition, you have any interest in japanese culture, you won't be able to put this book down once you start."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an exotic, senstitive and lyrical book.","review":"Golden has done a masterful job of insinuating himself into the mind and the heart of a Japanese woman. He describes her milieu to perfection. The reader is transported in time to Japan, from the year 1929 until the years following World War II. Golden portrays the desperation of the geisha to become successful. He also shows us the hard work, the political infighting and the scheming that are part of the \\"game\\". This book has much to say about the horrible plight of a Japanese woman who depends on others for her livelihood. She has to become the person that others want her to be instead of expressing her own identity. It is heartbreaking. The book has an authenticity and even a poetry that makes it both vivid and unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Restless Hearts\\"","review":"\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a (mostly) critically and popularly acclaimed novel, marketed as a top-notch piece of \\"historical fiction.\\" For that reason, I purchased a copy and read it through to its end. I wish, however, this book had been entitled \\"Restless Hearts\\" (or something similar), as I then would have understood that what I was about to read was actually a romance novel with a \\"historical\\" setting. As to how accurate the novel is in portraying the lives of WWII-era Geisha, I cannot say, as I am neither Japanese, nor a Geisha, nor a WWII-era Japanese Geisha historian. But even assuming that Golden gets his history right, his book is still filled with two-dimensional characters, adolescent themes, and bad plot contrivances. I give it two stars because I enjoyed the writing style. But a well-written book does not necessarily make the story within worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This review refers to the audiobook","review":"It's interesting that I tried to read this book several times, at the recommendation of friends who loved it, however I could never get into it. When I saw this audiobook, I jumped at the opportunity to try again. Having the story told to me by such an outstanding reader made all the difference in the world. I loved the vivid descriptions and the attention to detail. It's truly amazing that a male author could write such a clear picture into the geisha lifestyle with such intrigue, sensitivity and historical accuracy. It's obvious that a lot of research went into this story! I realize that I missed some parts by listening to the abridged version, but now I feel inspired to go back and read the book someday, or at least see the film, which I heard was so visually stunning! This is definitely a fine work that far exceeds all the hype surrounding it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treat!","review":"I loved this book! The simple, almost Zen-like imagery of pre-war Japan was hypnotic. The world of the Geisha is truly a world within a world--one with many twists and unexpected turns. Truly, an education for any Western-born person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I read this year!","review":"I loved this book. I was so sad it was over. The charaters were multi-dimensional. I felt like I knew Sayuri. When I wasn't reading she was often on my mind. I have never read a book about the Japanese culture and this book gave me a new respect and awe for the culture. The author is a very intelligent, sensitive, and insightful man. I would love to read something else by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder how much of it is based in reality.","review":"If this book was a true picture of the life of a Japanese geisha, I was astounded...for many reasons. First and foremost, I was shocked at the lack of value placed on children. Secondly, I was dismayed to learn of the role of women in Japanese culture. Finally, I was saddened to realize that geisha life was probably the best choice Sayuri could have been given.Memoirs of a Geisha has made me want to read more about Japanese culture and history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Woman, Real Feelings","review":"Sayuri - as her name makes her who she is - is a phenomonal character! Whether she is Chiyo, the ignorant child,or Sayuri, the all too mature adult, I felt as though she was telling her story to me in the privacy of her own tea room. This is a fantastic read for anyone who wants to escape the pressures of \\"the real world\\" for Sayuri's challenging world of geishas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arthur Golden fantasizes","review":"This book is a page-turner. I can't speak to its cultural accuracy, but in the context of the novel it was very convincing. What ruined the book was its ending. I won't give it away, but will say that the ending was wrong, wrong, wrong - it completely didn't fit the main character. The ending just confirmed that the author, despite his writing skill, was a man who can't really imagine what it is to be female, or what would really make this geisha happy. It is so sad that a writer with this much talent buys the Hollywood image of women as shallow. The book would have been so much better without the cliched, unbelievable, storybook ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I loved reading about the Geisha in the 30's and 40's. I think I would rather be a Geisha than a Japanese wife of that time period. Is it better today? What would a Geisha think about Goldman's portrayal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read story! Wonderfully done, except for the ending.","review":"I was glued to the words of this book from the beginning. It is erotic, exotic, and so well written you feel as if you are in Japan watching the story unfold. The ending however left much to be desired. I felt that the last 50 pages or so did not do justice to the book. It felt as if the author was suddenly tired of writing and quickly wrote an ending. It lacked the great story telling that the rest of the book has. I would, however, recomend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Through this whole story I thought it was non fiction, until the end when my fellow Lit. group members told me it was not. I couldn't believe it! The story was horrific in many ways, very demeaning to women I thought at first, but these women seem to enjoy the Geisha world, very different from our own. It is a society unto itself, with Geisha who have more power and men to provide well for them, and the underling Geisha in training, some of whom are treated as slaves while learning what it is to be a Geisha. There is much ritual involved and can have a good or horrid end for them. A fascinating read about something I knew nothing about, exept what is on TV. A glimpse into a culture not near my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I love the female fantasies of Geishas, Ballerinas, Bellydancers, Princess and have been wanting to read this book after everyone I know recommended it to me, saying I would love it. I did. So, if you have hesitation because of all the hype and worried it wouldn't live up to expectations, don't worry. I was wondering where it would all go when it opens in a small dreary fishing village, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. The descriptions of the costumes and the life of Geishas were intricatly woven into a beautiful story about a woman you grow to care about deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel to a secret world","review":"There is not much to be said about this book that hasn't already been said. I'd been meaning to read it for years, and when I finally did, I was not disappointed. Golden has created a world that so few of us know anything about. I certainly cannot speak to the accuracy of his depiction of the life of a pre-WWII Geisha, but was captivated none-the-less.His portrayal of the character of Sayuri is not fairy-tale perfect as so many have implied. I found the character believably flawed-particularly in her treatment of Nobu, the gruff-but-kind, disfigured businessman who chooses her to be his mistress. And, even in her later days in New York, she still seemed to maintain an aura of artificiality, as though the role of the Geisha could not be shed.I couldn't help but be swept up in the world Golden has created. The story is well-worth the hype it has generated."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"what more can i say - heart breaking and heart warming at the same time.i really love this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful plain and simple","review":"This story is so epic and intimate at the same time. Mr. Golden envelopes you in Sayuri's world so completely, it's easy to lose yourself and feel as though it's just you and she sitting comfortably having a conversation about her extraordinary life. There are books that come along that are rare and precious ~ this is definitely one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good thought provoking story; wonderfully written.","review":"When the friend who gave me this book to read said \\"let me know how you like it \\" I thought, \\"oh no I'm actually going to have to read it!\\" By reading the title, I thought it was going to be another sex book. On the contrary, it is a novel that is tastefully written. In a nutshell, it is a story about a girl's life and how she came to be a Geisha. It is written in first person and it is as if she is sitting across the table talking about her thoughts and feelings about her life over a cup of tea. It is wonderfully written, each chapter taking you to the next, you will not want to put it down. Someone should make a movie out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a new insight of the life of women in other cultures!","review":"Wow!! What a fabulous book. I want to read more about the Geisha's of Japan, and the stories they have to share. How fortunate we are to have choices that these women were never given!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entrancing Novel","review":"I found this book to be entrancing. It captured my attention from the get go. I fould Golden's descriptions of the Geisha traditions and lifestyle to be beautifully described. Not to mention his ability to capture the essence of Japan during the time period. I felt as though I were sitting in some of those teahouses with Sayuri. Definately a recommended read. Not only entrancing and entertaining but also informative. I now have a new interest in reading more on the Geisha culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing view of life of a geisha in japan","review":"The subject matter of this novel is extremely intriguing. Therefore, it is all the more dissappointing in the telling. The author can't capture the voice of his title character. She is precious and undeveloped. There is very little tension or psychological revelation in the telling. This is an overhyped book, ripe for the Steven Spielberg treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Novel? Written by a Male? Impressive.","review":"Considering this is Golden's first novel written from a female's viewpoint, I'm impressed. I learned much about pre-WW2 Japanese culture; Golden painted his research into the picture without the story turning into an encyclopedia entry. If you like biographies, you would like this book even though it is fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an exotic and vivid book,which will keep you riveted","review":"Initially I was very reluctant to read this novel as it seemed a bit boring from the excerpt I read on the internet. So you can imagine my surprise once I started reading and found myself fully engrossed and completely riveted. I was completely dispossessed of my misinterpretations and wrongful early pre-judgements. Forgetting that I was located in a one bedroom highrise in Chicago, I was completely transported to the teahouses and found myself actually observing the rituals of the geishas and their customers. At times I felt as if I myself were wearing the beautiful kimonos described in the novel. To forget that you are reading much less reading fiction is what I consider a literary work of art, and this is the best way I can sum up Memoirs of a Geisha. Thank you Mr. Golden.Simone A."},{"rating":"2","title":"my oh my","review":"great book, makes you think of stereotypes a bit differently and how other cultures live. One of those books that you need to find out what happens at the end but try not to read the last page first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The girl at the bookstore said she and all her friends just loved it. Was hoping for something alone the lines of Shogun. Wasn't Shogun. Didn't love it. Was tempted to stop reading several times, but hoped it would improve. It took so long to get where it was going. I did learn about the life of a Geisha, but would have preferred something richer. The men, even the Chairman, were mostly jerks and so immature. Drinking contests! The word \\"love\\" was never mentioned. I would have run away, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperess is not wearing any clothes","review":"Note to self: never ever read a book about a woman coming of age - written by a man. The story (was there a story?) plodded along like a sea tortoise - yes, that's the type of lyrical imagery one can expect from Golden. The characters are two-dimensional, stereotypical, and completely uninteresting. I've read romance novels better written than this. The true crime is that Golden has taken a potentially fascinating woman, situation, and era - and rendered it as dry as parchment paper. If it's true Steven Spielberg has optioned this book for the big screen, I predict major rewrites. Read \\"The Red Tent\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Man's Fantasy...I give this book a half star.","review":"Sayuri's a perfect male fantasy: An Asian sex slave with western features (grey/blue eyes). Now, why couldn't she just have been a drop dead gorgeous Japanese woman? Why the colored eyes? But that's not what gets me. Would any intelligent person fall in love with the type of man who takes her away from her dying folks, forces her sister to be a cheap ol' hooker, and pays her way to becoming a dumb little tea pourer? I'm talking about the Fisheries Manager and the man who eventually ended up being her sugar daddy. For Christ sake, these men were old enough to be her father! Talk about pedophelia and hooking. This book is pretty sick...sugar coating the male intent with a very willing female narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintended humour?","review":"Too bad we do not have novels written by geishas or meikosan about the life of an American male writer at the turn of the century. They would be almost as good fun as Memoirs of a geisha.It deserves however two stars because the author made his homework, and the book is indeniably well-researched - even though as many native English speakers he probably never even bothered to learn the language. Only, as far as I can tell, most geishas, including contemporary ones, and their male friends, including European ones, would think that he has understood little of his findings and of Japanese culture in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put this book down","review":"This book is wonderful It encompassed my eevery moment. I planned my day around it-sounds addictive? it is! This story of a young girl turned slave and then to Geisha was heartbreaking and also a success story. I really saw what through a geisha's eyes wha life was like for them:tragedy and continuos criticismt while appearing as they are beautiful and pampered. Until then end of this book, I really believed this book was a true biography. Hats off to the writer for spell binding me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A smooth read, predictable plot","review":"I don't understand the hype about this book. Yes, it's well written, but, as many of its critics have pointed out, the turns of plot and characterization are weak and uneventful. For the first two-thirds of the book we follow the plight of poor Sayuri up until her twenties; the last third wraps up her life, racing through WWII and the American occupation. A pleasant read, but I won't be pushing it on anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"fact vs. fiction","review":"This is a wonderful book. It artistically portrays the life of a Geisha without being obscene. Arthur Golden also brings the setting and characters to life for the reader. Without his skill of being able to completely describe the surrounding in an interesting way, the book would be boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"What a fascinating book! I couldn't put it down.

The most amazing thing about the book was the fact that someone would actually write it. I mean how many times can you go into the way some woman bats her eyes at a man. Ridiculous. Who CARES???? If this is your idea of an interesting book, then you would be easily entertained by a farmer's \\"compelling tale of sheep blisfully munching on green pastures.\\"Sure, you feel sorry for the main character. She has a horrible chilhdood. And sure, it nicely depicts the milieu of her society. But then the book goes on and on about ways and means of handling men. And that's it. I say thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman seeks love in the highly-constrained and formal world of the Geisha","review":"Fate smiles on a comely girl from humble circumstances in twentieth century Japan who finds her way into the profession of Geisha (which translates approximately as \\"art person\\" in Japanese). Our heroine faces many challenges along the way, from a harsh and demanding apprenticeship to the poverty resulting from World War II. The difficulties of navigating the labyrinth that was the painfully formal world of the Geisha, however, made a personal life that included a deep and abiding love very elusive. I still marvel at the finesse employed by the heroine and the author in this truly fascinating quest! The result is a brilliantly formulated and satisfying novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally, a new view of Japan","review":"Personally, I've never been a lover of the Japanese culture, but this book has changed that. It's certainly full of suspense and an excellent romance, but, more importantly, it brings the culture and the times up so close that I felt as though I was a little Japanese girl being raised to become a geisha. I was involved emotionally from the beginning and could picture in my mind the place and every detail of it. I am truly sorry that it is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"BETRAYED!","review":"Arthur Golden painstakingly made this book appear to be a true story. I was so taken into Saruyo's life that I was completely devastated to learn, only at the very end, that the entire story was fictional. The book jacket and \\"translator's note\\" are extremely deceiving. I'm sorry I ever got so involved in the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative writing","review":"I love great historical fiction and Arthur Golden's novel, although not as action-packed as other contemporary best-selling novels like the Civil War's \\"The Killer Angels\\" or WWII's \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\", captures Japanese culture in magnificent fashion. But no matter what type of fiction you like you should read the Memoirs of a Geisha, it is a wonderful, finely-crafted example of what a novel should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and overly pleased with itself","review":"The main character was the least interesting one I'd ever encountered; no original thoughts and no personality. There's no incentive to keep reading when I simply don't care what happens to her! This realization made the author's note even more jarring; his inflated sense of her seems just to reflect his misrepresentation of himself and his abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I haven't finished it yet but from what I have read so far, I love it! It's so much better than the movie and I'd recommend it go those who found the movie confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling novel","review":"The perplexingly inconsistent ending to Memoirs of a Geisha is really the only thing that prevented me from giving the book a five-star review. I won't spoil the novel; I was simply bothered that the ending seemed rushed and lacked credibility when compared with the rest of the story.Golden has created a remarkably nuanced, interesting, and believably human narrator in Sayuri. Her voice is consistent throughout, her failings in plain view of the reader, and her emotions are utterly credible and palpable. The account of the geisha bitterly fighting each other for meagre measures of autonomy and power are comic, engaging, and bleak.Golden does an excellent job of creating a character and seeing her through a challenging life from which she mines out what treasures she can and simply survives the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice book about Japan, Japanese culture and Kyoto","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a pretty good book. Its kinda slow, but its well written and quite interesting. The setting: Kyoto...what a place. This is one of those must see cities. The book I feel makes more sense and one can get more out of it after a trip to Kyoto. Read this book while at the same time look at Pico Iyers: Lady and the Monk 4 Seasons in Kyoto. Those two books plus a trip to Japan make this very worthwile. Its a nice look into a very interesting culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Drawn and depicted","review":"This is a great novel. The characters are so well described and clear, so wonderfully drawn, you can easily see any of the characters in any scene. Sayuri appears like any girl, she is someone with whom one can empathize, and the pre-WWII geisha scene in Gion is painted so vividly that one can hardly believe that this is a novel, not an actual oral memoir. To realize that Golden is really an american man from Tennessee is quite amazing--this book is so well researched and factual that it's difficult to believe he simply write this himself. A definite must-read--amazingly vivid and beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orientalist academic memoirs of a geisha","review":"The generally rave reviews about this book are a little misleading. Many people will try to sell you on its authenticity. I would have prefered reading about the culture of the geisha from the perspective of a Japanese writer rather than an American academic ( the author is a professor in E. Asian studies.) The book doesn't breathe under the western fascination with the minutia of every fold of every garment of the geisha wardrobe. I have a hard time believing that we couldnt wait for a Japanese told chronicle of the same story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated fodder","review":"It's impressive what Arthur Golden has done with this book. I wouldn't have believed that a middle-aged white man could actually write convincingly through an adolescent japanese girl's point of view. The intricate details of the geisha life described by Golden is impressive, along with his knowledge on the subject matter. However, it almost seems superfluous at times, almost to the point of pretentiousness. The story is simplistic with predictable plot turns. The heroine is a modern feminists' nightmare. I kept expecting to see the girl grow up to see herself, and the people around her, for who they really are. But then again, maybe that was Mr. Golden's point. Overall, I think the book is good for wasting time. It's akin to one of those feel-good summer blockbusters which leaves you with nothing but a few, somewhat memorable images and an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. If you're looking for substance, this isn't it. If you decide to read Memoirs, skip the last chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither history nor fiction","review":"This book was introduced to me as good historical fiction. It is neither good history nor good fiction. This book seems to be written by a person smitten by Japanese culture. The author seems to be so interested in talking about the culture that he forgets to build a story with depth and meaning. While the main characters have some depth, the rest seem to be more caricatures than real people. The plot line is all too predictable and offers no surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looked real to a Japanese's eyes","review":"When I picked up this book, I thought that this must be another popular \\"geisha\\" feature by foreign writers which does not have much of a true ring to it to a Japanese's eyes. I am glad that I have misjudged that point. I could not put it down once I started reading. The description was very intense and detailed. It was hard for me to admit the fact that this book is a complete fiction by an American writer, rather than a translated real story told by a Japanese geisha as the story intended to look like. The Japanese tranlation (just released in Japan) tells how well the novel is written to surprise Japanese readers. I can't help admiring this well-researched, lovery Japanese geisha story, which must be very close to the old geisha world in Gion, Kyoto."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read!","review":"Geisha is one of the most wonderful books I've ever read. To see how woman in other countries live, under such adverse conditions, makes me feel lucky to have grown up in U.S. To be able to understand how these woman were brought up and sold into slavery as such. Arthur Golden is the best, the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"This book was such a pleasure to read I couldn't put it down. Very well written; the words flow off the page like liquid silk. The content matter was handled very tastefully, I actually expected it to be more sexy (I couldn't believe it was written by a man). I can't sing the praises of this novel enough. You won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"purely delightful","review":"I must say the only reason i read this book is because all of my friends raved about it. I can honestly say this book, in no way, disappointed me. Memoirs of a Geisha is an excellent book that has a way of building each moment in your head. Golden provided exquisite detail about every aspect in Sayuri's life. Whenever Sayuri was stressed, i felt stressed. Whenever Sayuri was sad, i felt sad. The way he gave the kimonos so much detail, allowed me to paint a picture in my head and at time it seems as if you can feel the silk fabric brushing against your own skin. Arthur Golden is an amazing author who clear puts much effort into his writing. I highly recommend this book for anyone to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I feel this book was written in a fashion on which we see from two POVs. The character is always filled with her own options and opinions, but is a great listener. This is one of those books that can also be very educational, so you learn more about the geisha's life in Japan, but also get a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow what a story!","review":"it's the story of how a young girl and her sister are sold. chiyo, the youngest, tells her story of how she grew up as a maid in a okiya into sayuri, a geisha.its a wonderful book and i found it so hard to believe it was fiction! and written by a man! i never really liked the idea of geisha and that there job was to serve men but i acually found myself wishing along with chiyo that she'll become one.it's beautifully written and has convinced me that i'd like to see Japan, something i've never wanted to do before.there was one thing i wasn't sure about, the ending. i won't give it away, but it's happy and i just think maybe it's too perfect.chiyo/sayuri's struggles, optimism and never ending determination just add to the complete beauty that surrounds her.definitly one of my favourite books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated and disappointing","review":"A predicatable Japenese story full of stoicism and brutality. Intially a tragic story of a young girl kidnapped and then orphaned. She dreams of becoming a geisha. However once you realise that the life of a geisha is one of little consequence, salivating to every man's simplest whim you begin not to care. The men are vile. Japen seems full of cultural anoxerics! A book for only the most dedicated Japanophiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable character, writing so-so","review":"The story was basically interesting, but the character unsympathetic. He treatment of Pumpkin (her de facto sister) and Nobu (her suitor) were abominable, but she just didn't seem to get it. I had pity for her at first, but that quickly faded. And the writing was quite lacking in imagery much of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"This book had it's up and downs, but was ultimately very slow-paced. It is OK if you don't mind reading 5 pages about walking down a dirt road or observing a rock on a sidewalk, to put it one way. The writing is good and even humorous. The author is impressive in his ability to relate events from a woman's perspective.I could not get pulled in and would never have finished it, were I not required to read it for a bookclub.I, too, was disappointed that there was not more emphasis on the \\"art\\" of being a geisha. Also, the back of the book mentioned that she had to find a new life after the war and the geisha houses closed, but she just took up being a geisha again ultimately. That didn't seem like any great new freedom or beginning.I can see why people found it interesting, but if it doesn't grip you after the beginning, don't look for it to improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say, I couldn't get past the first two chapters.","review":"What is all the raving about. It's hard to enjoy a book when you have no interest in the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"reviewers prose indicative to credibility of their rating.","review":"Just an observation; notice how the prose of the reviewers, that so gratiously, submitted their 5 star ratings...their own insightful review parallelled the authors writing. There is a difference between prose and prozaic. The reviewers that were OVER-generous with ONE star, have the intelligence and sardonic wit, as demonstrated cleverly in their reviews, that they will learn to stay away from the bestseller list. As for me, after 10 pages, I concluded that he's not a writer- maybe a storyteller, but mostly a typist. I'd rather watch paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"An extremely disappointing and pedestrian novel that simply does not warrant the media hype it has received. The language is flat and without depth. The prose is mundane. A good editor would have cut the redundant sentences and tightened the narrative. This story of severe child abuse and misogyny is not redeemed by moral insight or cultural lesson. If it hadn't been a bookclub selection, I would have set it down after the first three chapters and spared myself the sickening sense of voyeurism that comes with witnessing senseless human cruelty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I have always been fascinated by the life of a geisha, so naturally I bought this book. I have just started reading again for leisure (during college I didn't have time). This is the best book I have ever read, I could not put it down. I had to remind myself that it was almost all fiction. I don't have the words to describe how great this book was. I became engrossed in the characters (especially Chiyo/Sayuri) and couldn't wait to see what would happen next. If you want a good book, or are interested in Japanese culture and geishas, I highly recommend this book. I hope that I can find another book as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting..","review":"As the name of this book suggests, the book is all about, well, memoirs of a geisha.. :-)Before I read this book, all I knew about a geisha is that she's a Japanese girl who provides entertaining and lighthearted company to men. Nothing else I knew.. However, this story revolves around a geisha and with every page I turned, I got to know more.The strong point of the story is the way the memoirs have been presented. The way the entire plot has been weaved, makes it an intersting read.In fact, it was after reading the book that I was even more interested to watch the movie when it hit the theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written by a guy, what?","review":"One thing that amazes me about this book is the author's non-cliche perspective. He really fuses a non-male (not to be gender stereotypical, okay, I am) voice and gives this girl-woman such a feminine thought process. The character is a wonderful introduction to the mysterious and electrifyingly seductive world of the Geisha and her role in Japanese life. It's a fascinating read about people and how they strive to better themselves and this book is a beautifully written, rich delve into watershed landscapes, fabrics, blossoms, and love and obsession, and how a girl becomes a woman and learns the art of emotional foreplay. Of course it became a film and rarely do movies do books justice and in this case, the book is the keeper. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and touching tale","review":"Haunting and delicious, Memoirs of a Geisha was truly a book that made me want to read more. The detail, thought and vocabulary painted an increadible tapestry which danced in my mind. The story line was believable and well researched. It's unbelievable that a the life of a girl to woman would be so well captured by a man. I would recommend this book to anyone who ever wanted to be sucked into the pages of a book.That worst part of this novel was that it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful except for one tiny detail","review":"Golden has hit the mark on Japanese culture and lifestyle with this book.The traditional ideas of custom and behavior are perfect.Suri, the main character, is easy to like and easy to identify with despite cultural differences with the reader.The only flaw is that the ending is a bit sugary. However, I liked Suri so much that I didn't mind giving her that bit of happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 word...AMAZING!","review":"This is by far the best book i have read in a long time. you sympathize with chio (later sayuri), you celebrate with her, and you feel everything that she feels. the books begings when she is forced to become a geisha. you follower her as the begings her schools..gets kicked out of her schooling, finds new hope with the man she loves. You feels so sorry for her becasue she lives with such a mean lady. hatsumomo..i belive is her name..and belive me..those 2 face lots of trouble. her life is saved because a geisha agrees to train her. and you see her life begin to slowly get on track after hatsumomo ruined it. i know this review is sorta scatterbrained..but belive me..you dont want to muss out on the bookoh..and if you saw the move..dont let that discourage you..the book is 10 times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transports You","review":"I have now read this book twice. I can only do this with good stories. I re-read Rebecca and Little Women and Memoirs of a Geisha. The book transports you to another world. You find yourself forgetting that these men all have wives at home and taking the side of the geisha. As I read, I wish to wear a kimono and have my hair styled elaborately. If you are looking for a good story and to also learn much about Asian culture, then I suggest you buy this book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never use this seller","review":"This book was rated in \\"like new\\" condition. It smelled like the seller went to their great, great, great Grandmothers very damp cellar to send us this book. It smells so bad my daughter can hardly breathe when she reads it. It was not even worth the penny I paid for it & it does not deserve the 1 star rating. I'm sure glad my daughter doesn't have asthma, she wouldn't be able to read it. The only positive thing about this seller is it came in a timely mannor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"I usually try to refrain from buying a book when it's a bit too popular, and I should have followed my own guidelines this time. I'm very sorry but I just had to say that this was the most boring thing I've ever read in my entire life, and I read everything! I took it to the beach with me last year and it almost ruined my vacation it was so bad. There's no action, no sex, no character development, nothing happens, you don't find out any of the good stuff, please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"I find it very hard to believe that in the 30s and 40s the Japanese culture, one of the most esteemed cultures in the world, would train young girls for the exclusive pleasure of men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely nothing imaginative, bad writing","review":"Yes, I did finish this book. I am a 27 year old female, conservative, college educated, and I have read a few good books. This was certainly not one of them. Characters are so simplified, either \\"GOOD\\" or \\"BAD.\\" I felt as if I were reading an essay of some nonimaginative woman who was trying to make everyone feel sorry for her. Just because it made it to a bestseller list, does not mean it is worth reading. Jerry Springer's show was popular too but we all know how 'good' that was. This book is in the same category.Do not waste your time on this book, I felt sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"I read this book for the sex and was disappointed. There was none. The story was o.k., but the details put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"Book binding is extremely poor on the original and the replacement book. Pages look like they have been cut by a blind man who has had a whiskey or seven. Manufacturing process is very bad and no body checks what they send out. In addition, if I could have left \`no stars' for the review I would have but Amazon do not allow \`0' stars, extremely unprofessional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This is one of the best books of our time. It is eloquently written and full of beautiful imagery. Even some four years after I read it, I still consider it one of the best books I have ever read. It is a beautiful piece of work. This is a \\"must-read\\". I have not met a person who has read this book and not loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A forgetable book","review":"My book group chose this book and I was quite excited as I usually enjoy books that focus on cultures other than my own. I am not quite finished and probably wouldn't choose to finish if not for my group. I care very little for any of the characters, the conflicts are not well developed, and the description of Japanese culture is weak. There is so much more I would like to know about this culture and these lives - the depression, the war, the social structure. It all seems so \\"surface\\" and generally unsatifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath-Taking Until the End","review":"Like a gorgeously layered kimono, Memoirs gradually unfolds to reveal the courage, love, daring, and hope of an intensely human and surprisingly modern woman. This book started off very well. The story was very interesting and quite addictive. But the ending seemed rather empty. It appeared as if Golden was trying to quickly tie up all loose ends. But despite the rather disappointing ending, nine-tenths of the novel was absolute breath-taking literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I thought this book was extremely well written. The fact that the author is a white male writing about the life of a Japanese geisha is an awe in itself! I didn't find it boring at all and read it in a span of 2 days! Anyone who hasn't read it should!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was drawn into \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" from the first page.","review":"I had to keep reminding myself that \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" was a work of fiction. I have receintly become interested in the romantic Geisha of Japan and have \\"read-up\\" on real Geisha history. Though I am far from learned on the subject, all I read about the fictional Chiyo and her life as a Geisha within Memoirs pages rang true to my prior historic readings. Anyone who has ever wondered about this exotic world and loves a good authentic ficton will enjoy this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was captivated with the story until the last quarter of the book when the detail became too tedious and the choices the characters made became too cliche. I'm mad I spent so much time on this long book when I could have been reading something of substance. Too corny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, unusual book","review":"I found this to be a really different book. I am not usually interested in \\"memoir\\" style books but this was excellent. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and stunning tale!","review":"I never thought I would be very interested in the life of a geisha. I was soon entranced and delighted by this wonderful, engrossing novel. The fact that it is written by a man in the first person of a woman is just a hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insiders peak in to a mysterious and fascinating world.","review":"I truly could not put this book down. It kept me up later than I care to admit. The story of Sayuri's life was so fascinating that I forgot it was fiction and actually told someone that it was a biography. Japanese culture has often seemed mysterious and fascinating, Arthur Golden's book has just re-enforced it. Sorry I'm finished reading it, thrilled it will be made in to a movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever technique, but story lacks \\"oomph\\"","review":"I found the cleverness of this book, framed as a memoir of a real geisha including translator's note, almost outdid the content of the story. An enjoyable read as insight into a different culture, but a less descriptive book lacking the emotion of such writers as Amy Tam and Arundhati Roy. Certain chapters contain interesting moments, but overall there is a lack of connection with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Pb than Au","review":"It is, at least, mind stultifying to read an amazon.com review whose writer finds it necessary to explain that \\"geisha\\" does not mean \\"prostitute.\\" While the CBS smotherage of the Winter Olympics was wall-to-wall cultural arrogance and ignorance, surely America outside of the air-heads of the electronic media is more aware than you amazonians think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was transported ----through this book. I lovedit.","review":"It was great. My kids accused me of zoning out and asked if it really was that good. but I really loved all the feelings and descriptions. I really felt like I was there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic and Yet Familiar","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a fiction in the format of an as-told-to autobiography about a little girl removed from her impoverished household and put in the service of a Kyoto teahouse. It is absolutely compelling reading because we can identify with the main character's struggle for recognition as she combats poverty, obscurity and jealousy among her rivals to become a popular and respected geisha.At the same time, we become aware of how very different the Japanese cultural context is, and just how the geishas filled out their role in that context. The book is set during the last flowering of the traditional geishas, the prewar 1930s and 1940s, when geishas were paid entertainers, not just party girls and certainly not prostitutes as is often thought.Memoirs of a Geisha makes compelling reading with human emotions that get the reader hooked and exotic period detail that fascinate all the while. Reading it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reminder of things and times gone past","review":"This story makes you realize the fact that time does pass, and with it the fantasies we've carried with us all along. If you cry when you think of what has passed you by, and you want to cry....read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and cartoonish","review":"I'm so glad to see that I am not the only person in the world who didn't like this book. The descriptions of the geisha life were interesting (assuming they are true - after all, this IS a work of fiction), but the characters generally were one-dimensional (either good or bad), the dialogue unbelievable, and the plot was like a badly-written soap opera. I plowed through it, but it really was not a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book Inspires!!","review":"I found this book to be one of those things that you come across once in a great while that just makes you take a deep breath and sigh with the satisfaction that you are somehow different after reading it. I think those of you who say the book is flat and unemotional are not reading it with keeping the context it's written in in mind. This is the Japanese culture, where 'saving face' is everything, and showing emotion is considered weak. So although you may not always learn the true feelings of Sayuri, you are not supposed to be reading this story as YOU would have told it. That's important to keep in mind. The story is true to not only the anthropoligical facts, but also the Japanese culture. It is wonderfully written and an enchanting tale. I completely recomend it to anyone who wants to learn a little about the Geisha's world as well as their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"My Book Club chose Memoirs of a Geisha to read this month, so I was looking forward to the read, and was majorly disappointed. The little cat fighting and tricks the in-training geisha did to each other were so trite and sophomoric. It seemed like a man's idea of what women do to each other, and I found it insulting--not to mention shallow, flat and poorly written. I was hoping for a rich, many layered history and story of what, I am sure, is a respected and artistic endeavor unique to the Japanese culture. Instead, I read about silly squabbles a la Joan Collins and Linda Evans on Dallas! Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it enjoyable!","review":"Unlike a lot of other reviews, I found the book facinating. Yes, it focused on these women and their interactions with men, that being all they thought about, were occupied with. That's the POINT, they are geishas, men WERE their lives! I liked the author's writing style, I prefer to read first person, and I thought Golden's words were very readable. The ending was a little disappointing, but true to life, things don't always work out perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry: Over-rated","review":"Sorry, but I couldn't finish the book. By the time I realized I was over half way through and I still wasn't hooked to the story line, I bailed out. There was one too many \\"Oh, but the Chairman\\", \\"Look what pretty eyes she has\\", and \\"It was years later I learned\\". I really expected more of a cultural insight vs cat-fighting perspective. I had hoped for more insights to the \\"artisan\\" aspect of geisha life, vs the bidding war for the mizuage.....I must say on the positive side that there are many clever descriptive passages (but even these wore thin as the pages dragged on). (Ref below reviews: Can't believe it was written by a man either...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rewrite of Oliver Twist in Japanese kimono drag","review":"Poor little Japanese girl is dragged off to be a geisha and she is so nice and is so mistreated but not to worry -- she meets some johns who are nice to her -- and she triumphs in the end. A university student goes abroad and picks up enough Japanese cultural tidbits to transport Dickens' tale of Oliver Twist to Japan. Why anyone thinks this male fantasy of geisha life has any resemblance to reality is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived, sexist, and totally western","review":"The writing and imagery were undisputably well-polished, but in every other aspect of good writing, this novel failed miserably. The characters are two-dimentional and predictable--even the main character never comes to any realization about the degrading position she has been put in all these year. Her self-retribution lies solely in a man's love, not something a feminist or any logical person would argue, I'm sure. I get sick just thinking about the way the main character throws herself at this man she reveres almost as a god. In addition, the author writes in a style that he believes to be \\"eastern.\\" I've never heard worse \\"eartern\\" writing in my life. Overall, this book was a very UNpleasent read, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"This wonderfully written novel captured my interest a once and didn't lose it, even after I finished reading it. It's hard to believe it's only a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs Of Geisha","review":"This book is brilliant! I have not read a book cover to cover in years. Everytime I went to put is down, I would say \\"Just one more chapter!\\" You will never believe that this book is Fiction. You feel for the heroin in the book and you feel what she feels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating novel","review":"It's been a while since I felt deeply immersed in such a story. The story is truly believable, not to mention beautifully detailed as well. As a college student, I never felt so entertained during my winter break since every morning I look forward to reading this book (the entire day)! Overall, it's an excellent story since reading it feels as if I myself were actually viewing the whole story on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first glimpse into the world of geisha -","review":"This book, despite its many flaws (above all the less-than-fair descriptions of Japanese male characters), is a good attempt to shed light on the often mysterious and misunderstood world of geisha.Geisha is a form of art and an eloquent expression of culture - not a high-class call girl service many Westerners' wishful thinking has led them to believe.The author quite capably describes Sayuri's life as an artist and an embodiment of amazing tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must read\\"","review":"I couldn't put this book down! The vivid descriptions of Sayuri's life in Japan made me feel like I was there. With each chapter, my curiosity grew. Would she succeed as a geisha? Would Nobu become her danu? Would she become more powerful than the evil geisha she lives with? What would become of her sister? Of Pumpkin? The ending was almost too good to be true. Get ready to crave rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joyful story and exquisite writing style...","review":"This book is two things: a entertaining, insightful story about a young woman on a journey and a tremendous work of literature.Sayuri's story is fascinating. Her life and her struggles captivated me. She is a real, yet magnificent woman. Following her life teaches the reader how to dream, how to deal with hardship and how to be a friend. I purchased the book from an Indian woman at the Toronto airport, she said to me, \\"This is a great book. I still miss the main character.\\" The detail and description of the way of life of a geisha is extremely informative and interesting.The metaphorical language used by Golden flows through the book as water flowing down a stream. The book is a true work of art, as beautiful as a French Impressionist painting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that draws you right into the world of geisha","review":"From the very beginning, I was completely drawn into this book. Nitta Sayuri's life, though fiction, is fascinating. The book is even more enthralling knowing that Arthur Golden spent so much time researching geisha culture before writing it, so you know it is based on fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Story","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha captivated me from beginning to end. The story is a little slow at times but kept my attention with the anticipation of how her life will unfold next. I was so enamored of the book that I ran out the next day and bought the DVD.......while the movie is visually stunning, the storyline is weak. They glazed over too much of the important detail and changed situations to suit the boundries of a screenplay. The book is so much stronger than the film version portrays. A worthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away..","review":"Seriously, I am still clueless why this book got so many folks raving about. This is one of the most boring books I have read. There is nothing in this about Japanese culture other than explaining how to stitch, press and wear a 'Kimono' (literally atleast about 50 pages of this book talks about kimonos). And if anything I would consider this book to be derogatory about the Japanese because the only way Japanese gents are shown in this book is idling, drinking, ranting while some poor girl (geisha) tries her wits on him for the money she has got. In fact I disliked it so much that my review might feel as if I have a grudge on the author. Stay away from this or read it yourself to see what I mean.-Santhosh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story you will never forget","review":"Step inside the world of geisha.. a paramount novel that will tease your senses into depths of sadness,longing and joy until you reach the end and you want the story to keep going. The underlying theme plays on the emotion of love at first sight.. If you are a romantic at heart, the novel will seduce and draw you in to experience one of the most celebrated novels.."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gorgeous book","review":"This was the first book my book club picked and it was so good that it has been difficult to find others that are as worthy of so much praise.The book follows the life of a gesiha in Kyoto from the time she is a young woman until she is elderly. Throughout Sayuri's life we see how she matures from a young and frightened child to a woman of wisdom and substance.This is an absolute must-read for anyone interested in Japanese culture. It is apparent that the author is an expert in this field and he teaches us without it being overbearing.Beuatifully elegant and mesmerizing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Took my breath away.","review":"This book is the best piece of Modern Fiction I have read in a long time. I had just finnished suffering through a handmaids tale when someone recommened Memoirs of a geisha my thought were only that it was modern fiction (like handmaids tale), had sex in it (reading graphic decriptions of sex is not my cup of tea) so I thought I was plunging head first into a handmaids tale set in Japan. My friend assured me that I would love it so I began. I am a very stubern person but I came out after finishing the book with tears. It is a magical book with characters that are so real I could almost hear their voices speacking. The sex in it is well done, with the story about a geisha it's kind of hard for there to be none, but it is tame. I know it happend and thats enough. I would strongly recommend this book to every one, it is a book you will love and read again and again. If you are thinking of giving it as a present I would not give it to anyone younger that 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"exotic memoir","review":"I think this is a reasonably interesting and challenging read, though it is wordy. I thought the recollections of the World War II era and the other historical sidelights added to my knowledge. I thought the first half of the book, in which the girl is torn away from her family in her little fishing village (also from her sister),while very sad, was a little better- told than the second half, though this is actually a straight line success story, from abject poverty to great success, since in the latter half of the book her relationships are with notably successful Japanese businessmen. Her apprenticeship, beset by jealousies, was interesting, with its many informative pages about the geisha's necessary talents, such as dancing and tea-service. There are many scenes in teahouses throughout. Her elaborate coiffure, while not comfortable for her, also caught my interest. The book is tediously wordy, however. I thought the scenes with the baron were amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Need another Fix...","review":"When my sister offered to lend me her copy of Memoirs of a Geisha, I nearly turned it down wondering aloud how good can a book about a Geisha be when it's written by a caucasian man. How was I to know I'd never put the book down?! It's hard to believe that Sayuri is not an actual person. It can't be!! =P Much of her life reminded me of another lady I know who told me her vague story about her life as a dancer in her country and why she gave it up. Very realistic. I only wished all books I've picked up were as interesting and fluid as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"memories of better books keep coming to my mind","review":"As a youth I enjoyed reading Clavel's Shogun as well as C.W. Nicol's Harpoon. Bonchi and Musashi are other novels of early Japan I enjoyed.So I didn't think twice about picking up a copy of this book. I regret I payed so much for it even though it was on sale. Fortunatley, a used book store offered me a good trade.Poorly written and quite booring. Ten years of research may have provided the author with ample facts to assemble. but he should have spent more time developing a style with which to write it. It gave me no feel for the main character or her life. Lifeless and colorless best describes this book.I hope the screen writer is better with the movie than the author was with this book. I highly doubt I will watch it except briefly on TVThe only good thing is that like Titanic which was a good film and the recent Pearl Harbor which was a turky it causes interest in the geisha and the time period from which they came."},{"rating":"1","title":"read this with a sceptical eye","review":"I first read this book 5 years ago when I knew very little about Japan, its cultures and geiko themsleves. On first read, it is an appealing book because it allows you into a foreign, unknown world, through the eyes of a geiko.HOWEVER - some of the language Golden uses is ridiculous, with many americanisms thrown in for good measure. The ridiculous metaphors and similies used made me feel irritated at some points. I even saw some spelling mistakes!If you're looking for a truthful, entertaining read, get Minkeo Iwasaki's book instead - written by a japanese woman, who was a geisha!A mildly entertaining book, until you realise that most of what is written is some middle aged, american man's fantasy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item!!","review":"I ordered the movie Memoirs of a Geisha. What I received was a book titled Memoirs of a Geisha. I want the item I ordered!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definitely a \\"must read\\" !","review":"This is a light reading and very captivating at the same time. Whether you are a reader or not, I'm sure once you start this book, you will not be able to put it down as you walk down memory lane through Sayuri's life as a peasant child to a world famous geisha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap operatic fluff","review":"So yeah, the guy reads, speaks and writes Japanese; that does not mean the novel is therefore unassailable. It reads like a romance novel. How anyone can classify this as a stunning work of modern literature is beyond me.I found the book insipid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"Thought this wasn't a 'guy book' because of the title/cover. Picked it up after my wife read it and loved it! A close competition between this book and Gates of Fire for the best book I've read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesha! Am I alone here?","review":"I must admit that I'm confused about the appeal of this book. I'm reading it as part of a book club, and never have I struggled so much to get through a single volume. I'm generally open to works outside of my normal interests, but I find this tedious book so overburdened with period detail and misplaced epochal reverence that I don't think I can finish it. While the general subject may be somewhat interesting, the story becomes obscured by the obsessive adoration the author has for the phenomenon of geisha. I'm afraid I'll have to learn the ending from my book club mates, unless, of course, they feel the same way I do and don't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Insight!!","review":"This book really gave fascinating insight about a Japanese underground culture that modern people will not otherwise experience. Reading \\"Geisha\\" will uncover a world of women who are so much more than prostitutes, they are women of hardship and grace. I just hope others enjoy the book as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Western- and Phallocentric Japanese Woman's Voice?","review":"I wonder why a white male author invented an Asian female voice to tell a eurocentric and phallocentric story ... S/he tells us that no rape occured following the war, as a matter of fact, American soldiers handed out candy to the children of Japan. S/he tells us that the dream of a little girl from a fishing village is to catch the right (read: wealthy) \\"eel.\\" S/he tells us that marble floors in train stations signify cultural/national greatness. Unfortunately too many people are reading him and listening to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kimono fetishist","review":"I'm being harsh, but the constant repetition of the details of kimono and hairstyles took up a huge proportion of the books 400+ pages that could have been used to give us some insights. Why any man would be interested in the women portayed here, let alone pay forunes for their company is beyond me.... The women are not the only characters sold short; a doctor reduced to a sweat whilst treating a cut on the thigh of a 15 yr old ...please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still hear her voice in my head.","review":"It's been several weeks since I finished Memoirs and I can still hear the Geisha's voice in my head. I can't believe she's a fictional character; I feel as though I've met her. I want to meet her! This is a lovely, lovely story -- not a novel, a story. Put it in your shopping cart; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic reading!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Very well written. The characters come alive for you and you find yourself not wanting to ever put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of a Geisha - excellent !! ---- Love story - who cares!","review":"I really enjoyed the book as it had an unbelievable amount of information about the life of a geisha and the training that is needed to develop the young girls. It was so real that at the end of the story I still was wondering if it were a true story or not. The love story and the triangles that made up the novel could have been trashed as it was a little too 'soap opera' for me. All in all a very good book to educate those who thought geishas were \\"hookers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic and sweeping, it will captivate you","review":"A lovely, complex, and engaging tale which was never dense or dull and often extremely moving. Though Golden's specialty is the small details in each scene, they come together to tell a story whose momentum is powerful; I found this hard to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Could not put it down.","review":"Interesting characters and a memorable love story. Very informative as to culture and life of geisha."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"I found this book to be totally engrossing. I cared about the characters, and was fascinated by the life of the geisha. But most importantly, to me anyway, was how the author did not take the low road, or sputter out in the end, as so many authors do.How many times have I read a book, to become involved with the story, the character, the events taking place only to have the author seemingly run out of energy or ideas and simply end the story the easiest way out? I appreciated the way the Mr. Golden followed through with his ideas, thoughts and characters, and allowed them to find a satisfying conclusion.Also, I had to keep reminding myself that a man wrote this book....so few seem to be able to portray women in any kind of realistic way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to go to New York","review":"Even tho I knew going into the story it was fictional, by the end I was asking myself the question 'If I go to New York will I see her on a street corner?' - that's how involved I became in the story. I thought it was a wonderful 'read' and I have suggested to everyone I know who enjoys a good story to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mu husband even enjoyed the book, and he never reads!","review":"I felt transported to a different life that could never be imagined. It was magical and tragic! To be treated so royally and so poorly all at the same time is amazing. I found this a book hard to put down, always wanting to know what would happen next. I read it in a few days. It was pure entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent--with one or two flaws","review":"When I saw the title I had some misgivings about this book which were happily unfounded. The story was both absorbing and extremely convincing. The only problem I had with the book was the endless similies the heroine utters. They were a little annoying. But this minor quip aside, reading \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" was a wonderful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character development too thin to create important work","review":"The world described in Geisha is fascinating, largely because so little is generally known about it. However, what we are left with at the end is a fairly superficial look at it and the people in it. The character development that could have made it a lasting work of writing, is so thin as to render it little more than an extended \\"TV show\\" experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining plot; lame prose","review":"If you're looking for a fluffy romance novel, this is a good book for you: there's even the added benefit of feeling you're getting educated in another culture. The plot moves quickly and the story is absorbing.If, however, you're looking for good literature, I have to say that Geisha falls very short. Mr. Golden's prose is awkward and cliched. His style is to pummel you with one cliched metaphor after another. In fact, if you consider yourself a connoisseur of good prose, you might have a hard time making it through the story.Overall, fun story, miserable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down. I hated finishing it. I wanted more","review":"I felt like I was there with Sayuri the whole time. I could feel her pain. What an amazing woman written about by a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but implausible","review":"Perhaps I'm jaded after living in Japan for many years, but I don't find this book as fascinating as so many others do. Why should people be so amazed that a man can actually write a woman's character?The implausibility of this well-written, but for me, finally unfulfilling book, is that no geisha would ever even think of spilling her secrets out to anyone. That's what surprises me, since the author is obviously extremely well-versed in Japanese and Japanese culture.It does not rank up there in my list with the great novels of recent memory. Read Delillo's \\"Underworld\\" to find masterful modern writing at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny Corny Corny","review":"The information was fascinating but the groaners! They kept coming and coming and coming like the waves breaking on the shores of our island, Japan. Like a hungry tiger at the edge of a herd. Like the hummingbird dipping at the nectar of a beautifully blooming flower...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I thought this book was trite, contrived, and poorly written. Even though I am not very acquainted with things Japanese, it smelled false and exploitative to me.I realize that it's difficult to \\"novelize\\" a cultural tradition--especially when it's targeted to readers outside of the native culture--but I think the author used every Western convention to make this book appeal, and therefore it suffers from a romance novel-type whitewash that, in the end, just doesn't ring true.Read this if you want some mind candy. It works on that level. As something that might provide insight on Geisha history, it's pretty fishy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bibbiti, bobbiti, boo-san.","review":"Have you noticed how many of the readers reviewing this book compared the story to \\"Cinderella,\\" and how many complained about the author's overuse of metaphors?Gosh, and there's a character named \\"Pumpkin\\"! And the evil woman with whom Sayuri goes to live is her \\"[step]mother,\\" complete with some wicked stepsister types hanging around! And Sayuri's big crush, who \\"rescues\\" her, is called \\"[Prince]Chairman\\"! How many more can YOU find! Mr. Golden, your overall metaphor was painfully obvious enough without such \\"clever\\" clues.It is just appalling to realize we live in a world where so many people love a book like this. But I guess it shouldn't be a surprise -- look how many Harlequin romances sell. I wish these women who adore this romaticized junk about submissive, helpless women would give really good books -- including well-written romantic fiction, if that's what you like; there's nothing wrong with that! -- a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book (except for the ending)","review":"This was a truly captivating book - Golden obviously was thorough in both his research and also the Japanese use of language. The descriptions in the book really give us insight into both pre-war Japan and also a different cultural mindset. Although Amy Tan writes about the Chinese and Chinese-American culture, this book reminded me a bit of her work, as I had the same sense of learning about a woman's role in Asian culture. The main flaw with this book is the trite ending - the love of her life, which is someone she met in passing as a girl, is the least developed character and unworthy of Sayuri. The novel deserved a less story-book ending, after such a realistic portrayal of the Geisha lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than you'd expect","review":"I picked up this novel because I saw a trailer to the movie and I thought the movie looked interesting and was thereby convinced the book was worth the read.This book is compelling in many ways but I think the thing that makes it most compelling is somehow Golden manages to make the voice of the character feel translated without making it an overbearing experience.He does not give rationale for each activity that Sayuri participates in because it is her life story and he is very good and just leaving it at that, an inexplicable want of the person who's story is being told.If you want a traditional, all ends tied up, everything completely satisfying, all comes together in the end type of book don't choose this one. If you're looking for a well-written fictional biography that does not attempt to be formulaic I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book","review":"Easily one of my favorite books, has to be read to be appreciated. Below my review, reviewer Zack brings some interesting points to the table, some of which I agree with. But overall I find this book has great depth and provides a broad yet detailed description of the culture in which Sayuri develops. I know I will read this book again. Just like Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevski. You always find something that you missed on the first read of a great book! And it always moves you, no matter how many times you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite read","review":"This was a selection for our book review club and my personal \\"best book of the year\\" for 2000. It paints a haunting picture of a young, poverty-stricken girl who is sold into the geisha profession and what becomes of her. It was difficult for me to believe that the author was male as his descriptions of her emotions, professional wardrobe and daily life seemed so realistic. Truly a most enjoyable and informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Beautiful writing, fabulous story! I was lost in this book & did not want to find my way out! I still have not found a book that matches the beauty of Memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will draw you in from the very first page.","review":"I absolutely loved this book, despite how cruel a portrait it is for women to read. It will draw you in immediately and keep you reading till the last page. However, I agree w/ the other reviews, the end seems rushed and far too pretty for this raw and honest book. Nonetheless, bravo to Mr. Golden for the precise detail and narrative that Memoirs of a Geisha holds. If you want a page turner, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely enthralling!!","review":"I absolutely love and adore this book. I couldnt put it down!! I kept telling myself, \\" One more chapter!!\\" It was excellent, I found myself enraptured by this novel. I finished it in three days!! A very worthwhile, enjoyable read. I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating story with an enchanting heroine","review":"I could not put this book down! As the story unfolds, you feel captivated to keep reading, the imagery makes you feel like you are there and the characters seem so real! I would definitely recommend this book -- I honestly can't understand the negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"story does'nt start until near the end of the book.","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. After all the great reviews it recieved i expected to be entranced by the story sorry to say it was a chore to get through. The first 22 chapters seem to go nowhere only towards the end of the book does the story of the character Sayuri begin to make any progress and starts to become somewhat interesting. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!!","review":"This novel is unlike anything I have read before. It is unbelievable that this was written by a MAN from the US. I felt as though I had been immersed in this world. When I put the book down (which was hard to do) I felt that my perceptions had changed - the colors in the world seemed somehow brighter. Somehow the author turned the written word into a visual experience. It was an incredible novel that I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL,CONSUMING,MEMORABLE BOOK","review":"I loved this book very much , but for some reason did not know that this was not a true story....I'm glad I learned that at the end of the book or it would have spoiled it for me. It was excellent and so beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really loved this book","review":"this is one of the most beautiful books i have ever read. i love it. i recommend it to everyone i come in contact with."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I must say to my American readers","review":"I am Japanese. I have a gradfather who often played with geisha. I have to tell my loving American frineds that this story is only a fairy tale, much of which is not the truth. We, Japanese people, can tell this is written by someone who only knows the surface of Japanese culture.Please read other Japanese novels that are written by Japanese writers. I feel as if this book is manupulating innocent American people who simply like to know about our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone!","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was one of the best books I've ever read. Sayuri takes you back to Japan to the time when you couldn't walk down the street without seeing a beautiful geisha on her way to a party or outing of some sort. Through the challenges the war brought upon her, to her challenging times spent with Nobu and Hatsumomo, Sayuri found the stregnth to to continue. This is definently a book I'd sugest buying. For ages 13 and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book reminded me of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Yes, an original idea and some interesting language, but if you take away the dressing, you have a very stereotypical book. Stereotypical of what? Of both Cinderella, and of your typical romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, charming, reads like you were there","review":"I bought this book knowing it was fiction. I read this book believing it was nonfiction. Arthur Golden tells Sayuri's story like her best friend, capturing all the emotions that only a best friend would know. I was completely captivated by her story and read the entire novel in 2 days. Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read! This book is a must!","review":"This book should be read by anyone who want's to get loss in a good read"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't live up to its reviews","review":"I agree with the writer from Chicago. The first part was interesting, but the mystique was lost when Mr. Golden became grapic in his descriptions. I too felt as if I were in a pornographic harliquin romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like two books in one - one exquisite, one conventional","review":"The first two-thirds of the book is mesmerizing. But the end of the book is so romance-novel conventional (and creepy - pedophilia is not romantic in any context), that I felt terribly used, as though I had been duped into reading a Harlequin romance disguising itself as literature. The ending also felt rushed, like the author realized his deadline was looming and had to finish the novel right away. There's no doubt that this book is very well researched, but that research might have been put to better use with a non-fiction account of geisha life."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are not words worthy to describe this masterpiece.","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is one of the best books that I have ever read, it is beautiful, very well written and realistic. It intrigued me so much, that I do not think I could put the book down once until I had finished it! This is not one of those books which you have to read 100 pages to \\"get into the story\\" - it throws you into the tale of a country girl, who is sent off to become a geisha. It is so convincing, that it was hard for me to believe that it is not an auto-biography, but fictional. The descriptions of details amazed me; the clothing, the tea houses, the clients, the other geishas, the environment, the places... it was as if I was there. I wanted more as soon as I had finished the book, I could not get enough of it. There are not words worthy to describe this masterpiece! A recommendation for anyone with an interest for culture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want it to end....","review":"I am not typically drawn to books about Japanese culture, but my friends convinced me to give this book a try. I found myself totally caught up in the characters and the story. My only criticism of this book is that a life-long relationship with a much older man (obviously a father figure) which begins as a child's crush is a little too far fetched. It's the only hint that the book was written by a man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical experience you can see, feel and almost touch","review":"You will become part of the scenery in this vivid book. You will feel like you are there as a guest in a teahouse. You become Sayuri's mind as she talks to you and as you feel life through her. A love story, a survivor's story and a magic carpet ride all in one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!","review":"I have never read a book that was as intriguing, informative, or well-written as Memoirs of a Geisha. I couldn't put the book down! At times it had me in tears (both from laughter and crying) as I related with Chiyo-san. The entire book kept me on a winding path where I had no idea what I'd come across next. The ending both pleased and upset me, but I wouldn't have changed a thing. I give this book an enormous 5-star rating! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!!!","review":"This was one of my first introductions to japanese culture, and it really helped answer a lot of questions I had about the cultural traditions in Japan. I really enjoyed this book a lot. In fact, it may be the best book I've read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha... Fact or Fiction?","review":"Is the same question I had to ask myself several times while reading this book. I didn't really know what to expect when I first bought this book, thinking it was a memoir on a non-fictional account. The book is just that good. This book flows like an artist. At the beginning you have the idea of the big picture. As you read more and more, the detials start filling in and before you know it the picture is done being painted and you are amazed that this simple novel came to be something much more beautiful than you ever thought.I really enjoyed this book and reccommend this book to everyone who wants to enjoy a good story. The countless detail and imagery that gets painted inside your head as you read is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into a Forbidden World","review":"I simply couldn't put it down! It has made me reevaluate my life and position in society -- am I, are we, as women, so different from the geisha just because their behaviors are more frowned upon, more illicit? Haven't we also groomed ourselves and educated ourselves so that we could excel in our careers (just as the geisha) or land the man (just as the geisha)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"This novel was a step out of my comfort zone, which is usually a mystery novel or crime thriller. So to read a novel like this, I was a little scared. I am so glad I did.I picked this up because the movie was getting ready to come out and I wanted to read the book first. I was very pleased with the way the characters and places come to life with every detail. As I was reading, I could play a sort of movie in my head, because everything you needed to see was written down. This is a one of a kind story and I don't think any other novel about this culture would compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER SUPER SUPER!!!!","review":"This book was superbly written. The author actually made you feel like you were right there in every scene. Beautiful job on the factual information on Japan. Anyone who doesn't know a lot about there culture will indeed learn more about it. Excellent read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really learned a lot about pre/post war Japan","review":"This book was great on history, and the story was rich and full of life...except for the third quarter. That was a bit sluggish. Golden really pulls it off as a Geisha!! Hmm... wonder if he's had experience..."},{"rating":"1","title":"nicely researched, but dreadfully dull","review":"Mr. Golden's meticulous research is commendable, but the story just didn't hold my interest. Guess I won't be reading any more NYT bestsellers as they seem to be over-rated. Back to the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and foreign","review":"He (Golden) is very convincing in putting himself in the shoes of a japanese Geisha.It is not a long difficult work to read,but has a simple plot with some of the most interesting character's you could ever put into one novel.Hatsumomo and Sayuri will intrigue you .You will be watching the characters fall into either obscurity or greatness.And the transformations that the characters make is amazing.You'll fall in love immediately with the novel's plot and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a novel!","review":"A well written book with all the fundamental elements of a novel that catch you deeply and bring you through the mysterious world of the geishe. At the end you will wish to be a geisha even if only for one day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pick it up until you're ready not to put it down!","review":"This book is amazing. I was a little skeptical going in, especially because it is written by an american man of all people. But I could not put it down! You are immediately sympathetic to Chiyo, a little girl who's mother is dying. She finds herself in the attention of a man who she believes will adopt her when her mother dies- but instead he convinces her father to sell her and her sister to an Okiya, where they are separated for the rest of their lives. From that point on, the book tells the story of how she becomes a geisha, and the heartbreak that she endures even when she attains the goals she set for herself. Very well written, with fabulous attention to detail and characters that really capture your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging","review":"As a Japanese woman in US, I have been asked about geisha forso many times. Everytime I try to explain geisha is not prostitute. Ihave read this book, and now heard that this will be a big motion picture by Spielberg, I feel so powerless. How could I convince people if what Sayuri and other geisha do in this story is just like those of prostitute? Yes, they went to school and learned many arts, but that just make these geisha looks like the prostitute with art degree. The author failed to show readers how these skilles and knowledge were utilized in their life. The author did a nice try to tackle with this sensitive subject, but PLEASE, fellow readers, read more books about Japan, look for other infomation in any means. Try some Japanese literature by Japanese author. This book is a real fiction, and you can't possibly see a true picture from only one fictional story.And this is not well-written even as a fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to move on...","review":"I'm a rare voice of disappointment: Geisha intrigued me early on - I'm fascinated by Japanese culture. But I became bored with it's stiff documentary feel - it felt as if it was compiled from a wealth of information, but without a heart. The characters did not come alive, the scenes did not shine for me. Many times I retried reading it and at last gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely lovely","review":"I often only read fantasy, but this book transported me to such another land that I could have swore I was still reading fantasy and not historical fiction! I loved the way the author vividly described Gion, Kyoto, the okiya and especially the kimono. It was a beautiful, but sad, world. The character of Chiyo/Sayuri was wonderfully developed. Definitely read it! A great look into a completely different world! I now really want to go to Japan ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"An amazing story that shows how life is full of great surprises. We just need to set a goal and take the steps and risks to reaching that goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"magical journey","review":"An easy read, but with unfortunate occasional typographical errors in the kindle version. Despite that technicality, this is a story that warms the heart and ignites the light of all the hopes we carry within. A must-read for all who wish to be reminded that adversity can be melted by the determination of our dreams. Simply enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written and Wonderfully read!","review":"Elaina Erika Davis reads the novel with fluidity and style. She has a clear concept of how characters should sound and captures each scene, each word with definition. Besides a very well written novel, Davis adds the spark a great audio book needs! I've only had the CDs for 2 weeks and have listened to it 4 times already! You catch little things you missed out on each time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"\\"Never thought the story of a Geisha's life would be so engrossing, but I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, they wear nice frocks . . .","review":"Now I know all about kimonos, a little about Kyoto, something about geishas, but that's all I have to show for reading this disappointing book. Period detail alone does not a good story make. The characters never came to life. If the author hadn't gone to an Ivy League school, would this book ever have made it into print?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING....","review":"I read this book for the sex and was disappointed. There was none. The story was o.k., but the details put me to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great book","review":"Everyone I know who has started reading this book has found that they just can't put it down. I wasn't going to bother reviewing it (because it has all been said before), but if nothing else let me echo the other 1500+ reviews: THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, passionate, unforgettable","review":"I just finished this book and I have to release some of the emotions it has inspired!! What an incredible perspective on life and where we all fit into the big picture, and a thrilling insight into the Geisha lifestyle. What struck me most about \\"Geisha\\" is that it was written by a man; Golden captures this woman's soul and mind deftly. In a way, I am sad the book is over!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read and discussion book","review":"I am amazed at how fast I sympathized with and wanted to know about Sayuri, the heroine. Normally a book takes pages to build identifictation with the hero, but not here. This is all the more amamzing considering that she is a young girl (I am a 30 something man) and from a culture I know little about. This early interest in her life is not disappointed as the book continues. In fact 20 pages from the end, I am still curious. Well written and a fast read and well worth discussing with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats wrong with fairy tales anyway?","review":"The life and times of a little girl who would become a celebrated geisha in post WW11 Japan. A fairy tale of a read; complete with the required cast of characters, a life full of challenges and the girl gets her guy kind of happy ending. Sap that I am I enjoyed every minute spent between this book's covers. The author paints beautifully detailed pictures of an almost secret society with his words, the characters are so fully described their motivations are easily understood and it has to end somehow so why not happy! The fact that Mr. Golden seems to be in such easy communication with his feminine side both startles and intrigues me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Captivating Read!","review":"From page one, I felt like if I looked beside me I would see Sayuri standing there. Mr. Golden writes in such a way that you immediately feel a part of the story. This book was captivating from its beginning until its end. I even found my self making comments out loud in an empty house and I shouted my rage, hurt, surprise and other emotions along with Sayuri.Memoirs of a Geisha is one of my all time favorite books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT cinderella in a kimono","review":"Do not listen to anyone who says that this book is Cinderella in a kimono. There are actually few paralells in the two stories, and this one doesn't exactly have the happiest of endings.Yeah, so anyway, Memoirs is written with an amazingly colorful language-the descriptions are absolutely mouth-watering. The characters are very distinct and real; they make you feel like you're living in the book. The book almost reads like a fantasy novel because the culture is so vibrant, so different.Personally, I was hooked from the beginning. But I have heard from others that the book takes a bit to get going. Mind that the book is pretty long, but it is quite worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely captivating, controversy aside","review":"Whether or not Golden's novel is fully based on the facts of one Geisha's life is of little consequence once you get swept up in the unfolding story of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\". Iwasaki's claim that the novel is a distortion of her life story did little to diminish my attention span as I read this book. I simply could not put it down. In fact, I used the People magazine article about her as a bookmark.Anyway, I thought this novel would be all about feet-binding and sex, but it's actually very tastefully written and focuses more on the intense competitiveness between Geisha than on their sexual lives--competition for security in the form of a wealthy danna, or sponsor. This novel was much better than I'd expected. I think the author did a great job considering he was writing in a woman's voice and dealing with such a mysterious and private world."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"exotic, mysterious, erotic Oriental\\"[junk].","review":"If you want a good example of the depravity of the current \\"Oriental\\" (Orientals are rugs, not people as R. Lee has said) craze, this is the book. A good example of how things Japanese (and other Asian cultures too) are romanticized and fetishized. I dare you to go to Japan and ask (or even ask some Japanese Americans) whether this picture is relevant in any way to their lives. Don't mistake this book for reality in any way. Don't believe that this gives you a true picture of Japanese culture. This is literally a white man's fiction, no matter how beautifully written. Just keep this in mind even if you do read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite simply, overrated","review":"I tried to read this book for my book club, but gave up about midway through. I wish I could see in this book what most others seem to see. Something was missing. To me, it was only too evident that it was a male author trying to write from the perspective of a woman--clearly fascinated by all the little trappings of femininity, but somehow missing the heart and soul of a woman. (And for the record, there are some men who write successfully from other points of view--that's not the issue.) He also clung to the historical details at the expense of creating a memorable protagonist.I thought I was just being my usual curmudgeonly self, but my husband recently read this book and felt the same. So disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuch, what a waste of time.","review":"The novel starts out as an enjoyable read, and it was very interesting--I couldn't put it down. Until I got about two-thirds of the way through, at which point it seemed to be penned by Danielle Steele. from the point when the war ended, and American troops went through Japan, smiling and giving out candy, the people realized the Americans weren't the bad people they were made out to be,(to paraphrase book). Ugh, I don't think people are so stupid that they can be won over by chocolate! From there, it turns into a Danielle Steele novel, pur formula, in which love conquers all and a penthouse in New York helps, too. It will make a great movie, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR CONDITION - sold as good.","review":"Cover was torn, writing inside book, dog-eared pages, cheap edition - book was NOT in good condition - too much $ for the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for what I wanted","review":"I knew what I wanted, and I am glad I found it for a price I could afford! Great Condition. However, the book had the golden \\"now a great movie\\" sticker on it, it would have been nice if the picture showed it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of a Geisha","review":"Wow, while reading memoirs of a Geisha, I can really appreciate the grace and beauty and skill and patience it takes to become a Geisha....poor Sayuri all those years of being a maid! and all that trouble from Hatsumomo.....I have a new respect for these women because during the time the novel takes place...women did'nt have a lot of choices....I am almost finished with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you nothing or very little about Japanese culture...","review":"or the geisha, this is a book you must read! Sayuri's story is one that is tender and bittersweet. I have never learned so much about one person's plight and hardship as well as glory and sucess in such a historic and entertaining way. Arthur Golden's insight to the woman's mind is unbelieveably profound! Read this book! I couldn't put it down and neither will you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very engrossing read!","review":"I had the same reaction reading this book as when I read Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\" -- you mean a MAN wrote this?? Mr. Golden has shown incredible insight and sensitivity in writing about a lifestyle that on the surface seems all about socializing, but in reality can be grueling, extremely demanding, and cruel. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have got to read this one!","review":"This is a book I just could not put down. It's one of those books that makes you forget where you are while you're reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully good.","review":"This book was wonderfull. I would read it again and recommend to others. It tells the story of a young girl who experiences hardship and is forced into living in a house where Geisha's are trained. She becomes a woman, finds love and becomes a well known Geisha. It is beautifully written and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"a keyhole into another world","review":"It was a whole new world opening up, a pretty wierd world at that, and not an appealing one, but very authentic. I felt she was really talking; it doesn't read like a novel, yet it does have a good plot. However, I only give it four stars for I felt the plot fell apart at the end. A good story should balance out at the end, and as a reader i like the people to get their just deserts in a book, since in real life they don't - at least, not as far as we can see. in this case everything was lopsided at the end, smugness and deceit getting rewarded, those who were truly good just vanishing without a second thought. I don't want to give anything away so I won't go into the details!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible story","review":"Having done a lot of research on modern Japanese literature, I have long been perplexed about what a geisha really is. This book is not only beautifully written and thought-provoking, but it offers a viewpoint of Japanese culture rarely seen in Japanese literature. Sayuri's life story was one of the most riveting and amazing tales I have ever encountered and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys novels and Asian culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. I couldnt put it down. It makes you want to find all the books on the Geisha that you can find. A fascinating experience into the geisha culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"Seeing this book week after week on the best sellers' lists I thought it would be worth a good read. Well, it started off fine enough but I was bored by the end. Her character never rang true to life for me. She gave the same bad treatment back to people that she had received from some. The ending was trite. I think Mr. Golden didn't know how to end this story so he just wrapped up loose ends. My bookclub read this book this month. Glad I wasn't the one that recommended it. This could have been a truly grand novel. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Metaphor Factory must have run double shifts to keep up","review":"with Golden's demand for Metaphors with Extra Velveeta. Memoirs does not have one redeeming quality. Cartoonish characters; trite plot, tedious dialogue; contrived ending. It took Golden over 400 insufferable pages just to say that Cinderella-san lived happily ever after. I feel like a reader adrfit in a salty sea of really bad writing. (Mr. Golden, PLEASE don't use my metaphor in your next book!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a mystery","review":"I think this story might have worked if it had been written in the third person. It takes a much better author than Golden to pull something like this off. In third person there would have been some opportunity (and real challenge) to draw the narrator in more detail, but as it is she comes off as papermache. There is never a deep emotion from her, everything happens on the surface. Of course a male author can write a female character well -- but not in this case. Golden took the convenient way out, and the result is stereotype that is (at worst) offensive and (at best) boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs Of Heartbreak And Triumph","review":"I had previously had an awe and wonder about the lifestyles of the \\"Geisha\\" world and by reading Memoirs of a Geisha, it really put alot of things into perspective. I know that the author had done alot of research before expressing himself as well as the lives of his fictional characters into a wonderful story that I would recommend to anyone. I have actually lost my copy of this book from lending it to friends and co-workers. I really don't mind, because this story needs to be read! This is a very detailed and beautiful story that was a pleasure for me to share with others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I saw this book a lot in the store and always thought \\"It's just too hyped up and I'll get bored...\\" but I was so wrong. This book is absolutely LOVELY, and well written.It transformed me into a different world and a different time. The emotions are very real. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to find out what the life of a geisha really was, and what it really meant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great view of a world I knew little of - compelling story.","review":"One of the favorites of my book club. Don't see the movie before reading the book. Add this to your must read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, entertaining & a fun story","review":"Enjoyed this book a lot. It kept my attention throughout and was highly entertaining. The end is a bit cliche and forced...almost as if he didn't know how to end it....but I fell for it anyway. I loved the character. This is a good book for vacations and lazy rainy afternoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Totally enthrawling. I was lost in the vivid descriptions of places, things, and emotions. The story takes an epic trip thru the life of a girl stripped from her family, and the enlightenment that follws. Golden has a style similar to Hemmingway, only more poetic. I was sorry it ended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs Of a Geisha","review":"The book was great! It was one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. It was one of those books that you can't put down and just have to read and see what's going to happen next. I think the author did a great job describing where the main character was, so you felt like you were there too. It's stories about Japan's struggle during the war were incredible and seemed quite real. It was a great mixture of fact and fiction. It was as though you were seeing all the struggling and triumph with your own eyes. I would say that this book is a must have and if you don't have it all ready you should run out and buy it. The book is an instant classic. I really injoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling!","review":"I seem to have stopped reading books that are just relaxing reads for some reason. I can't tell you that I just loved the book, but I was compelled by it, which is actually a higher compliment. When I put it down, I felt exhausted, so I know I was intent and processing much of the information the author put forth. It was a book that educated me and engaged me at the same time. Parts of it horrified me! For example, I can't imagine sleeping with my neck supported by a wooden rest so that my newly waxed and styled hair would not be crushed.I recommend this book. It's not an easy read, and in this case, that's what makes it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Involving story, disappointing end","review":"This is a wonderfully engaging novel, despite the fact that the ending falls a little flat. By the time World War II ends in the novel, the author has so drawn you into the world and life of the protagonist that you expect more from the rest of the story, but what follows seems to be half-hearted compared to the rest of the novel. Not that the end ruins the novel, it just seems to lose steam after a certain point, and the end seems contrived after so many struggles and hardships. This book is definitely worthwhile because it offers a unique glimpse into a world that is so exotic, foreign and archiac to most of us. Part of me still can't believe it was written by a western man instead of the geisha described in the beginning. His insights into the world of the geisha in Kyoto and involving prose make it a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned","review":"Was this item a knockoff or a second? No sewen in tag or label, no fiber content label. The name cuddleduds was stamped on the inside at the back in black ink. The next 2 or 3 lines were smeared and not readable.

Now, I do have a couple of others from another manufacturer which are extremely sexy (at least to the women I've met) but I wouldn't recommend swimming in them.Now, Speedo with their 1\\" bikini (Solar) style is perfect. It fits, looks good, stays on in the water, and I get compliments on my tan line. The gold shows the outline of all that is man so I don't wear it around kids. But the dark ones are perfect for the public pools and beaches so I usually get those. I am planning to buy a white one for the tan I'll get later this year. :)Speedo is my favorite. I order one size smaller because it stretches after a few wears but seems to stop at the right size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedo Rocks!","review":"I have been wearing the solar speedo for years. It fits perfectly with the center and rear seam. As a fitness trainer, I have my corporate logo put on them as well. Having a built body, with a suit designed for a man who should be wearing a speedo only helps to boost my business. I would recommend this Speedo to any man who wants comfort on the beach, or competitive swimming in a pool. The look is great, the look is confidence.

I chose this product because, in the picture, it appears to be a grayish navy color. When I pulled it out of the package on the day of its arrival it was an ugly bright blue. And i mean bright. it was also cheaply made of that horrible fake velvet and was incredibly itchy. As for the head piece, it was completely flat and i had to stuff it with tissues to get it to look the way i wanted.

In disbelief, the third day we woke up early and stared at the alarm clock as it breezed through the set alarm-time without making a sound, or registering that it had missed the alarm time.To add insult to injury, the clock misses alarms only when we set the alarm for intervals longer than an hour. A two-minute to one-hour alarm test works fine. When we set it for longer intervals, it won't ring. All indicators appear to be correct (bell sign if using the radio, z sign if using the buzzer, pm indicator where appropriate). It just doesn't ring.The radio works fine, the clock works fine, the night light works fine. But what's the point, if the alarm won't work? This item goes back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll just use my iPhone instead.","review":"Not wanting to drain my iPhone batteries when out of town and needing an alarm to wake me the next morning, I thought this travel alarm could be a handy alternative.Nope.Not sure what they were thinking when they designed this, but you can't use the radio and the alarm at the same time, which is the pits if you like to fall asleep listening to music. And worse, the alarm is not reliable. I've had several instances now where it doesn't go off at the appointed time. Yes, I checked to make sure I was setting AM instead of PM, but to no avail. It's not rocket science you know, and I have managed more complicated things (like raising teenage boys), yet this alludes me. I'm going to write it off as a manufacturing flaw, and not my inability to conquer a little box with an LED display.This is not Timex's finest hour.

However, when you go to bed at night you cannot have the radio on if you wish to set the alarm! It has one sliding switch which operates both the radio and alarm.

Easy to set, easy to tune, and works well. Can't have any complaints. Even with batteries it doesn't weight much.

Pulls in many stations, sharply, on AM and FM, and tuning doesn't backlash on you. Slips into a shirt pocket. The open-lid/reset-radio/snooze/LED light button is really clever. Very easy to set. This is a great rig for waking to news or music on travel. I notice some others had trouble. This one's OK. I'd say..give it a good testing right away when you get it. If it works you will be pleased going forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIght on Time","review":"The Timex Travel Alarm Clock works great. It's pretty small and compact but not too tiny where you can't see anything. The ringer is loud enough and the time is fairly easy to read. The only downside is it does not have an LED back light to light up the time. Instead when you push the light button it shoots a tiny light onto the screen. Kind of a trippy set up but it works fine. I recommend it if you just need a basic alarm clock to wake you up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm not loud enough and it does not last","review":"The radio signal is bad quality in my location.

The grammatical points are not thoroughly presented, that is, not quite enough for a serious beginner to have an panoramic view of Persian grammar. Second, it offers too little information on colloquial Persian. Third, too few reading passages. It has audio CDs, which is good, but most Persian textbooks out there in the market have audios too. So if you want to teach yourself, I'd suggest to try out different books, among them, I recommend Thackston or John Mace as basic reference; tackling Lambton if you are interested in classical stuff,if you'd like to learn more about different varieties of Persian, Baizoyev's Beginner's Tajiki is a quite good book, if you just want learn some Persian phrases to travel or impress your Iranian friends... forget what I just said, get lonely planet Persian phrasebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"half an order","review":"In an effort to learn the Persian language I ordered this course because it came with a CD to help with pronounciation of this difficult but beautiful language.
